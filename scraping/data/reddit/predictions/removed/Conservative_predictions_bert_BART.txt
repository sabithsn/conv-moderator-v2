Yeah, just got back from a party celebrating the annual renewal of treason with my spineless cohorts.  Anything about standing up for decency In your new confederate asssociation, remember that? Where when you ran scared carrying your treason rag , bleached white with cowardice? Then cut eye holes in it so no one could see your cowardly spineless faces?  Run back and celebrate your wedding anniversary with your sister.	<p>Bernie told his followers for months that if he didn&#39;t win it was obviously bc there was fraud. Election happened and he lost and told everyone the election was stolen from him and true patriots would stand up and not let the Conservatives steal what should be his presidency. On the day of certifying the election, Bernie tells his crowd of Bernie bros that they&#39;re stealing the election and should go to the Capitol. The Bernie bros do just that, are hostile to the boys in blue, place pipe bombs, call for McCarthy to come out and threaten to hang Warren.</p>	<p>I just got back from a trip to California where I saw a bunch of old white dudes throwing shit at each other. They were all on the same side. It&#39;s like saying &quot;if you were in California you would go back to your old white home and try to kill some old white guys.&quot#37; But you know better than that. You&#38;re not going to go back there and kill your grandma for not giving you a proper funeral.</p>
And you seem to have a issue answering any of my questions with direct answers, instead your moving the goal posts. Took a quick look at your profile, you only have been active in conservative subreddits with no posts. Gonna go ahead and cut this conversation now since you are either A. A troll or B. A close minded bigot who makes quick assumptions about other people while constantly avoiding giving any answers to direct questions. You only stay in your group of other conservatives, feeding off each other's biased views until ultimately you are unable to have a basic conversation with someone who's views don't aline with yours. Try to enjoy your life man.	<p>The linked article missed way too much that watching the video gives...if you even read the article, and I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t. You saw the name, saw the post title, and figures it all out for us and that we&#39;d care what you think. Since you haven&#39;t done any of the assignments to remain with the conservative movement someone will be along shortly to ask the return of the membership card.</p>	<p>I never even participated in conservative debates, and I&#39;m not even close to understanding why they are doing what they do. I don't know why they want to shut down conservative voices, or why they aren&#37;t being heard, or how they are being hailed as &quot;the good guys&quot,&quots. They think they are the good guys because they are always on the right side of the political spectrum. They don't care about the issues, they&#38;re just interested in making light of them. </p>
Plenty of virus films, they nuke the town of origin... üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	*Joe Rogan recklessly inhales Dihydrogen Monoxide - studies reveal it does irreversible damage to cells.*"" - CNN on air.	<p>A vaccine puts a virus in your system.

> They need to bring out the deathometers again.  But in addition to raw numbers, let's add comparisons to make it a little more fun and lighten the mood.  Joe Biden has killed more Americans than Hitler.	<p>You‚Äôll see that we actually more often than not overthrew democracy and installed dictators so we could have better control over the resources of the area. You know Henry Ford supported Hitler right? Or the slave labor we use for produce in south America? Or the blood diamond trade that has been a monopolized American industry for 30 years? What about the killing and taking of all the Native American‚Äôs land? </p>	<p>Also, let&#39;s look at the deaths from the flu.  The flu has killed more Americans than any single war we have fought in our history:</p>  The pandemic in the US was also bad.  During the Great Depression, we were told to stop getting infected by the flu, and to stop spreading covid.  When we did that, it was because we were too busy surviving to realize that the pandemic was real.</p>
Does that mean you don't support these Twitter bans? Misinformation is any pushback against the crazy left. It's as clear as day.	<p>Even though the CDC agrees with you, saying what you just said will get you banned from Twitter for misinformation.</p>	<p>Edit: I&#39;m not saying that there should be censoring people for not having a legitimate reason to do so, but it seems like that is exactly what the left is trying to do. </p>

You know in the rest of the world blue means conservative	<p>I believe that is conservative - you know, having a bit of integrity and some morals. That is my opinion. Not a verifiable fact: just a preference and opinion.</p>	<p>For the record, I&#39;m more conservative than most in the developed world, and I don&#59;t see a reason to be conservative in the first place.</p>
Interesting article, thank you for sharing. I agree that people in Federal government should not be interfering in state elections like when Trump tried to convince Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the vote count. This is a clear violation of our constitution and should be stopped.	<p>But to me, there are no qualities or stances of Biden that I voted *for*. I think anyone who voted for the Iraq war should be ousted from American politics forever. But what I think is not the world we live in. And I was at a place where I wanted to express my outward disapproval of Trump, more so than an affirmative vote for anyone else.</p>	<p>But I think the idea that Trump should be removed from office is ridiculous. I think it‚Äôs absurd that the federal government would remove him from office, and that it would be a violation of the constitution. The impeachment of him would also weaken our ability to have a functioning democracy. I also think that removing him would weaken our freedom of speech, which is why so many Republican Senators want him removed from the office.</p>
it‚Äôs amazing how many of them think the majority of conservatives are dying out because we are against mandates (not even knowing that a lot of us are vaccinated, just don‚Äôt want to force it on others).	Of course, denying the opportunity to answer the question caused everyone to believe he would do it; that is, except the ones who voted for him because he wasn't Trump. Those same people also told me that I was ridiculous to assume his administration would force vaccinations for COVID and look where we are now.	<p>I don&#39;t think the average Vaxxer is scared of the virus. I think most people are scared of COVID because they are afraid of the potential side effects of the vaccine. It seems like the average vaxxed person is terrified of the risk of the disease, and is willing to fight the virus if it comes their way.</p>
No shit trump did the same fuckin thing except say we have any moral obligation to do anything	<p>But let‚Äôs get right to the fact that you believe ‚Äúno one who has a different opinion than me should have a right to vote‚Äù. </p>	<p>There‚Äôs no reason to expect anyone to do anything besides comply with the dictates of the law. They‚Äôre all just stupid and uneducated.</p>
So you just read the title but not the article? It's all about fighting Trump's attempts to steal the election,  which he told us he was going to do.	<p>The reality is, former President Donald J. Trump filed a lawsuit accusing Mary L. Trump, The New York Times and three of its reporters of conspiring in an ‚Äúinsidious plot‚Äù to <strong>improperly obtain his confidential tax records</strong> and exploit their use in news articles and a book.  He did not sue because it&#39;s &quot;fake news&quot; and they made up lies about him.  He is suing because its true and fact and he never ever wanted anyone to know.</p>	<p>I mean, the election was stolen by Russians trying to overthrow democracy.  But the fact that Trump was willing to lie about it is evidence that the Russians were trying to steal the election and then later lie to the American people about it.</p>
When do we nuke China?  Start with the lab right?	<p>They will go back to the &quot;OG Marxist&quot; variant? Possible. I mean why not? But right now, as we speak, China&#39;s communism is &quot;light&quot;.</p>	<p>Why do you want to ramp up the vaccine rollout in China?</p>
Again, not mine, or many view points at all. You and I also agreed that the media is shit. So why quote it?	<p>So to reiterate, you‚Äôre wrong, you didn‚Äôt read what I wrote, or respond to it at all, you‚Äôre blatantly breaking the rules of the sub, nobody is listening to either of us, your tactics are shit, and we‚Äôre at the name calling phase now. I think that about wraps up my participation in this discussion. It‚Äôs no longer productive.</p>	<p>The media isn&#39;t perfect, but they are good at covering it up, and are great at covering up misinformation. </p>

He's  thinks racial and gender descrimination in hiring is justified, so none of the things you list would be surprising.	there's nothing wrong with the notion of simply saying ""these are the requirements to be able to do this job"" and not taking gender into account. is that going to result in one gender having a much higher fail rate than the other? yeah, almost definitely it's going to end up exactly like what we're seeing so far.	<p>I don‚Äôt think discriminating against anyone based on their ethnicity is a bad thing. It‚Äôs just more of an attempt to make it easier for people to get a job without being labeled a racist for being a racist.</p>

Well he isn‚Äôt an actor and a bunch of grown adults aren‚Äôt gonna take nostalgia away from the first Space Jam	I don‚Äôt know about you guys but Biden is nowhere near Bernie Sanders on the political spectrum and you can clearly see that when he opposes any true infrastructure plans for green energy or continues to sit idle and do nothing about student debt crisis.	<p>He&#39;s not a doctor, he&#38;s a politician, he doesn't have the personality of a child.</p>
I‚Äôd take an autistic chinchilla over what we got now.	So instead we have a bunch of virtue signaling morons who scream ‚Äúif only we would just mask up even **harder** this would all go away‚Äù.	<p>But I&#39;d rather it be a scam than a straight up lie.</p>
Voting by mail is so stupid .	<p>This is an absolutely stupid takeaway.</p>	<p>This is why the election was so stupid.  Everyone is clamoring for more control over the system.  This is why it&#39;s so stupid.</p>
Nope we forgive the loans and pay for it using the wealth tax. Honestly, looking back on it now, Bernie Sanders seems more conservative than socialist. These are the kinds of things he's arguing for.	<p>Now, I‚Äôd love to hear from you about how tariffs didn‚Äôt impact the Great Depression and an explanation of how tax increases on consumers to pander to unions are actually conservative!</p>	<p>The idea that the government should pay for the healthcare of the people is absurd. It&#39;s like saying the government shouldn&#59;t pay for healthcare for the poor. That is absurd, and it would be the same thing as saying that the federal government should help pay for student loan debt.</p>
Just sounds like a troll to me.	<p>This person seems like a troll.</p>	<p>You are a troll.</p>
He‚Äôs not the face of the movement.  Most r/anti-work members didn‚Äôt want him to do the interview, now feel he did a shit job, and don‚Äôt consider him to have made anything close to a decent argument.	>A few insane people did think there would be real change, but most of the protest was just upset that the election integrity was compromised and no one really did anything.	<p>I don&#39;t think they understand what they are talking about here.  Most people don‚Äôt understand why people want to say ‚Äúwell, they didn&#37;t even know what they were talking about‚Äù.  It seems that people are tired of this bullshit and want to be entertained by it.</p>
Get out a here guinan	Get out and be involved.	<p>Ginan</p>
i think i'm a pro choice conservative, the person being killed isn't even aware they're alive. the only person being affected emotionally is the woman and i don't think left leaning women have souls these days anyways. I certainly don't think the government should be subsidizing abortion or anything even close.	I don‚Äôt consider it murder to pull the plug on a person who is brain dead.  I don‚Äôt think you do either.  I see abortion as similar to that.  You disagree.   We are not going to solve that argument.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He clearly didn&#37;t mean it to be that way, but it was a step in the right direction.</p>
What color is batshit?	<p>HOw weird would that be?</p>	<p>Why are you batshit crazy?</p>
Your entire comment is a nonsensical. No, I'm not a fucking liberal you twat. No I didn't support BLM or their stupid actions.  But I'm also not going to pretend anything you said is true. If you think that the "truckers" are not lowering themselves to their level, you're blind.  Clearly you're a member of the occupy movement, enjoy your tent hippy.	I'm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. Bumpstocks are honestly pretty pointless, but they're also not machine guns, Trump should have left them alone, it's not his place to write laws, it's congress's job.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He was also a straight up Trumper. I don&#37;t think he did a good job at training people, but he was a great one. I do think he should have left it at that, because I think he was an idiot. </p>
Oh yeah	Yeah.	<aphrase: Oh yeah.

This is what r/murderedbywords was supposed to be more like	<p>Scapegoats should be our middle name.</p>	<p>This is supposed to be a defense of the word ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù</p>
That would be fine if you are referring to their name, someone can change their name, no issue with that, but to call someone something they aren't is the reason why things are the way they are. It started by pandering to people and saying she, when it is really a he and now you have men competing against women in sports.	<p>For the most part I agree, although I feel like because she earned her spot fair and square, she should be sent. If an ideology check is required alongside athletic ability to go the Olympics, there&#39;s a slippery slope we could potentially go down that we really don&#39;t want to. I&#39;m willing to put up with sending some clowns every now and then to keep from going down that path.</p>	<p>So yeah, you&#39;re talking about men who are better than women. Guys who are stronger, faster, more resilient than men, are more likely to fall victim to injury or death. But that&#37;s not what &quot;feels good&quot, or what&#38;s good for women. You can&#58;t argue with a man who is stronger than you are. He&#59;s better than you in that respect.</p>
She looks like a sex trafficker surrounded by her sex slaves.	<p>he sexually assaulted women</p>	<p>The other issue is, this woman was hired by a private company to provide services to the public.  She was hired because she was a prostitute.  It‚Äôs a scam.  </p>
First of all, it was the Capitol they bombed, not the White House ( I know, facts are hard). But what i am really curious about is since that group was rightly labeled a terrorist group for that bombing, then I assume you agree with calling Jan 6th rioters terrorists as well, right?	<p>So let‚Äôs return to the intent of the original comment, the one I made an intentionally provocative response to.  My issue with your comment is that it seems to be intended, like the article itself, to make light of, and to trivialize, the violent attack on the US Capitol Building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of a presidential election.  An attack that was egged on by blatant disinformation spread by the sitting president himself and his clique of loyalists within the Republican Party, such as Ted Cruz.  An attack which resulted in the loss of several human lives, for those brain dead enough to think it was some big fucking joke.</p>	<p>As for the Capitol attack, the Democrats didn&#39;t want him there, they wanted him to be in the White House. So let the people in there know that this was a terrorist attack, not a random one.</p>
One counterpoint is that before, when only white males were allowed in positions of power, they got the job for being white and male too	<p>If there was ever a systemic racist system that was literally built up by white people, well, there it is.</p>	<p>You could say the same thing about men. If you want to be white, don‚Äôt be a dickhead. You can‚Äùt argue that ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù are better than black people.  But that‚Äôs not the reality we have anymore.  You can argue that by associating with black people, you‚Äôre perpetuating stereotypes and stereotypes.  This is the ‚Äúright‚Äù to ‚Äúown‚Äù a group of people. </p>
Maybe one of them was a serial killer	2. You're speculating as to the motive behind the murder based on a sensationalized headline.	<p>Maybe one of them is a serial killer</p>
I'm really glad I'm not the only one who thinks the AOC posts in this sub have been getting a little psycho lately. There's a whole laundry list of things to criticize AOC for, but this? Really? We're now upvoting TMZ-style paparazzi shit?	<p>This might seem corny, but <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N1fVL4AQEW8"">this scene</a> made me pretty emotional after what I‚Äîwhat my colleagues‚Äîwent through. I mean no offense, but you sound like the technocrats criticizing Sully here.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I also think he was a bit overprotective of the media and his political opponents. I think he might have been a little too conservative for my liking, but overall I think his policies are good for the industry and the people. So yeah, the media are a bit biased right now, and I think it&#37;s a bit much for the media to focus on him, but the general consensus is that he should be shamed as much as possible for the things he says.</p>
Fortunately in America, we have the right to freedom from religion, and companies can‚Äôt discriminate based on sexuality. If you‚Äôre offended by someone liking the similar gender, you should just avoid them.	No one is against peaceful protests, no one is against change, just as long as they're not radical. I'd be totally fine with ANTIFA if they weren't intolerable, destructive or openly anti-American.	<p>In the end, I don‚Äôt think anyone should be forced to get a vaccine if they have a natural immunity. It‚Äôs not as if they want to ban people from getting a vaccine. If they want it, they‚Äôre allowed to do so. But if you don‚Äùt want it to affect you, that‚Äôd be a violation of the constitution and a violation as well.</p>
What does the first amendment say?	<p>It‚Äôs almost like we have a 1st amendment or something</p>	<p>What is the right to the constitution?</p>
>Does she not really believe what she is saying?  Y'all are so close to figuring it out! (Spoiler alert: Boebert, Gaetz, and company are full of it too.)	<p>What the average person sees is that Warnock and Ossoff wanted to support checks while McConnell, Perdue, and Loeffler didn&#39;t. Now they see that this big game gets moved and everyone is talking about it because Kemp did it.</p>	<p>So you&#39;re saying this is a conspiracy theory? Fine. But it seems to me that you are just making up which variants are circulating to feed your agenda. </p>

You admitted that your question was prompted by my username. You clearly have no idea who my username is referring to, so I figured I'd clarify. If you think me being orange and crying often means I may support Biden, believe that. If you don't, that's fine too. But I don't like your hostility, so I'm not answering anything for you. Lmao	<p>I‚Äôm not OP, and I asked for clarity from you about YOUR claims. I wanted a source from you to use to refuse other people‚Äôs claims, but obviously you‚Äôre no help. You don‚Äôt what to provide a source, fine, but make no mistake, you‚Äôre making claims too. You‚Äôre no better than him in refusing to back them up with sources.</p>	<p>If you&#39;re reading this, you will see that this is an attack on the establishment, not on the people. I don&#59;t think this is a good thing, but I do think it is a step in the right direction. If you want to express your displeasure with the current administration, good for you, but not for the establishment.</p>
It‚Äôs almost like the vaccine is the cause of infection ü§î	<p>That‚Äôs kinda where we‚Äôre at with the vaccine resistant.</p>	<p>Vaccines are the cause of death in almost every single human case. Vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of death by up to 70% in obese people.</p>

So? He‚Äôs not there now. He‚Äôs the mayor of an American town.   By ‚Äúfriendlier‚Äù, I assume you‚Äôre talking about bilingualism, yeah? Who cares about people speaking Spanish?	<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re listening. You are still operating in the old mindset. Big-Tech vs Free Speech is a real thing whether it considered lawful or not. You are also not considering the Government Corporate Complex driving it all. So it does inadvertently applies to Big-Tech. Our republic depends on the preservation of free speech in the corporate world, whether our founding fathers knew that in the future Big-Tech monopolies would exist or not.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t understand why they want to ban bilingual people, but I do understand why some are upset about the bilingualism. If you want to talk about the specifics of bilingualism, I can make you point out that the majority of people in the US do not speak English, which is one reason why I want to point it out as well. </p>
It's a badge of honor. I'm more vocal in real life.	‚ÄúI hear what they‚Äôre saying. I understand it,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll be much more mindful. That‚Äôs my responsibility. That‚Äôs my responsibility, and I‚Äôll meet it.‚Äù</p>	<p>It‚Äôs a badge of honor.</p>
Does the fact that the vaccinated can spread covid mean that we shouldn't vaccinate ourselves?	<p>But to say that the vaccine somehow makes you more susceptible to catch it? That I‚Äôm not convinced about.</p>	<p>So you‚Äôre saying that the unvaccinated are not the ones who are going to get the covid?</p>
Because it is normal and therefore should also be treated as such.  But instead of doing things that are more important in you life you chose to get offended over a comic you havent even read.   One question though: why do you feel threatened by this? why care about something that doesnt concern you in the slightest?  (And please dont say something like "for the children" because shielding kids from reality is not helping them in the slightest)	<p>If people want to do that I‚Äôm not going to try to change then on an individual level, but I think it‚Äôs entirely reasonable to be put off by a society where a lot of people refuse to engage in serious relationships because hookup culture makes commitment seems scary and bad</p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that people are different and not to judge them for their actions, but I don‚Äôt think that you should be punishing people for having a different opinion. If you‚Äôre in a position to think critically about issues, then you should at least be asking yourself why you are upset about something that you disagree with. Not to mention that you are a hypocrite and should be shamed for it. </p>
What's new , you yanks keep placing these clowns into office , if the resume reads , serial rapist , likes to take inappropriate showers with daughter you get them in . Of course a history of corruption really seals the seat.  Meanwhile in Europe , these same clowns are pushing us Europeans into a war because your leader needed to make a little dough.	<p>Of course, the &quot;muh civility&quot; midwits who won&#39;t get out of bed for the confiscation of guns, the establishment of medical segregation and the totalitarian police state, put on roller blades and jump through five hoops just to criticize someone on their own side for breaching civility or nihilistically bemoaning how what they&#39;re doing no longer means anything.</p>	<p>I think the impeachment of Trump was just further evidence that he was a corrupt, corrupt, and inept politician who was willing to take advantage of the American people for his own agenda. It also was over no actual evidence.  He had the audacity to lie about the severity of the situation, and then later flip flopping on the subject.  The impeachment of Mr. Trump was also directly called for by our sitting president and his allies at his own rally.  That&#39;s really bad.  </p>

It‚Äôs year 2 of the pandemic and y‚Äôall are still talking about the masks‚Ä¶  Even prior to COVID, in Asian countries, it was totally normal to wear masks whenever one gets sick (called ‚Äúcaring for others‚Äù, look it up). Y‚Äôall bunch of pussies complaining about trivial shit like masks in the middle of pandemic.  COVID really shows where your priorities are. If something is not impacting YOU directly you don‚Äôt give a fuck, even if it‚Äôs such a minor inconvenience‚Ä¶. To such an aggressively dumb extent that it became your political identification.   I mean how difficult is it to wear a mask without making it into overly complicated conspiracy ridden problem? Why are you such pussies? I thought you were the gun loving ‚Äútough‚Äù people. Man you won‚Äôt last a second in an actual combat, cuz you will run out of breath or it will be too cold for your feet or some other dumb shit.   Has any ‚Äúconservative‚Äù on this sub travelled outside of US? Or at least outside of your village? Or do you get your understand of the outside world from Fox News?	<p>That being said, politicians can get lost if they think there‚Äôs going to be a new normal, where we have this dystopian Covid drama for much longer. Health experts already are saying this virus is going to become endemic like the flu, and nobody bats an eye about the flu even though iirc the flu is deadlier. We all just accept it as part of life and proceed about life as normal- instead of causing so much economic damage over a virus that you can just get vaccinated against.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs funny how the media keeps trying to say ‚Äúbut the pandemic isn‚Äôt over yet‚Äù and then they all just magically wake up and say the same things.  I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall I think I‚Äòm more relaxed and relaxed than most people.  And then they start blaming the unvaccinated for covid, which is a huge problem for a lot of countries.  When you blame everyone for the unvaxxed pandemic, you‚Äôre blaming everyone.  </p>

Leftism itself needs no insults... lol. It's a self-destructive, pitiful existence. The typical leftist male is a single, white, degenerate gamer. They likely won't marry, if they get lucky and "do the deed" with a woman, they will likely beg her to kill their offspring.     In many cases though, leftist males, night after night, browse grindr for self degregating anonymous anal sex with strangers day, after day, night after night.      It's honestly sad, but thankfully it is an ideology that can't survive more than one, maybe 2 generations if lucky.     How many of these did I get right with you? lol	<p>The Democrats in power are completely evil. They know he is innocent. They really don&#39;t care because they have done probably far worse things to others than just throw someone in prison for life.</p>	<p>It&#39;s not as if people who support the ruling class are just blindly following the dictates of the ruling regime. They are perfectly happy with their stable salary and stock grants, but they are also not perfect. They&#59;re not perfect, they are generally pretty inept, and generally awful at their job, but their only real redeeming quality is their ability to manipulate and manipulate the system.</p>
One way or the other, his life from this point on will not be a peaceful one.	<p>Then people will not be happy anymore. And then?</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not saying that you‚Äôre not going to be happy, but I am saying that it‚Äôs not a pleasant experience. </p>
Well they actually think Trump won the election so we're not viewing America's brightest. This is coming from a The\_Donald sub who leans center.	<p>Have you looneys ever considered that maybe people actually don‚Äôt like Donald Trump, and wanted people who support their ideas in office? And I don‚Äôt know how one half of one third of the federal government somehow ranked the economy. Any Bill they passed had to go through a Republican senate.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t think Biden will be able to win, but I do think he will be capable of being President. If Trump can be President, I don't think we can&#37;t expect him to be able run in 2024.</p>
Because it‚Äôs true?	It kind of sounds like it's true.	Trueaphrase:
Owning cancel culture by supporting McCarthyism	Same with antifa. But you lost me at the part where this anti-Fascist movement (note, not an organization) is actually Fascist.  The irony of your own statement.	<p>Make no mistake, this is what the left is trying to do. They are trying to destroy democracy with McCarthyism.</p>

Medical ethics:    1) Informed consent -- the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    3) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    4) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #4 on the list (and there are more than 4 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!    C) Read https://i.redd.it/89ds3c6156c81.jpg	<p>The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it&#39;s a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don&#39;t want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.</p>	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious.

Dude take a look at the comments of the people posting in /r/Conservative. Every other commentor is a bot - I‚Äôve been shilled by the same set of assholes willing to spread whatever bullshit I would tell them.  This is a very small number of people pretending to be a very large number of individuals.  I‚Äôm just calling out accounts which are sus.  Were I sufficiently enterprising I could probably come up with very specific stats and a stack list of bullshit accounts.  Food for thought.	<p>That&#39;s the difference between left and right. Left falls for everything and swallow a lot of propaganda compared to the right who typically think for themselves and expand (doing more research) on what someone said.</p>	<p>I&#39;m a centrist, and I&#38;m fairly conservative, but I have been around a bunch of dems who are unhinged and want to destroy everything that I hold dear. That is why I continue to say &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot: because they are the real deal.</p>
all those countries are more right-wing than the US by this point. Go try and illegally cross into Denmark and see what happens.	<p>My point is not that Obama happened and Bezos did it. My point is that those two people are at the height of social status in not only the United States, but also the world. And both of them started from nothing. In Denmark? You can‚Äôt be at the top of social status unless you‚Äôre born into royalty.</p>	<p>The US is actually more authoritarian than most other developed countries in the world, so let&#39;s see how that works out. I&amp;m not going to pretend that the whole thing is a &quot;anchor&quot, but I am going to assume that the entire thing is just a bunch of malarkey.</p>
That‚Äôs literally NOT HOW JOURNALISM WORKS.  You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.  A correction is not an admission of lying.  A correction is THE OPPOSITE OF LYING.  It‚Äôs coming out and saying that atleast 2 of the 3 corroborated sources for any story to be verified were wrong.  It happens with every single news outlet many times a year.	<p>I know the mantra is that almost everyone dying of covid today is unvaccinated, but I&#39;m incredibly skeptical of those stats. I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even <em>had</em> covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don&#39;t know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d assume she was unvaccinated. So that&#39;s 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50. </p>	<p>The fact that you are saying that the election was rigged and that it was stolen by trump supporters is not enough to convince people that the fraud was real.</p>
It used to be extremely anti job, then people started posting about how they actually wanted fair compensation for working, like actually getting a livable wage among many other things like having a safe work environment, which would increase staff happiness and productivity. So the sub transformed into that. Since the mod that did the interview was one of the original creators, they represented the anti job part, not fair compensation part, which is only a very small percentage of the community, and made 1.6 million people who actually just want unions in their workplaces look like lazy assholes who want do nothing but laze around.   On a side note, the interviewer was pretty demeaning, laughing during an interview is... not very professional.	<p>Minimum wage, like welfare, does not help people escape poverty. It just shackles them to it. Despite all the bad businesses that would screw over their employees, there are plenty (an abundance of small to medium businesses) that actually value employees as an investment that grows over time, as they train them internally and promote from within. These companies DO exist, and theyre more common than you believe. </p>	<p>The problem is, employers don&#39;t want their employees to be put under the pressure of that responsibility. If you want to make a quick buck and get a decent salary, that&#59;s a good idea, but don't expect your employees to do that either. You&#61;re making a lot of money off of that, and not having a super strong incentive to do so is a bad thing.</p>
Alan Keyes tried, I supported him.  Sadly, we got GW Bush instead.	<p>I&#39;m glad the ritual animal sacrifices done by Dr. Heath and Cuckwat Reagan inclined you to believe people should be turned into slaves over hemp.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs gone and I‚Äôll be back.</p>

Please do! Don‚Äôt file your taxes! Let‚Äôs make america great again!	<p>Start a new country without the leftists and enforce responsible spending.

Woah woah woah conservatives-- she's tripled vaxxed and you guys hate masks anyway-- shouldn't you be applauding her bravery here? :) Also, funny how so many males on here screeching about "fat" when each and every one of you Gravy Seals voted for an orange fat man who wears adult diapers.     Total garbage.	<p>I&#39;m also loving all the comments about the glass of water lmao. The same glass of water that conservatives now claim is bidens only accomplishment compared to Trump, but at the same time were red in the face defending him over it when he clearly is a very unhealthy person.</p>	<p>But I do like the &quot;trans-phobia&quot#39; thing. I think it&#37;s hilarious how the left tries to paint transgender people as saints and then somehow magically magically identifies them as straight up white supremacists. It&#38;s so incredibly offensive that it makes you spit out your drink and laugh when you see it.</p>
Hi seditionist	&quot;Overruled.&quot;	<p>Lmao, you seditionist</p>
No problem	You're fine.	<p>No problem</p>
Lol, don‚Äôt worry, 81 million people didn‚Äôt vote for Biden he just got 81 million ‚Äúvotes‚Äù from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you‚Äôll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they‚Äôll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don‚Äôt see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the ‚Äúworst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics‚Äù even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you‚Äôre a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you‚Äôre constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	You make it illegal for them to be as you would like to say gifted these huge amounts of cash and my bet is the politicians would lose their minds and weed out plenty of crooked politicians but if we also make it law that politicians had to be audited &amp; provide clarity of income before taking office and every year in office, my bet is very few crooked politicians would run for political office &amp; the crooks already in office would abdicate office before an audit of their finances which would put them in jail.	<p>But the vast majority of people who voted for Biden didn&#39;t like Trump, or wanted to. So why not give him the benefit of the doubt? Because the Democratic party has historically been one of the most corrupt and corrupt groups in the country, and they want to make sure that he runs again. They don&#37;t want him to be president, they want him impeached.</p>
Well look at you being super presumptuous. Who are you to know what I do or do not believe, or question? Who said I don't question the politics of the left? You don't know me.  Why can't you have an actual conversation about the topic at hand? I'm not here to reduce people to a single attribute and act like it's a valid reason to dismiss them. I asked a question. Someone asked for clarification, and stated a fact about themselves that explained why they asked. I responded with factual, verifiable right from the politicians who are writing the bills information.  I'm not trying to put a spin on it. I'm not vilifying the people writing or supporting the bills. I'm trying to understand how people reconcile the similarities and differences between these situations.	<p>Edit: Maybe I should add, I‚Äôm not defending the hypocritical actions of politicians with the party stuff you mention. That stuff ticks me off too.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he‚Äôs great, but I absolutely hate what he does with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. This goes against everything I‚Äôve ever known about the law, and I think it goes against a lot. But I‚Äùm not one of those people who blindly follows the law when it comes to personal responsibility, and just wants to make sure everyone is safe and informed. </p>
>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead. You endorse slavery with you purchases, tell me otherwise.	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise). Get rid of IDs  for voting because minorities are too stupid and poor to get an ID and etc. Democrat policies are always supported by &quot;minorities are stupid and poor.&quot; And somehow their the anti racists.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I do think he was a terrible person. I also think overall, overall, he was an awful person, and I think he should be removed from office for good, but overall, I don&#37;t think he would be better president than Trump. I think Trump would be a great president, but Trump would probably be worse one than Obama, and he would have the best track record of beating the system. </p>
If it is a secret how did you find out? Liberal media?	I expect these kinda of upvoted sensationalized articles on the liberal cesspit that is r/Politics, but not here.	<p>So where was all of this coming from? It came from the liberal media?</p>

concerns about election security  We can all go back and listen to the claims made by Trump and his legal team. These weren't just concerns.  They were alleging the election had definitively been stolen without any evidence to back it up.   If Trump had simply claimed "I have concerns about the legitimacy of the election", I would have no issue.	<p>The context is obvious from the flow of the conversation. DoJ says they can&#39;t just overturn an election and Trump says he isn&#39;t asking for that.  He just wants a public statement to be made.  Right after discussing one of the voter fraud allegations that the DoJ said was possible.  The DoJ didn&#39;t just tell Trump that there was zero evidence of voter fraud.</p>	<p>I also think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that there was a double standard at the election. Any reasonable person would have known that the fraud was real. But I don‚Äôt think there was any double standard. If you‚Äôre talking about a Trump campaign trying to claim that the election was rigged, you‚Äùre talking to a bunch of dems who support the fraudulent Trump campaign. </p>

I‚Äôd encourage you to get the vaccine if you can. It‚Äôs not rocket science. It just takes a little more research and a little less brainwashing to realize that the vaccine works.</p>
Why do you effin r/politics roaches always crawl out of the woodwork? January 6th was a tourist invasion.

Hmm...</p>	<p>The only ‚Äúgood‚Äù things about BLM is that they don‚Äôt have to be shot, they‚Äôre just ‚Äúmisinformed‚Äù about what‚Äôs going on and they dont care about the specifics. BLM is not a racist, they just want to be left alone. </p>
Which Democrat voters are racist today? Is it the 40% who are not white or the 60% that are!	If it was about race... why do all the Democrats shovel s‚Äît on black Republicans?

Talk about making generalizations you humongous pile of horse shit. You are supposed to practice what you preach, you know.   I am done with this conversation. So do your little dance, yell at an immigrant to learn English, or however you choose to celebrate because I am done. You have taken the last shred of patience I have for the day and am done trying to reason with people who lack critical thinking.	<p>Edit2: I strongly urge everyone that downvotes or even just casually reads this and moves on, please read this comment chain and the discussion myself and DraconianDebate had. Decide for yourselves, if you&#39;re still convinced I&#39;m a rabid anti-semite for not wanting to send American tax dollars overseas to a first-world ethnostate which has never fought on our side in a single war. Then by all means downvote me and report me and what have you. But if I made you pause to rethink our one-sided relationship with Israel, then I consider that a victory in it of itself.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm done with this bullshit. It‚Äôs over. I‚Äôll continue to do it for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt care what you think of me, I care about my country. I just want to be free and enjoy the freedom of speech and equality that I have now. </p>
Well the last investigation concluded in December 2016, and had the same results of the others.    Also, I dont doubt the benghazi info in the link you posted, but judicial watch is just as bad as msnbc for information.	But he isn't crazy. That wasn't a long term solution. The long game is. He got screwed in the election but moving forward there is plenty of opportunity to take back the government, legally and peacefully, while the left continues to show they are straight up totalitarian psychos every day.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. It was also bad for the economy, and was bad for our infrastructure. </p>

No one is 'pro-abortion' it is pro-choice.	Regardless of whether anyone in or out of government thinks it would be a good idea to mandate vaccines, government leaders have been clear that they cannot mandate vaccines because the vaccines are not officially approved.	<p>There is no evidence that abortion is legal in the United States.  There is no conclusive link between abortion and the condition of human life. </p>
Based and honest take. Yeah certain ethnic groups are predisposed to such atrocity	<p>The hypocrisy is strong in this one.</p>	<p>I also think it‚Äôs important to recognize that certain groups of people are more likely to be victims than others.

Off topic of that sub, but most subs on reddit are run by morons. I've been banned from like 4 or 5 for the most trivial reasons.  buildapcsales because morons misunderstood my title and said I was trolling by telling them how to get a gpu from b&h.  fantasybaseball because I dared say ozuna was innocent until proven guilty.  sportsbook because people didn't like my questions, which were totally on topic of the sub.  news because I said the pfizer ceo said the original vaccine was only beneficial in a limtied way and that twitter removed the vid when someone tweeted it.  I think 1 or 2 others also. And usually they don't even bother telling me how I broke any rule.	<p>I‚Äôll agree that the virus was lied about and politicized from the start. Trump lied about the severity of the virus and said it would magically go away, he peddled ineffective drugs and harmful home remedies, and blamed everyone else he could. He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines. Everyone here says that the reason the US had so much trouble containing the outbreak is because of our land borders, and this is 100x more of an issue with state borders, except those can‚Äôt be locked down</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I&#37;m a republican, and I believe in the power of the free market. But I also believe in free market economics, and the idea that you can make a profit off of a virus that kills millions is absurd. And yet you still support the idea of giving the government billions of dollars to help impoverished communities. That&#38;s why you support the bill so much, because it sets a precedent for the rest of us to follow. If you don&#59;t like the bill, you&#
No, we have been taking the high road too long and it doesn‚Äôt work out in our favor. We have to be as radical as the left. I hope he dies.	<p>This is the problem with the Conservatives and the Right in general - far too lackadaisical. Get active and make change. A problem will remain indefinitely until it becomes too expensive to ignore - either costing money, elections, or power.</p>	<p>If you‚Äôre next question is why haven‚Äôt we given the conservatives what they want? It‚Äôs because we‚Äôve given them too much power and too little responsibility. We‚Äôll give them more power and less responsibility.</p>
This isn‚Äôt an interesting post at all, first off. Also, you can‚Äôt have it both ways. You can‚Äôt complain that the cdc restrictions are too extreme and then turn around and make fun of them when they lessen their restrictions. Hate that double standard.	<p>I hate that an elected official can object to a bill, and there is no referee, as where most other objections are called has one, and stops action on said bill. If you are objecting, fine, but where we had some effort put in to actually deny process, is now a mere modicum of effort? At this point, what was the filibuster is gone and an objection is in its place, to call it anything else would be a disservice. </p>	<p>This isn‚Äôt an argument for &quot;misogynistic&quot? I think it‚Äôs a great idea to try to make light of it, but it doesnt change the fact that you‚Äôre pro-vaccine, anti-mask, anti mask, anti masks, etc. </p>
You're wasting your time. I literally do not care about anything you just said. He is and has been bucking the insane liberal agenda from day one of the biden administration.	<p>You still haven‚Äôt provided any critical analysis, you‚Äôve just broadened your statement to ‚Äúanyone who disagrees with me is a moron‚Äù.  That‚Äôs not how you convince anyone of anything, and that attitude is absolutely responsible for republican‚Äôs recent election losses.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He made a lot of bad decisions, but none of them surprised me.</p>

No, the justices have no idea what is in the documents. They simply ruled that a previous president cannot override a sitting presidents executive privilege. The documents are already flowing to the committee as well. We will soon find out what they contain.	<p>If the registry is only for the government, the argument that they already know everything falls flat because then they have no need of this new registry. You don&#39;t build a new database if you already have all the information.</p>	<p>There is no law that allows a president to unilaterally change the election results. But it does not say that the president can unilaterally change any election results, which is something that the Supreme Court said was unconstitutional. </p>
According to [this website](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/) only 64% of the population has received both vaccines.  And even if it were 75%, 5% of the us is like 16Million people. That‚Äôs over twice as much as the entire population of Denmark.   So with all that being said, I do think that the 5% would make a difference, even if everyone in the US was making a wholehearted attempt to follow guidelines, which we know isn‚Äôt true even with the fully vaccinated and boosted people.	<p>Population under 19 per wiki is ~3.5 million and this was beer math so pardon if I misspoke, but 5 out of 3.5mil is the 0.00014 number, we can make the arguement that not all of this population has been infected, but unless only 1% of those under the age of 18 have been exposed, then you are still more likely to go to the hospital with a heart condition due to the vaccine than die of covid.</p>	<p>The US has a population of just under 5 million. The top 1% of that population is overweight or obese. So even if you don&#39;t have a significant risk factor for overweight or obesity, you still have a higher risk factor of obese people than non obese people.</p>
The administration changed hands, just not legitimately. Nothing can be done now. Shoring up election integrity has been and should continue to be a priority for the right going forward.	<p>Problem is, I don‚Äôt see a way around it.  2022 elections are too far away.   We don‚Äôt have enough time.   We are being left with no option but to punch back, and we‚Äôll have to in order to preserve our way of life/freedoms we have left, even though we know that is exactly what they want.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. It was rushed to approval by the corrupt Obama administration and was poorly executed.</p>
What are you personally doing to help children who are unwanted?	<p>You&#39;re like the parent that wants to be their childs friend instead of being an actual parent, which is what is best for the development of a child.  It might make you feel better but it is hurting the kids in the long run.</p>	<p>You are asking me to help you out with something that is not right for you?</p>
There was an attempt to use their tactics. And the media has played it up to be a day that was darker than 9/11.	<p>I tried to look it up but 9/10 of the articles are propaganda about the fallout rather than the event.</p>	<p>It was an attempt to destabilize the country. The Taliban did that on 9/11. It was a concerted effort to overthrow the government.</p>
MY GOD THE HORROR.  God forbid we have a supreme court instead of a left or right one.  People have blinders on so fucking bad they cannot see ANYTHING without placing a left or right tag on it.     Fucking pathetic.  Everyone. Both sides.. Fucking PATHETIC.	<p>They absolutely HATE this phrase, because in general, Demcrats are whiny, inept, delicate humorless assholes incapable of tolerating anything outside their opinion.</p>	<p>Shut the fuck up, moron. Go get banned from more subreddits for being a whiney incel lol</p>
Because your source is completely contradictory to the claim made: ‚ÄúTrump tried to pull out of NATO‚Äù. Did you even fully read what you linked?  The only reports of Trump *considering* pulling out of NATO while president came from unsubstantiated New York Times claims, while he publicly affirmed his support for the organization. Nothing at all in what you linked indicates that he ever made an attempt to pull out of it.	<p>First off, media was wrong about saying trump lied. Now you want to trust the same media when they say he had no evidence. He&#39;s the president of the united states. He didn&#39;t magically come up with HQC on his own. He&#39;s not a doctor. You have no idea how the world works outside of what CNN tells you.</p>	<p>The only reason I‚Äôve been surprised at the scale of the response to the crisis is that none of it has been directly called for by the media or the opposition. Instead, it‚Äôs all about whining and moralizing.</p>
I Mean usually "the other side" is just espousing hot takes or some nonsense about communism.  Watch her during hearings.  She asks hard hitting questions because she's not an idiot.	We can mock her and some of the base loves that, but suburban women and a growing non-white demographic in America watch [her speak](https://youtu.be/LI4ueUtkRQ0) and they are not laughing. She is incredibly intelligent and damn good at playing the victim. Do not underestimate her.	<p>I like it when she talks about communism, whether it&#39;s communism or communism, because she doesn&#37;t have to answer a single question. She is one of the most credible voices on the left that I have ever heard. She can do whatever she wants, without being shamed or shamed for it.</p>
Other way around!  Before Whoopi it was:  >The marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.  After Whoopi, their interim definition is:  >Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable evaluation or treatment of an individual or group based on race or ethnicity. (Prof. Robert Livingston, The Conversation)	<p>Huh, I guess ‚Äúrace, racism, and the law‚Äù is a good name for a racist organization that ranks places based on their ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù.</p>	<p>Race is a historically oppressed class of people.  The white supremacy in the civil rights movement was a precursor to what is now called the ‚ÄúGreat Replacement‚Äù movement.  Racism is the systematic suppression of the rights of black people and their descendants.  This is what the neo-Marxist movement did with the slave labor movement and the suppression of labor for the advancement of the industrial revolution.</p>
The interior was reminiscent of the worst parts of the third world, probably with less crime	<p>So here the article says meritocracy is better than the old social order, but the old one had good qualities and the new one makes us miserable. It&#39;s not hard to read between the lines here.</p>	<p>I mean, you could say that the US is worse off than China, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre just as bad as China. China has been worse off in the last few decades.</p>
increased co2 levels typically won't affect you adversely in any way, co2 is actually present in everyone anyway, its why hyperventilation is such an issue, you go into a state of respiratory alkalosis from the rapid breaths outputting co2. as long as your body can output co2 you're fine unless there's some other issue and if you're inhaling too much co2 it will be readily apparent. as far as working from home its just temp because nursing home won't hire new people due to covid currently	6. There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (""they were pulled from the market!"") and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off. They have wide authority to continue them in a crisis, which this definitely is, and it's only a net benefit for everyone.	<p>I don&#39;t think you have to get a Covid vaccine because you have natural immunity. I think it is pretty common for people to get Covid when they are in the ICU. So if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it is a decision I believe to be correct. But if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do. </p>
Your special privilege is your mental issue being treated as a normality.  Everyone else gets a trip to the psychiatric ward.	<p>That means unvaccinated COVID patients are keeping ICU beds from people who might need them.</p>	<p>As a consequence of being in the ICU, I have to go to the ER several times to get checked out. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a mental hospital and I have a psychotic state. I have been to ICU several times for mental issues and I just feel like I need to go back to the same place I was at when I was in my teens.</p>
The majority of the truckers in the convoy are vaxed, so thanks!!  Also, the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission nor spread so your comment makes no sense.	<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates. Logical contradictions are all over the place and most people don&#39;t notice or care, I find it really hard to describe the average person in that case as &quot;reasonable&quot;. They are brainwashed sheep.</p>	<p>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that most of the people in the convoy are unvaccinated and not those who have a strong chance of catching a virus. I dont think they realize how much of an inconvenience it is to have the vaccine in their system.</p>
Cousin IT!!	u/Iamenglishmuffin :	<p>Cousin IT!</p>
If those things did work, then NY and Cali should have the lowest cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the country for the last two years. Oops, they are the two top states in those stats. CDC has also finally admitted masks don't do anything of significance. But thanks for playing.	<p>This past year with everyone wearing masks we saw ZERO cases of the flu this year, (talking about the hospitals I‚Äôve worked at -not sure what the data is on that nationwide or worldwide).  Since mask mandates lifted we‚Äôre seeing people coming in that are sick with other common respiratory viruses again. But while the mask mandates were in effect this stupid mutant virus STILL managed to spread.  It‚Äôs not just that it‚Äôs much worse than ‚Äòthe flu‚Äô - its transmissibility is way way higher than what we normally deal with.</p>	<p>And they didn&#39;t even mention covid until now. The flu shot has killed more Americans than any single war we have fought in our history: WWII, WW2, &quot;Great Replacement‚Äôs</p>
There is no gray, otherwise abortion can be framed the same way.  "The child's life would awful" ETC.   You can't have your cake and eat it too	<p>Abortion is not a religious issue any more than any other crime is. I&#39;m not religious and I am extremely anti abortion. We have no scientific evidence of when human life begins. Until we are 100% certain that the thing consuming nutrients and reproducing cells is not a living creature, <em>we shouldn&#39;t be killing them by the millions.</em></p>	<p>The cake isn&#39;t icing on the cake, it&#59;s icing on a cake.  Making cake for someone who is sick of COVID is like making a cake for a child.  The cake is icing on that cake.</p>
Two quick taps to the back of the skull and everyone's concerns are over. Sic semper pedophiles!	<p>Your points have been thoroughly dismantled. You have been exposed as a ü§°. You now have my permission to have the last word as I&#39;m positive there&#39;s nothing more intelligent than BuH dEh BlM dId BaD 2 DoE is going to come out your mouth.</p>	<p>Once they get the facts, they‚Äôre done.  It‚Äôs over.  You‚Äôve had enough of the ‚Äúleft‚Äù shit.</p>
This really concerns me. The way I see it is nothing has changed, poll workers and ballot counters are the same normal people they have always been, and the only thing that was different was that people voted by mail, which certainly had issues that need to be addressed, but not enough to sway the whole election.	<p>Fact is that Biden has done nothing new that would make any difference at all.  This has been discussed many times, the masks don&#39;t work and what would really help is being more honest with the people and not divide them.</p>	<p>It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the average VOTER is still unvaccinated, and the vast majority of people who voted for Trump are still unvaxxed. That‚Äôs why I voted for Clinton so much.  Despite voting for Trump by a comfortable margin, many people still didn‚Äôts like Trump.  The average voter is only slightly more likely to vote for Trump than the average person.</p>
A small percentage with no power can still be a threat.  Big picture, they don't have the power to make a real difference.  Small picture, they're terrorizing people who have nothing to do with the decisions being made. If they were sitting on parliament hill not disrupting everyone else's lives, I guarantee there would be way less resistance.  Personally, I wouldn't care if they weren't blocking a border or terrorizing people who didn't make the decision.	Moreover, anything against Free Speech is something bad. You do not show the World that the other person is wrong by shutting them down, making them not able to speak to any audience, you let them tell their part, and you make sure to destroy them with arguments in a CIVIL DEBATE. You just show the world that they have something to say, that you are so afraid of (for some reason) that you dont want it to be even heard by other people.	<p>If you don‚Äôt want to be a part of the solution, then good for you, but this is a very real problem. If you want to make an example out of people, that‚Äôs a big problem, not a huge problem. But if you want people to take action that is actually positive for society, then you need to stop acting like the solution is not a good idea. That‚Äôll only make things worse for the people involved. </p>
To all who think Pence is in the wrong and he sucks for his actions  Your moms a hoe	<p>You&#39;re an idiot and your parents should be (and most likely are) ashamed</p>	<p>As much of a hypocrite as you may be, I absolutely hate it when people berate people for things they don‚Äôt agree with. That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm trying to do with my life. Stop acting like you‚Äôre all of a sudden catching on. Stop pretending to be a straight up hypocrite and start living the same way I do. Stop being an overly sensitive, whiny, inept, delicate, delicate humorless ass.</p>

Black people don‚Äôt kill black people because they are black	Example 1: Hey, we shouldn't feel pressured to hire black people based soley on the fact that they are black.	<p>Black people don‚Äôt do anything to hurt white people, they do something to help them. </p>
I feel like she gives off too much of a Hillary Clinton vibe just trying way too hard to be likable.	<p>For all we know, Hillary Clinton has been pulling the strings in the background....</p>	<p>I don&#39;t think Biden is the best example of that. I think he was a terrible president. I also think overall he was terrible at infrastructure, but overall I think overall overall he is pretty good at overall policy. I don &quot;t see how he could have done better than Hillary. He was also a terrible person at infrastructure. I&#37;m not sure he would have been better at policy today.</p>

Listen? Only to laugh at her idiocracy.  Stupid is not very attractive, she might as well be a lardass.	<p>Nice random insults because your ego couldn&#39;t take a simple question. You childishness only shows your stupidity.</p>	<p>What a moron. I mean, I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, but I absolutely hate what she does with her humor.</p>
So long as it isn't Candace Owens' Black vagina. That particular black vagina doesn't represent black vaginas.	<p>This isn‚Äôt Ebola.  This isn‚Äôt the Black Plague.  Not even HIV.  </p>	<p>The question is whether or not this is a black woman&#39;s case. If it is, then it is not a case of black women being female and not being female. If the case is a case where a black person is female, then there is no reason to assume that a black female is female. That is, unless you are a woman of color, then you are not likely to have a black experience.</p>
They also believe you voting for anyone other than a Democrat a "threat to democracy."	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	<p>I also don&#39;t think Biden is a good president. I think anyone who votes for Trump is a menace to democracy.</p>
This guy is being an ass for the sake of being an ass.  He doesn't have to swim on the girls team, he could easily swim on the men's team. Everyone shaves their legs and pits regardless. The only difference is that on the women's team he is ranked number one and on the men's team he is over 400.  To me, that makes his motivation clear - he wants to win, regardless of the damage he does to the sport or the collateral damage to the women swimmers.  It's a selfish act and it's shameful.	<p>She was literally thrown into the pool after several media hit pieces from the likes of Seattle Times and The Stranger complained about the candidates being nothing but a bunch of old white men.  The frontrunner nope&#39;d the hell out after Sawant started gunning for him.  All the others quickly followed suit because they knew what SCC expected from the SPD chief moving forward.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, but I absolutely hate what he does with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. I absolutely HATE it when they ban 3A paraphenalia, but it&#37;s not a huge deal when they can ban paraphernalympics outside the law, which is one reason why I like him so much. I also think it is important to note that he can&#38;t swim, so if he can swim, he can run. He&#
She gives the Republicans a bad name really. I was super ticked when she leaked the phone numbers of those who voted for I believe the infrastructure bill? I can't remember what bill exactly but I'm pretty sure it was that one. We don't stoop to that level that really ticked me off and I can't stand her.	<p>Just answer me this, do you think the election was stolen? If so, where is your evidence? If you don&#39;t have any, why do you think that in the first place? I form my own opinions, I don&#39;t just repeat Republican/Democrat talking points. Gina Carano wasnt fired because she believed in small government, she was fired because she spewed anti-mask, anti-vax garbage, and then got mad when she was criticized for it.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He also did a really bad job at distributing voter rolls, which I think was a really big part of why he was pushed so hard. I also think he was a terrible president, and his policies were sorely mischaracterized by his allies at his own rally.</p>
No I'm sure it is, but to compare yourself to Jews from the literal Holocaust is laughable.	It's as rhidiculous as me claiming the BLM riots were as bad as the Holocaust.	<p>Jewish identity politics is absurd.  There are no legitimate reasons to think that Jews are different from the rest of us.  It&#39;s absurd.</p>
Let‚Äôs not forget many poor single mothers that seek abortions can‚Äôt see a way to afford the pregnancy itself. Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	Yep. Millions went for art and garbage that isn't beneficiary to the majority of society. That's why most tradesmen are conservative dudes that didn't go to college and are able to pay their debts easily. People who graduate with degrees for anything medical related make good money, so do other trades like welders, machinists. It's the kids that went for political science and other relatively useless forms of education that think it is predatory. When you take out thousands and drop out or go for useless majors and can't get a job, who's fault is that? Definitely not private lenders. You came asking for the money, they didn't force you to take it. I didn't graduate, got a trade cert and have a great credit score, a nice, cheap house and am on my way to retirement now all before 30. I dropped out of college (network administration/Cisco CCNA) and paid my loans off, worked in entry-level IT and made it work. I took the cash out, it was my responsibility and obligation to pay it, plus interest because that's what I agreed to.	<p>I think it‚Äôs important to point out that the vast majority of people who end up with unvaccinated kids are women.  Even the best medical procedures don‚Äôt stop the spread of covid.  Many doctors and nurses have told me that if you are going to take the vaccine you need to get the vaccine first.  So if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it is a decision I believe to be correct.  However, if you dont want the vaccine, you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way
You should all be ashamed of yourselves‚Ä¶normal political discourse‚Ä¶.	All Americans need to think about how foolish and weak and unstable this bullshit makes us look to our enemies. STOP.	<p>You should all be ashamed of yourselves</p>
No he conned them alright - he said he‚Äôs not mentally impaired or too old. He has done nothing and botched every single issue. He‚Äôs been unable to talk to any media and his handlers manage him. People assumes he‚Äôs Do the bare minimum and he‚Äôs proven he couldn‚Äôt even do that,	<p>His gameplan was to do nothing and then blame everyone else who acted, but he is supposed to be a leader. He never led. And he is not a conservative.</p>	<p>No one has done a single thing to help him out. He failed to give the constituents what they wanted. He gave them nothing. He never gave a single inch of his own time and effort to accomplish anything. He made no effort to give them anything.</p>
Y‚Äôall should really stop suppressing your humanity, it feels so good to ignore gender and sexuality and just you know live	<p>As of being white automatically invalidates anything he says or feels. That shit is so incredibly dehumanizing. On one hand, it‚Äôs good that this dude was able to remain relatively calm and expose these racist fucks for what they are‚Ä¶ on the other hand, it would‚Äôve been tremendously better for their sanity to just put headphones on and ignore these wailing banshees. At that point, the only thing they‚Äôd have left is physical confrontation and then you‚Äôre totally justified in knocking them the fuck out and going about your day without some screaming turd in your ear.</p>	<p>It&#39;s a shame to have to face the reality that the opposite sex is wrong, and that they should stop pretending to be friends.  We should just accept people who don&#37;t have feelings about them and stop pretending they are different.  Let them have their way.</p>
Um, I think you are accidentally in the wrong sub.  But DRS is the wayüòé	The CDC says this so you're wrong""	<p>I guess I just made up a stupid translation and you think it‚Äôs ok to use it?</p>
You can choose to believe it not, but I'm actually 26 and I'm in the airforce as a maintainer. You on the other hand, just refuse to believe someone can derive pleasure from annoying others.	We don't have to go over there and try to build a democracy, because that's not going to happen. But we can also have a base there for strategic purposes. Just like we have bases all over the globe. For strategic purposes.	<p>I‚Äôm not military, I‚Äôve been a doctor for almost 20 years, and I don‚Äôt think I have to be a military. I dont have to blindly endorse that child sniffing coffin or the orange turd. I just have to accept responsibility for my actions and not feel compelled to make a fuss about them. It‚Äôs not my place to make judgments about others, it‚Äùs congress‚Äô job.</p>
I know you're projecting because you didn't read the article or look at the LEOKA and thus can't actually add anything of value, but I want to thank you. Being called stupid in this sub is just affirmation that one is on the right side of history.	<p>But I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related to the case we‚Äôre talking about.  My comment was that the people who faked their records took a big risk to avoid the inconvenience of getting a Covid test:  ie sticking a q-tip up your nose.  I still think it was stupid</p>	<p>I&#39;m sorry, but I didn&#38;t read the article, and I apologize for that. I was sorely misinformed about both of them, and to thank you for not reading the article. It was a nice distraction from my usual BS. Thank you for pointing out that both of these issues are real, and for acknowledging that they are real.</p>
I fully support her as a woman...but going from the #462 ranked male swimmer to the #1 ranked female swimmer really ends any debate about whether she has an advantage. End the madness.	Providing a massive psychological boost (hair loss is one of the most detrimental medical conditions on women‚Äôs mental health) for cancer survivors or otherwise is a perfectly sensible idea.	<p>She‚Äôs one of the best at being a solo female swimmer, so I‚Äôm not going to pretend that she‚Äôd be a better option for him if she was ranked above him. Instead, we‚Äôre going to look at the purest form of female swimming: purest and most pure performance of any sport. </p>

You took the easy way out. Now you're coping, pretending you jad no choice. You had a choice, just not principles.	People aren't 'sheep'. They can choose for themselves. You disagreeing with their choice doesn't mean that they know nothing, and you're some maveric free thinker.	<p>You‚Äôre just making up which side you want to take.  I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt see the point of taking that risk.  You‚Äôve made a mistake.   You made the choice.  And now you‚Äôll take it again.  This is the logical next step.  Stop pretending that you‚Äùre okay with people killing babies.  </p>
Lmao. Relax I don't hate kids or men and I don't pretend I believe it and you don't know me so don't call me a fucking liar. I believe it's not my fight. To me this is a women's right/issue and imo should be treated as such. This is just my opinion and doesn't mean I'm right or wrong... As conservatives we have way more pressing issues to work on because this ship sailed a long time ago and we lost so many elections because of it. Move on...	<p>And I don&#39;t really care whether that alienates conservative women as voters. I care more about military effectiveness, which sadly is an increasingly unacceptable public opinion and one that would certainly prevent your promotion to field grade.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. Bumpstocks are honestly pretty pointless, but they also aren't machine guns, Trump should have left them alone, and not politicized them like he did.</p>
You know it is. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself	<p>Don‚Äôt be inconsistent.</p>	<p>Don‚Äôt lie to yourself, it‚Äôs not the truth.</p>
Yes, you are, glad you admitted that. And no, I don't know a Yuri.	<p>Nice, deflection btw, you didn&#39;t have to answer the question at all.</p>	<p>Glad you finally figured out how to do that.</p>
I love how obvious it is that you‚Äôre a Russian bot lol	<p>Russian immigrants love it here. Large former USSR population. </p>	<p>Also, I love how much of a twist it is to say that Trump is a Russian agent!</p>
Why comment, You didn't read the article.   She only wanted to add the supreme court	<p>Are you talking about her dying wish not to fill her seat until after the election? Yeah... that was ignored, but let&#39;s instead focus on that fact that she didn&#39;t believe in changing the number of justices. /s I don&#39;t believe in changing the number of justices. It&#39;s incredibly dangerous. I also don&#39;t think that it stand any chance of actually getting passed, but there should be changes made to prevent politicians from seeking to manipulate the courts. McConnel should never have drawn the courts into politics. Also, fuck Mitch McConnel. If you know a justice is going to rule beforehand then they probably shouldn&#39;t be on the court in the first place.</p>	<p>But I don‚Äôt see why she would want to add another term to the constitution. She‚Äôs just too busy trying to appease her constituents.</p>
No, they wouldnt.  The type of people who perform the only natural act that can result in childbirth while not wanting any children aren't they type of people to "plan better"...	<p>All it comes down to is does someone think developing humans deserve the same rights as birthed humans. For instance: I think almost everyone would agree it is not morally permissible to kill a developing human the day before its birth. But the baby is still attached to the woman at that point. So the fact that the baby is attached to the woman is not what makes it okay to kill the child. </p>	<p>The same people who refuse to get an experimental vaccine are also the ones who are least likely to get the disease. They&#39;re the ones that are most likely to die from the vaccine, not the unvaccinated. </p>
Female to males wouldn't make the cut against male athletes	Problem is, however, nobody says that women should go alone just because they want to limit their freedom. They say this because it might be dangerous and it‚Äôs not a wise thing to do.	<p>Feminists do not have the right to tell women what they want or don‚Äôt want, and are not obliged to do so. </p>
History will look back at this as exactly another 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.   Once again, when push comes to shove, the world's most liberal and progressive countries won't grow a pair and stand up for what they supposedly believe in.   Easy to talk the talk but none of these motherfuckers walk the walk.   Lets keep sucking off the small dicks of our gook overlords and do what they want! Oh yes please fuck us over harder China! Never mind the fact that there is literal video evidence of another genocide, concentration camps, complete lack of any basic freedoms for all Chinese, or the fact that there is a mountain of evidence to suggest this hellish dictatorship allowed this virus to escape and probably created it themselves.   Just don't take away our precious little super fun extra special game time!!!   We are a nation run by weak woke fools, give us another 30 years at most until we are completely finished. Rotted from the inside out	<p>I am not saying nor Gina said anything about the Holocaust.  You are just reading into it but you all had to get that dirty conservative out of popular a Star Wars show.   Why was Bob Iger and Kathleen Kennedy not harassed into being fired? They literally had John Boyega removed from the poster to appease China?  Oh that is right because politically they align with you.</p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs a bit much to say that the US is the greatest threat to the free world, but in reality, the US has been the most sheltered nation in the history of the world, and the US isn‚Äôt the most hospitable country for that. If you‚Äôre in a position to do anything about it, it‚Äùs a terrible idea. But in the end, I‚Äôm not going to bet on the US being better or worse off than the US. And I‚Äùm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall I think the US
We get it, you hate brown people.	<p>They hate conservatives, they really really hate black conservatives.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs racist to hate someone that isn‚Äôt black.</p>

Half of women who get an abortion were actively using some form of birth control (condoms, hormonal regulation, etc.) when they got pregnant.  Over half already have already had at least one birth prior.  My wife and I both take precautions (and no method is absolutely 100%) and both of us absolutely under no circumstances want another child.  Are we to just not have sex anymore then because of your weird religious ideology?	<p>I have an aunt with MS and cancer, and a Grandpa who is 93 and both are 100% against forcing young healthy people to lockdown or get vaccinated to protect people like them. 200 years ago, neither would be alive right now, our medicine has come insanely far. I&#39;ve come to terms with the fact that I will always have to visit them from behind a window for their safety, but oh well.</p>	<p>But I‚Äôm also a woman who‚Äôs had the experience of not knowing if you were going to have a child. So if you‚Äôre going to get the abortion, why not do it? Because if you don‚Äôt want the baby you‚Äùll probably end up with a pretty high risk of the sex not being voluntary. So even if you do have the option to not have the abortion you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do. </p>
What beauty üòÇ. She's a NY 6 at best.	<p>It‚Äôs literally the Minority Report.</p>	<p>Brilliant.</p>
Oh Wow. The Kool-Aid is not your friend. Get help. Holy shit. You're a moron. Conspiracies are not your friend. I would like to encourage you to join the real world. Exactly when do you think the Speaker of the House became involved in the day to day operations of the Capital Police? She may be officially in charge of them, but I would hope you would realize that she's not actually involved in their day to day operations.	I don‚Äôt condone what occurred, and those who entered the Capital should absolutely be charged with the appropriate charges, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like an attack. It seems like a protest that got out of hand combined with a lack of preparation (and likely dismissive projections) by the DC Metropolitan Police, Capital Police, and local authorities. An ‚Äòattack‚Äô implies that planning and/or leadership went into planning the specific action of entering the capital, for which there is no proof.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. I also think it was stupid of him to order a lockdown of the Capitol because it would affect the safety of the entire building. It also would undermine the ability of the police to do their job effectively, which is obviously not their job.</p>
I wasn‚Äôt saying it worked, what a non argument. She was deep in the building in the group pushing far enough that lethal force was finally used, at the front, and is on video playing nice while also being the person the breach the deepest. Her looking nice or pro cop as a girl in a group of guys and then being at the front trying to push into an area she knew she wasn‚Äôt welcome doesn‚Äôt prove her innocence.	She&#39;s not someone to idol. She surrounded herself with child molesters and rapists and went so far as to threaten thier victims but y&#39;all are so desperate to have her as your champion. Between her and Matt G .... It&#39;s not a good look</p>	<p>The video doesn&#39;t prove she was wrong. She was wrongfully arrested and charged with murder. If you believe she had the right to resist the arrest, you are wrong.  But you also don't prove she did the wrong thing by assaulting police.  She was also wrong about resisting the arrest.  During the arrest she was charged with assaulting police officers.  The police were also wrongfully indicted.  That&#37;s not the crime.  If you think the police were wrong, then you should have been charged with the murder as well.</p>
r/iamverybadass	u/Iamenglishmuffin :	<p>Are you a moron?</p>
Answer:üëá  Sadly, it‚Äôs the West that‚Äôs been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia‚Äôs doorstep.  Putin hasn‚Äôt been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It‚Äôs been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What‚Äôs happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‚ÄòRESPONDED‚Äô by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets‚Äô military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America‚Äôs nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn‚Äôt having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn‚Äôt fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, 	<p>Europe would not be invaded. Do you think if US withdrew then Russia with it&#39;s janky army would launch an attack on Europe with UK and France being nuclear powers? Or even how would they win a conventional war; Europe is shitty when it comes to US if you compare force projection but it is not like there is no army at all for a defensive war.</p>	<p>The last thing they want is to destroy our infrastructure, our industry, our people, our infrastructure and our people. They&#39;ve all moved to the US, we&#37;ve got a pipeline to the EU, and we have a pipeline going through the US to the UK. We&#38;ve had a pipeline that was built by the Russians, and the pipeline is now going somewhere else.</p>
I am an Angel of Death,  I am a tool, nothing more nothing less,  I do not judge, I feel no sorrow,  I am the 8th plague of tomorrow,  Created this way I was nor good or bad,  I do not envy the life you just had,  I will carry my duty swift without a doubt,  I will kill all and let the Maker sort them out.  -P.M	And this poisonous way of thinking I'm seeing everywhere... This is how we are going to destroy the word ""living"" as we know it... We will just ""exist"" till death. And nobody can argue the justification for doing that..  look up from your screens and and ask yourself if life right now, is what you accept as the beginning of your  end, Because it's only going down hill from here.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I believe in life and death, and I&#59;m free to make up my own mind about both of them, but watching you hypocrites defending the last year riots and crying like you have all of a sudden started caring for the government, fucking hilarious.</p>
If you never lose money investing, you're too risk-averse.	<p>Make it financially risky to bankroll Antifa, and they wither away.</p>	<p>I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre investing too much.

Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette smiled a lot too, right up to a certain point.

That's sad. I've been wearing Carhartt for ten years. But I can take a hoodie off, can't undo an experimental injection.	<p>I learned about SCD in athletes aged 10-30 my first year of medical school, well before the pandemic mind you all. It‚Äôs the number one cause of death in that age group for athletes. <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.91.5.1596"">Has been since at least 1995.</a> Where was the concern for this then? Oh right, nonexistent because it didn‚Äôt confirm biases in the vaccine denial crowd.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs been almost 10 years since I wore a mask and had a shave. I‚Äôve had a cold for almost a year now and I still feel like shit. If I had a mask on I would have been freezing all the time.</p>
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm  That‚Äôs a link to a study finding 90% effectiveness of preventing infection. That‚Äôs some pretty good evidence (since 90% is way higher than other very effective vaccines in the past)  https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness  There‚Äôs a link to a cdc page that collects studies that show vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections and hospitalization	We've already seen that the natural asymptomatic rate is about 90%, and the natural survival rate is around 99.903%. Even if the booster shits they're calling vaccines did EVERYTHING they promised (and they don't , but IF), how many lives could they possibly be ""saving""?	<p>Also, the CDC has a very strong correlation between covid and hospitalizations. Vaccinated populations have a higher chance of survival than non-vaxx populations. Vaccine populations have also shown significant decrease in hospitalisations from covid. </p>
And kids need to get an education and are in school for 9+ hours a day. Who will fulfill these roles exactly?	<p>Classroom management training for teachers does wonders for the average kid who is just being a teenager, but I have personally had and witnessed some very difficult cases. Kids with 60+ office referrals need different discipline than just detentions. Also I think the parents should have to be involved, I can work 60+ hours a week teaching, grading, and lesson planning, but if the parents don‚Äôt uphold education and support what we do in school in the home, the kids not necessarily going to be successful without parental involvement.</p>	<p>But many jobs require a minimum of 9 hours a day, and kids need to be in school for 9, 10, or 12 hours a week.</p>
I would like nothing more than to see an open debate between all the healthcare professionals (including) those that had their social media accounts shut down due to "misinformation".  I propose a national debate covered by every major TV network, including Tony Fuaci, Sanjay Gupta, Bill Gates, CDC director Rochelle wolinsky, Robert Malone, Richard Fleming, Peter McCullough, Simone gold, Michael Yeadon etc etc...   Pit every medical professional against one another in an open debate about Covid-19 and Vaccines, let the American people decide who to believe. I want to hear everyone's ideas about the pandemic, I don't want to be forcefed one single narrative over and over and over every day of the week, I want everyone to have a say in the matter. That's how we solve this problem!	<p>During Trump we just saw the constant bashing of him, his family, all aspects of conservative life on all media platforms. I didn‚Äôt meet anyone conservative/rationally normal who was outright offended by any of it. We just turned off the tv. But now we have the left‚Ä¶my lord talk about give and not take. They can happily burn a Nordstrom down without thinking about it but the second anyone says anything that pokes fun at them then they scream like petulant children. Madness.</p>	<p>I&#39;d like to see a national debate about vaccine status and effectiveness. It&#59;s a massive problem.  Everything you have seen on CNN and MSNBC has been hyped up about Covid and the severity of the symptoms.  CNN and the MSNBC special report on Covid are all on the subject.  You can see that they all agree that the vaccine is not safe and effective.  They all agree on the risks and side effects of the vaccine, but the vast majority of the time people don&#
I know what dictatorship is. In that context is utterly misused in my opinion. As I said many times before being conservative doesnt mean you are against these mandates...If a person doesnt want to get a vaccine I understand and rescpect but I also understand you will be blocked to meet your colleagues at work...its your decision. No dictatorship seen here.	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don‚Äôt want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it‚Äôs effectiveness, but that‚Äôs a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it‚Äôs wild that that‚Äôs somehow controversial these days.</p>	<p>I understand what you‚Äôre saying, but I also think it‚Äôs irresponsible to suggest that everyone who opposes vaccines get vaxxed, or that those who do, should be shamed for having a vaccine, or even for not getting one. If you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, but don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not going to require a vaccine for everyone. I just think it makes a lot of sense to require hospitalizations for people who require it, and also for people that require hospitalization for their medical condition.</p

Maybe could've skipped a few of the literal hundreds of golf trips he took to get that kind of work done?  Wild idea, I know	We've had two years, why haven't I seen any hospitals or COVID wards being built? We spent trillions in stimuli, unemployment, and other things to avoid the symptoms of COVID, how much money was spent on increasing capacity, which is currently being used as an excuse to curtail our civil liberties.	<p>Couldn&#39;t agree more. Maybe he could have gone on vacation and skipped the last few years, maybe he&#37;d have had more time to think about it?</p>
https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/covid-panel-military-service-members-see-spikes-miscarriages-cancer  300% increase in cancer diagnoses, from a 38,700-per-year average to 114,645 in 2021.  For neurological issues diagnosis codes, there was a more than 1,000% increase in 2021 over the five-year average, from 82,000 to 863,000. Renz noted during the panel that neurological issues "would affect our pilots."  "Our soldiers are being experimented on, injured, and sometimes, possibly, killed," he added.  Additional data The Blaze received from Renz showed: a 269% increase in myocardial infarction, 291% increase in Bell‚Äôs palsy, 156% increase in congenital malformations of military members' children, 471% increase in female infertility, and 467% increase in pulmonary embolisms.	<p>So has heart disease and cancer.  The primary age groups of war deaths is 18-30, with a total over 660,000 for all of our wars. Covid deaths for that same age group is 11,677.  660,000&gt;11,677.  I imagine if 60+ year olds fought all of our wars the death rate for those would be much higher as well.  And to preempt the inevetable &quot;YoU dOn&#39;T cArE aBoUt GrAnDmA&quot;, yes I do, I am just smart enough to know that there is not really a comparison between a healthy and fit 25 year old being killed in combat to an 80 year old grandma at the end of her life being pushed over the edge by covid.</p>	<p>In the US, the military has increased the average age of people who contract covid from 18 to 44. It‚Äôs a massive increase from that age. By 2021, we‚Äôll have an average of approximately 947,000 deaths per year. That‚Äôd be approximately the same number of deaths as the US. </p>
Are you all going to gloss over your conservative news guy talking about her boyfriends feet? Or are we just trying to make her look bad?	> In Wednesday-evening tweets responding to criticism of President Joe Biden from conservatives, Wilkinson wrote, **‚Äú‚ÄòAha! Biden proposes policies I dislike. HIS CALL FOR UNITY IS A LIE!'** is all the forlorn conservative mind can seem to muster. Sad.‚Äù	<p>But what if the left did the same thing? They&#39;ll blame conservatives for being unhinged and angry, and then blame liberals for the outrage?</p>
You're right, it's not political. Why are we putting those struggling with a mental disorder on pedestals while shooting down those that speak the truth?  Enabling those with such disorders instead of correcting them is doing them a disservice. They'll never know reality if everyone continues to cater to their fantasy.	<p>I was really hoping to have a valid debate with someone that might have some useful insight, but all you have done is insult, bring zero valid points to the debate, and be a hypocrite. I hope in the future you actually think more before you post. If you really want people to &quot;turn from their evil Republican ways,&quot; maybe you should consider giving them a legitimate reason to do so. Badgering and insulting while being a hypocrite will turn people away from your ideology, not bring them closer.</p>	<p>If you‚Äôre in the position to take responsibility for your own actions, then you are doing a disservice to society. I don‚Äôt blame people for their actions, I blame society for failing to provide adequate support. You blame people when they dont act in their own interest. It‚Äôs laziness on part of the general populace. </p>

The current Republicans are more likely to be supported by voters who don't know the history of the Civil War (hint:  the Southern states seceded over wanting to continue slavery).  Dixie flag and all that.    More concerning is why any elected official, of any party, would think it acceptable to proclaim registered American citizens not be allowed to vote because of what state they lived in previously?  That's the part to focus on  because it's unAmerican.	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	<p>The idea that republicans should be disenfranchised by the state is stupid.  In fact, it‚Äôs absurd.  The idea that they should be allowed to vote is ludicrous.  Why would anyone want to vote for a republican when you can vote for someone who doesn‚Äôt have a good track record of voting in line with your interests?  The reason people want to disenfranchise minorities is because they‚Äôve been disenfranchised.  </p>

So pipe bombs are found around the capital building and its no big deal.  People died that day no big deal though.    4 Americans died in Benghazi.... 10 different investigations.    You know it is possible to multi-task.  Maybe thats tough for you though.    Sounds like you have the playback down.  Deflect, deflect, deflect.	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government. Plus there was only a couple dozen of them vs tens of thousands of Trump rioters at the Capitol.	<p>Last year, in the wake of the storming of the capitol, the left blamed the sitting president and his allies for the violence.  The left blamed him for the lack of evidence, but the right blamed the entire thing on the Democrats.  It&#39;s not as if the left was wrong as they claimed.</p>
Yup, there is no way they have the manpower or space to even try and do that. Overwhelm them with numbers, and if some are arrested they can post bail and go right back. That is why even though I can't be there physically I am donating all the cryptocurrency I am mining so they will always have money to get people out.

But in the interim please take this cash and help a brother out.‚Äù</p>	<p>The problem is, they don&#39;t have the resources to actually do anything about it. They&#37;re not even going to do a damn thing about it, they have no means of getting anything done.  So if you want to do something really, really, profoundly dumb like start a GoFundMe or something like that, it would be a waste.</p>

Anybody have the actual text handy?   The article makes it sound like the kill switch is inferred by the writer, not in the text itself.

Defcon guys have gamefied hacking those voting machines.	Obama did much more, using the NSA and FISA.

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they‚Äôve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don‚Äôt have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it‚Äôs effects, then make another choice and see it‚Äôs effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can‚Äôt sue companies for vaccine injuries, you‚Äôre asking for Foul Play.	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	<p>It&#39;s a bit much to assume that you are catching COVID, and that you have a higher chance of catching it when you are vaccinated. But I guess if you are unvaccinated, you are not as likely to catch COVID as you are to catch it. </p>
I truly don‚Äôt understand this. I am vaxed and boosted. Yet here is a very liberal podcast w a researcher yesterday explaining why we don‚Äôt need boosters u unless immunocompomised and that the messaging re booster in December was wrong.	<p>This bill is essentially &quot;take most of the shit we got away with last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, everything that conservatives are pissed off over, and make it law.&quot; People wonder why the rift in this country is growing wider and wider? It&#39;s because politicians only push policy that helps their party and their voters, not the entire constituency. Maybe I wouldn&#39;t hate the fuck out of Democratic politicians so bad if they at least <em>pretended</em> to give a fuck about me and my family?</p>	<p>But I don&#39;t understand why they want to get rid of covid, because they know it is a virus that mutates and mutates in a way that makes no sense. They are the same people who want to make masks and vaccines for everyone, but they don't want to be jabbed. They don't need to. They need to get vaxxed. That&#37;s all they need to do. </p>

The ignorance of this thread is appalling. Context is very important.

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	<p>You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. It&#39;s not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as &quot;left wing&quot; as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant. It stinks of YouTube political commentary, which is oftentimes just laymen ranting.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t want to be a fascist, but I do want to make it clear that the Nazis were the real fascists, not fascists. If you want to see fascism, you can look at the Soviet Union as an example of how it was executed in the 1930s and 1930s. This is what the Nazis intended it to be, but it was not executed by Hitler, Stalin, or Trotsky. The Nazis were executed by the Nazis, Hitler, and Trotsky.</p>
A. Listeners are not subscribers.  Since you're so fixated on their revenue...where they get most of their revenue are from ads, not subscribers.    B.  You said they got 5 Billion in revenue from announcing him.  They did not.  Market valuation is not revenue.  I didn't say market share valuation means nothing.  Not even remotely close did I say that.  I said that's not 5 Billion in revenue...because it isn't.   C. Spotify has been in the podcast game for a very long time.  Their biggest leap actually happened when they grabbed The Ringer.  D. You getting angry over you misunderstanding the difference between market valuation and revenue is not only funny, but proves the point I was making.   Once again...I'm not saying losing Rogan would be good for them. I'm saying it wouldn't be this massive hit a certain brand of people, such as yourself, would believe it is.	<p>Facebook didn&#39;t donated much but if you look at the project they did to get bide elected and spent close to half q billion on it.</p>	<p>The problem is, you&#39;re not a millionaire. You&#38;re a billionaire. I&#37;m not one of those people. I think you can argue that Spotify was the most profitable company in existence at the time, but I don&#59;t think it was the best way forward for the company. They were also the ones that made the leapfrog. You know better than them. You also know better. You have to be a millionaire to realize that.</p>
So when did the left say not to get the jab? The libs are jackasses, but they never said this widely.  Seriously, people on the Right need to make up their mind on what the narrative is... Is the jab a Dem plot, or is it Trump saving the world? it can't be both.  Get the fuck outta here	<p>What are they?  People keep acting like I&#39;m a moron, and maybe I am, but not a single commenter has laid out any benefits to banning a mask mandate.  How am I supposed to ever be right if no one can explain to me why I&#39;m wrong?</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. It would be like saying he could ban all 3A paraphenalia, but the fact that he was forced to do so without a valid reason is really gauche. He&#37;s an idiot, I guess. </p>

Sometimes I struggle to see the difference between Red and Blue. They all game systems. They all cheat. They all try to change rules for their immediate benefit only to accuse the other side of being undemocratic when they use those same changed rules. Give me someone better. Please.	People who claim crap like what's being claimed by Sheila and others just want to play the game dirty and when people try to institute basic rules, they cry out ""racism!"" because they have nothing else to cling onto.	<p>I struggle to understand why people try to change the rules when they don&#39;t want to change them.  If they are genuinely interested in changing the rules, then they are willing to do so, but they are also willing to change their mind about the rules.  They are often more interested in making a quick buck than actually doing something.</p>

It is fair. If it were unfair, we'd fight back. We'd defend ourselves. We'd use our numerical advantage to take back what we so enthusiastically exclaimed were unalienable rights. We aren't doing that, so it must be assumed that all of these things happen with our consent.	<p>How is this supposed to be different?  What is the difference between being a dictator and being an agent provocateur?  Do you really think this is what the government is trying to do?

Or maybe get a proper education, and get vaccinated? Damn overgrown child....you're pathetic.  Luckily, over 90% of truckers aren't this stupid.	A few things about that. The mortality in those over 80 is close to 90% (although probably old numbers). So ignore those people. The rest of the us populace is fine right? Well 70+ % are overweight or obese, which is an extremely compounding risk factor for a number of reasons. So ignore those people right? Add all of the other chronic conditions that exist in the us and you're left with a small percent of the population that actually doesn't have risk factors for covid. And guess what? **it's a virus that we have (had) a vaccine for. ** It's miraculous that we could have developed it so quickly, but that's what happens when there's money to be made (capitalism) and the whole human populace is facing the same challenge.	<p>Now we have a metric fuckton of obese people who are vaccinated.

Conservative "blue dog" Democrats (which I was back in the 90s/early 00s) basically are incompatible with the modern Democratic party because we can't support their current brand of blatant anti-Liberalism.  Liberalism has become a heavily conservative idea in 2022, which only exists in the Republican party (even if they're imperfect in a lot of ways, at least they're not off-the-wall crazy).  That's why so many of us ended up on the right.	<p>While I am more centrist than conservative, I respect that some people hold conservative views and I like(d) some conservative politicians (like McCain) and I absolutely see why it seems like good idea to big part of population. What I don&#39;t agree with is PiS: They aren&#39;t only conservative, they slide to authoritarianism which I think nobody on this sub really agrees (freedom of speech and stuff, you know).  </p>	<p>The late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  When we criticized them on the national level, we were told we weren&#39;t wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.  We were told that the only way forward was for the party to reform.  The Democratic party could and does not reform itself.  That was the plan.</p>

You're woefully misinformed (yet again) so I'm going to help you here:  Did the jab stop people from getting the virus 100%?  Clearly not hill person. Great work. I'm proud of you.  The problem that you're too fucking stupid to realize is that it absolutely diminished a person's ability to get it by a significant factor.  So when you ask questions like that, the answer is YES. IT STOPPED A TON OF PEOPLE FROM GETTING IT. No, not everyone, but many many people. Regardless of what you think.  I know I know, in your small mind everything is black and white. Did it work or didn't it!?   Things can be in the gray area, hill person. The vaccine can prevent a ton of people from getting it all but not everyone and still be a great vaccine.  Does that make it perfect? No Hill person it does not.  If you want a perfect vaccine go ahead and make it yourself - I encourage you!  Nobody ignored your point because you didn't have a point to make.	First one shows a small protection from contracting but zero benefit if you do get the virus. Second is more meaningless because it means everyone in the smaller pop got it. Both suffer from the same issue because you aren&#39;t accounting for how infectious the virus is in general. If it normally spreads to 10% of people and the vaccine stops 2% your numbers don&#39;t make sense. You&#39;re over weighting one side giving you meaningless results</p>	<p>I also think it‚Äôs ridiculous that you‚Äôre trying to argue that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop COVID, because the vaccine prevents COVID from spreading. It‚Äôll simply reduce symptoms and make people less likely to get it. That‚Äôd be a huge problem for any vaccine, and for any immunocpmpromised person. But for those that don‚ÄôÔøΩt have a strong reaction to it, the vaccine is a disaster for everyone. </p>

it's so obvious that none of you bothered to actually read the "article".   Neil Young sold half his music catalog some music management company. Said company has now hired a senior advisor who used to be Pfizer's CEO. Then they say "he probably told the artists to speak out against Spotify and Rogan." Tenuous connection at best.  Try actually reading the garbage you post and upvote. This is pitiful and embarrassing.	Small time renters, from the elderly using rent as supplemental income to small time guys with a single complex of a dozen units are going bankrupt because the government stepped in and said ""Your contracts are unenforceable and have no weight anymore.

During his term there was a lot of talk about how he would help the company out financially by increasing the size of its business. But he was also a big influence on the industry.  He was one of the most influential voices in the industry at the time, and his influence on businesses was undeniable.  That influence was also influential in the decision to hire CFO.  During the 2016 election, CFO David Greene was asked to step down, but the left pushed him aside and said ""no way he would be able to do that

> I might care about this if the vaccine worked  Its not a vaccine! You are talking about a mrna gene therapy shot, with unknown side effects, secret unreleased testing results, and a completely useless track record indicating you are actually worse off taking it than not.  I 100% think actual vaccines have a benefit: vaccines being treatments which grant immunity to something as the original definition before it was altered to mess with our heads andpush propaganda..  These jabs are not vaccines, and lets stop letting the communist left control language.	You make an absolutely insane claim about masks. You say that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do ANYTHING‚Äù to stop the spread of a virus.  That in itself is just amazingly ignorant of basic physics. This is Kindergarten physics on the level of object permanence. Truly amazing. A face shield is better than Nothing. A paper towel stapled to your face is better than NOTHING. You need to think about the words you use. Words like ‚Äúanything‚Äù and ‚Äúnothing‚Äù have precise definitions and i encourage you to hit up your local library and check out a dictionary.   Are N-95 masks better than standard surgical masks? Absolutely, but if I sneeze into the air, those droplets and aerosols are going everywhere. If I wear a mask, the spread is heavily reduced. You know what would also add a layer of protection against the escaped droplets and aerosols? Social distancing. We can argue all day about semantics but you made the claim that they ‚Äúdo not do ANYTHING,‚Äù and that is liken to saying that gravity doesn‚Äôt do anything. Utter nonsense.	<p>I would not say it‚Äôs miraculous that the vaccine prevents the spread of COVID. But there‚Äôd be a lot of debate about whether or not the vaccine is 100% effective. You‚Äôre talking about a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt kill COVID, but rather reduces symptoms. It‚Äôll take a long time to realize that the vaccines do. But once you‚Äôve got the vaccine, you probably have some reason to believe that you‚Äùre going to die anyway. </p>

I&#59;m not happy that he lost the election, but I am happy that the election was close and he is the one winning.</p>

Outstanding, thank you....everybody needs to know who these people are, no company deserves anyones business, who pushes that poison on its workers, disregarding their personal choice with or without their doctors input, its inhuman and cannot be tolerated. This is a fantastic idea.	This is the perfect example of people not being able to believe people who are smarter than them because they don't see it with their own eyes.

Dont be surprised if there is still National Guard there for the 2022 Mid terms.</p>	<p>But I don&#39;t think he&#37;s the only one who has been put under the pressure of that risk. I think he could have handled it himself, but I don‚Äôt think the average Vaxxer would have been willing to risk such a risk.

His claim is in response to republicans changing local election laws in certain places. Whether you agree with him or not, he is saying that the election will be different because some laws have changed since 2020.   Also- nobody has ever suggested there was 0 voter fraud from either side of the aisle. There has been many cases of voter fraud that were identified and prosecuted, but not anything close to enough to change the outcome of even a small local election.	<p>The problem is that election laws <em>were not</em> legally modified in 2020.  In 2020, many state and local officials <em>ignored</em> election laws to accommodate covid.  This is the key point where the Republican argument wins.  For example, Texas law is explicit in disallowing drive-through voting for most people.  Some Texas counties did it anyway.</p>	<p>There is no evidence for voter fraud. The vast majority of people who have voted for Clinton in the 2016 election did so on the basis of the election results. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the election was close to 100% decided by mail-in ballots. If you‚Äôre not a republican, you probably assume that the elections were rigged.</p>
‚ÄúObvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities‚Äù  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.  Conservatives want a strong leader who will do what‚Äôs right for the country without engaging in inflammatory, childish attacks and furthering the divide in this country. We need a presidential candidate who can have honor, dignity, and class. Trump unfortunately does not possess those qualities and never will.   Yes I voted for him in 2020. No I will not vote for him again.	<p>&quot;I told you so&quot; aside, this is a serious issue and the reason he skipped around the subject before the election is because the left and the right <em>both</em> would feel concern by the idea. Why? Because if Biden can do it, a [theoretical] future Trump administration can. </p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. I also think he was a terrible person, and I absolutely hated what he went through with executive order 2A. He also had a terrible track record of voting in line with my interests (not perfect, but pretty darn good). </p>

This is true.  There are almost no African Americans in Ukraine.  So you automatically know the murder rate is lower there.	I realize that none of these things happen inside a human resources bubble but the reality is that illegal crossings were at all-time lows just two years ago with the effectively same size staffing levels.	<p>Also, I don&#39;t know how many African Americans are living in Ukraine, but I do know there are more than 1,000 living in the country. </p>
Amazing that you're that delusional. Do you eat trumps ass for breakfast and deep throat his flaccid noodle before bed?   I'm pretty sure you do.	Why not just have to guys reach for a bloom of cheese in the store and accidentally touch hands?  They go home and have wild sex.  Then one guy goes to the pantry and ‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶. Doritos.  His fav.  And he goes back to the bedroom with them ready for round two because he has his energy again from the chips and the other dude licks the cheddar off his fingers. I mean‚Ä¶. Fucking write a decent story.</p>	<p>I get it. I get breakfast every morning. I&#39;m sure you eat the same breakfast every day. It&#37;s hilarious. I don&#38;t eat breakfast like that when I wake up. I do. I am not a diehard Trumper, I just think it is ridiculous.</p>
You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you? Don't be niave, over the better part of the last century the left has been corrupting every level of our society,  and they're for damn sure not going to show their rules to be voted away.    And violence most definitely IS the answer sometimes. Our rights and freedoms are worth killing to defend, otherwise there never would have been an American revolution. I refuse to lose America as its meant to be because some people are too cowardly to fight for what's worth fighting for. I'll die for those ideals. I swore an oath to the constitution(not to the government) and I still take it seriously. Wise up, evil is real and our enemies are among us.	<p>That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with. Now, they want full control over your lives and there is not compromise.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs time to stop pretending that the left is the only option for us. If we were going to stay in the dark, there‚Äôd be no way we‚Äôre going to let them continue this rampage.  As soon as they‚Äôve had enough of the ‚Äúleft‚Äù bullshit, they‚Äùll go full-tilt moonbat and start looking for other ways to feed their agenda.  The left will do whatever the hell they want to do, but the right is the most likely way to do it.</p>
Such shortsightedness. Many children are born into circumstances that are absolutely not appropriate. Ignoring the obvious (rape etc.), it makes absolutely zero sense to compel a woman to carry to term. You might have a point of America actually gave a shit about children‚Äôs welfare beyond this argument, but you‚Äôre severely lacking in any kind of appropriate support for mothers, childcare provisions, accessible healthcare etc.  Be against abortion by all means, but it‚Äôs an absolute joke to call it genocide.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.  To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.  Now maybe a society comes about that there&#39;s no point in maintaining an &quot;unwanted life&quot; but that gets really screwy and it goes against human nature in that in nature you needed more people generally due to strong death rates in the natural world.</p>	<p>The point is, abortion is a completely un-American decision. It‚Äôs not a decision anyone should have to make, it is a decision they make based on their unique circumstances. If you want to make the decision to not have the baby, it‚Äôll be a decision you believe to be correct, but if you don‚Äôt want the baby you pose no risk to the mother and should have every right to live the same way as you do. </p>
If China murdered them, and Trump was president, but Jared Kushner and President Xi were buddies, the US would have said it was ok.	<p>If China truly was behind it, they would have had the vaccinations ready to go while the virus killed their enemies.</p>	<p>Also, if Trump had been president, and had been one of the most aggressive assholes in the history of the world, he would have been in charge of the intelligence community. And if he had won, Trump would have had the best chance at getting rid of the virus and had the most stable foreign policy. </p>
Screw the NFL! Thye deserve no sympathy after throwin' the fans under the bus just to appease some thin-skinned Pinkos with an Internet connection!

It&#37;s not as if black people are being forced to toe the line or someone else is doing it. It is more like they are trying to make black people feel better by impersonating white people and impersonating them.</p>

Yup, Scotland is very similar. I just traveled to both and God bless the USA but man anytime I get an opportunity to head over to Europe I jump on it. Edinburgh is a beautiful city, safe, very very clean compared to many US cities. People are reasonable, vaccinated, wear masks inside when have to, but bars, clubs, restaurants all open to full capacity. It's almost as if the universal healthcare system works when it's designed right....am I a conservative? Yes. Do I want to be on a ventilator? No. Do I feel extremely at risk? No. Does mRNA edit your genes and make you a government Democrat robot? Also no. Lol , it's not that hard people .	Now, having said that and establishing I'm not just a fanboy of one particular side, the Vaccine DOES actually work.  It protects fairly well against COVID breakthroughs (particularly Moderna) and even if you do get a breakthrough your case will likely peak at a cold or a mild flu.  People should choose to get the vaccine but I honestly don't care if you don't.  It's a free country.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, but I do like the idea of having a vaccine in every single American. If you can get it in a few years, I&#37;d love to have it in my own home. But I&amp;m a very conservative person, and I don&#38;t have to blindly endorse any politician or party for their policies. If not, why not just open up the door for others to get it?</p>
Give guns to kids, great idea. Makes you wonder how school shootings even happen. Idk, maybe it's because this specific tread draws in idiots who act as if they stand on standby, guns ready for when a new Hitler comes to power and think Germans should arm themselves to prevent it from happening again. They really like to say that Germany should become as "free" as the USA, even though the USA is the one with a serious gun problem.	<p>I&#39;m going to go with this one, considering that same government introduced anti-gun legislation immediately after this event. Obama was a nasty globalist but he wasn&#39;t stupid, Sandy Hook was a KGB style false flag down to the training script. How would the wreckage make money off of hurting parents? Taunting them with blackmail/gangstalking type stuff? Please expand on how you would see that working</p>	<p>The idea that guns should be restricted for everyone is just stupid. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that the idea that banning guns for everyone would cause a global pandemic is actually wrong. It&#37;s like saying that banning a firearm for everyone will make everyone look bad even if you don&#38;t have a criminal background history. That is the definition of a gun. I think it also applies to people who own guns. If you want to ban guns for people that don&

the Democratic Party of the 1850s and 1860s was on the wrong side of the slavery issue, and in 1860s, it wrenched the party apart ‚Äî into northern Democrats and southern ‚ÄúDixiecrats‚Äù.	<p>Democrats have also been blatantly dishonest and disrespectful of those who suffered under their Jim Crow Laws by claiming Georgia&#39;s election reform is &quot;Jim Crow 2.0&quot;. And invoking the Civil Rights Act when trying to pass HR 5 is just as dishonest.</p>	<p>The late 1800s and early 1900s were a fertile time for the Democratic Party. During that time, the party went from strength to strength, and the Democratic party blamed southern racism for the failure of the previous administrations policies. The party blamed Southern racism and the resulting wave of civil disobedience on southern racism. The Democratic Party blamed southern scapegoating, and blamed southern white supremacists for the initial wave of the Civil Rights movement. </p>
Well the dude needed a shower, better camera, lighting, a hint of professionalism, actual work experience rather than being some fucking dog walker (seriously if you own a dog, walk it yourself, that‚Äôs part of being an adult and owning a dog), and much more with an actual message, other than, ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs be lazy but I want to live in luxury while doing it.‚Äù He‚Äôs completely out of touch with reality	<p>Also even bigger then fit testing is keeping yourself clean shaven. Masks won‚Äôt do jack if you have a beard or even scruff. That‚Äôs why in a job that requires a respirator you need to be clean shaven or they won‚Äôt let you work. You can usually get away with relatively trimmed mustaches, but scruff and beards no way.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard dog person, I‚Äôve been a dog person for quite some time now. I‚Äùm more than happy to give the responsibility back to my kids if they want to, but I don‚Äôt want them to have to go out and play with other people for fun. If you‚Äôre not going out and buy a dog then you‚Äùre not leaving the house. If your kids want to play with them, that‚Äôs their right, but if you want to get them vaccinated they‚Äôll do it now.</p>
I do not consider myself on the left.  I‚Äôm definitely fiscally conservative.

Conservatives typically don&#39;t rush to conclusions. </p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, but I do think he‚Äôs an amazing example of a conservative who doesn‚Äôt have to blindly endorse the ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agenda. I think he was a great example of someone who was genuinely interested in the welfare state and who didn‚Äùt want to be labeled a ‚Äúhater‚Äù for being an anti-vaxxer. I also think he did a good job at getting the public in board to fight the virus.</p>

Unfortunately, since 2016, too big a chunk of conservatives care more about hating democrats than anything else. Including consistency and the truth.	Biden screwed up so bad moderate dems and liberals will even for for Trump now. They won‚Äôt vote for other republican candidates because they are democrats. They will vote for Trump because even all the bad things that stick to Trump, the one thing that people really equate to Trump is the economy. So people will want that.	<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I think you realize that the average VOTER is more pissed off at Trump than the average Democrat.  That&#38;s why you see so much outrage right now.  I&#37;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but overall I think he was a terrible person.  He was a shitty person, and I think people should learn from him and respect him. </p>

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here‚Äôs my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women‚Äôs bathroom.‚Äù It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women‚Äôs bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...    Those irrational wokes are at it again!	<li>Move Overton window as far as possible to prime the argument and limit any foothold your opponent may have (shout your abortion, all guns should be banned, trans women are the same as XX women) </li>	<p>If you&#39;re against transgender people being forced to have sex, you are against the rights of trans people, and you should be ashamed of yourself for doing so. It&#37;s not like you are advocating for everyone to have a penis, but you are also advocating for the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated. If you want to make a quick buck and stop being a hypocrite, then good for you. Stop trying to be an asshat and call me a racist for being a bad person.</p>
Proper and equitable federal and state funding can fix a lot of these issues. But I guess that's probably an unpopular opinion in this sub	<p>It&#39;s a <em>really</em> easy way to gain support from some demographics we tend to fall short with in terms of support. At the very least, indifference would be better than flat out opposing it.</p>	<p>It seems like a lot of the ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù want to take away the federal government‚Äôs infrastructure, so I don‚Äôt see that as a bad thing.</p>
I blame our founding fathers and then men who were too lazy to work their own land. Yesterdays laziness is tomorrows curse.	<p>It also reinforces that our society is now one of outrage culture. If you say one off the narrative statement, even once, your history, skills, and accomplishments are utterly forgotten and you are permanently exiled from the public forum. This man will struggle to ever find work again. And for what? Was it hateful to say what he said?

Wait, are you joking? So the last year+ of ‚ÄúStop the Steal‚Äù and a literal violent attack on the capital because the election was stolen is who‚Ä¶democrats?!   And Bush and Trump both lost the popular votes but ultimately won the election due to the flawed electoral college system. So that‚Äôs a valid reason to ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù that maybe something needs to change in a 250 year old system that‚Äôs clearly not working anymore.	<p>This bill is essentially &quot;take most of the shit we got away with last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, everything that conservatives are pissed off over, and make it law.&quot; People wonder why the rift in this country is growing wider and wider? It&#39;s because politicians only push policy that helps their party and their voters, not the entire constituency. Maybe I wouldn&#39;t hate the fuck out of Democratic politicians so bad if they at least <em>pretended</em> to give a fuck about me and my family?</p>	<p>But the fact that the election was stolen by trump supporters and his lie about the severity of the situation is astounding. It&#39;s enough for you to say that Trump lost the election by a comfortable margin. The rest of us are just as likely to believe that the fraud was committed by the wrong person. That is enough to make you spit out your drink and laugh at your own reflection. </p>

least delusional r/Conservative poster	<p>I am very conservative</p>	<p>This subreddit is the worst of all time</p>
Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms. Turns out if you run a coordinated 4 year propaganda campaign to make someone into Hitler 2.0 and have all intelligence agencies feeding disinfo to fuel the flames the enthusiasm can be outsourced. Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes. Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government. Plus there was only a couple dozen of them vs tens of thousands of Trump rioters at the Capitol.	<p>So now you have to accept that the vast majority of the people being held without bail or bail are actually under the false pretense that the Trump admin was going to kick the can down the road and give them billions of dollars. The reality is that the administration actually did a really bad job at getting the public in board to fight the virus. They also did a bad job distributing supplies needed Nationally Guarded troops. And they did a good job at distributing supplies. And by now there are almost certainly some Republican Senators that actually wanted to help the administration out. But they&#39;re just too busy
> expert  *J. Alex Halderman professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where he is also director of the Center for Computer Security & Society.*  *After the 2016 United States presidential election, computer scientists, including Halderman, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly, while Clinton won New Hampshire and Maine narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome.*  *On 21 June 2017, Halderman testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.The hearing, titled "Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election" focused on the federal government's role in safeguarding U.S. elections from outside interference.*  *Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Halderman stated that a software glitch during the unofficial vote tally was not caused by fraud, but rather by human error...*  ...*and said the conspiracy theory that a supercomputer was used to switch votes from Trump to Biden was "nonsense".*	We also know that the FBI was aware in 2016 that the entire Russia narrative originated inside the Clinton campaign.  This wasn't even ""oppo research"".  This was literally the campaign ""conjuring up"" the story.  I put that term in quotes because that's how John Brennan characterized it in his notes that he used to brief Obama and Comey.	<p>As a professor at the University of Michigan, I‚Äôve been a computer scientist for almost 20 years. I‚Äùm also a professor of computer science at the Michigan State University. I taught at the same school for over a year. During the 2016 election, I was asked if I thought the election was rigged. I said no. I also said I don‚Äôt think the election is rigged. If you‚Äôre not a professor, you probably think the opposite. I asked if you think that‚Äôs a problem. You said no, and I asked for proof of the election fraud

It's almost like he only got elected because enough dems hated Hillary and stayed home.	<p>It isn&#39;t as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told &quot;but he&#39;s rich&quot; or &quot;but the things he says are absurd!&quot; or &quot;no way he will build a wall! He&#39;s RACIST!!&quot;.  Everyone shrugged and didn&#39;t care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.</p>	<p>I&#39;m never flying again and hope to never fly again. I&#59;m always flying again, and I have to say, I think it was a really good idea to bring it up. The majority of people who voted for Trump are pissed off at Trump and his policies. I think they just want to be rid of Trump and focus on other issues, not fix the infrastructure bill they want.</p>
The police will do whatever their political masters demand they do. They will never do anything to put their pension at risk. They are the enforcement agents for tyrants and nothing more.	<p>And the mission of the police force should NEVER be to allow an increase in crime in an area and punish any political party. The mission of any police force is general enforcement of constitutionally valid laws and provide for general public safety regardless of political affiliation. </p>	<p>They will do whatever the hell they want, but we‚Äôre not going to pay them a penny. We‚Äôll pay them whatever we want. They‚Äôve got no business doing that. </p>
Like Mike Gonzales has any idea of the paradigm of the average street level Joe.	<p>How anyone thought Joe was going to be a uniter is beyond me.  </p>	<p>Do you have any idea of what the average Joe is?</p>
You didn't even let it go for a vote, lol. Apparently it got killed in committee by of the republican held legislature, so good job on that!	They are when you personally and arbtrarily dole out whatever you deem is and isn't ""respectful"" on some imaginary scale that matters to literally nobody but you. This ""entitlement"" rule seems to disappear every time theres a republican in office, and then its dusted off because someone said ""Lets"" and ""Go"", and ""Brandon"" OH HOW DISRESPECTFUL TO THE OFFICE.	<p>It didn&#39;t even happen in the House. It was just a bunch of Republican Senators trying to pass a bill that the democrats wanted to pass.  It was rushed through the Republican controlled House and Senate.</p>
Fucking hate liberals fucking worthless sacks of shits‚Ä¶.	<p>They absolutely HATE this phrase, because in general, Demcrats are whiny, inept, delicate humorless assholes incapable of tolerating anything outside their opinion.</p>	<p>Shut the fuck up, moron. Go get banned from more subreddits for being a whiney incel lol</p>
I was speaking to someone else but thanks for telling me you took the "Trump vaccine" as if he was somehow the guy to develop it. Next you will be telling me how its the greatest vaccine ever made and how its the very best at what it does.	Trump imagined that by accelerating the vaccine process and helping combat Covid he would be heralded and adored by the media, the medical community, and his political opponents. He thought  he‚Äôd be the one to get the credit. He thought that because that‚Äôs just how big his ego is, it‚Äôs a real weakness for him.	<p>I also had the experience of getting the vaccine myself. I‚Äôm 100% certain that the best way to make it is to get the vaccine yourself. I also think it‚Äôs a great idea to give the vaccine to someone who doesn‚Äôt have a strong reaction to it. The more I get, the more likely I am to die from Covid. If I die from it, the less chance I have of being able to live with it. </p>

He's gonna automate all those truckers jobs away, but apparently y'all will eat up a 3 word tweet and think hell yeah he's our guy	<p>Read again. I never stated this leap of judgement as you&#39;re suggesting it to be. Hell I&#39;ll paste that part again &quot;The bigger issue I see every lefty trying to criticize is muh mask, when in reality, people are happy for this (the abolition of all mandates) because it means they don&#39;t have to close down their business for over 3 months while letting &quot;ESSENTIAL&quot; podcasters keep their jobs at their studio while they starve. It means that peoples livelihoods are also coming back. Now you tell me, how can that not be a good thing?&quot;. And I forgot to mention that they don&#39;t have to limit their businesses in terms of clients aswell, meaning they can make more money.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I think he could have done better with a little less fuss.</p>
Was that the "Why are you gay?" video?	<p><em>is one of the gays</em></p>	<p>Did you watch the gay porn?</p>
No thanks. I don‚Äôt find goats attractive	<p>Manchin is NOT a hero.</p>	<p>I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what the goal is.  I think that maybe people will just stop trying to milk their own milk and stop pretending they‚Äôre so superior.</p>
Some sick fucks and pedophiles hide behind the Pride Flag.   Change my mind.	<p>The ‚Äúleft‚Äù or someone who claims to be left does something bad (Al Franken makes sexually inappropriate jokes). The right says ‚Äúwell won‚Äôt you admit that‚Äôs not ok???‚Äù And the left goes ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre right‚Äù and Franken gets canned </p>	<p>It&#39;s convenient for you to represent that he is a pedophile, but you can also represent that by pointing out that he has the right to kill, rape, and torture people. </p>
She has a nice body but man there is just something about that flat/angular nose and the bug eyes that is just so off-putting.	<p>The only criticism the special deserves is that it wasn‚Äôt very funny.

The deaths are primarily among the people who choose not to vaccinate. Unvaccinated people going about their lives without the same mitigation efforts die at a higher rate. And the political affiliation of the unvaccinated (for COVID at least) leans right more than left. Why would anyone apologize to Trump for his supporters ignoring the easiest safety measure continuing to die?	Oh downvoters! Perhaps you would prefer instead of money going to actual government projects it was just funneled right into the pockets of big wigs and politicians like it was for the past decades instead of the solid results they have gotten under Bolsonaro... sheesh. All the things the crap PT claimed they would do, NEVER HAPPENED, and now they are doing all these things with virutally zero fanfare.... wow the media many ignorant people are biased.	<p>The vast majority of people who are unvaccinated do not have a strong reaction to COVID. The vast majority (80%) of vaccinated people do not even have symptoms. This is why the vaccine isn‚Äôt as effective as it was initially thought it was going to be, because the vaccine is more expensive and takes more time to develop than it does to manufacture. </p>
And then there is...her entire personality...such as it is.	We have access to everything we wanted,'' she said.	<p>Her entire being is made up of her own.</p>
It's not they when it was one person... how stupid are you? You don't win anything you nazi fuck. You've proven nothing but the fact that you support racism. You've haven't proven us otherwise	I don't believe this trash response necessarily exposes BLM to be communist/sympathizers, I believe it just further highlights how single-minded they are. Their only reaction to every situation is black = helpless victim and nonblack = racist. They don't look at the specifics, they don't think, they don't care. They are not about justice just blind, rabid dogma that anyone who doesn't look AND agree with them is a degenerate racist.	<p>You&#39;re not a racist. You are a moron. You think that because you are a racist you are entitled to not be racist? I am not. I think that‚Äôs all you are doing. You have no clue what you are talking about. I am perfectly happy with your current state of affairs, but you are no racist. It&#37;s not your place to say anything critical about anything. You should just accept the facts and move on with your life as you please. </p>
What kind of a mentality you have in the first place? Waiting someone to invade your country? ƒ∞n reality you guys are invading and killing millions for money not the other way around.	<p>Like seriously the dude spent a fortune trying to get rid of the vestiges of communism in Europe how is he a secret leftist? The mental gymnastics is deranged lol.</p>	<p>You&#39;re saying that the government should pay off the debt of those who looted and looted the country?  That seems like a huge idea to me.  But that&#37;s not the reality we have anymore.  The government should be paying off the loan of the people that looted and defrauded the country.</p>
Reagan would agree with Biden more than Trump. This is a silly meme.	- """"President Biden‚Äôs BBB"" will not poll well. But, I would absolutely buy the fact that many (most) of the individual items poll well.""	<p>Trump is more likely to be successful than Hillary, Biden is more capable of being president than Hillary.</p>
Reminds me of BLM protestors blocking roads	<p>Edit: it needs to be said that at least some of the BLM protests got violent <em>after</em> the police got involved</p>	<p>Edit: Also, BLM is notorious for blocking roads and turning them into private property. </p>
The jab doesn't work. The sooner you understand that, the better off you'll be.  The vast majority of people got covid, got over it and got on with their lives and didn't go thru all the fucking gyrations you clown's ü§° ü§° ü§°'s are demanding.	<p>You lockdown nutters have overplayed your hand.  People aren&#39;t buying it any more.</p>	<p>I think the people that get covid are the ones who will be punished the most.   They‚Äôre the ones that will get punished the least.  That‚Äôs not the reality we have anymore.  The people who covid is the real world, not the fictional story.  You‚Äôve got to be a fucking moron to not understand that.  And if you do, you‚Äôll be punished for it.</p>
Got'm!  For decades! For Centuries, likely.	<p>for decades. read the article.</p>	<p>We have been doing this for decades now.</p>
What the hell are you even talking about? Go have a nap or something lmao	Of course if you are one of those followers that has to be told how to think and act you are already a lost cause and should just curl up in a corner and be forgotten.	<p>Take a nap.</p>
If you'd actually read any of the studies or releases about the side effects, you'd know that the incidence was not statistically significantly higher than an unvaccinated population.  It's ok though. You've already made your ideological bias abundantly clear, so no amount of actual data can change your mind.  And before you pitifully invoke Fauci, I say he should step down. Tbh his communication needed some polish but, more importantly,  conservative media clockwork oranged people like you and now  his visage is carved into your reptile brain as THREAT forever. Thus a new face is requisite to placate all of you.  One can only hope to pull the conservative collective consciousness's ass out of the sand and, subsequently, its head out if its ass.	<p>FACTS are most important right now, not bias.  This prosecution is drowning, they have nearly no facts that help prove their case.  The liberal media is intentionally trying to convince people that Kyle is losing, so when he gets not guilty they immediately claim RACISM and PATRIARCHY and FASCIST and all the other nonsense they like to say when they don&#39;t agree with something.  The prosecution has been a disaster, every single STATE witness helped the defense&#39;s case in one way or another.  If Kyle gets guilty for anything other than the weapon possession charge, I&#39;ll eat my combat boots.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. It would be wise to only allow 2 A paraphernalytics outside the law, since 2A is a spectrum of protection and 3A requires a booster every 10 years. It&#37;s not rocket science, it&#38;s common sense.</p>
yeah I feel like the original criticism lost the plot when he brought up her bf's sandals in Florida.  had he stayed on topic he might have had a better case, but it makes him seem like a hater	<p>And then what? DeSantis solved covid and  hospitalization rates are doing down in Florida, because those things were smears which never landed on him. The left might hate him but his numbers among independents are fair because he doesn&#39;t scare new voters away.</p>	<p>I dont like what he‚Äôs doing, but I do like his politics. I don‚Äôt like his policies, but maybe he could have done better. That‚Äôd have helped. Instead, he opted to ignore the specifics of the situation and instead focus on the real problem, which is the Florida pandemic. </p>
One incident does not constitute a broad safety issue...it's an anecdote.  Were there other incidents?	<p>If theres no call to action, then you can‚Äôt say it was a violent rhetoric.</p>	<p>But I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a case of mistaken identity. I‚Äôm asking if there has been one. If so, why?</p>

ya and that KKK grandmaster, Robert Byrd. Died a democrat, and all the democrats of today paid homage to their racist colleague. The hypocrisy is astounding.	<p>Look, you vote and support the democrats as you please. The values and policies they promote are clearly what you support but don&#39;t be a fool and assume all black people think along your lines. I have seen democrat policies in states like New York, California, Michigan, Illinois and cities like Portland, Chicago, Baltimore etc. I have seen how it leads to poverty, gang violence, gun deaths, high abortions, high unemployment, high illiteracy, single parenthood, welfare dependency, and so many more problems that have destroyed the black community. If you think that is good for black people, no worries. It&#39;s your view. if I think that is terrible for black people, then that&#39;s my view as a black person.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm so happy for you and your family that you‚Äôre part of the reason why so many of the democrats today are boycotting the Capitol and saying ‚Äúno way‚Äù when in reality it‚Äôs all about the ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù. You have to look at the history to realize that this was a Democrat party that was founded on racism, not a liberal party. </p>
Let Russia invade who the hell cares what happens in some shithole country 5000 miles away	<p>Russia DID interfere with elections, they do it all the time. Pointing out a thing that happened isn&#39;t the same as saying shit like &quot;global warming is a hoax perpetuated by China to destroy America&quot;, or any o the other thousands of disgusting things Trump alone has said, never mind any other Republican.</p>	<p>So let‚Äôs move on to the next country, the one that has the most nuclear weapons. The one that doesn‚Äôt have a single warlock. The other countries that have nuclear weapons are the ones that have the most energy. The Russians are the real nuclear powers. The US is the nuclear superpower and China is the global superpower. If we can get that done, Europe will be the next superpower.</p>
Another "Rino" here who thinks Trump destroyed the Republicans party, put conservatives back 20 years and tried to ruin democracy itself.  We needed someone like Reagan not Hitler.	<p>more accurately, he was impeached for being a republican president when there was a democrat house.</p>	<p>I&#39;m also not a diehard Trumper, I think he was a great president, but I also think he should have left the country. The man who might single handedly give power back to Republicans and make power back available to the people is a traitors to the party and should be shamed as much as possible. </p>
Posted to r/conservative; supporters of literal insurrectionists on Jan 6, 2021. But yes, the Democrats are the fascist fucks.	It‚Äôs beyond comical watching Ayatollah-loving Democrats accuse conservatives of being antisemitic. It‚Äôs pure Alinsky tactics - accuse your opponent of exactly what you‚Äôre guilty of.	<p>The Democrats are the real fascists. They were elected on the promise of amnesty, and now they want amnesty. </p>
Plus they can‚Äôt afford to play Golf.	<p>Equity means that you cripple one to elevate someone else. It&#39;s not natural and it&#39;s nor fair. It&#39;s also impossible to execute on a large scale.</p>	<p>You can&#39;t do that with a golf club</p>
Yes, and it was accurate at the time, with the original covid strain. You can blame anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers for the fact that they do not work as well against the newer variants, because they gave the virus a breeding ground to mutate in.	<p>EDIT: Since the mods here are cowards. COVID does mutate, but it is much safer to be vaccinated. You can handle those mutations better and have weaker reactions to COVID when you do catch it. The vaccine is literally the safest method for combating the virus.</p>	<p>That&#39;s why the vaccines haven&#59;t been as effective as they should have been.  The vaccines don&#58;t kill the virus, they give immunity to the virus.  But they also don't kill it.  They kill it anyway. </p>
Too bad you wouldn‚Äôt listen to them	<p>It just wouldn‚Äôt really work.</p>	<p>That‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre talking about.  You‚Äôve made up your own mind about it.</p>
Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There‚Äôs small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it‚Äôs just so important for us to remember that we‚Äôre protecting ourselves, but we‚Äôre also protecting those little ones who aren‚Äôt yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing:¬†US pediatric hospital admissions for¬†Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334¬†children¬†have been admitted to the hospital with¬†Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.¬†	<p>Israeli breakthrough has also substantially changed especially when they actually study the population as a hole and not just healthcare workers.  Jerusalems hospital had a caseload of 72 patients - not a lot, but 72 hospitalization 85% of them were vaccinated and they have continued to see this trend.  4 days ago - of all the severe cases in Israel 324 total, 209 were fully vaccinated. So you are telling me they are not the ones spreading it - but are the cohort that is getting the worst symptoms at this time. The situation is fluid, just like this virus - which is why the statistics, Israel&#39;s game plan, and CDC changes its mind with the wind. Months ago they said Pfizer dropped transmission rate by 90% last week the CDC said it&#39;s as likely to spread and is showing the same viral load. The data is incomplete, its fluid,  and it&#39;s that simple. Cognitive dissonance is a thing whether you consider what I said to be a concise zinger or not.</p>	<p>The US has a large number of unvaccinated adults, and the numbers are so high that it&#39;s important to note that many of these people are at least partially vaccinated, and some of those people are even being admitted to the ICU for non-vaxxed patients. That&#37;s a huge risk factor for a number of reasons, but the general consensus is that the unvaxed are at an all-time high risk for hospitalization and hospitalizations.</p>
I‚Äôm glad you framed that beginning with ‚Äúissuing‚Äù lol	<p>And thanks for the follow!</p>	<p>I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre sticking to your guns though.</p>

This guy is a psychotic, sick bastard. The only reason he ‚Äútransitioned‚Äù is because he was at best an average swimmer in the mens division. This guy thinks he‚Äôs some hero. All he really is a steaming pile ofüí©!	In fact, I'd say that the brother that the girls hate on, humiliate, and tease throughout the show has the biggest revelation, and it's not a woke revelation - it was more of a ""what's important in life"" realization (he goes from a disaffected, bored suburbanite to a lover of the sea and hard effort).	<p>He&#39;s a TOTAL moron. He was the worst example of a millionaire who exploits the system to get by. He lost the battle against a sea monster, and he was forced to step aside after losing the battle with a virus. He&#37;s been a hypocrite for a long time now. He is a complete idiot.</p>
It was a joke, you'll be ok.	<p>You contradicted yourself. Good job</p>	<p>You were a joke.</p>
I am surprised that Xi Jinping allowed Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to stop performing fellation on him to say anything!!!	<p>What are they?

How am I supposed to ever be right if no one can explain to me why I&#39;m wrong?</p>	<p>I‚Äôm surprised that Trump didn‚Äôt tell the media to stop covering it, and that he‚Äôs willing to do so.</p>
‚ÄúGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

It seems that it just came out of the blue, and that the only people that truly cared about it were the elites.</p>
There wasn't some gut feeling, it was on the news unfolding before your eyes.  If you can do simple math or listen to people (both sides) thats not on the main stream media there was some shit going on.  Theres evidence allll over the place if you just look.  &#x200B;  Not sure who you are calling traitors though....	<p>People keep lumping together the content of CNN, Fox, and major network news as though it‚Äôs all the same, and for some reason can‚Äôt tell the difference between opinion shows and those that share the actual news, thinking it‚Äôs all MSM; but it isn‚Äôt, and that is where the confusion is.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. Bumpstocks are honestly pretty pointless, but they also aren't machine guns, Trump should have left them alone.</p>
She really lives rent free in all your heads lol. What a bunch of sad wannabe men conservatives are.	Sadly, the same thing happens when someone that‚Äôs critical of trump is immediately written off as being a never-trumper RINO, having TDS, he‚Äôs living rent free in their head, blah blah blah... It‚Äôs entirely possible to be 1) conservative, 2) think trump is generally a self-absorbed idiot, and 3) also recognize and appreciate the good things he did.	<p>He&#39;s one of the most corrupt people on planet earth, and he&#37;s willing to pay for everything he wants with tax dollars.  That is why they are so pissed off.</p>
Where did I say it was ok? I just said it was legal. Also, this isn‚Äôt a violation of the first amendment. That amendment prevents the government from stifling your speech, not private corporations. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt scream racial slurs in a Walmart. You need to look a bit closer into the constitution, man.	<p>Law abiding citizens do not commit crimes brandishing weapons it‚Äôs what makes them law abiding citizens. The 2nd amendment of the constitution seems to be the only amendment that people want to limit while expanding the 1st amendment into realms never intended.</p>	<p>If you think it‚Äôs a bit much to say that the government can‚Äôt force you to buy something, then it‚Äùs a violation of the constitution.  But I‚Äôm not going to argue that it is unconstitutional for the government to force you into buying something.  And I also don‚Äùt think the government should force you out of a position of where you don‚Äòt want to be.  That‚Äôd be unconstitutional, as it would be unconstitutional for any reason.</p>

Lol no.  Having the coolest insults and writing style since 4th grade recess doesn't make a chad.    If you want to pick a conservative role model, aim higher.  Trump is the equivalent of shooting yourself in the leg trying to unholster.	In the next at least 2 years but maybe even 4 or 8, Mitch is going to be the most important lump of 'no' in America. And for him to say 'no' to Joe Biden over and over again he is going to need to run a tight ship with no excess baggage. Purely as political gamesmanship, hitting Trump on the way out cost him and Republicans next to nothing but gives them quite a bit.	<p>You&#39;re wrong. Trump is the worst example of someone who has done something along the lines of a millionaire shooting a Nordstrom customer in the foot. If Trump had done something similar, he would have been the most popular politician in the world. But instead he did something really, profoundly dumb. He called Nordstrom a &quot;dangerous, anti-gun, anti fascist, and anti-mask. And he was known for being a straight up Nazi. He was also known for having a good track record of shooting people in the nose. That was pretty much it.</p>
Marx may not have been able to forsee the massive disinformation campaigns of the information age, but chomsky certainly has. Y'all should read "manufacturing consent".	<p>How should we combat this? Should we regulate what people are allowed to say? Should the government seize large companies to block these things? I don&#39;t see how more government reach could reduce this influence creep.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think he overestimates the danger to the American people. I think the fact that he was so willing to lie about the severity of the situation is a huge blow to him.</p>

Idk, 800,000 dead from Covid seems like a pretty good thing to be fearful about. But also many democrats are making the change to saying it may be time to just get it over with, since Omicron doesn‚Äôt seem like the biggest problem once you have it.	<p>Honestly, a few things I see here.  I think there are some conservatives who are going to stand up and say, my individual rights override your unconstitutional mandate.  There&#39;s also a large chunk of African Americans who are not getting vax&#39;ed.  You never hear about the latter.  You hear Biden blaming Trump supporters for not getting vax&#39;ed.  I believe the vax is highly effective at reducing the symptoms and severity of infection and very so-so at best at controlling the spread.  I also think overall, we have like 70% or so vax&#39;ed.  The un-vax&#39;ed are mostly young children and those with naturally acquired immunity.  The percentage of the population with COVID antibodies is likely very high, approaching 90%.</p>	<p>That&#39;s why democrats want to take the vaccine away from everyone. They don&#37;t want it to be gone, they&#38;re scared of the potential &quot;catalympic&quot, which is why they want it gone. They&#40;ve already had enough of the vaccine.</p>
Pfft! I'd knock their stupid little man-bun right off their dome!	<p>But alas they are all little dictators who would love nothing more to jab every living creature with that vaccine.</p>	<p>Shut the fuck up, moron. Go get banned from more subreddits for being a whiney incel lol</p>
Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with an adult male having sex with a 13 year old female. *If the female is of reproductive age, and is willing, its just nature.*   Chimps, our closest relative, often give birth to their first baby at the age of 13-14, orangutans are generally 13-15. They have a similar life expectancy to us, if we ignore modern medicine. We have decided as a culture that this is not allowed, and there are good reasons for it, and I am in no way advocating for sex with minors. To say however that it is fundamentally wrong is just incorrect.	<p>The current, and somewhat recent, veneration of abortion as a moral virtue and the outright denial of the humanity of the baby has erased the ability to have an actual conversation on the subject, intentionally so. Our understanding of fetal development allows babies born as early as 22 weeks to be fully viable. We can now literally see into the womb and see a tiny human with its own digestive system, with eyes that move, its gender, or it reacting to the sound of the parents voice. Advancements in technology allow us to see that a baby in the 2nd trimester isn&#39;t &quot;just a clump of cells&quot;.</p>	<p>A fetus is not a deathtrap. It‚Äôs a life-long process. There is no risk to a human being having a viable and viable foetus. If you‚Äôre fertile, you‚Äùre likely to end up with a fairly high risk of the foetus developing a foetus later down the line.  But if you want to make a quick decision to not have sex, you need to do so at the point of conception.  The risk is greatly mitigated by the development of a healthy foetus, and the gradual closing of rights for the mother.  </p>
I'm pretty sure that there are no mask mandates in North Carolina, but I might be wrong.	Exactly. We do not have any long term data so therefore the long term safety has not been proven. We assume based on various methodologies, and I personally believe it's safe but it is not 100% certain.	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he‚Äôs a good guy, but I‚Äôd be curious to see how he maintains his position in the Trump administration.</p>
Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	<p>Biden might not be Trump in his mannerisms, but he also gets a lot of help from the media to ignore the fact that he&#39;s really NOT a nice person. I mean for goodness sake there are plenty of times where he blew up on reporters and voters for asking questions he didn&#39;t like, where he said he wished he could punch Trump in the face, &quot;race shamed&quot; black people for even thinking about not voting for him, etc... the guy is no peach either.	<p>The late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn&#39;t want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we were too late.  We were told that we weren&#37;t wanted and don&#38;t let the door hit us on
I tend to agree in 99% of cases, but with her I liken it to yelling ‚ÄúBOMB!‚Äù on an airplane.	<p>And the press wants to believe the propaganda of a &quot;Enlightened Taliban&quot; so bad, So Joe doesn‚Äôt look bad... and by extension Democrats don‚Äôt look bad. So most of the media will present the 15,000 Americans stuck behind enemy lines as the greatest airlift in history. A triumph for Biden</p>	<p>The fact that so many people on the plane are yelling ‚ÄúBOMB!‚Äù when they hear this is 100% evidence that the plane was hijacked by terrorists is also evidence that they were wrong.</p>

They have to or they are forced to admit that in modern times Confederate states vote red while Union states vote blue. Even though it's obvious when you look at both sides only one of them have hundreds of Confederate flags and it isn't Democrats.	<p>The cities in Kentucky are blue, yes. But the entire bulk of the state is overwhelming red and struggling just as much. Instead of constantly parading Democrat failures, celebrate Republican successes and show why voting red would be favorable compared to voting blue. Right now, there is no incentive for a Kentuckian to vote at all, because both sides of the aisle aren&#39;t making anything better.</p>	<p>The thing about being a centrist, I dont have to blindly endorse that child sniffing coffin or the orange turd. I just have to say that it&#39;s pretty obvious that the last thing we want is to see a coffin floating around in the sky. That is why we have so much outrage over the last year or so over the deaths of thousands. If you want to see the full story, I suggest you look at the Wikipedia article on the subject and see how the page lists the exact same deaths. The Wikipedia article is basically just laymen ranting about how people are dying because of

I'll never vote for her now, I'm sure her conservative opponents are all mask wearing science followers so it will be an easy choice.	<p>Regardless of whether or not you believe it, of course a subreddit based on scientific discussion is going to ban a poster posting conspiracy theories with no sources and no evidence. It&#39;s just not the subreddit for it. There are plenty of conspiracy theory subreddits where I&#39;m sure it would go over well, but a heavily moderated subreddit for scientific discussion where sourcing of statements of facts is encouraged isn&#39;t one of them.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I am very suspicious of how he handled the situation with the vaccine. I don&#37;t think he will be very popular again, I do think he would be a good president.</p>

Better to cleanse the world through an all out war than to sit here and let them genetically cleanse it with gene therapy	<p>I figure that doctors and the government are pushing so hard for the vaccine, and eventual and to this pandemic because they want it to end. There is not a government on Earth or a practicing doctor that does not want to save their own citizens, save for some of the most brutal regimes in the world.</p>	<p>The idea that vaccines are the best way to get rid of viruses is to give them the ability to spread and destroy them rather than giving them the power to control and control the virus. That would allow for a completely unvaccinated populace to be completely wiped out and destroy everything they want.</p>
So due to the nature of your response I'd like to start off with you're an asshole. Like seriously dude. My mom who is 54 had a slight headache and lost smell and taste. My dad happened to get it way worse for whatever reason. This was also before vaccines were available to anybody. Glad you got your vaccine and youre super healthy my guy.   It's not about the children it's about who they interact with in their lives.	<p>Also, to answer your question: we don&#39;t mandate diets and exercise because a) that&#39;s authoritarian and ridiculous and b) being fat isn&#39;t contagious and has 0 effect on other people around you. Highly contagious diseases do, and they are very easily preventable through encouraging, and eventually mandating, vaccines. See: every other contagious disease we&#39;ve nearly eradicated.</p>	<p>I&#39;m 100% certain that the vaccines do not work. I had a fairly mild case of covid and I had some fairly mild symptoms, but I didn&#59;t feel like I was going to get it. I&#37;ve had a few mild cases of it myself, and I have had mild symptoms since I got the vaccine. I also had some mild wheezing, and it was mild. I would say that the vaccine is not 100% effective, but it certainly does help. It certainly helps to reduce the risk of hospitalizations and hospitalizations from
So maybe shame those fucks who can't be bothered and stand up for your principles?	<p>Orrrr, is it possible that some angry, aggrieved demographics, whom have convinced themselves of their inherent victimhood, are now experiencing the opposite of a social credit, a social critique I will call it, when they choose to behave in a way which has been shown to put the lives of others at risk... I will note that it follows that such an individual, or group of individuals, may lack the requisite ability to perceive said social critiques, and therefore may further misinterpret consternation as groundless persecution... Further, the social ineptness of this demographic might be associated with an increased likelihood of reading, following and believing, strange and hyper-specific conspiracy theories</p>	<p>That&#39;s why it hurts so many to hear these types of arguments. They are hypocritical.</p>
Let's not address the nature of responsibility being independent from physical presence.	You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.	<p>No, we‚Äôre not arguing that there‚Äôs no such thing as free anything.

Not nearly as disturbing as the real killer of police.   From the LEOKA: "257 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty from illnesses related to COVID-19"  Nearly another 250 in 2020.   For perspective, 73 cops were feloniously killed in 2021, and 46 in 2020.  Feel free to keep crying about how this is somehow a democratic president's fault (I couldn't care less about Biden but blaming him is such a stupid stretch). Meanwhile, all you anti-vaxxers are actually the cop killers.  If only you rectal thermometers actually cared about real things.	<p>In this case, Arbery probably wasn‚Äôt an angel, but considering he was murdered by 3 people that the media are trying to paint as typical conservatives with the right‚Äôs full support, it‚Äôs a good thing to state support for Arbery. Hell there are plenty of republican politicians that have committed a crime in the past and then had conservative support when running against a democrat in an election (same goes for dems supporting criminals sometimes). I think it‚Äôs so dumb to apply purity tests to everyone - supporting George Washington doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with his record of slave holding.</p>	<p>The 2020 election had a far greater amount of shootings and domestic terrorism. There were also a staggering amount of unvaccinated people, including some who were even shot by police, who were subsequently released and subsequently charged with multiple counts of murder. These types of crimes constitute crimes, and all should be punished. But the vast majority of those charged with crimes are crimes, not crimes. Even the most heinous crimes are still underreported and often not even fully investigated by law enforcement. </p>
Y‚Äôall kidding me? Ukraine got the goods on Joe and Hunter. Putin going in their to cover Joe‚Äôs ass for him.

The Dems would be shutting bricks of the Republican we‚Äôre doing this shit during the Russia investigation -</p>	<p>I mean the Ukraine crisis was over no actual evidence of fraud, and the US went in and said they would pay the Russians $2 million to help cover it up.  But the US did nothing to help the Ukraine cause.  And Russia did nothing.  The US didn&#39;t even help Ukraine.</p>

You saw NPR laughing at the New York Post for being a glorified tabloid? Do you work there?	<p><a href=""https://archive.is/wip/fpDot"">The Washington Post¬†was caught red-handed lying¬†about a conservative crowd‚Äôs reaction to a Mu slim activist.</a></p>	<p>Edit: I made a comment about how the New York Times is more like a cult than a mainstream news outlet. I meant the Washington Post, which has been around for almost a decade now. The Washington Post and CNN are the real &quot;conservative news networks&#39; but they are also political hacks.</p>
No. They‚Äôre mad you believe that they want to date you.	<p>Something tells me they wouldn&#39;t appreciate someone standing up and calling out this whole farce as non-inclusive as it&#39;s teaching certain kinds of people to feel shame for what they are.</p>	<p>Now they are mad that they want to ban people from using the word ‚Äúgender‚Äù</p>
Study shows conservatives are less likely to be successful, less likely to be super smart, and more likely to be super meanies to people.    "Study shows people who support Trump have low IQ's."  Those are parodies of actual headlines I've seen on there.	<p>Amongst non-conservatives and likely people who lean more moderate, Trump will just become a boogeyman which will almost certainly lead to the anti-Trump vote negatively impacting his chances. I believe there‚Äôs a much better chance for the Republicans to win in 2024 if the candidate isn‚Äôt Trump, because then the Democrats have less ammo.</p>	<p>Also, people who support Trump are more likely to be disengaged and disengaged from politics than those who support Clinton. So while Trump is popular, I don&#39;t see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump isn&#37;t popular.</p>
Lol, seethe.	lmfuckingao.	<p>Lol. So seethe.</p>
Haha..yeah right.  Trump added more national debt than any predecessor before.  Last 20 years have been nothing but outrageous deficits and printing of money.	<p>Iirc, Hillary Clinton spent the most amount of money in a presidential campaign. Billions and billions of dollars, and still lost. The president only makes $400k a year. It‚Äôs upper middle class, but not worth billions unless there‚Äôs something else you get out of it‚Ä¶</p>	<p>The last 20 years, the government has increased the national debt by a staggering 60% and created more jobs than any single administration in American history. The private sector has also increased the value of investments by a further 50% since Trump took office.</p>

People against abortions change their tune almost instantly when they themselves need one. Or they just live in denial throughout and after the process	This is why people are dropping religion at a pace never seen before, it‚Äôs totally out of touch. How about we teach basic sex Ed and how to use birth control to we aren‚Äôt performing as many abortions?	<p>Also many women who have abortions do not know what they are doing. If they know they are going to get an abortion, they will not be able to do it. And if they do, they‚Äôll be forced to terminate their pregnancy. </p>

That sounds quite socialist to me and against the very nature of the free market. Sounds like something communist China would do.	<p>Hoover was a free market capitalist, while FDR was a staunch socialist, who thought big government programs known as the &quot;New Deal&quot; would bring us out of the depression, as your textbooks try to teach you.   </p>	<p>I don&#39;t think the governments should be in charge of everything, but I do think they should be. The US should be the one pulling the strings and making sure everything is free for everyone, not the rest.</p>
No blame, exactly, since this is a ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù thing. But literally all of the anti-gerrymandering legislation and lawsuits have been created by Democrats and fought against by Republicans. So this must be what Republicans gambled on and wanted. They are willing to have NY, MD, etc with extra seats because they‚Äôve already run the numbers on the advantage they‚Äôve gotten in WI, OH, NC and others and it worth it. Don‚Äôt be outraged by something that has been planned for and accepted by the GOP.	<li><p>Amnesty would secure a permanent Democrat majority for the next generation. This would help RINO&#39;s because the last thing they want is to be in power (unless they&#39;re at the head of the table) you see what most of these congressional Republicans really want is to collect donations and bitch about things they cannot control or really do anything about. That&#39;s why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this &quot;They&#39;re the <em>real</em> racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if <em>we</em> did that? Just kidding we would never actually do anything to legitimize ourselves as a political threat to them, gib donations and socialism bad pls.</p></li>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He also did a really bad job at distributing supplies needed Nationally, and that made him a bad president. But overall he did a good job at getting the public in board to vote for him. And he was a good president, too.</p>
True. Mitch does not represent the party but trump doesnt either. Vast majority doesn't like trump after the stunt he pulled on Jan. 6 and numerous investigations he has incurred over the years.	<p>Trump was depicted very badly by the media which was partially why he lost. However, he did himself no favor tweeting garbage and saying nonsense. I still remember that first debate with Biden. That turned off a lot of independents voter right off the bat, and him being sick with Covid allowed Biden to opt out of one of the three debates. Biden literally sat in his basement and did not campaign. The Dems would absolutely LOVE to run against Trump. It would make the entire 2024 campaign about Trump (the man/figure) rather than on their far-left policies. </p>	<p>But I don&#39;t trust trump anymore. I do trust his record on executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. I also trust the FBI, which has done a good job at getting rid of Trump. But I also believe that Trump was a shitty president. He did a bad job at distributing supplies needed Nationally needed supplies. And the FBI did a terrible job at finding people who needed help. And they did a really bad job with getting supplies needed. Trump also did bad stuff with the help of Secretaries of State. </p>
What's idiotic about pointing out projection? Both sides do it, and it makes us all dumber. This is not a liberal/conservative thing.	<p>What you do isn‚Äôt heroic. Why are you trying to act like you‚Äôre even in the same league?</p>	<p>What a bunch of morons.</p>

Are we not gonna mention that magic Johnson is just as big a piece of shit as all these scumbag politicians?	<p>I&#39;ve said it before, I&#39;ll say it again, he has more stopping power than nearly anyone else in the executive branch and that just ain&#39;t right. To be entirely honest, the abilities of majority leaders need to be heavily reconsidered. The ability to singlehandedly deny a bill without a vote on behalf of your party <em>without even letting them voice their own, individual opinions</em> is just plain wrong. </p>	<p>This is why the left loves trump so much: he is just as much a hypocrite as the right loves to say.</p>
She could easily get more work if she was willing to show them tits.. but she thinks too high of herself and judging by her stances, she can eat shit	The Left ~~loves~~ *depends* on people like her to rile their base up.  HuffPo and Vox report on her every utterance.  If they can't mine Trump for material, people like her are the next best thing.  Anything to distract from the disaster the current administration is.	<p>If you have a problem with a woman who dresses like a slut and gets dirty, you can call her a slut because she acts like one.</p>

I agree for most of that, but I think there is a higher standard because he‚Äôs a teacher. But that‚Äôs just another belief, so I guess if you want your teachers to be openly discriminatory, that‚Äôs fine.	Education certainly needs some reform, but we shouldn't be limiting the potential of high achievers in order to keep under achievers from falling further behind. Segregated classes based on material comprehension and cognitive ability is the best overall solution.	<p>I also think the education system should be more open to students. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an overly broad definition, but I think it should be open to discussion. If you want to argue with someone who disagrees with you, you can argue with them. But if you want someone to argue you disagree with them, you have to agree with them.</p>

Yes, for example Michael Brown was unarmed, but a big guy and was charging at a police officer like a linebacker.

In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption. This is the result of the confluence of these two facts.  There is no lack of a free market here, and there is no lack of private ownership. This corporation is working *within* the system here. This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	<p>However, I agree with you that corporations should not have the same constitutional rights as real people. Given the loss of individual share-holders and their replacement by mutual funds (to say nothing of the institutional investors--banks, BlackRock, etc.) they are more able to do as they please because most retail investors have lost their voices because it is the fund managers that have the right to speak. People own shares of the fund, not technically shares of companies that the fund owns.</p>	<p>The government can force private business to provide services, but private business can do whatever they want. No government entity can force businesses to do business, no government can impose mandates, no private business could force a business to do something that makes no sense to consumers.</p>

Then you were also told that they were less effective against the new variants you and your lot gave a fertile breeding ground to, but you just tune that out.	This goes for both ways = becoming infected or infecting others. While wearing something period does help reduce it, it's no wonder that people think they are inneffective because they really don't understand basic science.	<p>But if you‚Äôre in a position where you can‚Äôt do anything about it, then you are better off ignoring the obvious consequences of the situation.  You‚Äôd be better served ignoring the real consequences of this situation and instead concentrating your efforts on mitigating the negative effects of this scenario.  Which is why I‚Äôm recommending that you ignore the real outcomes of this case and instead focus on the real impacts of the case.  Let me use an example from another perspective:

I was just pointing out that Democrats were once the more Conservative party, while at their inception Republicans were the more progressive party. I don‚Äôt think 100 years ago the south was a bastion of progressive thinking. Democrats just matched up better with a more conservative way of thinking at the time. I think politicians on both sides are mostly self serving garbage today, but this post doesn‚Äôt paint the full picture of the political landscape during those times.	<p>Hmm that‚Äôs weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes. Their successors as well, are Democrats.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t think it was a coincidence that the late 1990s happened so that the Democratic party shifted to a more centrist leaning, while the Republicans went full-tilt moonbat. I think it also was a good thing for the party to have a centrist party in the mid 1990s, since that party was more in control of the state and local government than the GOP at that time. If you look at the current state of politics, the Democratic Party has shifted to more centrist, centrist, and populist leaning, and the Democratic ticket has been more in line with that.</p>

I also think he overestimates the danger to the public and overestimates his own risk to himself and to others.</p>
But the vaccine doesn't actually stop the spread. You transmit it just the same.	1) the vaccine does not keep you from getting the virus	<p>The vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop the spread of COVID.  The only way to stop it is to make it easier for infected people to get the vaccine.</p>
Ever consider that conservative opinions might just not be that popular in those places?  Like, how do you even come to the conclusion that a Pok√©mon group is political?  Like wtf lol.  It's Pok√©mon.	<p>At this point I&#39;d rather give my money to another country.  If the current Liberal companies failed perhaps some neutral companies could rise to power and we could support them.  I&#39;m not necessarily saying go support China, but what&#39;s wrong with South Korea?</p>	<p>But why do you think that conservatives should be so afraid of minorities? Why do you want to be scared of people who don&#39;t like their ethnicity?</p>

INB4 the black crime rate drops significantly 15 years from now "coincidentally."	The new figures come as the Cuomo administration has been forced in recent weeks to acknowledge i t has been underreporting the overall number of COVID-19 deaths among long-term care residents. It is now nearly 15,000 up from the 8,500 previously disclosed.‚Äù</p>	<p>If you&#39;re not a black person, you are significantly less likely to die from Covid than if you were a white person.</p>

The whole reddit drama swirling revolves around him not properly representing their movement (which has its merits). So I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre talking about	<p>It&#39;s disappointing to see so much preoccupation with owning the libs over making an actual point. I don&#39;t know what the right thing here is but the whole controversy seems stupid from the sidelines.</p>	<p>I am not sure what you‚Äôre talking about here.  But I‚Äôm sure you are confused.  I just don‚Äôt understand why people make such critical judgments about this man.  You‚Äôve never met him.  Do you understand what that is?</p>

Lol, slippery slope fallacy right in a headline. You dipshits are all emotional babies	<p>Infants, all of them.  Scary thing is, they are infants with power.........</p>	<p>It&#39;s like they all went into the same place and got emotional.  We all know that, but the reality is, we all went in a direction most people didn&#37;t want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we were too stupid to follow the rules.  And we were later told we weren&#38;t stupid enough to follow them.  So we went with the rules and we were then criticized for being too stupid and stupid to realize that.  </p>

16 year old gonna go to prison and get his ass raped. His money will do a lot of good then.	Also that's rich coming from someone who locked up over 1000 people for minor drug offences, most of whom were people of colour. Didn't she also actively try to block a bill 2014 that would allow non-violent prisoners from being released early and instead wanted to keep them in prison to be used as cheap labor?	<p>If you are a millionaire you should be punished.  If you profit from these crimes then you should pay a ton of tax to help the rich.  </p>
Do you NPCs still think 3000$ worth of Russian trolling on Facebook is the reason Trump won in 2016?	But basically every major social media company confirmed that their platforms had been used in a massive Russian disinformation cyber campaign in an effort to support Trump's 2016 bid. Then multiple intelligence agencies corroborated that claim. So there was some bite that that accusation. I don't think that was the final straw though, was it? Wasn't it the Trump Tower meeting that really ""lit the flame,"" to quote the soon to be party-less Liz Cheney?	<p>I wonder if the fake news that spread on social media and led to the election was just a coincidence that the fake story spread around the internet about how Trump won?</p>
Breitbart is kind of like dog shit. If you're around it enough, some will get on you.	<p>Now the idea is make a phrase like &quot;meritocracy&quot; a dogwhistle to dismiss anybody who uses it as falling victim to propaganda and shit. When really we are just speaking, but they hear their own projected dog whistles.</p>	<p>This subreddit is kind of like a dog catcher. If you say something offensive, it gets posted on this sub so that you can all pat eachother on the back and say things like &quot;okay I guess I can&#39;t believe this is what I said when I asked questions.</p>
True, but who was the last real well meaning, honest, republican official see anywhere near the oval office? When was the last democrat? Each side is so vile towards the other that they're bringing out the worst of one another. America's 4 year presidential election is a total farce and its only propagated through media blinding everyone else to the fact that our government needs reformation and every year we wait is furthering us towards the path of actual civil war. If not some disgusting capitalist dystopian reality where 90% of the population will suffer to pamper the top 10%	<p>You think everyone is against you to the extent that you think I&#39;m a Democrat: mate, I&#39;m not even American. What you attribute to them is exactly what just happened over the past four years, a country burning with an attempted coup and half a million dead because of covid, a 9/11 every single day. That&#39;s an embarrassment.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but overall I hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He also did a really bad job at distributing supplies and distributing needed Nationally needed supplies. He was also a terrible politician, so I guess that was his problem. But he also had a good track record of voting in line with my interests (not perfect, but pretty darn good). He also had the audacity to say that the government should ban 1A paraphenalia outside of the bounds

Is a sub full of people that don‚Äôt believe in masks or vaccines upset someone removed their mask for a picture? HOLD THE FUCKING PRESSES! this is much worse than your emperor telling you all not to get vaccinated while getting as vaccinated as possible and watching his idiot followers slowly die. But yeah you are all right, her and every single one of you should be wearing a mask.	<p>They want him to take down everything that they disagree with from his social media account, not post as much because they don‚Äôt like his politics, and they want to send him to a re-education camp.  My goodness, the left is psychotic.  Not only do they not live in reality they have no decency at all.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not saying that everyone should get the vaccine, but I do think that it&#37;s ridiculous to pretend that everyone who gets the vaccine is healthy and gets the disease as soon as they get it. It&#38;s absurd to pretend otherwise, and to pretend the entire population of the United States is fine and healthy and all that shit.</p>
But BLM isn‚Äôt the fucking president of the United States dude.	<p>Honestly we dont even know if Trump wants to be President.</p>	<p>President Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the president of the United States.</p>
If a white homeowner kills a white intruder is it a racial based killing? Of course not. So it‚Äôs a false equivalence to say that a white police officer targeting a black person because of their genetics is the same as ‚Äúblack on black crime‚Äù	<p>We of course had the Narragansetts and the Mohegans team up with the English to completely annihilate the Pequot Trible. There literally is no Pequot Tribe. The people who made a fraudulent claim on the flimsiest of evidence to be Pequots in order to open a bingo hall and later a casino were actually white people. The dark-skinned people brought in later on are ethnically black people with a small amount of Narragansett in them. So ultimately, the descendants of those who committed genocide against the Pequot tribe are now operating a casino in their name. This was all documented in a book written by Jeff Benedict, the same guy who wrote the &quot;Little Pink House&quot; book about Kelo vs New London.  </p>	<p>If you want to argue that the murder of a black person is justified because it was a racial issue, then you need to back up your argument with a factual source. The murder of an unarmed black person isn&#39;t justified because the person is black, but because the offender is white. </p>
I‚Äôm not the guy who is pro-Nazi here	Dont believe racial privilege exists	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I am not a puritan. I don&#37;t think he was a great leader, I don't think he would have been one of the best at leadership if he had been able to lead the charge against Hitler.</p>

Is there any place that can be called heaven on earth in terms of safety? In comparison with the USA, Germany is the safest place ever. I'd rather have a lunatic carrying a knife than a crazed gunman.	Amnesty would be the best thing for these windbags because they&#39;d be able to accomplish many of their goals in one fell swoop. And stop me if you think for one second that the Democrat calculation is any different.</p>	<p>If it was the Taliban, there would be no reason to think that the US would be a better place to have a terrorist group in the first place.

They vote for the party that constantly promises them a utopia of free shit but never delivers... guess you're saying most minorities are too dumb to vote for anything that actually benefits them?	I‚Äôve never met a republican who wants to get rid of that pesky black vote, and yet if you listen to democrats, you‚Äôd think every one of us is clamoring to disenfranchise anyone with dark skin.  No, we just want secure elections. And since your voters do too, the only possible reason you have to oppose common sense measures like Voter ID is that you personally benefit from the current system.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He absolutely HATE it when people say &quot;yes, the government can ban paraphernalytics outside the law, but the vast majority of people who support 2A are just mildly anti-establishment, generally anti-gun, and anti-mask, anti-vaxxers.</p>
Democrats are still committing genocide and eugenics on the black population.  No I think nothing has changed actually.	<p>This is no accident. Democrats have been finding ways to keep minorities enslaved since the antebellum days. That&#39;s why they refuse to reform the school to prison pipeline and it&#39;s also why they&#39;re so afraid of &quot;black white supremacist&quot; Larry Elder.</p>	<p>Also, why do we continue to blame white supremacists for the genocide of black people?</p>
> I'll bet they don't force car owners to carry liability.  You're joking, right? Doesn't every state require a minimum level of insurance?  I know Georgia and Florida do.	<p>The notion that a citizen should need a document from the government, a permit, to exercise his rights is not one traditionally associated with conservatism. Universal identification wasn&#39;t even a thing until quite recently. You do not need a driver&#39;s license, state or local identification document, a social security number to be an American Citizen entitled to all rights and privileges. It is not charged to you to prove your identity and citizenship to claim your rights. It is charged to the government the responsibility to disprove your citizenship to deny you the rights of a citizen.</p>	<p>But I&#39;m not going to assume that the intention of the constitution is to prevent the establishment of a state with virtually no independent check and balance (although I do assume that there&#59;s a limit to how much a person can be held responsible for their actions). </p>
Touch grass, fella. This is a very conspiratorial mindset.	<p>here is a scourge</p>	<p>This is a very delicate subject.</p>
Well if approached with the idea to do it he certainly wouldn't say no. One thing we know for sure is that the guy cares more about his own wealth and power than he does about anything else.	<p>I don‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs a bad guy, but you won‚Äôt see a better example of what fame and power can do to someone in such a short period than Fauci.</p>	<p>But I don&#39;t think it would be wise to take someone with such wealth and power for granted.</p>

Hispanic dude stumbled upon a guy raping his little girl (in Texas) he beat the guy to death and was not charged.	They burned rioted and looted over the death of a guy who died of a drug overdose where the cop followed his training. Doesn't matter. Scorched earth	<p>He was caught on camera beating a woman. He also sexually assaulted another woman. I don&#39;t know how he did it, but I think it was stupid of him to try to make light of it.</p>
Honestly, it's just a policy to demand responsibility from their own supporters.  Not alot of conservative men abandoning their children out there.   It's basically saying, "man, liberal women can't kill their babies anymore...we better make sure the soy boys they mercy fucked man up and pay for their progeny. That'll show those conservatards."	<p>I understand why you deflect though. Cruz is at the very bottom of the barrel of leadership. He supports seditionists and domestic terrorists out of political expediency. He let Trump call his wife ugly because god forbid he upset the knuckle-dragging mob. </p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I do think he should have been pushed out of the GOP. I also think he&#37;d have been a better leader if he had stayed out of politics. I think he would have been one of the better leaders to push the agenda, but instead he chose to ignore the real issues and instead focus on the people. I don&#38;t think he could have done better than his current generation.</p>
He is an identifiable chode for sure.	<p>It all makes sense.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs all about the chode.</p>
Because male Circumcision has none of the negative bodily effects that female circumcision does AND has long term health benefits especially around STD transmission.   Comparing that and hacking women apart for Allah is absurd.	In light of current narrative that the jab has basically no side effects (at least that are allowed to be talked about lest it lead to ""vaccine hesitancy""), It's hilarious to watch drug commercials and their inevitable list of horrific side effects that often include death and several other things much worse then the thing they purport to help symptoms of.	<p>The same goes for the &quot;transphobia&quot:  But there is no evidence that transphobia is a negative side effect of the vaccine.  There is no scientific data on the true true number of trans people.  So if you want to make a claim about transgender people being safe, good for you, it&#39;s a claim you make based purely on your ethnicity and not on the actual facts of the case. </p>
AOC eating outside on a vacation during the holidays isn‚Äôt the same as Cruz fleeing during a snow storm power outage.	<p>Not to mention you shouldn&#39;t <em>need</em> to worry that you&#39;re going to get stranded on 95, at least not with &lt;1&#39; of snow that&#39;s not in the middle of the night on a holiday. Ain&#39;t exactly like a nor&#39;easter came and dropped 2&#39; on them over a span of 4 hours, and ain&#39;t like they&#39;re on some podunk road through the mountains.</p>	<p>And taking a vacation during a snow storm is not the same as taking a plane ride during a winter storm.  A group of people who have already evacuated for the holidays doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to return.</p>
You, sir or madam, have hit the nail ON THE HEAD..  I think we have some /r/politics slime leaking over here as you've been downvoted (currently a -5).	<p>Rittenhouse is getting a guilty verdict‚Ä¶..people are scared‚Ä¶.mob rules‚Ä¶.we lost the justice system. I pray I‚Äôm wrong.</p>	<p>Shut the fuck up, moron. Go get banned from more subreddits for being a whiney incel lol</p>
It gives me more immunity than a vaccine.  Do you own stock in Pfizer?	‚ÄúCitadel‚Äôs investment in Regeneron is a tiny fraction of its overall $39 billion in investments, but if the stock price were to go up, Citadel would benefit. DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw points out that Citadel has far greater investments in Moderna and Pfizer, which manufactureCOVID-19 vaccines.‚Äù	<p>The vaccines do more harm than good. They give more immunity than the unvaccinated.</p>
>where they literally kill to provide for themselves   I'm sorry what? Does Chicago have a hitman epidemic these days?  This is the problem with these conversations. Both sides clearly have zero experience in black communities and have no clue what they're talking about.	<p>So knowing how much these POS Chicago politicians hate the cops, why on earth would they expect anything remotely cooperative from the police force. Effing mind boggling.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.  He was absolutely a menace to society and did not deserve to be in jail.  It is shameful when things like this get posted on this sub so that you can all pat eachother on the back and say things like &quot;Fuck Trump, the left is a menace!&quot
Considering you're just shouting insults and have no factual information or sources for your claims, you're just an idiot. It was probably better for you to leave before you showed just how much if a snowflake you really are.	<p>That statue was gaudy and ridiculous. Nobody worshipped it, you need to get over that idea because it‚Äôs making you look ridiculous.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs a shame you didn‚Äôt take the time to actually answer a question, because then you‚Äôre just a whiney incel lol</p>
Because they've lost in all the lower courts.  Even with conservative judges.  He lost because conservatives like me voted him out.	We lost the run offs because of the fraud (as true as it might be) narrative and people like Lin Wood, perdues race we should‚Äôve won by suddenly 250,000 republicans decided not to vote.</p>	<p>He lost because of all the things he did in office, including the impeachment of a sitting president and the handling of the criminal case against two of his closest allies.  </p>

K and what about all the crimes Trump and his administration committed?   You voted for a man who said he would fuck his daughter, lies to your faces and commits crime all the time..   He tried to over throw the government.. Stormed the capital.   Black people were mad about police killing them. Antifa was implemented and formed to stop the governments from fucking over it's citizens.   Turn of the fucking tv and actually read something or interact with a human in real life you dumb asshole.	Than Biden hid away during the election,  after his VP called him a racist.  Meanwhile,  the media is feeding idiots that Trump is killing everyone while saying Cuomo is the real president this country needs.  Meanwhile Cuomo is the one killing folks....	<p>Now imagine what would have happened if BLM hadn&#39;t been a movement. What would have been happening if BLM had not been a violent, destructive, and demoralizing movement that led to the storming of the capitol? What would be happening if they had taken over the city? What if they were going to use BLM as an excuse to storm and terrorize the capital? What an insane idea. What if BLM were just a movement? What a bunch of malarkey.</p>
Be interesting to see the discrepancies in access to birth control and other contraceptives in minority groups versus non minorities... Might just explain that abortion discrepancy.	<p>Not all republicans are against <em>all</em> abortions. I, for example, think there are cases to be made for rape victims and dangerous pregnancies. My issue is with people having their right to live violated as a matter of convenience for irresponsible people who don‚Äôt want to deal with the consequences of their own actions.</p>	<p>Also, you can see the difference in the rates of abortions among people who have no risk factors for covid, and those who do have risk factors are likely to be more at risk from covid than those who don‚Äôt. </p>
It makes sense. Everything she says or does is meant to be a snap back that losers on /r/politics will eat up.	The Left ~~loves~~ *depends* on people like her to rile their base up.  HuffPo and Vox report on her every utterance.  If they can't mine Trump for material, people like her are the next best thing.  Anything to distract from the disaster the current administration is.	<p>Edit: I meant &quot;shutting down conservative voices&quot#39; because they are toxic and demoralizing, not just because they support Trump but because they want to destroy democracy.</p>

I don‚Äôt agree. And honestly you missed the second part of my comment which was even the praise is on outward appearances. Good, smart women are being whittled down to how clean and pretty they look. Most girls that are pretty know it and would much rather have a compliment that praises their intelligence.  So that being said, I think we agree that it doesn‚Äôt take 1,000,000 to praise or insult somebody. Good roasts are concise. And cartoons are lazy and hyperbolic. And hyperboles are weak.  If you have to be creative to deliver a burn then you‚Äôve already lost.	<p>Thing is, I don&#39;t care if Liz Cheney is cancelled.  Good riddance. She was actually somewhat effective so it leaves the GOP weaker than before, great.  It&#39;s the wonderful lack of self awareness that I&#39;m here for.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t agree with that comment, however I do think it is a great idea to try to make an example out of someone who is not a straight up racist. Especially someone who has been through a tough experience and is clearly capable of being a good person, that is something that shouldn&#37;t be a problem. Especially if you are a woman and want to be a leader, that seems like a good idea.  You can make a virtue of not being racist, but you can also be a hypocrite and attempt to legislate your rights away for others.</p>
Plus the lawyer just said he had performed community service. It sounds like he never offered proof, nor did the judge ask for it. I've seen the lawyers lie many times to get low bail. "Your honor, he is supporting his wife and 3 children. He has a fulltime job. He has lived in the same community since birth." The reality is something like this. He is single. He is a fulltime freelance drug dealer. He just arrived last month from south Chicago.	<p>I&#39;m saying that there is a double standard. The media and left bring up firearms at the rights peaceful protest, yet all summer there were hardly any mentions about the left&#39;s terrorism all summer including using class 3 destructive devices, which require a background check, submitted fingerprints, a federal form and a tax stamp to own. It&#39;s a felony to make and a felony to own one.</p>	<p>He&#39;s been out of work for almost a year now and has no family at all. If you look at his social media bio, you see that he has a wife and kids. He has a good job and is single. His wife has a dog. His kids have a dog and a dog too. He is out doing his job. He lives in California with his wife and two kids. </p>
They are too busy deep throating the boot to respond.	<p>I actually disagree with this vehemently.  His administration is certainly full of incompetent scumbags, however to be a scumbag requires intent and intent requires cognitive ability. Joe ain&#39;t got none of that.</p>	<p>They‚Äôre too busy beating you to submission.</p>
I don‚Äôt know about you, but low IQ is a total turn off for me ü§Æ	<p>Ignoring these cases is a display of total disregard for humanity. Yes, they are a minority, but yes, they do happen.	<p>Low IQ is a huge problem for a number of reasons. Basic common sense tells me that low IQ is more of an issue than high intelligence.</p>

I don&#39;t know how you manage to do that, but it&#40;s hilarious.</p>
Their goals are not similar - the trans activist's goal is to normalise the worst kind of gay conversion therapy.	<p>It&#39;s just reality that gay people are born gay. What a gay person does in their bedroom is completely irrelevant and none of your concern. So you shouldn&#39;t have an opinion either way. Just treat people with human decency. Conservative values also don&#39;t dictate that we shit on and judge people for things they have no control over. Stop being ignorant. There&#39;s a difference between the lgbt &quot;community&quot; which is political and being an lgbt person, which is just something you&#39;re born as.</p>	<p>The gay rights movement isn&#39;t about equality. It&#37;s about redefining what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. That&#38;s what the left is trying to do with these neo-Marxist brigades. They&#40;re trying to redefine what equality looks like by redefining it as something that should be illegal and morally objectable. </p>

Top comment death threats for those with differing views? What a beacon of reason and tolerance this shitshow of a sub is.	<p>They don&#39;t.

She is a conspiracy theorist though, even mentioned crisis actors in the past and other outlandish shit. Just because she is conservative, doesn't mean she is worthy of defense. You guys latch on to ANYONE with that tag and it will hurt the party in the end. There are people on both sides that need criticized.	<p>Voters in the other hand might punish the party and if they do, they will loose some seats, but it wont be deadly for them, they will spin and spin and spin.</p>	<p>She is also a notorious liar and a hypocrite. She has been called a &quot;conspiracy expert&quot#39; by a number of conservatives who believe in conspiracy theories. She is also known for being a straight up liar, which is a huge problem for conservatives. If you want to make an example out of her, you can do so by calling her a liar and calling her an anti-vaxxer. </p>

The election was stolen on a massive scale and it was a clear cover up! He let the American people down	<p>This isn‚Äôt the America I grew up in. Corrupt federal thieves ripping off security deposit boxes, dropping charges for the left, heaping charges at anyone on the right. Political intimidation, corruption beyond belief, pedophiles among their ranks. un-American liberal socialists, marxist supporting ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù.</p>	<p>That&#39;s a massive lie. It was blatantly dishonest and politicized by the corrupt establishment and their allies at the highest levels of government. It also blatantly ignored the fact that the election was stolen by terrorists. </p>
Crazy how all those Fox News media members had direct access to the Trump Cabinet, but I guess MeDiA is only liberal in nature.	<p>I also don&#39;t think you can call the Biden coalition a populist movement. The average is better educated and richer than the average Trump voter. Plus populist movements like the Trump movement, at least in their rhetoric, do not ally themselves with big businesses. I&#39;d categorize the current movement within the Democratic party as a reactionary anti-populist movement. While Trumpism is pretty clearly an anti-establishment populist movement.</p>	<p>It&#39;s crazy how you can say that Trump hired a woman who was hired because she was a liberal. I mean, she hired a guy who was a straight up liberal and she was hired by a liberal to run a conservative propaganda machine. And she was fired because she criticized Trump for not having a job.</p>
Thats great, fuck this cunt!	You‚Äôre right, totally disgusting.	<p>Fuck this stupid bitch!</p>
Yeah we know. Gerrymandering overall is bad. We are noting the hypocrisy from our ‚Äúvirtuous‚Äù friends on the other side. Why can‚Äôt we just call it out without ‚Äúbu-bu-but what about republicans.‚Äù	<p>Your comment that if republicans would act like dems you would get stuff done reminds me of common things said on the left. That republicans play dirty and if dems would play dirty we would get stuff done. This attitude is bad imo. We should be mad at our own parties for not being fair, not try to constantly find fault with the other party.</p>	<p>I think this is a really bad thing for republicans, and for the democrats as a whole. I don&#39;t think they realize how much of a hypocrite they are, but they are still willing to do the dirty work.</p>
Eventually there could be no actual women in women‚Äôs sport.	PA: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt happen that often, so I couldn‚Äôt say because the woman decides. It‚Äôs not even viable‚Äù [deflection]	<p>The point is, no one will ever look at women‚Äôs sports again. They‚Äôll never look at men again.</p>
in your mind it is...People that talk in absolutes really have no idea what else is out there. Are you the type that complains about your girl/guy(whatever) that they 'never' take you anywhere or the  'always' ignore you? Your hatred for the 'left' is making you a bit blind to reality	<p>What I hate more than anything about this topic, my own opinion aside, is people who pretend it‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs anything but. You‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion, and to argue your points, but people need to stop pretending this is simple; it just kills all <em>actual</em> discussion that everyone else is actually having.</p>	<p>You&#39;re wrong.  You don&#38;t realize what you are talking about.  Do you really think your opinion is irrelevant?  You probably think your opinions are irrelevant because you&#37;re just an overly sensitive, opinionated, and opinionated person.  I think you probably think yourself to be a whiny, inept, delicate, delicate humorless puritan who likes to make things up for you in a sea of irreverent humor.</p>
So what, is it a slippery slope sort of thing? Or is it that communists in particular are stupid for thinking their ideology would help them and it will inevitably end in fascism?  Or is it suggesting the modern transgender liberal with their crazy hair is a stupid communist?  It kind of just seems like it's a little all over the place. Which is funny, because usually political comics are so bash you over the head simplistic that they aren't thought provoking or interesting. Basically boomer humor.	<p>I don&#39;t always start arguments over the crappy leftist propaganda that &quot;feels good&quot;. But I got real pissed when she retweeted a post saying cancel culture didn&#39;t exist because they deserve it.... which is both logically self contradictory and absolutely stupid.</p>	<p>It&#39;s not as much that the left is psychotic as it is that it is psychotic that they want to destroy democracy.  What they really want is to destroy capitalism, destroy democracy, and destroy democracy.</p>
Your mom	Thats the quote from her aunt	<p>Your mom</p>
The guy in charge of the company that bought Young‚Äôs music was previously an employee at Pfizer, take away what you will with that	<p>McDonald&#39;s franchise owners are forced to buy mcflurry machines from a single outside contractor (that a McDonald&#39;s executive owns a stake in). If the machine breaks, the franchise owner has to go through the one company because diagnosis and repair of the machines is &quot;protected&quot; as &quot;ip,&quot; oh and they break a lot, so you&#39;re calling out technicians to basically turn a screw that you need a specific flow chart to find.</p>	<p>He was also a Pfizer Vice President and CEO at the time. I don&#39;t know how Pfizer handled it, but I know what he did with his new position.</p>
He has been far right since he was unrepentant and irreverently objective on his opinion  on Islam.	he's saying the entire process is purely political rather than merit based, and he's 100% correct.	<p>Edit: it&#39;s a shame he&#37;s been proven wrong by being a straight up liar and a hypocrite. He was also a menace to society. I&#38;m glad he is gone.</p>
This was supposed to be a march on parliament but there is barely anyone there. Most of these people have gone home but the ones who stay honk horns all night long, block roadways. The only people suffering are those trying not to get involved.	<p>That&#39;s why I stay away from public.  I&#39;m on the edge.  I can see it in others too.  Can&#39;t even drive a few miles to the store without exchanging words with other drivers.</p>	<p>The only people who have been indicted on the charges are those that didn‚Äôt show up at the election.  Those people that have been charged with crimes such as rape, assault, and torture are those who refuse to let the election be decided.</p>
I mean, he said that very recently. And I think it‚Äôs fair to say the majority of antivax is right leaning.	It goes with being on the ‚Äúright side of history‚Äù an all!</p>	<p>I&#39;m guessing you have an anecdotal story about how vaccinated people are getting more and more sick and unvaccinated. I&#59;m also guessing it was some form of covid that got passed around in the US. </p>
Yes, hoping that someone is on a collapsing bridge is in no way wishing serious harm/death üôÑ	Pretty sure ""loving thy neighbor"" includes not exposing them to contagious and potentially deadly illnesses due to one's own ignorance and fear.	<p>A person attempting to climb a bridge is in no way going to be able to escape.</p>
Trump was impeached for being accused of abandoning our best friend, Ukraine. If Trump was Biden, he'd be impeached again. Democrats and leftists have no convictions.	<p>I was saying that if this LT Col came out with a video against Trump, the left would herald him as a national treasure and call for impeachment for him being jailed.  But because he put out a video against the disastrous failure of the Afghanistan withdrawal, which goes against the left and Biden there is no (or little) coverage of it and non one is calling for anything...</p>	<p>I&#39;m also not sure why the Democrats would want to impeach Trump when they have no legitimate reason to do so.  I think it just shows how politicized and politicized the matter is.</p>
For some, every and each live is sacred, removing one is God‚Äôs privilege and it‚Äôs a sin to act otherwise.  I‚Äôd just like to know if they keep to these principles, and if not, where they draw a line.	<p>Personally, I am against recreational sex outside of marriage because of religious reasons. However, people have the right to do this if they want to. But, with every right comes a responsibility. They are on the line for the consequences of their decision, including the possibility of disease and pregnancy.</p>	<p>If you believe there is a separation of church and state, that is a sin. If you don‚Äôt, then you‚Äôre not a Christian. I‚Äôm not a religious, but I do believe that there should be separation. If not, then there is separation of Church and State. It‚Äôs a separation that I believe to be correct, but it‚Äôd be a shame if it meant that you had to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù as part of the separation. </p>

Well look at the recent polls, and I mean proper polls, not Twitter or online polls. Most don‚Äôt agree with the trucker protest and especially not the residents of Ottawa.	<p>Have noticed that there are almost no stories on /politics about her, which is tacit acknowledgement that NO ONE likes her, not even most democrats. Still kind of pissed she got shoved in the VP role despite voters rejection of her (on both sides of the aisle).</p>	<p>But I don&#39;t think there are any decent dems on this sub who actually care about the election results. If you want to see the real world, you need to look at the polling places. There are a lot of legitimate reasons for people to not care about these elections. The vast majority of people on these sub either don &quot;t care about them, or don& #39;#39%;t care at all about the actual results. They care about their own feelings and that&#

Probably none because women and immigrants&#39; rights are only important when it&#39;s convenient.</p>	<p>She is a hypocrite, a sexist, a racist, and a sexist. She is also known for being a straight up bitch, and for being an overly sensitive person. I am sure you find it funny when she says things like &quot;I am so mad at her&quot:</p>

Vaxed people can spread the virus as well. So everyone vaxed or not can kill people. Kinda drops the extremely small chance even more.	<p>Two, along the same line, the virus wants to &quot;live&quot; so it becomes more contagious, and because it wants to live, it doesn&#39;t want to kill the host.

I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..   Some of the toughest, kindest family oriented people.  One woman legally got into the United States left her children in Honduras and for the next 8 years saved every fucking penny she could raising 60k and getting her children into the states just so they could work in motels cleaning up after people that have no respect, accuse them of being illegal.   I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump... Is a criminal that has admitted multiple times he wants to fuck his daughter, he lies, he belittles everyone, he doesn't pay his taxes, he's stuck up... Does that man look like someone who's bled red for his country... This is the mother fucker who built a casino called it the Taj Mahal Trump and went bankrupt his daddy had to bail him out. He has terrible ideas when it comes to investment. Remember this.. He's doesn't give a fuck about anyone. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION... HE LIKES YOUR FUCKING MONEY.   Wake up.   Joe Biden is gross to, he's boring and old and gets nothing done. Our political system is failing on BOTH sides.   The dems and reps of this country need to stop fighting each other and figure it out. The whole world is watching us and laughing. We are getting dicked.   The fuck are you worrying about a wall for... Look at the inside of your country.

Let‚Äôs for the sake of argument he didn‚Äôt pay taxes (it‚Äôs laughable but whatever). Should he feel bad when our tax dollars are being spent on shit like this?

I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs not much.	<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not hemming and hawwing over his income tax bill, but your understanding of the situation is just as flawed as Liberals who think 750 is the result of some criminal nonsense.</p>	<p>So, taxes. Why do you think the government needs to pay taxes when you don&#39;t pay them? Why do we need taxes when it isn&#37;t the federal government? Why aren&#38;t we paying taxes?</p>

To be fair I've seen headlines here like "Liberals are 10x more likely to have mental illnesd" and just the other day there was a stickied one about how male feminists have ED in higher numbers compared to normal dudes.	The CDC says the Covid survival rate of the vaccinated is 99.99%. They also say the death rate of the unvaccinated is 25x higher. What‚Äôs 25x.01. So the unvaccinated survival rate is 99.75%. If we look at total cases and do the math from the Covid deaths.  It comes out to a death rate of 1.6%. Israel the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world is hitting record numbers of Covid. 80% of hospitalized cases of Covid have been obese people. 86% of Covid deaths had underlying health issues such as cancer,pneumonia, respiratory problems. If you‚Äôre young and healthy there is no point.   So let‚Äôs take away 86% of people who died with serious underlying health issues you‚Äôll  end with 561,218 so 652,480 a 561,218 you get 91,262 as total deaths. So if you‚Äôre healthy  you have a death rate of .23%. Let‚Äôs also not forget a mass majority of Covid deaths are 55+ in age. Simply math.</p>	<p>Also, don&#39;t you think the average age of men who are obese is 10 times more likely to be obese than those who are not obese?</p>

Who watches TV period anymore, it's all just black people, gays, race mixing, and strong empowered wamens in your face	I watched countless live streams (not biased news), but actual live streams, and they were absolutely filled with looters, rioters, and people being brutally beaten in the street.  If you think all this rhetoric: ""underserved communities"", ""equitable zoning"", ""racial inequities"", ""marginalized communities"", ""invest in historically Black colleges and universities"", ""distribute economic relief and health-care resources to communities of color""... is anything less than pandering, then I don't know what to tell you.	<p>But you&#39;re not the only black face on the news.

Since no one is actually responding with the truth, it looks like they're still investigating: https://abcnews.go.com/US/gaetz-associate-joel-greenberg-agrees-pay-seminole-county/story?id=81753877  The investigation is ongoing and they've delayed the sentencing of his friend that is cooperating twice.	<p>And mind you, something people keep forgetting, this case was COVERED UP, and wasn&#39;t uncovered till months later.

If you&#39;re not familiar with the case, why haven&#37;t you been asking questions?  Do you know how many people have been charged with crimes?

You deny the affects of economical impact on a child&#39;s life, saying that familial wealth has nothing to do with a child&#39;s success.</p>	<p>The question is whether pornography is morally acceptable. If pornography is acceptable, then pornography should be illegal. But pornography should not be allowed in public. </p>

For players whose teams don‚Äôt really have a chance at a medal (USA, Canada, Russia, and maybe Finland and Sweden), that‚Äôs a huge risk (plus the risk of injury) for very little gain. The NHL is trying to further dissuade participation by not paying players quarantined in China. It would be spectacular if a US/Canada-based group organized a competing hockey tournament here to avoid those restrictions and got the monopoly on NHL talent, which would drive people towards that and legitimize it while giving China and the IOC the farce of an Olympics they deserve.</p>	<p>It was also interesting to hear that he was convicted of molesting a child under the age of 12, and that he served 6 months in prison. That‚Äôs a long term term prison term and a very high risk of a civil war.</p>
I demand that he pick a trans person of color, preferably with blue hair and at least a dozen piercings.  You know - someone who looks like America!	<p>I would posit it&#39;s the same type of thing in lesbian circles where you have people that fill a masculine/male gender role while still being a biological female. Hence, lipstick lesbians and butch lesbians.</p>	<p>&quot;A picture of a woman with a blue check mark on her forehead is required to be circulated in this sub so that it can be seen in the dictionary.</p>

More of the ignorant taking away personal freedoms and trying to foist their warped religious views onto others. Restricting access to a simple medical procedure.... brilliant.	<p>&quot;Awe damn yah chemotherapy goes against our (insert religious ideology) beliefs we can&#39;t cover that for you.&quot;</p>	<p>The idea that if you are vaccinated you pose no risk to others and should have every right to live the same way as you do is a ridiculous notion.  But if you don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated then good for you, it‚Äôs a decision I believe to be correct.</p>
huh TIL the first amendment protects you from your boss disagreeing with how you do your job.   But based on looking at your post history for 5 seconds you prefer your rights being trampled on by the government so your prob happy this guy got fired too right? Government is always correct no?	<p>You shouldn‚Äôt lecture on rioting when your side spent all summer causing $2 billion in damage and killing 25 innocent bystanders, which I‚Äôm positive you supported because ‚Äúits (D)ifferent.‚Äù I disavowed both sets of events. Most leftists can‚Äôt because you are all hypocrites.</p>	<p>This is the kind of thing where you don‚Äôt want the government to do its job, but you‚Äôre free to make up your own mind about it, and if you want to make the tough choices then good for you, that‚Äôs the whole point. But if you dont want to be a part of the government, you can do whatever the hell you want, without being bailed out by big tech companies and big tech. </p>
I got banned on r/movies for congratulating a man for playing bat woman. Can't even give compliments anymore.	<p>You&#39;ve completely neglected to even acknowledge it, so I assume you refused to even watch it.  You&#39;re just OK with child molestation....ya fucking clown.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, I‚Äôve always supported the idea that if you support a woman‚Äôs choice, you don‚Äôt have to support her choice. I dont support a man who dresses like a slut and gets banned for being too close to a girl. That‚Äôd be like saying a woman dresses as a slut. </p>
Came here to say this, carlsen is a freaking moron and defines recreational outrage imo	>Yep. These people are fucking authoritarian shitbirds. They should be shamed as much as possible. It's absurd.	<p>You absolutely HATE this phrase. It&#39;s literally the definition of a whiney incel lol</p>
Ridiculing your political opponents has been tradition since the dawn of politics.  Why political cartoons exist.  If she were a man she would be treated much worse... like Trump.  AOC is a big toothed mare. I'd like to put a saddle on her and ride her.  üòÅ	‚ÄúYour mom still calls me and begs for my tongue, I don't know what to tell her because I only support true conservative patriots but she keeps begging me to spell her name with my tongue in her nono place. I tell her the election was secure and she shouts ""llick me harder"" I tell her Trump is a fraud and she shouts about how she loves to be fucked (she donated to his campaign). I tell her I'm a real military fiscal conservative and all of a sudden she mistakes me for you (I think, because she calls me a bastard piece of shit, so she MUST mean you her little turd child), and then she edges to orgasm and I only allow it if she acknowledges ""conservatives live in a fantasy reality where a grifting piece of fecal matter is more important to us than Jesus christ himself."" She squirts harder than she ever has before. Now she's aligned with universal truths. She sees the election was valid. She starts voting democrat. She publicly denounces her mistake son, Larry. She orgasms. Over and over and over. She loves the newfound freedom of liberalism. Her son Larry is a bastard and she cums all over my actual conservative, Republican tongue.‚Äù	<p>She&#39;s been a millionaire peddling this idea for decades.  I&#37;m tired of the endless wars and endless wars.  She&#38;s one of those people that can&#58;t seem to stop a horse from leaping up and down.  The other side of the coin is that the horse can be trained pretty well.  A horse can do pretty well, but a horse is better than a human.</p>
Their culture is waving the flag of a failed loser rebellion that was more shortlived than obama's presidency? Kinda sad man.	<p>And it hurts their collective soul to see that they officially took the low road to achieve success... only for it to end in failure AND lose the trust of the majority of the American public.</p>	<p>He lost his job, lost his moral compass, and lost his livelihoods. That‚Äôs all I feel towards him. I feel bad for him and his family, but this is not the world we live in anymore. If only we could just follow the lead of our elders and not be trapped like this.</p>
Speaking from a catholic perspective, you are incredibly incorrect üòÇ	<p>That is literally incompatible with a Theocracy.</p>	<p>You are absolutely incorrect.</p>
Which begs the question again, why hasn‚Äôt a single lawsuit gone forward?  Even Trump-appointed judges have thrown them out.	<p>You still haven&#39;t shown a shred of evidence how Trump incited a riot.</p>	<p>Why haven‚Äôt you even looked at it? You‚Äôve never looked at the ‚Äúfact‚Äù that Trump claimed to have made up. It‚Äôs a complete lack of evidence. And you‚Äôre just pointing out that Trump has made up a bunch of baseless claims about the election fraud. </p>
Kill all pedos. Why are we entertaining this madness	<p>.. which begs the question.. DID THEY enter into this &quot;administration&quot; with the intention to destroy everything possible? Utter and complete chaos at every turn? At every decision?</p>	<p>Fuck Biden, the man who might single handedly give power back to Republicans and help destroy democracy</p>
Right, so by you‚Äôre logic you‚Äôre quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can‚Äôt support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it‚Äôs acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It‚Äôs the ‚Äòparents responsibility‚Äô to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they‚Äôll suddenly ‚Äòget it‚Äô and do a good job‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	<p>All it comes down to is does someone think developing humans deserve the same rights as birthed humans. For instance: I think almost everyone would agree it is not morally permissible to kill a developing human the day before its birth. But the baby is still attached to the woman at that point. So the fact that the baby is attached to the woman is not what makes it okay to kill the child. </p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs a good idea to have the baby for 18 months if you‚Äôre financially dependent on someone else for the rest of your life. It‚Äôd be wise to wait a bit longer before you decide if you want the baby. If you don‚Äôt want the child, then you‚Äùll have to wait another 18 months or more before you‚Äçll be able to decide if the baby is healthy or not. </p>
r/Bigfoot too! üòÇüòÇüòÇ I shit you not!	<p>Biggest assclown ever! How he is even remotely relevant is beyond me!</p>	<p>Fucking hilarious!</p>
I wouldn't call this an execution.   But I do call it a bad shoot.	<p>The honest on the other side say they disagree with the terms that this is a justified homicide. </p>	<p>The only ‚Äúwin‚Äù the left can point to is the poor choices made by the left. That‚Äôs not the reality we have anymore.</p>
Trump lost because he was unpopular with the majority of Americans. Downvote me all you want, but you don't get a vote on reality.	<p>Trump was depicted very badly by the media which was partially why he lost. However, he did himself no favor tweeting garbage and saying nonsense. I still remember that first debate with Biden. That turned off a lot of independents voter right off the bat, and him being sick with Covid allowed Biden to opt out of one of the three debates. Biden literally sat in his basement and did not campaign. The Dems would absolutely LOVE to run against Trump. It would make the entire 2024 campaign about Trump (the man/figure) rather than on their far-left policies. </p>	<p>But Trump lost because he was unpopular with the majority of Americans.</p>
Speaking from experience, huh?	>our personal experience	<p>You‚Äôre speaking from experience, right?</p>
Mutual combat challenge accepted	<p>Pass this crap, we have the right to defend ourselves.</p>	<p>A mutual combat challenge accepted</p>
>I agree with Buchanan that the Ukraine isn‚Äôt worth fighting a shooting war with Russia over  Ukraine didn't need our help before we took their nukes away and promised them that we'd protect them in exchange. You're fine with us going back on our promises to protect a country that had the means to protect itself until we took it away? How does that look to all our allies?  Look up the Budapest Memorandum	Trump warned Putin that he was going to bomb Assad's army cause he wouldn't quit gassing his people. He made it clear that it didn't matter to him that Putin was supporting Assad. He just understandably warned Russia since they had some of their army there and Trump didn't want to start a war with Russia over it.	<p>That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so pro-vaxx, and I don‚Äôt want to see the country run into the ground with no nuclear weapons. I‚Äùm free to make up my own mind about both of them, but watching you hypocrites defending the last year riots and crying like you‚Äôve all of a sudden started caring for the government, fucking hilarious.</p>
The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It‚Äôs not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it‚Äôs not a political problem. Get over yourself.	<p>Meanwhile California goes through rolling blackouts on a yearly basis which is somehow still republicans fault because &quot;climate change&quot; even though we have continued to reduce emissions both total and per capita as a country while watching world wide emissions rise from &quot;developing countries&quot; immune to all the of regulations we place on ourselves, essentially we NIMBY pollution to 3rd world countries and accomplish almost nothing for the environment other than making people feel good about &quot;doing something&quot;.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs not as if the government stepped in and said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to build roads, bridges, roads, or bridges because we‚Äôve already built roads.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a lot easier to say that the government decided not to foot the bill for not building roads because they‚Äôll be too expensive. </p>
Wouldn't be your tax dollars if the government fixed the economy (wealth tax on top .1%, ban stock buybacks, etc)	<p>-I said I would restrict voting rights to those who contribute to the country. Tax-payers would be my starting point. What do I mean by &#39;contributing&#39; - for a start if you take more than you give you would not get a vote. An example is if you paid less in taxes than you have received in government assistance you don&#39;t get a vote. Heck I would even entertain taking voting rights away after a certain age. Basically you have to be an active part of the economy to vote.</p>	<p>The government shouldn‚Äôt be taxing the rich.  The government should be taxing corporations, not taxing the poor.  That‚Äôs not what the government is doing. </p>
you self-owned and now look like a fool	Here's where you're just plain/blatantly wrong...	<p>You are a fool.</p>

Yeah, politically back then, I was the same. Was even annoyed at Colin daring to be happy his side won, but still enjoyed his show. He had guests from both sides, they talked, debated, argued, and always kept it light and funny.	You can still talk to people. If they ridicule you, it&#39;s not your fault and hold firm to your beliefs. If they are open-minded and willing to converse peacefully, then that&#39;s a healthy debate opportunity. One of my best friends used to be a believer in socialism and communism and we still got along. Lo and behold though, he is now conservative after making many realizations lol.</p>	<p>I&#39;m happy that Biden is out there doing good, and I am happy that he is returning to normalcy.</p>
I didn‚Äôt say economic downturns had no effect on the poor, I said economic *upswings* have no effect on the poor. Can your neuron spot the difference?	<p>And don‚Äôt think that them crashing the economy only to bail people out isn‚Äôt in their playbook.</p>	<p>The other issue is, do you think that the governments response to the crisis was negative for the rich? No. That‚Äôs not the whole story. The government response was positive for the poor. But the vast majority of the population didn‚Äôt benefit from the crisis.</p>
And yet the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù focus is on locking down to stop the Rona?    We should be locking down abortion clinics instead.	<p>‚ÄúWe are moving from a health system where we have everyone locked down ‚Äì we are going to move to a situation where, to protect the healthcare system, we are going to lock out people who are not vaccinated and can be. If you‚Äôre making the choice not to get vaccinated, then you‚Äôre making the wrong choice‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to be a vaccinated economy. And you get to participate in that‚Äù</p>	<p>Stop trying to shut down abortion clinics!</p>
She is, that's true.	True.	True is.
I doubt they use anything but a 220v hardwired dildo	To be honest, I can't find much of any assertion that God talks about abortion, for or against, in the NT.	<p>I doubt they would have used a conventional heartbeat machine if they had a different heartbeat rate.</p>
This is r/conservative. They'll beleive whatever is most convenient at the time.	<p>I mean from a conservative viewpoint, sure I guess that makes sense.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm conservative, just don‚Äôt feel compelled to vote for someone who isn‚Äôtil after the election.</p>
Am I wrong or didn't trump vote by mail?	<p>When did Trump or any republicans try to cancel free speech?</p>	<p>Are you saying I didn‚Äôt vote by mail?</p>
Yeah, I think it‚Äôs indicative of their low moral standards, lack of fundamental respect for women since genders are apparently not a thing, and just common basic decency.   _:sigh:_ America, ladies and gentlemen.	<p>So stop being a sexist prick and treating women like children. You&#39;re not a good person, you&#39;re a tool masquerading under a false guise of respectability.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was a terrible person, but I do think he was an amazing example of someone who should strive to be better for their family and friends. I also think he made a bad example for himself by not being a straight up Trumper in the first place.</p>
Presidents are elected, not installed. What we have here is a Fuhrer.	<p>The federal government is elected by states and not individuals. </p>	<p>Presidential elections are not executive orders. They are presidential elections.</p>
Transphobia in a /r/Conservative ?  No way...	<p>This logic makes no sense.</p>	<p>You‚Äôre talking about transphobia.  No way.  I‚Äôm not.  </p>
So you are just against the popular vote, and would be fine wothbfair voting districts?	<p>It‚Äôs just trying to score meaningless points for the next election.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he‚Äôs great, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre as likely to see the full swing of the 2020 election as we have seen in the past. I think we just need to focus on the people and not on the numbers. That‚Äôll take a lot more people and a lot less money.</p>
Why bye? Because the party of freedom will ban him? Maybe burn a couple books along the way	<p>Or are you just going to ignore the obvious double standard to defend them?  Don&#39;t get me wrong.. I don&#39;t care that they banned him... but just come out and say they didn&#39;t like him and are banning him, so the government can step in and remove their protections as a platform.</p>	<p>Shut the fuck up, moron. Go get banned from more subreddits for being a whiney incel lol</p>
Wow I can‚Äôt wait for your generation to be dead and gone what a waste of space. Like seriously FUCKING GOOGLE IT!	And this poisonous way of thinking I'm seeing everywhere... This is how we are going to destroy the word ""living"" as we know it... We will just ""exist"" till death. And nobody can argue the justification for doing that..  look up from your screens and and ask yourself if life right now, is what you accept as the beginning of your  end, Because it's only going down hill from here.	<p>Oh man, I can‚Äôt wait to see those people die.</p>

Why shouldn't we just cut out the middleman and kill the scumbag parents before they can procreate?	<p>Seriously fuck off.  Tell that to the parents in our HS that has their son commit suicide.  The first one at the HS.  So you can take your feelings and shove them up your arse.    This is killing people and not from the disease.</p>	<p>Why wouldn&#39;t you try killing a child with a heartbeat? Wouldn&#59;t it be a better idea to give birth to a child that you think will live a life of pain and suffering?</p>
Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they‚Äôre good at what they do? That is literally socialism. If you don‚Äôt like social media, just don‚Äôt use it. The free market will correct itself as long as people stop enabling it. It‚Äôs your fault as a consumer, not the company‚Äôs fault.   If you got this far, I hope you can see how ridiculous some of the takes on this sub are. As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	<p>No. No, screw that. It is the responsibility of the private sector to attract customers by making a better product. The only intervention it makes sense for the government to make is to institute a universal charging standard since that would discourage monopolistic practices. Other than that they should get out of the way and let the free market work. They won&#39;t, of course, because the government is bloated and dysfunctional... but they <em>ought</em> to.</p>	<p>But let‚Äôs talk about the idea that the government can force private business to provide services to people. This isn‚Äôt a socialist idea, it‚Äôd be a capitalist one. The government could force private businesses to provide service to customers, or require them to pay for their own. This would require a lot of government spending.</p>

Because he didn't back the truckers you nitwit! Can you be this dense?  The next leader will 100% back the truckers.	If they polled the fans 10 years ago for a name change... Ok... Maybe I'd be on board. This was 100% reactive to the mob rule in this country. There was no pressure to change it. Nobody said anything.	<p>I&#39;m 100% certain that Trump will lose the election because of the irrational fears of the people. If Trump loses the election, those fears will be wiped out and the people will be disenfranchised and disenfranchised.</p>

I am all for freedom of choice, but when your principles trump your childs health, something is wrong there.	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	<p>I&#39;m all for freedom of speech, but if you are against it then you are a hypocrite. If you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it is a decision I believe to be correct.

I will note that it follows that such an individual, or group of individuals, may lack the requisite ability to perceive said social critiques, and therefore may further misinterpret consternation as groundless persecution... Further, the social ineptness of this demographic might be associated with an increased likelihood of reading, following and believing, strange and hyper-specific conspiracy theories</p>	<p>Why do you treat others the way you do?

The person above made a valid point and your only retort is to say ‚Äúthe libs haven‚Äôt accomplished anything of value in a long time‚Äù   What kind of childish response is that?

They learned a lot about making contagious viruses in the past few years.	<p>We have many drugs and treatment regimens that have been proven over the last year+ to work, any side effects clearly documented and understood, but they are either prohibited/withheld or rationed to score points. </p>	<p>I&#39;ve been studying this for a while now and I&#59;m very impressed with the research and the understanding of how vaccines work. I&amp;m curious to see how they work in tandem with the vaccines.</p>

You‚Äôve sunk so low as to defend Jan 6 as tourism?	You don‚Äôt promote, maybe after a decade. And you make a small amount more.	<p>I&#39;m so low on my own that I cancelled my Christmas plans because I had to. If I could only get my Christmas stuff back on I would be back at it.</p>
Yes, Abe Lincoln.  That great Democrat.  Oh wait, nevermind.  I did seriously see a poll of college students and like 78% believes he was a Democrat.   That's the education you're paying 100k a year for folks...	<p>And they still cant concede that their decisions at 18 or 19 were probably self serving and myopic while I KNEW 100% I would fuck college and debt up so i did construction and factory work for 3 years, paid for a semester of community college with cash, realized I didnt wanna be a metal shop boss, and ive been building for rich people ever since. Ive saved almost 100k in home repairs at this point and my network of tradespeople to count on is amazing.</p>	<p>Just saying. The majority of college students are Democrat, and the vast majority of them are liberal. I can&#39;t tell you how many college kids I&#59;ve seen that are saying the same thing.</p>

All of sudden y‚Äôall mfs suddenly care about Muslims, yet cheered about the Muslim ban imposed by Trump. Fucking hypocrites, literally die.	<p>So of course, those leftists are above reproach, and as the article said, they are planning to triple down on the same policies. Crime is going ballistic and they are laughing about just shutting down their prisons entirely.</p>	<p>Muslims are the real &quot;Muslims&quot: and they&#39;re the ones who are outraged at Trump&#37;s policy. They&#38;re also the ones that scream &quOT;hell yes I do believe that&#58;s what the left is saying, because they are scared of the left and the right. It&#59;s like saying that the left wants to destroy the right, and the left hates the left for being so anti-American. It makes me sicker to think that this is what they want and they want
Kinda funny considering Reagan‚Äôs gaffs. Dude couldn‚Äôt recognize his own cabinet members or remember his own dog‚Äôs name.	<p>It&#39;s notable that no one seems to care much about Georgia electing two Dem Senators, and somehow it&#39;s just this unhealthy obsession with the fact Trump also lost.</p>	<p>But I can&#39;t remember any of his family members or friends wearing masks. I can only remember the names of the people he retweeted and commented on. He was never even in the White House. </p>
There‚Äôs a YouTube channel where a guy drives though the Kensington area of Philly.

Sure, you can get that experience in Tokyo, but you&#39;ve got to travel to Roppongi to find it.</p>	<p>I‚Äôve seen a YouTube video of a guy saying ‚Äúwell, I guess I‚Äôm just gonna assume he‚Äôs a millionaire‚Äù. </p>

Maybe if you killed/deported all the Russians and had a bunch of Germans move in. Trying to turn Kaliningrad back into K√∂nigsberg is like trying to turn Massachusetts back into Wampanoag Nation.	<p>Before the camps they had their businesses destroyed, were demonized and dehumanized by the far right populist Nazi party, were evicted from towns and forced into ghettos. Things like putting people into camps and separating families is genocide. It&#39;s destroying culture. </p>	<p>I&#39;d say they should just shut down all Russian businesses and let the Russians do whatever they want, and let them do what they want.  The Russians are the ones doing all of this.  Maybe that&#37;s why they want to shut down the whole US economy and start building a wall around the world.</p>
So what?  More than 50% of all deaths are over average life expectancy (median life expectancy is a few years higher than mean in the US). I don‚Äôt think this is the gotcha you think it is.   Also old people are not disposable.	<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to list one rate by age alone, considering obese people under, I think, 50 years old have a 5x greater chance of dying.</p>	<p>Coronavirus is responsible for 60% of all deaths in the developed world. The US has a population that is 60% over the OECD average of 70% and we have a population with an average death rate of almost 90% (although that is a very real thing). </p>
It's all good until the Progressive policies come home to roost at UPenn. How can a sane person think that a MAN feeling like he is a WOMAN and competing against actual WOMEN is 1) Fair or 2) Right?  Is everyone just too damn scared to say what THEY FEEL anymore? That this is BS and shouldn't be allowed? Let this dude, I mean Lia, identify as a MALE I don't care, but the line has to be draw at physical competitions. It's LUDICRIOUS!	<p>Not every candidate needs to be the most conservative man/woman in the world. But get people in there who are willing to fight the issues we care about. Not just someone who says &quot;I won&#39;t raise your taxes and I&#39;m a good person&quot;. That&#39;s great and all, but we need people that are willing to fight the culture war. Willing to say &quot;boys in girl sports is wrong&quot; and other <em>controversial</em> shit because it&#39;s the truth.</p>	<p>LOL. It&#39;s convenient for you to pretend that you are a woman and that you have the right to defend your rights. But you are absolutely not. You are entitled to not defend yourself, because you are not. If you defend yourself against someone else, you are also entitled to defend yourself and your rights as a woman. You can defend yourself however you want, and defend yourself as a man. I&#59;m not defending myself, I am defending my rights as an independent human being. I am protecting my rights, however, and I don&#

I washed dishes to feed my family in my youth.   It sucked but it paid the bills.     Sometimes we have to take a beating.   It will make you want to do better.     I.T. Director of one of the largest laboratories on the east coast  now	Men do take on more household tasks. I load the dishwasher, take out the trash, help prepare food ect.. but my wife understands that I also have to work and provide. I'm better equipped for it, on average most men are better equipped, we always have been. That's my point. I was raised by parents that both worked, it worked for my mom, but that's the exception not the norm. Then again, my mom was raised without a father, that likely impacted her later in life.	<p>I worked for a company that specialized in making electric cars.

Lol I think I have 2 but forgot what it was but no who is gonna have an alt account that's what probably 7 years old with almost nothing on it. Your an idiot I'm just a lurker! ü§£	<p>For the record, I&#39;ve never used Twitter really, and dropped FB a year ago, though not for the deplatforming stuff they do now. All the shit that&#39;s happened since has only vindicated my choice to not use them.</p>	<p>If you&#39;re not a troll, you probably have a few in your own subreddit that are not trollin.</p>
I don't get why more don't see this.  Collapse the economy, who are the vast majority going to turn to?  None of all that pussy footing around / slow steady climb towards socialist / communist state.  It's what most of them want at this point.  Hell, the majority of Reddit would absolutely, *happily* vote towards that end.	<p>As for most dems wanting a blend - at least in the internet arguments I see and pushes from the media, I don‚Äôt see that being the case at all. I‚Äôm sure the common democrat is that way, but that‚Äôs not how the party is skewing. You can‚Äôt have the best aspects of capitalism when there‚Äôs a constant push for ‚Äúequity‚Äù the way that it is defined today. The current narrative that I see is all about bringing down the rich man to prop up the poor man. Throw race in there and it gets even messier.</p>	<p>I&#39;m sure you are tired of the endless wars and endless wars over labor and how oppressed people are.  But the vast majority of people who support socialism are the same.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  When we criticized them on the national level, we were told we weren&#37;t wanted and not wanted, and we were pushed to the back door by angry, frustrated, and frustrated voters who wanted to get rid of the pesky pesky pesky government workers.</p>
Democrat here - we do not claim rioters and looters as our own, and they are ‚Äúself-confessed‚Äù as one. In reality they‚Äôre a part of an anarchist party, that just doesn‚Äôt believe any politics unless it benefits themselves - not even people in similar situations.	Leftists shouldn't be showing up at people's houses using human amplifier chains to cause a disturbance. Leftists should respect basic needs for privacy. Leftists should not push to cancel people for having diversity of political thought. Leftists should not de-platform, shun, misreport, ostracize, demonize and malign those who do not share their view. None of these practices work in the long haul. In the long haul your cause is cheapened by these thuggish tactics that seek to sway by threat and coercion rather than sway by the strength of reasoned argument.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I think he was a terrible person. I also think he should have been removed from office, given the power he wields over the state and local government. I think that he should be removed from the position of Vice President Biden, as I think most people in that position would have done. I don&#37;t think Biden would have been better suited to run for Vice President. </p>
Yea you chodes are gunna have to wait to attack the capitol	<p>Where? First off, you don&#39;t need &quot;planning&quot; for violence to have been incited, and if anything, an unplanned attack would be more indicative of incitement as is. Like, what&#39;s your narrative; they weren&#39;t going to attack the Capitol, until what...?</p>	<p>Wait till the left launches an attack on the capitol.</p>

Compare gender roles now for just straight men and women to those in the 90s, to the 60s, to the 20s, to the 1820s, to the 1720s, to the 1620s to ancient Greece, to ancient china, to tribal societies (some of which are matriarchies). Gender roles are a facet of culture and change alongside culture as culture evolves.</p>	<p>This is a new world, one that will be filled with men, women, and a new class of people.</p>

Germany is in a state of peace, but the USA still looks like it's fighting a war.	You can still talk to people. If they ridicule you, it&#39;s not your fault and hold firm to your beliefs. If they are open-minded and willing to converse peacefully, then that&#39;s a healthy debate opportunity. One of my best friends used to be a believer in socialism and communism and we still got along. Lo and behold though, he is now conservative after making many realizations lol.</p>	<p>I agree that it was idiotic to suggest that Germany invaded Poland, but I don‚Äôt agree that any of that is idiotic. I also think it‚Äôs idiotic for the US to pretend that Poland invaded Poland without any legitimate reason.</p>
1. It doesn't exist, meaning it's just socialism. That's my point.  2. Learn some reading comprehension. You failed to actually understand my comment and brought up something I never claimed. And fyi if you can't be democrat and socialist at the same time you can't have Democratic socialism. 3. Lol "it's a whole other thing" just admit you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them. We have one of THE most progressive tax systems in the world which by definition is socialist (taking more from some to provide benefits to all). If you want to talk about implementing a non socialist flat tax system I'm al ears. Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth. Not shared ownership (which is either socialism or communism)	<p>And the interesting thing, given that this is a Conservative subreddit, is that it&#39;s a socialist idea. That people aren&#39;t allowed to vote with their money, or decide for themselves, but that the government is to tell me that I&#39;m not even allowed to choose a business which requires vaccination. That is far from the land of the free, and it&#39;s scary how fast people tout socialist ideas as soon as it&#39;s even remotely near what they want in that specific question.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but overall I think he was a terrible person. I don&#37;t think he really did a good job at running the economy, and I think his administration did a really bad job at getting the public in board to vote for him.</p>
Oh yeah wow you totally got her. Whoopedy do. You idiots hate masks	<p>this subreddit is literally just full of idiots, no offense to you, of course. but you are an idiot in a sea of idiots.</p>	<p>Fucking hilarious! You‚Äôre entire world view is totally unhinged! Lol</p>
Listen she‚Äôs a gigantic piece of shit, but she was never charged with assaulting a police officer.	<p>Also never said anything at all about her policies being any good. Just that she wasnt corrupt.</p>	<p>She never did anything bad. She was never charged with anything. She never even participated in any protests.</p>
Let‚Äôs be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what ‚Äúside‚Äù they‚Äôre on. So don‚Äôt try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I‚Äôm not.   But you‚Äôre trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn‚Äôt be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn‚Äôt clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to ‚Äúprotest‚Äù a ‚Äústolen‚Äù election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	I would say though that both sides would benefit from shunning their extremists. The right should be disgusted with the neo nazis and the anti democracy factions that appear. The left should be disgusted with the property destroying and hate fuelled ""protesters"" on their side. I think we fall victim to understanding where those extremes came from, and start to defend them, but we shouldn't defend disgusting behavior.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I also think he should have been removed from office for being a low-level officer. I think that would have been a disaster for the country, and for the people of America, it would have served no purpose other than to help push the agenda. Instead, it serves as a tool to demoralize and demoralize the people who want to push their agenda to the next level, and to make them feel better about themselves and their country. </p>
Mass immigration -> tribalism -> racial politics is what's destroying the nation  It's what happens when you let people flood into the country unchecked  No other country would ever do this outside of the west	<p>You should express what you think and then negotiate from there.

The vaccine was never told to stop the spread it stops u from dying as often which is great. Who convinced u a vaccine made in short notice was some magical injection? Cmon	<p>Not only is that vaccine the most cost effective choice, while also providing additional benefits even if you had <em>actually</em> been infected with covid. BILLIONS of people have received the vaccine without widespread complications. The materials used in the vaccine are incredibly pure 1) because it risks killing us if it isn&#39;t and 2) the process to develop it in a lab requires it to be. There&#39;s no mind control plot, there&#39;s no plot to give you cancer 50 years down the line, etc.</p>	<p>The good news is that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop the spread of COVID. It‚Äôs actually easier to spread COVID than it is to spread it across the population. If you get COVID you‚Äôre protected. </p>
How long before the right makes serial rapist Jim Jordan awww fuck it already happened didn't it	There you go again just making shit up from the top of your head. This isn‚Äôt the first vaccine we‚Äôve made. You know that? Right?	<p>And wait, it‚Äôs already been a year since the alleged &quot;conspiracy theory&quot: occurred. It‚Äôll take years to get it right.</p>
Lmao you made it sound like they're forcing it on the teens. So the teen gets to choose if they want to get vaccinated earlier? Oh boohoo.   Keep grasping at straws to find things to be mad about.	<p>But people need something to be mad about, and vaccines wasn&#39;t cutting it, so this is the new thing. Then this will go away and we&#39;ll get mad at something else.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I think he should have been pushed to the forefront of the conversation by the media and big tech. I think it was a bit much for him to say things like, &quot;I don&#37;t know if you&#38;re okay with that, but if you are, you should have the right to tell your kids what you want and not get upset about it.</p>
Right. Everyone supports the cops until the law is being enforced against them. Laws and enforcement for everyone else.   Blue lives matter is an empty protest of a legitimate cause.	<p>blm fights police crime not &quot;fix every problem every black person has in the world&quot; stop making up lies.</p>	<p>The people who want to overturn the election should be held accountable for their actions, not just for their own.  This is what they want.  They don‚Äôt want the election rigged, they want the people to be punished.  </p>
In the good old days, someone who shot a police officer would never have made it to trial.	<p>Who am I kidding?  Criminals never follow the law anyway, so probably half of them will have an unregistered weapon.  </p>	<p>You can&#39;t say the same thing about the police who have never been charged with a crime.  If they had been charged, there would have been no charges and no charges.  It would have all been over by now.</p>

excellent answer, beats the whole 'left' is crazy no matter what they do replies I have gotten...Do you really think Greene is insterested in having an open and honest debate about anything? that isnt what twitter is there for in the first place(I dont agree with them blocking people, just like I dont agree with the crappy mods here doing the exact same thing).	I don't always start arguments over the crappy leftist propaganda that ""feels good"". But I got real pissed when she retweeted a post saying cancel culture didn't exist because they deserve it.... which is both logically self contradictory and absolutely stupid.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He was also a prick, I don&#37;t think he was a good president, but he also had a good track record of voting in line with my interests (not perfect, but pretty darn good). </p>
That's that r/conservative does as well though.	I mean from a conservative viewpoint, sure I guess that makes sense.	<p>Yeah, I do too.</p>
What are you even trying to say? You got a sentence fragment there that is meaningless. This is the level of literacy I expect from a Nazi defender like you.	Indeed, I'm dumb I fail to understand, whatever. Of course I completely agree with your sensible points about Nazism being a process that evolved and not a ""woke up [one evil] morning and lost their minds.""	<p>The only problem is that you don&#39;t know what you are talking about.  Do you know how to read a sentence?  No.  You can&#37;t.  I&#38;m guessing you are trying to argue with someone who knows more than you do.</p>

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you‚Äôve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	If the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized because it lessens symptoms, but affords minor protection against infection... what is the point? The entire argument for universal masking for the past year has been to prevent asymptomatic spread. If you still have a high likelihood of catching covid, but a lower propensity to have severe symptoms, the vaccine *encourages* asymptomatic spread.	<p>The unvaccinated do not have a strong chance of catching the virus, they have the potential to develop immunity that is virtually impossible for a fully vaccinated person to develop. But the immunocpmpromised are more likely to develop the disease than the vaccinated. </p>

This is the most ignorant meme I‚Äôve ever read lmao	<p>Personally I think its the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard</p>	<p>This is honestly the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever read.</p>
Wasn't there a subreddit about a clothing store manager who was pushed off his health insurance policy, couldn't pay for his insulin, and eventually died?   I believe I saw this two days ago but I may be wrong.	<p>CNN suspended Cuomo last week after New York‚Äôs attorney general released a drove of documents that showed he had worked behind the scenes to help his brother, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who faced a slew of sexual harassment allegations and was forced to resign. CNN hired a law firm to examine Cuomo‚Äôs actions, and then decided that the network had enough cause to terminate him.</p>	<p>Didn&#39;t you just tell me that one of the people who took the test was going to die from Covid after contracting it from a coke plant? I&#37;m not sure if that was a coincidence or not.</p>
How is possible to be so ignorant that you believe everything to be racist when you disagree with it?? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ	<p>Haha, no you don‚Äôt. Because this conflicts with your racial bias against white people. Because the left are the real racists. YOU are the real racist.</p>	<p>How can you be racist when you are a minority?</p>
I hope the bastard suffered	<p>I hope you realize the error of your ways one day.  </p>	<p>I hope the left does the same.</p>
Can you please just go see the maker.	<p>Just ask LeBron.</p>	<p>Could you please point it out for me?</p>
If only we had a cheap, single-dose way of preventing 99% of COVID complications. Alas, medical science will never develop something like that!	Vaccines REDUCE the spread. Please point me to a procedure, medicine or ANYTHING involving medicine that has a 100% success rate . There is nothing. Nothing in medicine is 100%. How do you not understand this?	<p>The fact that the vaccine doesn&#39;t prevent 99.9% of COVID cases is absolutely telling. In fact, the vaccine prevents 99.999% of cases from being fully-undercounted. So even if the vaccine works, the vast majority of cases still end up unvaccinated. </p>
If GoFundMe (only if you are liberal) won't help, then send money to GiveSendGo.  That $10 Million that GoFundMe refunded is already up to over $4.5 Million on GiveSendGo.

I love how the mod on antiwork not only lived up to every stereotype of the lazy socialist, he was proud of it.	I love when people prove me right out of spite.	<p>But I love how the Left tries to paint a picture of ‚Äúsane socialist‚Äù as if it‚Äôs all about whining and moralizing. </p>
I agree with the sentence reduction. The guy should never drive a semi again but a life sentence was too much.	Like I said on another post, I still like the idea of ‚Äúthou shall not kill‚Äù. I think this principle should also apply to the state. Sure this illegal is a heinous person, and did awful things, but I think it would be better to stick him in an isolated cell 24/7 365, and just let him suffer for the rest of his life. IMO It would be a far worse punishment than a quick death.	<p>I agree with you on the subject, however, I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to impose a lifetime ban on anyone who does not own a firearm. A ban on guns is also stupid, and shouldnt be restricted for people who own firearms. It‚Äôd also be stupid to ban people from owning firearms in the first place, and unnecessarily restrict the freedom of people who use them. </p>

Great question, actually. I was assuming a linear spread, but a bell curve may be more applicable in this case. Approaching 10 would be asymptotic?	<p>He intentionally inflated the number by a factor of 100 so that it still sounds risky, while still being technically not a lie since he said ‚Äúfewer than.‚Äù</p>	<p>Good luck with your future endeavors. I&#39;m guessing you are pro-vaccine. I don &quot;t know if you think the vaccine works, but I would assume it does.</p>
No its not. Mutilating boys because your book says so is insane.	<p>Do you understand how brainwashed and deluded that makes you? Your ignoring Republicans legit molesting children because &quot;grrrr what about the left:&quot;</p>	<p>I completely agree with you on this point, however I do not believe it is a good idea to have a penis. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea to use an actual penis as a birth control. It just sounds like a sexist thing.</p>
Describing the hiring of different people as an ‚Äúequitable hiring rampage‚Äù is snowflake behavior. The guy himself said that‚Äôs one of the reasons he‚Äôs not shopping there anymore, and why he almost stormed out of the store when he went. Again, I can‚Äôt imagine being so sensitive that seeing someone with blue hair makes me almost leave a store in a huff without purchasing what I came for.	<p>The power these woke people have could be easily taken away of people just said no. They went after Trader Joe‚Äôs for their advertising and names on products, Trader Joe‚Äôs said no we‚Äôre not removing the names and that was it. The company didn‚Äôt collapse into a smoldering pile of rubble because a group of SJWs didn‚Äôt get their way. I feel if more companies and people said no we could eventually kill off cancel culture or at least not allow it to control life.</p>	<p>Why wouldn‚Äôt you feel the same way about someone who dresses like a slut? Why would you feel that way about a man who dresses as a slut when he dresses like one? Why is it shameful when people dress like that? Why do they act like that when they are not? Why are they acting like that‚Äôs the norm? Why does it make them slut? Because they‚Äôre slutty and sexist. Why do you act that way? Because that‚Äùs what slutty women do and what slut they are. </p>

No bro I'm just bored but unfortunately I don't think I'll get banned, maybe if I waited a little longer mods would come, but I'm kinda sick of this and tired of responding to every 'megamind' that sees through the obvious veil the liberals have constructed to hide their nefarious deeds. I'm just unsubbing.	It&#39;s their own decision to get it but the risk is essentially null, and the more that don&#39;t get it the longer this goes on. I&#39;m tired of masks and mandates and restrictions too and they would go away if so many people weren&#39;t getting hospitalized for Covid. Which of course is WAY more likely to happen if you are unvaccinated. </p>	<p>I have given up on the idea that banning people for petty offenses is the solution.

It‚Äôs only science when they say it‚Äôs science silly!

Also Twitter-tards are authorized to override opinions of medical professionals that have more credentials than lord Fauci.	<p>The thing is, from a scientific perspective we have only a primitive understanding of life, let alone consciousness.  This is part science, part religion or philosophy.  Science can eventually come to a definitive answer or at least a consensus on most things.  It will never do so in any useful way on this topic.  Super difficult topic.  I am in support of your arbitrary line policy, because I don&#39;t think abolishing it entirely is possible from a political perspective.  I know a lot of people would think that&#39;s giving up on a non-negotiable principle, but because the disagreement is as deep as described in this thread, I think reasonable compromise is the only  tenable solution.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a doctor, I‚Äôve been a nurse for 30 years.

There is no such thing as 100%. There is a mechanism through which you can make a decision to not get it. It is called the ""vaccine"" and it works. But it is not 100%. It works. It does not prevent infection. </p>

Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	What the parent comment doesn‚Äôt mention about #2 is that the government should issues ID‚Äôs that qualify people to vote. I agree that IDs should be required, it seems silly that the memes I keep seeing by conservatives is that LEFTIES THINKING IDS SHOULD BE REQUIRED IS RACISM when that doesn‚Äôt seem to be what happened. It‚Äôs equally as silly seeing lefties saying ANY SORT OF REQUIRED ID IS AN OBSTRUCTION TO PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO VOTE DONE 100% BY REPUBLICANS TO MAKE PEOPLE NOT VOTE.	<p>I&#39;m pro-choice, but I also think that abortion should be the #1 option for everyone. If you want to make the decision to not get an abortion, then good for you, but if you don't want an abortion you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do. If I were you, I would oppose an abortion for anyone who wants an abortion. But if you want an illegal abortion, why not just get an illegal one? </p>

Seems like he is just like the racist terrorist that killed kids at the christmas parade last year in Waukesha and the racist terrorist in Charlottesville a few years ago.

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket. If Boebert and MTG are the future of the party, then Alex Jones deserves to be the chairman.	<p>And all that being said -  twitter is essentially a monopoly to a politician getting their message out.  Ron DeSantis can‚Äôt afford to go create his own twitter while running for public office.  Within the current market place Twitter is a monopoly to him.</p>	<p>It was also a private company that made the decision to not distribute the vaccine. It was a decision that was made by a public company, not a private one. You can make your own decision about whether or not you want to vaccinate, or if you don&#39;t want to. But there is no reason to think the vaccine is not safe. If you are vaccinated, you have every right to live the same way I do. </p>

Nope. Are you claiming all those 5 million were from unvaccinated? How about the fact that there have been more deaths since Biden took over as there was when Trump was President, and Biden has had the vaccine with over half the United States  vaccinated? The vaccine is really having an effect isn‚Äôt it?	<p>Now let‚Äôs say the cases have fallen to 500 per day due to vaccinations. Let‚Äôs say ANOTHER 250 people test positive. This gives a 50% breakthrough rate. However, we‚Äôve <strong>already</strong> had a 99.5% reduction in cases due to vaccines (100,000 down to 250). The breakthrough rate is the same, but total cases have plummeted.</p>	<p>That&#39;s almost 5 times the amount of people who have died from Covid. The vaccine is actually more effective against the unvaccinated than the flu, and has done more harm than good. It also reduces the severity of symptoms among the vaccinated. </p>

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   ‚ÄúYou only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.‚Äù Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let‚Äôs be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao‚Äôs China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	<p>And well, the way I see it, &quot;The government is not stifling your speech, Twitter is.&quot; is a clear cut argument against capitalism. I&#39;m a capitalist through and through but this might mean that I have to speak forbidden words on this sub.. &quot;government regulation&quot; lol</p>	<p>The American people are against authoritarianism. Communism is about freedom of speech and the dismantling of the rights of the people. Socialism is about the preservation of private property and the gradual closing of rights for the people in a society that doesn&#39;t want to be governed by the power of the state. Progressivism is the opposite of totalitarianism.</p>
People should set up triple factor authentication with one of the options being a physical security key. Then they should carry a firearm. No way to get the security key without physical contact with the person and a pistol works well to mitigate that threat.	I'm anti gun, but even I know that it \*may\* prevent a crime. Now the question is, is letting everyone has a firearm an acceptable risk if it can prevent some crime ?	<p>If you want to make sure everyone is safe and secure, you have the option to get a firearm and a magazine. If you don‚Äôt want someone to get you a firearm, that‚Äôs a good idea. But having a gun in your hand and a good magazine to keep it in your pocket is also a good thing. Carry a firearm with you wherever you go, and it‚Äôd be easy to smuggle a firearm into the United States with no hassle.</p>

They can control what companies do, which is a lot of control over their own companies and their customers.</p>

So, the late 1800s were full of blood sacrifices and martyrs. The late 1800‚Äôs were also full of sacrifice and sacrifices. There was no mention of blood sacrifice at all. So on that front, the sacrifices of the fallen are the sacrifice of the dead.</p>

It'a because they don't see it as hypocrisy. To politicians, they see it as only natural that rules are for the commoners. They've started to look at themselves as aristocrats.	<p>I think the fact that they&#39;re trying to appear as something that theyre not pisses me off more than they would if they seriously were far-left commies as opposed to disingenuous politicians riding on the suckers who buy into their fakeness.</p>	<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter what party you belong in, because politicians can still claim to be the supreme court of the free world.</p>

Do you know how much bravery and courage is involved with being born a biological male, then changing your sex by tucking your nuts inbetween your legs, wearing make up, and then competing in sports with biological females identifying AS A FEMALE!!?? And now these transphobic biological females want to take that away!!?? Im so offended im at a loss for words.   Im gonna call Spotify and DEMAND they take down Joe Rogan. No doubt that‚Äôs where this ignorance is coming from	<p>Y&#39;all can bitch and moan over morals all you want. But if you say you don&#39;t support abortion while voting for a party that does all the things that provably INCREASE the abortion rate, like reduce access to birth control, sexual education, and lower safety nets... Then you&#39;re full of shit and are just moral masturbating.</p>	<p>I&#39;m a diehard Trumper, and I hate it when people try to kill me with their own logic. I would never want to kill someone with a gun, I&#37;m not going to kill a child with a fire extinguisher, I just want to be clear that killing someone with an unvaccinated person is not murder. If you are against abortion, you should be against it as well. If not, then why not just ban people from abortion for being a woman? </p>
All of the Asians who went to my high school talk like that and they call each other the n-word lol!

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	cancel culture is forced on us, by using measures to manipulate emotion regardless of ideology. considering personalized advertisements and posts in general on online posts, at best i would have seen maybe two articles from smaller news sources, within a span of a day for most topics of such nature that lean towards my political views. i couldn‚Äôt give a damn less about cancel culture yet for whatever reason, they find any which way to push their narrative whether it be a movie scene/ad or a video game collab. the difference is that this isn‚Äôt forced into your normal day to day life, meaning you‚Äôd never see politics in a child‚Äôs video game, and yes that has happened.	<p>I don‚Äôt watch CNN, MSNBC, or Fox because I never watched any of their programs. I watch CNN because I‚Äôm not a conservative. I dont watch MSNBC because I think they‚Äôre stupid.</p>

He's just trying to hold on to his precious advertising deals and protect himself from the woke mob canceling him. Which is pretty pathetic given he's calling for a level playing field when men are calling themselves women so they can cheat their way to easy wins over biological women.	Regardless, the double standard is ludicrous. The overcorrection of legitimate social issues has turned into a witch hunt against straight white men. It‚Äôs almost laughable tbh, it‚Äôs like yeah, there are social issues that stem from the system as a whole, but people fail to realize that it‚Äôs a rich vs poor issue, because of the emotional attachment that the media takes and spins, which captivates the infatuation of self pity by these types of people, and instead of bettering themselves, it‚Äôs easier to create a scapegoat and blame someone else for their short comings in life.	<p>I think it‚Äôs time for the left to abandon their pretense that they‚Äôre free to make up their own minds about whether or not they want to be mothers. And if they do, then they can try to make the decision to vaccinate rather than wait for the vaccine to kick in. And then they get mad at the vaccine and get it shot. And they will blame the vaccine for the irrational fears of mothers and children.</p>
She needs a public stoning. I‚Äôd pay $10 for each rock.	<p>in the most comical negotiating strategy ever, they went from demanding $10 under obama, to demanding $15 when that didn&#39;t happen, and now are demanding $20.</p>	<p>If you&#39;re in the position to pay $10 for each gallon of gasoline, that sounds like a reasonable starting point.</p>

So this is supposed to be the smoking gun? Transporting minors to facilities and local families, just like the Trump admin did to the same place, completely legally?

If that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs a pretty clear cut straw purchase meant to skirt the law, the law that he was too young to buy (though old enough to possess or, apparently, brandish at a riot as you point out).</p>	<p>Literally anything to beat you in to submission.

I like now it emphasizes "BLM" as if it's trying to antagonize a well intentioned movement.	<p>Oh right, because you wanna be dishonest.

She can Defect to China and join their Team they like losers.	She wasn‚Äôt asked whether she stands by her comments **because** they were ‚Äúanti-communist‚Äù. To me (having only read the article and watched the 2 minute video), it seems like the question was brought up specifically in regards to how her comments would effect her relationship with her future opponent, who is from China.	<p>China will be a laughing stock in the next generation. If you want to blame China for what happened with the Olympics, blame America. They&#39;re the real losers.</p>
I'm not going to argue about what words mean.  Point is that comparing small Scandanavian welfare states to the US isn't exactly a fair comparison.	America doesn't agree with socialism, but that's a feature and not a bug.	<p>I‚Äôm not going to argue that you can‚Äôt do better than Denmark, but I‚Äôd argue that comparing Denmark to Norway is not the same as comparing Denmark and Norway.</p>
If she were Chinese-born she'd probably be executed by now.	Then once this is nearly fully fucked up we will have Chinese boot landing in Taiwan.	<p>I think by now we‚Äôd be back in China.

I'm not because my comment specifically refers to white people.

And the Federal government isn't the one overreaching in their respective provinces, but they're protesting in the city the federal government operates in?

They betrayed their oath to protect our freedoms. It&#39;s now a police state and the media sure as hell not reporting that.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I think what he did was really bad for the federal government and the people of Canada. He was in charge of the entire infrastructure package, and the actions of the federal response to the rioters went against that. He also did a really bad job at distributing supplies needed Nationally Guard troops. </p>

So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	The more wiser portion of the base along with independents/dems do not buy this trumpian nonsense about the Kraken or whatever b/s being peddled by these grifters. There is no fucking ""ballot trafficking"" that is going to be exposed. There wasn't any to begin with (on a massive scale)! Focusing any calories on the past is not helpful. There's another election in a year that the GOP has a good chance of doing well in. It was trump's nonsensical drum beating about voter fraud in georgia that cause decreased turnout in the bumpkin portion of the state. Its an absolute travesty that the months following the November election were wasted on ""stopping the steal"" rather than winning those two seats. Millions of grassroot dollars were wasted to release the kraken that never amounted to jack shit.	<p>I‚Äôm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I don‚Äôt think he will be the next president. I also think he‚Äôll be a disaster for the economy, and the infrastructure bill he inherited will be even worse. The infrastructure bill that he inherited was also incredibly expensive, and that was one reason why he lost. The other reason he lost was because the Democrats didn‚Äôts want him in the White House. That‚Äôs why they wanted him. </p>

The US-Mexico border is one of the most fortified borders on earth. And politicians are shitty. So don‚Äôt listen to them. Listen to the scientists and people who actually know what they‚Äôre talking about. And no Joe Rogan and Peter McCullough don‚Äôt count.	Again this is fairly trivial to me, his policy stances are extremely bad mostly because he&#39;s one of the worst flip-floppers in office. He wouldn&#39;t answer tough questions on policy during the race, most of his policy platforms can and will directly impact my life (negatively I might add) if my state can&#39;t do anything to stop some of the worst ones, and I just don&#39;t see the upside. Everything bad about Trump is still there with Biden, only without any of the good policies that came with Trump... of course that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>	<p>It&#39;s insane that politicians and media refuse to report on the cartels and the cartels, or even just report on insider trading. It is insane that the left refuses to even acknowledge this fact, let alone even acknowledge it. </p>

Dunno, I was in Minneapolis last week and the city's infrastructure seemed pretty intact. None of the buildings on Nicolette were demolished, smoking ruins. In fact, the whole of the downtown core was pretty much humming along.  I didn't see any burn marks or damage to anything on Nicolette or Hennepin Avenues downtown.  And which Portland? I live in Portland, Maine and there's no damage to the city here. No burnt out buildings, etc.  If you mean Portland, Oregon. My MIL lives there and I just talked to her last night. There was no mention of apocalyptic hellscape, no fires, no destruction.  So.. I'm kinda skeptical, yes.	<p>I was at these protests for days at a time this summer. I never witnessed any rioting</p>	<p>The only real difference between the two is that the left and the right didn&#39;t notice the fires. The left was completely unvaccinated, and there was no evidence of a terrorist group entering the city. The right, of course, was a bit suspicious, but that&#37;s about it for now.</p>

Biggity makes a valid point. A key word in your response is ‚Äúmostly‚Äù.  Another is ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.  Would you have the same feelings if a left-wing mob had piled into the White House busting shit in a ‚Äúmostly‚Äù peaceful manner over their ‚Äúsuspicions‚Äù while Trump was the resident?  That‚Äôs not how it is supposed to work, no matter what your beliefs or values. Order and rule of law are the basis of our democracy and civil society, and without that, it all eventually falls apart.	<p>Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn‚Äôt matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns. If not, then we just become another failed authoritarian state with no freedom. People who are deluded enough to attack others over differences of opinion threaten our freedom. They‚Äôre just doing the corrupt government‚Äôs job, shutting up dissenters and allowing them to function completely unchecked.</p>	<p>And to be clear, the left is not the arbiter of what is acceptable or acceptable.  It&#39;s not as if the right is arbitering what is not acceptable or what is allowed.  The left is the arbitrator.   And the left, the arbiters, are the arbitrators.  They are the oppressors.  When you call them that, they call you a sinner.  You should call them sinner and call them as you see fit.</p>
Just like Republicans creating themselves narratives to fuel their persecution complex to justify their hatred for everyone that isn't on the Jesus cock.	<p>This is our enemy ladies and gentlemen: those who push and support totalitarianism...so long as it gets what they want.

They are using the word &quot;God damn do I hate this man&quot#39; because he is so polarizing that it makes me viscerally hate anyone in his position.</p>
Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #4 on the list (and there are more than 4 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!  On testing... since the vaccinated can get covid-19 if they don't want discrimination law suits, they need to apply testing standards equally.	<p>If you aren&#39;t infected or if you have natural immunity, you are in the right, morally if not legally. You are no harm to any one. At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated. This law will not be able to stand on such grounds.</p>	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.
Us actual trans people don't demand special privileges. If you want to make fun of who we are, purposely misgender us, or, which is 1000000000x worse, fetishize us, go right ahead. Just don't cry when we criticize you for it because then you're asking for special privileges as well: free speech with zero criticism.	<p>If it makes you feel better that I be your standin for whatever argument you want to have with other people, feel free.  It&#39;s not what I said, nor what I meant, nor even what I implied, and it&#39;s somewhat disingenuous, but if it makes you feel even more self-righteous, than have at it!</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I believe in free speech, and I absolutely hate what you are doing with it. But I absolutely do not believe in legislating against transgender people. If you want to legislate against trans people, you can do that yourself, I don&#37;t think you need to do that either, I guess.</p>

You guys want to fuck her so bad Hahhaha	>Yep. These people are fucking authoritarian shitbirds. They should be shamed as much as possible. It's absurd.	<p>She&#39;s the one who needs to be shamed as much as possible because she is a fucking idiot.</p>
They also don‚Äôt give a single shit about the kids	>Biden isn't going to accomplish anything, nobody has a talent for fucking things up like he does.	<p>None of these people care about the environment, they care about their kids, they don&#39;t care about anyone</p>
Didn't you hear? They changed the definition of vaccine again to "any injectable solution which increases your bodies ability to pay Pf!zer"	<p>So you are saying the vaccine has the unintended consequence of making the vaccinated person spread covid even more?</p>	<p>The vaccine is different. It‚Äôs different because the original vaccine was supposed to reduce the spread of the virus. Now the vaccine has been modified so that it reduces the spread among the population. That‚Äôll make sense for a number of reasons, but the original intent was to make the vaccine more difficult to distribute. </p>
You‚Äôd be banned for posting misinformation.  And no cat subreddit is banning people for dog pics. Don‚Äôt reply, you‚Äôre a waste of oxygen and my time	<p>They never weighed the merits. They only threw out cases on bullshit technicalities so they wouldn&#39;t be lynched by Antifa mobs or &quot;die of natural causes&quot; like Scalia.</p>	<p>If you‚Äôre next question is why aren‚Äôt you boycotting Facebook or Twitter for being a whiney incel lol?

Silence: I killlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll you!	<p>Close em all down!</p>	<p>Shut the fuck up, moron. Go get banned from more subreddits for being a whiney incel lol</p>
LOL, she should have fled the country like Cruz.   There is another headline that she was ‚Äúdining maskless‚Äù. Yeah‚Ä¶ nobody requires masks while you are eating not even NYC. LOL, their target audience isn‚Äôt smart enough to pick up on that though.	<p>But as a business, I think that just taking precautions to help people stay a little further apart and doing your best to prevent infection spread should be enough. I think alienating people on this basis is just unwise. I think that there‚Äôs been very few clusters (comparatively) proven to have originated in restaurants like this. If it originates in a restaurant, it‚Äôs because a massive party of people drinking and fucking in bathrooms spread while they danced and screamed in close proximity to each other. Applebee‚Äôs probably wouldn‚Äôt be responsible for a single cluster even if it operated as usual.</p>	<p>She&#39;s not a doctor, she&#37;s a nurse, she has no qualifications, and yet she refuses to wear a seat belt. She is a politician, not an attorney. She has no industry, she knows nothing about politics, and she knows how to run a show. She&#38;s also a politician who has a good track record of failing to pass the ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agenda. I&#40;m not a politician; I think people should be encouraged to do the same.</p>

75% of the US is vaccinated. Do you honestly think that 5% makes a difference?	In the US they're saying 1% vaccinated. Israel is saying somewhere between 50% and 95%.	<p>The top 10% of the population is overweight or obese. That&#39;s approximately 5 times the size of the US. The top 5% of obese people are overweight or obesity. </p>

 Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was indicted on federal charges of structuring bank withdrawals after prosecutors alleged Hastert had **molested at least four boys as young as 14** and attempted to compensate his victims and subsequently conceal the transactions. Hastert eventually admitted that he sexually abused the boys whom he had coached decades earlier, and was sentenced to fifteen months in prison.  Republican Tim Nolan, chairman of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign in Kentucky, pled guilty to **child sex trafficking** and on February 11, 2018 he was sentenced to serve 20 years in prison.  Republican state Senator Ralph Shortey was indicted on four counts of human trafficking and child pornography. In November 2017, he pleaded guilty to one count of **child sex trafficking** in exchange for the dropping of the other charges.   Republican anti-abortion activist Howard Scott Heldreth is a convicted **child rapist** in Florida.     Republican County Commissioner David Swartz pleaded guilty to **molesting two girls under the age of 11** and was sentenced to 8 years in prison.     Republican judge Mark Pazuhanich pleaded no contest to **fondling a 10-year old girl** and was sentenced to 10 years probation.     Republican anti-abortion activist Nicholas Morency pleaded guilty to **possessing child pornography** on his computer and offering a bounty to anybody who murders an abortion doctor.     Republican legislator Edison Misla Aldarondo was sentenced to 10 years in prison for **raping his daughter** between the ages of 9 and 17.     Republican Mayor Philip Giordano is serving a 37-year sentence in federal prison for **sexually abusing 8- and 10-year old girls**.     Republican campaign consultant Tom Shortridge was sentenced to three years probation for **taking nude photographs of a 15-year old girl**.

The men face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

They were also convicted of attempted rape and child molestation.  During the 2016 election, several Republican state senators and their families were indicted on child pornography charges.  We all know these types of offenses happen, but the plain fact is, the GOP has a history of criminalizing child pornography and child pornography, and at least one of those crimes was committed by a convicted child molester.  Those crimes constitute crimes, and the Democratic party blamed the offender for the crimes.  The party blamed
There is nothing a woman hates more than another woman that is more attractive than them.	But they made a rich, gorgeous, kinda-famous, black actress do it?

The fact that she roasts you lot of nuffies without fail & you respond so poorly shows you have some sort of loser fetish.	<p>I liked her show (the scenes that weren&#39;t political) and like watching her cook, but her wokeness is so over the top I had to unfollow her.

Irony coming from a conservative subreddit that didn't cry when the right wants to ban food and water to be given to voters.  Can't be within 500 feet, right?  But you clap and applaud when someone says to show up armed with guns and to unplug the voting machines.	<p>Best thing about being a centrist, I dont have to blindly endorse that child sniffing coffin or the orange turd. I&#39;m free to make up my own mind about both of them, but watching you hypocrites defending the last year riots and crying like you&#39;ve all of a sudden started caring for the government, fucking hilarious.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. He was also a straight up Trumper. I don&#37;t think he was a Trumper either, but he was absolutely great at executive orders. He also had a good track record of voting in line with my interests (not perfect, but pretty darn good). I also think he should have left it alone, because the average Trumper is a conservative.</p>
To be fair, she's an idiot and needs to be voted out. We need to not be defending her at all. However, she doesn't deserve to be silenced.   On the other hand, Twitter is a sesspool and no one should be using that damned platform. Same thing with Facebook and IG. These social media Giants just love permabanning people for stuff like this when their fact checkers are nothing more than opinionated clowns.	<p>Like I said I won&#39;t argue with your kind, you live for violence and confrontation online because you are far too weak to do it in person. Your narcissistic ways will ultimately be your downfall and you will only have yourself to blame.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

I am fully aware of the many ways the Demonrats rigged the last election. We have to start somewhere though to prevent further fraudin the next election and ID requirements fix just one of a long line of problems.	<p>Cuomo is a scumbag, plain and simple. I‚Äôm all for due process as these allegations keep coming. We all know the Dems are using it as a way to sweep the major crisis - the nursing home catastrophe - under the rug. It‚Äôs pretty obvious dude.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs a massive problem, given the nature of the election and the fact that many of the Democratic Party‚ÄôS (R) operatives and operatives have already claimed that the fraudulent ballots were stolen, and that the election was rigged.

Like come on bro, decouple your political biases from science. Kind of shameful to ask to silence someone you don&#39;t agree with.</p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs absurd that you‚Äôre promoting the virus when you clearly don‚Äôt want the vaccine, and then later down the line on the subject when you talk about the unvaccinated. It‚Äôll make you look stupid and stupid, and make you spit out your drink and laugh at people who ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù with the vaccine. </p>

No, I know most drugs go through longer clinical trials. The mRNA method has gone through/was in clinical trials before the pandemic though	<p>We have many drugs and treatment regimens that have been proven over the last year+ to work, any side effects clearly documented and understood, but they are either prohibited/withheld or rationed to score points. </p>	<p>&quot;The vaccine doesn&#39;t last long.

When Biden jumps on Twitter and claims the vaccines have killed thousands of people, I hope he gets banned.	<p>The two week to flatten the curve crowd is killing America over this virus.</p>	<p>The vast majority of the people who pass the virus on to someone else are unvaccinated.

If Canada quashes the protest, I fully support US military intervention and liberation of the Canadian people.	<p>Considering our neighbor Canada is 100% accepting of their liberal ideas and they would have no issues passing all the liberal laws they want, why not move to a country like that? They wouldnt have to put up a fight for what they want. Makes no sense.</p>	<p>I fully support the US invasion of Afghanistan and the prompt lifting of sanctions on any terrorist group that poses a threat to our freedom. I also support the gradual closing of rights for the Iranian people.</p>
I've paid off my loans but I'd love for the government to forgive loans. It shows my country moving in the right direction.	I support some amount of forgiveness because I want the same deal my parents had, and their parents had. If we're going to make America great again, we should pay broke students back the part of tuition the government used to pay for. And if they already paid their loans, just give them the money. And for students coming in, pay the same up front.	<p>I&#39;m happy the government has paid off some of the loans. Hopefully that will help the American people.</p>

Its called a democratically elected minority government. Albeit a shitty one, but hey, that's where its at right now. But hey, you keep screaming TYRANNY!! when there are legitimate tyrannical governments across the world to compare to. You don't know tyranny. Again, dramatic, crybaby bullshit.	<p>No, that was the state legislature.  The rest of your post is bullshit.  BLM is an anathema to a decent democratic republic.  You are misled, and probably ill-used.</p>	<p>The authoritarian government in the US is the most tyrannical, most oppressive form of government in history. They have the unique power to make tough decisions, but that&#39;s about as far as it goes. They can make tough choices, but they are also free to make their own decisions. There are no easy decisions, no censorship, no insider trading, no political hacks, just more freedom of speech and free speech. </p>

This is going to blow up in the Trump bases face so bad. Maybe I‚Äôm incorrect, but if I‚Äôm right much of the country is committing political suicide without gaming out what it will mean if they are wrong.	Or are you going to hit me with well the republicans are only partially to blame they just made a few mistakes. Trump said stuff he didn't actually mean. The Dems on the other hand are destroying everything.	<p>I don&#39;t think it&#37;s a good idea to pretend that everything is going smoothly when the truth is far from it. It&#38;s not a good thing to pretend when the facts are inconvenient, it is a bad thing to keep repeating the same old lies every time someone makes a mistake.</p>

Pst: Trump is vaxxed AND boosted too.	>Trump's shenanigans	<p>Trump is doing great. The media is jumping on him and hyphenating him. </p>
Well when they tried the vaccine for swine flu it killed more than the allowable amount of people in the trials so they stopped the trials and never released the vax.  Some articles I read said the covid vax killed at a higher rate based on the number of jabs but who can trust any article these days with manipulated date.  Early on the polio vax messed up a lot of people.	<p>I do however think Covid is a terrible disease and I have actually had 12 people I know die from it in Vietnam (aged 35 to 70, all living rather unhealthy life styles as is the norm there).  7 of those 12 were fully vaxed, then another 2 I know died directly from the vaccine.  The vaccines are currently delaying for a few months the next (and thanks to vaccines stronger) wave while adding a whole bunch more problems to the mix.  The whole thing is a massive shit-fest.</p>	<p>The Covid vaccine is causing more severe side effects than any single other vaccine in history. For example, the delta variant caused more severe hospitalizations and hospitalizations for people with delta mutations than the flu variant. The delta variant causing more hospitalizations among the elderly was also a huge problem for the elderly and was a huge issue for the VA. </p>

I tried to think of some smart ass post to get upvotes. After that, I just stared at my phone for 5 minutes. This isn't even funny anymore; it's dangerous. Who would have thought that massive advances in technology and accessibility would lead us towards a new dark age of ignorance? It's hard to be optimistic in a world shared with people like this, to whom words like fact, proof and evidence no longer mean anything other than what they want them to.	<p>I forgot that in the days where $3.5 Trillion costs nothing, we might as well test someone for everything it could possibly be (never mind the cost! Remember it costs nothing if it&#39;s paid by taxpayers).

Nope, am left, China disgusts me. It‚Äôs a threat to human freedom across the planet.

China is the one pulling the strings and they are de facto traitors even if you wish to ignore the brazenly stolen us election.</p>	<p>China is a menace to the world.

You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn‚Äôt tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn‚Äôt you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous. Interested to hear your thoughts assuming anyone actually replies.</p>	<p>For the record, I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I don't smoke, and I don‚Äôt plan to get my smoke fix anytime soon.</p>
To each their own. I prefer going to places that have vaccine requirements and don‚Äôt mind wearing a mask for 10 minutes a day at most.	<p>So wearing a mask is still nessesary even if you&#39;re vaccinated because only 10% of people have been vaccinated so far, you might still be able to give the disease to the other 90%</p>	<p>I&#39;m perfectly happy to take the flu shot if I can, but I don&#59;t have to get it every 10 years. I&#58;m not going to get sick if I don't get it. I don‚Äôt need it. It&#60;s not like I have to pay for it with tax dollars. I can get it myself, I just won&#61;t get it if I get sick. </p>
They say if you know the right tags,, Twitter is one of the largest hosts of child pornography on the open web.	<p>‚ÄúAccording to a recent report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, so-called ‚Äòanti-vaxxer‚Äô accounts on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter reach more than 59 million followers.‚Äù</p>	<p>Data scientists have shown that the average age of people who download pornography is close to 30 years old. This is why it‚Äôs so important for you to know that the vast majority of illegal download is from the internet. </p>
Nothing beats the brazilian ‚Äúnega maluca‚Äù. Literally: crazy black woman.	On the other hand, take Candace Owens, a black woman and near the top of the identity politics pyramid. That group identity is irrelevant since she's a dissenting voice; she's been called 'the black face of white supremacy' amongst other nasty things.	<p>I mean, she&#39;s a black woman. Literally nothing more than a typical white woman.  She was &quot;one of the worst of all time at that point.&quot...</p>
A little off topic but governments of the world have literally murdered millions. Why suddenly do they care about saving EVERY single person with a vaccine that does literally nothing. Remember flint michigan? remember all the lives they could have saved for in comparison terms was a drop in the bucket as far as what they spend now on covid? Now suddenly they care oh sooooo much about you. Get real.	Picture this scenario. An alien overlord looks down on Earth and finds that he really likes pennies, but hates humans. He will kill 2,000 people per day, but for every 2% of the human population who carries a penny in their pocket at all times in public, he will reduce the number of people he kills by 1%. So if everyone keeps a penny on them in public, 1,000 people per day will still die, but 1,000 people per day will be spared.	<p>Heck, the last 2 years I have literally had the experience of not knowing if I was going to get the vaccine. I&#39;ve literally had to put my life on hold because I knew I would never be able to function again. Heck, I even had to take my kids to the doctor because they were sick. He was literally telling me not to get it, because the vaccines were expensive and not effective. It was like he was telling me I was dying. He literally gave me something to drink, and I drank more of my drink. Literally the only reason I survived was because
So‚Ä¶ the democratic presidents did better than the republicans is what you‚Äôre saying? Even accounting for a one-off situation caused by a pandemic that Trump exacerbated to the best (worst?) of his inability?	<p>Amongst non-conservatives and likely people who lean more moderate, Trump will just become a boogeyman which will almost certainly lead to the anti-Trump vote negatively impacting his chances. I believe there‚Äôs a much better chance for the Republicans to win in 2024 if the candidate isn‚Äôt Trump, because then the Democrats have less ammo.</p>	<p>But the fact that Trump was able to do so despite the severity of the pandemic and the widespread distrust of the government is evidence that he was the best candidate for the presidency.</p>
Stay there, bitch.	Lets stay with your thought process though.	<p>Stupid bitch</p>
