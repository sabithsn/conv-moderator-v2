I'm confused on why you're still messaging me, did you miss my reply to your earlier comment to me where i said that i don't debate with white females who post the N-word ?    https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/s6qx4p/cmv_that_feeling_you_get_when_you_start_to_sneeze/ht8ef8b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3   I'm pretty sure it's against the subs rules to harass someone who's said they don't wish to continue debating with you, I'd be careful so you're not banned if i were you.    don't worry no need to reply, just a friendly reminder. be better	If you agreed with this, I would have assumed a rational person would say ""yes, of course, I wear them when people like the OP ask me to"".

\> Politics is far more tribal than it should be and it's damaging to progression and coherent conversation     You hit the nail on the head. At the end of the day, your neighbor is still your neighbor and you have more in common then you don't. This us vs them mentality is detrimental to society.	<p>However, since you ARE seeing disparate outcomes, that actually shows that the current system IS still patriarchal, since it means that men are more involved in the competitive environment to become both winners and losers in it. The women are still excluded more from this environment, and are therefore underrepresented at both extremes. So, you&#39;re disproving your own claim again. :-)</p>	<p>I agree with you but I think it’s more complex than that. People are easily manipulated and manipulated, and it makes it harder for people to have meaningful conversations with others. It makes it more difficult for people who don’t have meaningful relationships with other people.  </p>

I've been arguing this since Richard Spencer was sucker-punched in the head live on television on inauguration day 2017, while calmly speaking with a reporter.  People were all 'hell yeah!' at the time, too.  No one wants to listen, or have even the slightest bit of imagination about how normalizing it could come back to bite you.	But the first time I saw a TV show with an actual male-male romantic subplot that wasn't played for laughs or a ""one special episode"", I spent hours watching and re-watching those scenes online. When I heard that the teacher on Arthur (my favorite show as a little kid) had been shown on-screen marrying another guy, I immediately started happy crying right in the middle of a group of my straight guy friends, something I never do. Even I was shocked at my reaction and couldn't explain why it mattered so deeply to me.	<p>I&#39;ve been arguing this point for months, and it seems to me that it&#37;s because the media has failed to care enough about the issue. The media is so blinded by their obsession with Trump and his supporters that they have no idea what they want. They should be able to shut down the media and give them a platform to speak about the issues they want to discuss. The only thing that matters to them is that they are allowed to do whatever they want without fear of repercussion. </p>
Almost as dumb as not being able to Google post HRT advantage. This thread shouldn't exist. This isn't a debate. Instead of replying to me or reading the rest of this thread just jump over to Google and Google post HRT advantage.	Even if we left it to Google, which I see no reason for, them being responsible for the standard doesn't give them the ability to be a gatekeeper, which is, after all, the problem we're trying to address with this."	<p>I&#39;m not arguing that people are stupid for not reading the comments on this thread, I just want people to be able to decide what they think and which they think they should believe.

If you gonna show and support hate publicly, then you deserve whatever comes after.	<p>Let’s say you do something wrong, and only you know about it. A good person would own up to it, and suffer the consequences. A bad person would cover it up and get away scot free. So I suppose the message is, “Be a bad person and you can get what you want in life”</p>	<p>But I think you deserve respect for your opinion, not for your hate. You deserve it for your actions.</p>

I’m not lying about anything, I’m calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day. When will you take responsibility for what you comment?	TBH, I have no idea what comments you've been receiving. If you say they're inappropriate, then they are. They're not excusable, regardless of how someone feels at the time. I hope you've been reporting them. I report all comments that break rules, especially non-productive comments."	<p>I&#39;m not calling you names, I am calling you out for your bad behavior.

Your arguments are bad faith. Vaccination mandates are for the public health and safety. They are constitutional, and right now those who are unvaccinated should be forced	You ignore the purpose of government, and the social contract which makes society work. Governments make and enforce rules, and perform actions for the benefit of the GROUP, that we cannot do alone. Defence was of course the first of these, and is clearly still important. Justice and policing is another. Public health is a third. It’s not only the government’s RIGHT, but their RESPONSIBILITY to make and enforce rules that protect the health of our population. Those rules should be made with consideration for the members views and beliefs, but setting a minimum standard to achieve the required result is fair and reasonable. The imprisonment of Typhoid Mary was an example of this. She carried Typhus, but was unaffected by it. She passed it to 53 people and 3 died. Since she could not be cured, and insisted on working as a cook, she was quarantined for over 30 years. Was she happy? No. Was it necessary to protect the lives of others? Yes.	<p>I agree with you, but I don’t believe that banning vaccines is a good thing. I believe that all vaccines are good, and banning them is just one of those things. I think banning them would make more sense. But I think that’s a misguided position, not a good one.</p>
I think you need to read up on child development and brain development before you say stuff like this because you just sound stupid. Yeah kids are annoying, but they are small people processing the world around them and parents can only do so much to control their feelings and actions. If you really hate children so much, stay home, thats what I do.	I feel OP is upset by the sight of children realizing that the world is in a bad way at the moment with several long term problems that need to be addressed, and their solution is not ""we desperately need to fix the world so children will feel safe again"" but instead ""we should lie more to children so they don't realize how bad the world is..."""	<p>It&#39;s true that the brain development of a child is a lot more complex than that of a person. The brain development and development of an adult child are more complex and complex than the brains of a fetus. We have to teach our children to be aware of and control their environment. We can only teach them so much if we let them learn to regulate their environment and their behavior. As a result, we can teach them to be sensitive and sensitive to other people.</p>
Well, now I'm offended.  Because your accusation is 100% false.  I have never, at any point in our conversation, said the above quote that you are attributing to me.  You and anyone else can scroll through our discussion and see that I'm telling the truth.  Falsely attributing a quote to me flies in the face of the "good faith" pretenses our debate is supposed to be taking place under.	<p>I mean I understand you were not trying to phrase it this way, but you absolutely have. Your definitive statement leave open a cavern of insufficiency; I would have to literally tell you an original thought NEVER conceived by people PAID to conceive of such fiction.	<p>I do not believe you are correct, and I don&#39;t think you are. I believe you have no idea what you are talking about, and you are so blinded by your own ignorance that you can easily dismiss any of the claims you make as fact. I don't believe you were correct when you said that, but you were wrong when you claimed that I was wrong. </p>
I'm not. Just make an effort, jfc.	No they're not.  Reread their argument.	<p>I&#39;m not making an argument.</p>
I totally agree with that. I don't mind a bit of gore if it makes sense for the plot. But gratuitous gore like Hostel and such is absolutely disgusting, the directors must be sick in their heads (which is often the case with movie directors).	<p>In my own kinks, I enjoy cuckold porn, but the rate that racism bleeds into that fetish is super gross. There&#39;s consensual cuckoldry, that I find hot, but the amount of white supremacist rhetoric is alarming (although any non-zero amount would be alarming).</p>	<p>I don&#39;t think the gore is appropriate for movies. I think it should be reserved for those who enjoy gore, and for those that don’t, that’s fine. The gore can be enjoyable, but it can also be harmful to others. And I think that the gore should be used in horror movies, as well as in horror films. </p>
Both men and women should be able to sexualize the opposite gender equally.	First of all, it goes both ways. If it affects women, it also affects men in the same way.	<p>I think all women should be able to have sexual roles equally, not just men.</p>
great argument.	Amazing argument."	<p>Excellent argument.</p>
Not trying to be that guy, but I think your viewpoint is the common viewpoint rather than the devils advocate.   The only thing I would add is I think it’s totally fine if their salary is cut in half and each of them get half the money if they want separate bank accounts.	<p>On your second point, I agree. I think the current government programs that help people ignore personal freedom too much. If the government is aiding you, it should aid you in most circumstances, not give you a million strings attached, not so many limits on how you spend that money. It should be your money, just like tax breaks are your money. </p>	<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a bad person, I just want people to be able to have a decent life.  Even if you have to live off of a portion of your salary, you can&#37;t have a great life. You can have a pretty decent life, but you can have pretty decent ones.  You can also have a nice life, and you can be rich, and earn a decent wage, but that&#

I agree. He worked with so many actors and actresses over 15 years and with all these rumors of him being a creep going around, i feel if something happened SOMEONE would have spoken up	As a result, there are officers out there with dozens and dozens of misconduct complaints against them that aren't removed from their jobs. I believe the officer in the George Floyd arrest had already had something like 18 previous complaints against him.	pp>I agree that you&#39;re under the impression that if someone had told you that he&#37;d be fired, you would have been more likely to have been fired than not.

... wow...   It took guts, to post something like this, so INCELebration of your courage, I'll engage a little. How do you define "gender roles"?	<p>I&#39;m sorry did you make points? I mean I see alot of stuff about how &quot;you really want to control women&quot; (no) ... and &quot;you want sharia law&quot; (no). etc.  did you think casting aspersions was a reply worth rebuttal? imputing some stupid shit, because thats the only thing your limited mind can grasp as a reasonable basis for rejecting your flawed premises?</p>	<p>I&#39;m not sure how you came up with this. It&#37;s very clear that it was a very complex and complex topic. I think you need to consider the context as it relates to gender roles.</p>
That Bills/KC game was amazing. Two evenly matched teams giving their all with spectacular plays on both sides. The winner came down to a coin flip. They should be able to answer the TD with the next kickoff in OT, and back and forth til one doesn’t make it. I could have watched that for hours. The NFL needs to reconsider their rules at least during playoffs that was bullshit	<p>Again I agree Super Bowls are a team sport. If you’re an NFL GM you need to build a team first before drafting a QB. You’re probably more likely to win when trading or signing a free agent than drafting.</p>	<p>It was a great game, with absolutely no real threat. The defense was incredible, and the offense was absolutely unbelievable. The Packers had a chance to win, but they just couldn&#39;t. Their defense was so great that they ended up giving up huge points to the Chiefs. It was like a miracle that the Packers were able to pull it out of the first round, and then the Packers won in overtime. The rest of the year, the Packers have looked like shit. The only thing holding them together is the defense. This is one of the worst teams in NFL history. </p>

What about your other neighbours that have to listen to some shit-for-brains make noise all fucking night? Now they just have to listen to you making a racket all fucking day? You can't out-annoy stupidity. Take the high road, don't piss off your neighbours that don't make noise at night, and just call the fucking cops when they're loud past 11 pm like an adult.  You're sounding like a whiny kid that got woken up from their nap too soon and now they're banging on the wall, trying to annoy their parents.  Grow up and either knock on their door and tell them to shut the fuck up or call the cops to come and do it for you. This whole being petty for revenge is so 16. This isn't some passive aggressive sibling fight. You are an adult, act like one.  Sorry your building management is so shitty. I would be emailing them and calling their after-hours line every time your neighbours are loud. Annoy them into helping you.	<p>My landlord had my neighbors harass me by banging on my door, and then flash lights in my windows at random times of the night, so I called the cops while it was happening. Even though I called, when the officers arrived they  interviewed the landlord for about 15 minutes then came over and said &quot; He has the right to be here at anytime if hes working on air conditions or checking on the property&quot;. I followed up by explaining the harassment, and the officer along with 2 other officers standing by shrugged. The landlord then had my brother attacked the next day, to which he defended himself by pulling his firearm, which ended in his arrest because the neighbor gave a false testimoney, saying he see my brother supposedly waiving a &quot;silver gun&quot; unwarranted ,when 1) he didnt have a silver gun and 2) he was attacked by the landlord and an associate. Police came and interviewed landlord again and then he was arrested. Moral of the story, fuck the police.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t want to be a loud, obnoxious person who wants to make you feel like an annoying twat, but then suddenly I realise that they are actually making me feel like a twat. I have to be able to control my anger, and I can't control it. I can only control it if I have a reasonable amount of control. If I can control it, then I can be a good parent to my kids.</p>
>It seems moronic to me because Leftists claim to represent the working population or labor class but usage of slurs and somewhat crass and raw language is characteristic of the working class.  Speak for yourself.	<p>This isn&#39;t &quot;our nature&quot;, this is ideology caused by living under capitalism. Do you think people living under feudalism spent all their time comparing themselves to others? I am not saying feudalism is a better system by the way, just that people were miserable in other ways, but nonetheless accepting their god-ordained place in the social hierarchy.</p>	<p>That’s my view. Leftists are hypocrites. They are trying to attack the working class and their supporters. They’re using the word “progressives” to describe people who are struggling to make a living. They use the word progressivism to describe those who have failed to make progress. The definition of progressivism is not representative of the workers, but of the people who have been struggling for decades. It is representative of a group of people struggling to survive and succeed in the modern world.</p>
A pedophile is someone who has a sexual attraction to children.  You don't look up pictures of pretend children if you aren't sexually attracted to children. You are welcome to delude yourself into believing otherwise, but that is incorrect. So, sorry that calling a spade a spade and pointing out how abhorrent your position is upset you.	I personal also find it a bit cruel if you do have a baby and decide not to want to help it. How can someone look at a child and not want to care for it. (I am pro-choice btw)"	<p>You don’t need to be a pedophile to be attracted to children. You don‒t have to be able to predict the behavior of other people, you just have to accept that it’s a matter of internal consistency. If you’re not able to control what you want, then you can just ignore it. There is no such thing as an internal consistency in behavior. </p>
I don’t really get the point of these pedantic posts. “I know full well what a word/phrase means, but I don’t like that meaning.

I know you&#37;re not a feminist, and I&#38;m not trying to convince you that I am, but I don&39;tl;t think it is relevant to the conversation.</p>

Or i guess you'll just worm you way into a feet-up position in government and perpetuate your sheer fucking nonsense """"FoR frEe"""" at taxpayers expense.	<p>They are free to abuse the public trust and members of the public, declare themselves to have been acting within accordance to their own flawed policies, and then when held accountable by virtually the only measure left to the wronged, the money that they pay out doesn&#39;t even put a dent in their budgets, while we&#39;re left holding the bag for their wrongdoings.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not sure how you get that, but I guess you can be a good employee by taking advantage of the low pay you get. You can get a decent salary by taking jobs that are not in the best interest of the people. You could also be a pretty good employee if you want.</p>

We will never get rid of the “virus” because the media will keep pushing it out. With a survival rate of 99.89%, and no symptoms. Confusing on why a human would inject themselves with a experimental liquid, especially after all the vaccine deaths. “Covid” will never go away as long as the media keeps pushing false information. I can’t blame everybody though, most people just turn on the news in the morning and don’t even think to question anything they hear. The competent will survive this fake pandemic, because we just ignore the communist rules.	That's a fantastic leap in logic. No one has to treat this seriously because it's patently different and does not follow logically from requiring vaccination for a virus that has caused one of the most infectious pandemics in history. One literally involves killing a human, could incur serious psychological trauma, and does not clearly prevent any potential harm to others. The other is a half-second prick that you probably won't even notice, is very unlikely to hurt you in any way, and will increase both your own likelihood and that of literally everyone that you will ever come in contact with of not contracting Covid-19.	<p>The CDC has said that the pandemic will continue to spread until the end of time. That is not a valid argument. Most people who have ever had a pandemic have no idea how it really works. Most of the time, people don&#39;t care about vaccines. But the CDC said that if you get vaccinated, you can still have a high risk of getting sick from it. So the CDC is going to continue to push the false vaccine claims until you get sick from the virus.</p>

I 100% agree with you. Both teams should have 1 shot at scoring and each have OT time to play their defense/offense.	<p>Also, about Dani Jones. You estimate the probability of a trans winner if there were only 1 trans athlete. You have assume equal probability of winning for all athletes, and calculated what that is for one athlete. What&#39;s your point?</p>	<p>I agree with you that each team should have 1 shot at scoring and each should be given 1 shot to defend. If not, then both teams should be able to take advantage of the extra time and resources afforded to them. If both teams have a 1 shot, then the chances of both teams scoring are pretty low.</p>
Children are like poems... they're only beautiful to their creators.	Well, I tried to change your mind and I don't think I did. So I'm off. [As an added bonus here's a very good poem by Countee Cullen about what we talked about](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42618/incident-56d2213a45f36). It's not part of my argument, I just think it's a really good poem."	<p>It&#39;s like a book. You are the author. Your words are beautiful.</p>
To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	<p>Why should anti-vaxxers be a protected class? They shouldn&#39;t have any protection from ridicule, just like moronic Trump supporters don&#39;t. Further, their decision is incredibly disrespectful and ignorant to the millions of people who have died from COVID, I certainly will not respect their decision.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t believe that God can cure all of these    We have a system where all religions are created equal, and no one can claim to be perfect or god is perfect.  We also have to accept that we can only be good if we accept that.  Many of these religions can be just as evil as we can be, and we have to choose not to accept them as we want to.  I believe that the only solution to this problem is to let people be themselves.  It&#
Oof. The rapist vibe guy has opinions on splitting pizza.  Go through his history. He legit believes it's ok to rape women and has doubts the age of consent laws are good for children.	<p>If you lie and say I ate your pizza and your friend comes to my home a beats me are you responsible?</p>	<p>It&#39;s like saying that a person who wants to rape a child is a pedophile. The person who raped a child wants to make sure that the child is never sexually abused, and the person who committed the crime wants to be punished. The other person who said that is a rapist. </p>

It's not worth my time continuing a discussion with someone unable to grasp a simple concept.  X number of animals were killed as of today to provide meat in the grocery stores. There is a deer in the woods still alive, if I go decide to kill that deer it's now dead... It wasn't dead this morning, but it is dead now that I shot it. Again, it's really not hard to follow along.   The meat in your grocery store was dead already, the animals in the woods are alive until you decide to go kill one. It really boils down to you being able to wrap your head around this concept. Given this situation, it is immoral to go out and kill another animal when you didn't need to. That's literally all I'm arguing at the end of the day - a hunter doesn't wake up and NEED to kill an animal, but they do anyway.  More death is unacceptable, I don't care if it makes you feel better about yourself. From the animal's perspective, you just killed me even though there's 1000s of pounds of meat in the grocery store down the road.	If you cant afford it, chances are you cant afford to not buy mass produced corn products which are extremely detrimental to everyone and especially the environment. Its a complicated issue is my point, and to think that not eating animals means you are helping them can often be backwards. People need to start researching and thinking deeper than that. There are too many deer, and most die very painful uncomfortable deaths do to overpopulation and starvation. Maybe we should try to find a win win solution for this instead of spreading propaganda like ""meat is murder"" (not accusing you of this, but its a common thing).	<p>The fact that people are killing cows, chickens, ducks, cows, cows and chickens for food is a pretty vivid illustration of the problem. The fact that we are doing this because we can&#39;t just kill cows, we need to kill chickens as well, so we can sell them for food. So, I&#37;m going to stop buying them for meat at the local farmers market because we&#38;ve already killed cows in the past couple of years. So I don&#
So you don't want your view changed, then. If no data will convince you, stop wasting our time.	It’s fine to be disinterested in the topic.

That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever’s in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.	<p>If they shudder at the thought then why did they openly support it? Pleading ignorance isn&#39;t valid here. Hitler was a special kind of evil, fascists are only marginally better, in that most of them simply fall in line as opposed to being driven by their hate. Its not a matter of me inviting upon them being bad (in a way like Hitler, they are by definition. If they don&#39;t like it then tough. I literally have no empathy for such people.</p>	<p>Objective truth doesn&#39;t matter because everyone agrees on it. What matters is that the science itself is good, and not just the people who agree with it. If you don’t want to accept that science is good and not bad, then you can easily dismiss it as nonsense and just continue to ignore it.</p>
That's non sequitur. I'm not talking about music reviews or opinion. I'm talking about white nationalists espousing debunked "race science" to push white supremacist policies. But yes, any media program should vet its guests to make sure they're not absolute cranks who spread racist bullshit.   And yes, I am saying we shouldn't let white supremacists speak in public to spread their message. You seem to be running head first into the [paradox of tolerance.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) One of the ways around it is to simply not tolerate bigotry. Again, I recommend doing the reading here. Why are you so adamant that they be able to share their hate?   Frankly, your second paragraph didn't even make grammatical sense. But yes, as stated above I do want to censor bigots. I do support "science facts" as you put it. I'd love for you to provide an example of "experiential designs" that were rapidly disproven. Do you mean phlebotomy and the other "race science" fields? Because yeah, we threw those out when they were disproven.   And no, not everything had scientific consensus* (you can't spell) but everything we've discussed today does. The only people disagreeing are bigots. You've thoroughly shown us here where you stand on this.	<p>Yeah because they&#39;re not already doing this! I&#39;m not particularly interested in where this discussion is going. I don&#39;t have a low opinion on you but I already know you&#39;re going to try to hit me with the &quot;white people are victims of white supremacy too and they don&#39;t know it!&quot; And I just don&#39;t agree and don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get you to agree white people have purposely tanked the social safety net in America of their own free will and not because billionaires brainwashed them. I&#39;ve been in America my whole life and I&#39;ve seen where the racism comes from. It&#39;s not just something flowing from the bottom up, and most white people flat out don&#39;t even realize how good they have it compared to other people not only globally but in America itself. We have this thing where we make all problems broad to seem as if they primarily affect white people, then the government primarily only helps white people. Happened with affirmative action, happens every year with various types of welfare (look up welfare spending in white areas vs black areas - it&#39;s a doozy). This was a nice discussion but I&#39;ll have to end it here.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not saying that all white supremacists should be banned from mainstream media, I am saying that they should be allowed to make their own political statements without repercussion from their supporters. I am not saying they should have to be banned for engaging in racist discourse, but that they shouldn&#37;t be allowed in mainstream media because they are white supremacists. I mean, they shouldn't be allowed into mainstream media if they want to, but they should not be banned if they do so.</p>
It is a slur, I don’t think it’s bad to say though.	<p>Which I’m actually okay with, but I’m guessing you’re not.</p>	<p>I don’t think it’s a bad thing to say, but I do think it is a slur.</p>
They should invite skittles to a party. They don't  care about inequality or inclusiveness. They can see the trend and want to sell candy.	But brands still want to sell their stuff and kids still want toys and junk food, so brands will just subvert the ban. You think kids are too vulnerable to blatant advertising? They have no hope of distinguishing a fake prop soda from a soda product placement. When their favourite disney show character gets a happy meal, they arent going to be able to filter that out as an advertisement, separate from everything else the character likes and is interested in. And wait until, like, their playground is brought to them by Barbie and their Candy Land Game is skittles-themed.	<p>It&#39;s all about giving people candy and having fun. Giving people candy is not a bad thing, but giving them candy is a bad way to do that.</p>
I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human 	<li><p>even if they did do it the way they did to help small states, there&#39;s a big difference between that, and saying this was a big part of the electoral college&#39;s design.  People talk about this like the whole point of the electoral college is to help the small states; but even if you think the founders thought about that, they clearly had bigger fish to fry in designing the system.</p></li>	<p>But I think the concept of cultural appropriation is the same as that of slavery. The idea that we are somehow somehow somehow related to each other is not a valid one. We have to adapt to the needs of the world, and adapt to our own environments. We need to be able to adapt and adapt, to adapt, and to adapt when we need to. We can do this by creating new cultures, and we can do it by building new ones. </p>
Adapt. Improvise. Overcome.	To elaborate:	<paraphrase: Adapt. Improvise. Overcome.
Suffering?GTFO here.Grow up and pay your fucking debts,that you agreed to.How hard is that? Is the fact that you are educated mean you are immune from "suffering"?No. Suck it up.Let the fat fuck with the heart attack die, I didn't force the food into his mouth.	<p>So, since it is illegal to discriminate, it is perfectly acceptable to say to someone to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  You may not end up rich but your children will once that generational wealth transfers.

I wanted to argue with you because I believed this was a place where people sincerely changed their views.  However after scrolling through the last few posts, I have to admit you are right. Even anonymously, reddit users care more about appearing right then finding truth. !delta	This is a topic that has prompted a ton of discussion, both internal and external. It's a little bit of an [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) issue, where the regulars are sick to death of seeing these anti-trans threads, but the people posting them are posting them for the first time. And they do lead to people being educated and changing their minds. So how do we balance the potential good of giving people opportunities to overcome their biases and misconceptions against the potential harm of giving people with no intention of changing their views chances to soapbox?	<p>I&#39;m not looking for validation from reddit, but I think you can easily convince people that reddit is a good place to start looking for good information. If you can find it and tell it to you, then it is a great place to begin. I&#37;m looking for people who are willing to share their opinion with you.</p>

>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??	<p>As well I&#39;m really a lot less proud to be Canadian after hearing about these graves and IRS&#39;s than I was before hearing about them. Like that&#39;s really fucked up that MY country did this. I&#39;m not proud of my country for doing that. When I think about IRSs and the graves of innocent children, I am NOT proud of my country. Should I be? Should I look at this information and just maintain the same feelings of national pride I had before learning about this? I don&#39;t think so. </p>	<p>You&#39;re also pointing out the contradictions of the Canadian right to vaccine, which are not inherent to the Canadian Right to Vaccine movement, but that you didn&#37;t make it a point to point out. You did not make it an issue. You clearly didn’t want to be a part of the protests, and you wanted to be able to say that. Now, you can&#38;t do that by simply making it seem like an issue, so that people can point out the inconsistencies and contradictions in the claims.

> And if someone has a view with zero data, providing anything countering their claim is providing the missing data...  Which I did. In the first response to your CMV. Which you ignored. Because it was inconvenient to your view. Which lacks any data.   😂 Funny. But, illogical arguments do not make for more than soapboxing.	<p>Exactly, which is why your request for such data is in bad faith as there can be no charts, graphs or studies that show the extent of this issue, only those cases that are identified and you dismiss as anecdote.</p>	<p>In other words, if you&#39;re not responding to a CMV, it is a waste of your time and your attention. You simply ignored the CMV. Which you ignored. Because it was inconvenient to your view. Which lacks any data. 
Reality has a Liberal bias. When people complain about being forced to watch Liberal media, what they mean is that there aren't enough outlets producing fascist propaganda for them to consume.	<p>Jokes aside, the reason for this is that liberal politics tends (but does not always) err towards scientific consensus, which means you end up with a bit of a feedback loop where more and more of those involved in the field tend toward liberal political leanings, simply because the right rejects them outright, which they find untenable.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t think the media is biased towards Trump. I think it is biased against him, and I think that the media outlets that are biased against Trump are biased towards him because they are trying to suppress his supporters. That is a pretty bad thing to do, and it is not good for anyone to be able to tell which candidate is the right one when it comes to politics.</p>
Well what a dumb fucking point to make then. Of course more people are affected, Christian nations have a higher population than Muslims and a higher gay population because they aren’t executing them.   What an irrelevant and dumb fucking idea to even attempt to bring up as valuable.	But you aren't gonna be successful telling Christians that Christianity is stupid because *you* are just way better at reading the Bible than dummies like St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, **or the fucking Pope.**"	<p>But I don&#39;t think this is a valid position to make. Most of the time, governments in the developed world are trying to suppress the growth of their population, but not all of them succeed. In other words, most of the countries that are struggling to suppress population growth are those that have the largest number of people living in countries where the population is growing rapidly. This is not a valid stance to make, at all. In fact, it is a very bad one to make.</p>
We already have affirmative action programs in place, what do you want us to do, have white people walk in the streets and whip themselves with flagella while saying shame lol. Bro you are being brainwashed by some elite nasty people, you need to wake up sir.	So let’s take the starting assumptions of these two theories, white privilege exists & there is systemic bias against people of color. I think this a fair starting place. But then the offered solutions are let’s dismantle the entire system and rebuild it and let’s teach everyone that white people should be ashamed of their white privilege and be angry with white people today for things white people did hundreds of years ago.	<p>You&#39;re saying that racism is bad and you have to stop doing that. You have to start doing what you want, not what you think you want. You can only do so much if you stop doing what is right and stop doing the things that are wrong. You need to start making racist statements about race, you need to stop making racist claims about race.</p>
> If you managed to achieve that, you would already be a statistical unicorn.  Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns. You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. [And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html) Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  >Of the people who just call 911 in that scenario, I think a higher percentage of them are going to survive to tell their co-workers the next day then those who get out their gun.  That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  To be clear, I have no issues if someone wants to own a "Smart Gun" but any requirements for their use is asinine as they simply are not reliable.	<p>Take off the top 10 dangerous cities in America and suddenly gun statistics don&#39;t look so bad; I mean specifically rifle statistics look phenomenal. You are already 99.9% safe from rifle violence, but the numbers will certainly expand. </p>	<p>The CDC says that a higher percentage of people who use a firearm in self defense are more likely to be killed by a firearm than by a car. The CDC also says that about one-quarter of Americans (about 1-quarter) of the population are likely to have a firearm. That's a pretty high number, and it would be hard to say that the number of people using a firearm is higher. But the CDC says there are at least 10,000 people who have a gun in their hands each year. That&#39;s a pretty low bar to even consider.
I don’t see a single attempt to change your mind that isn’t clearly a case of “no, I got fucked over, other people should, too” or “this world is tough and cruel [the one they didn’t choose to be born into], they gotta learn that.”  OP, I agree with you. No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents’ fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.  FTR, I have a 21 and 18 year old, so please don’t try to claim I don’t have experience.	<p>I mean I hate to break it to you, but as a parent, someday you&#39;re going to screw up. No parent is perfect and most are quite far from it. And believe me, nothing is more effective at making you question authority than seeing your own parents screw up.</p>	<p>I don&#39;t think this is an isolated situation. There are plenty of people who have been through difficult times, and many of them have been able to come out of it unscathed. The ones who have failed so far are the ones who are trying to figure out how to get back up and keep going. It&#37;s not as simple as that. </p>
Your sealioning is really evident, and your refusal to Google these things or accept the mountains of data provided is extremely telling.	I’m sure there are countless topics that I don’t realize I have only seen a biases side of and don’t realize there is another side but the key is when something grabs your attention and seems important, that is the time to really look into it from various sides to try to see what is really going on.  No media is unbiased no matter how honorable their intentions are.  Bias is unavoidable and realizing that is the first step to countering it."	<p>Your ignorance about the data is absolutely astounding, and your unwillingness to even look at it is indicative of a lack of understanding of the data.</p>
To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.	<p>This doesn&#39;t stop it from being racist. Instead, it justifies certain types of racism. Since the term &quot;racism&quot; has a negative connotation, a lot of people feel it&#39;s easier to refer to such policies as not being racist - instead of trying to argue how some forms of racism are justified. The latter is more honest. I&#39;m not even going to go into how affirmative action harms minorities (who are only accepted into universities due to affirmative action).</p>	<p>You&#39;re just saying that racism is a systemic problem that has nothing to do with race. Racism is a result of systemic racism.  Racism doesn&#38;t have to be systemic, it just has to be a systemic issue.  The problem with racism is that it is systemic, not individualized.  So it&#

Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here? Cause a "realist" would clearly see that your engagement in the discussion is 100% ideological motivated.	The problem is that it's not anti-discrimination legislation that segments populations by groups. It's society itself that does that through its biases and the discrimination. Repealing all anti-discrimination legislation tomorrow isn't going to change the fact that people will be seen as part of an identity and a community based on their characteristics. All it will do is allow for the majority to mistreat them based on the characteristics it does or doesn't like.	<p>I don&#39;t think you have to accept that the ""rules"" are bullshit, and I don't believe you need to be persuaded to accept them. I don&*t believe you have any right to make these rules, and you have no right to hold them accountable for the actions of others.</p>

And if you use a very high level program, you are not going to have problems. </p>
USA and Russia started the arms race. They can take the lead.	<p>Saying, &quot;Republicans just have an advantage&quot; is like saying United Russia just has an advantage.  Functionally the latter will control Russia&#39;s fate until they a military backed coup.</p>	<p>I think the US has a responsibility to protect us from these threats. If we don&#39;t do that, we will lose control of our military. We can also not just protect ourselves from the threats of war, we can also prevent them from acting in bad faith. I think we should be able to do that with our military assets.</p>
Go paste it. I believe in you. Prove you're not saving face.	PS committing to being yourself and welcoming rejection is the key to self confidence.</p>	<p>This is the point you are trying to make. You don&#39;t need to be a moral actor to do so. You can just be a human being.</p>
It's not that you are allowed, it's that you SHOULD! If you are a complete textbook affiliate to a party you are the problem with today's society. The lack of freethinking and the "my team" mindset in politics is our biggest issue. You SHOULD disagree with at least SOMETHING in the list of your parties views.	<p>I disagree that it&#39;s bad to have strong political opinions. The alternative is an entirely apathetic electorate, which gives politicians no incentive to serve their constituents as they are sworn to do. When people care, those in charge are held accountable. Even if it means that there are sometimes issues that become too politically charged or divisive, the alternative is worse for democracy.</p>	<p>You are just as susceptible to being manipulated by a certain group of people as anyone else. You are the one who is trying to convince people that you are a bad person, and you are the only one who can do that. You need to be able to convince them that you aren’t bad, but you are just not good enough to be a good person.</p>
I don't like makeup because it hides things.	<p>Either way, you don’t belong on this subreddit. Not because of what you believe, but because of your apparent lack of ability or desire to defend your beliefs. </p>	<p>I don’t like makeup because it hides things. </p>
If I had a guess, I would say you and your husband probably get taken advantage of daily by other people. You already know how to handle this problem, and you are coming to Reddit for some magical solution that doesn’t exist.  Here’s the solution, use your words like adults. This situation is so indicative of our society and it’s infuriating to me. Because is people just learned how to use their words and communicate, the world would be a much better place.   But instead of communicating and engaging in a mature resolution to the problem, you are looking for ways to get payback. AND YOU HAVENT EVEN ATTEMPTED TO TALK TO THE NEIGHBOR YET!!!  OP you may think you are right, when in reality you are just as immature(or more so) than the neighbors you are complaining about.	All fining these companies is going to do is make consumers feel good about themselves. The companies will continue exploiting adults and the kids will probably just go and do something more dangerous than make your tshirts."	<p>It&#39;s clear your problem is not isolated to men, but with women, it is more common to see men being manipulated and manipulated by women. If you ask me how I would feel if I had a penis, I would say that it would be different. If I had an adult male partner, I&#37;d feel like this would be a much better situation for me. I don&#38;t think it is. I think if men were able to learn to do what they want without the distraction of women, I think our society would be much better.
I never forget how old I am myself but every once in a while I remember that I'm consuming content on Reddit from teenagers half my age.	<p>Doubt this has much to do with it. I&#39;m old enough I didn&#39;t have home internet access growing up and still managed to masturbate multiple times a day every day as a teenager.</p>	<p>I&#39;m 20, and every once in a while I find myself scrolling through social media. I can easily see friends who are 20 or older and I often find them scrolling through their pages. They are often young, and I can see their faces in the background and see their lives and their lives changing so rapidly. I don&#
The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.	<p>It doesn&#39;t.  Loads of straight men have sex with other men.  Loads of gay men only have sex with women.  Statistically, of course, gay men are more likely than straight men to have only sex with men and less likely than straight men to have only sex with women.  But having sex is a choice.  Sexual orientation isn&#39;t.</p>	<p>I agree with you, but I think that the popularity of gay men is proportional to the number of women who are attracted to gay men, and I think the fact that there are a lot of straight men attracted to bisexual men (and bisexual men) lends itself well to the idea that bisexual men are more attractive than bisexual men.</p>

So I was right, it's a bit of both.	Well, it kinda does.	<p>So I think that’s a pretty good argument for both of them.
It’s hard to argue. I absolutely agree.	I agree with this part but...	<p>I agree with you, I agree with your point. I believe in good faith. </p>
Lmao Reddit karma = sound argument. I've heard it all.	Okay so like I'm fully aware that you're making sincere arguments and I'm even more acutely aware that it sounds like I'm trolling, but like can you understand that you're saying the same things TERFs say?	<p>I&#39;ve heard it all. I have seen it all.</p>
We understand what you mean , we just disagree .  I've read up and understand how these ideas were formed.  I just think they are bad and make errors.  Im not using concepts I think are ill thought up and conflict with facts.  I think the way gender identity is framed as unfalsifiable makes it lower in the hierarchy of concepts that observable , testable fact.  So I use pronouns for what people are   not what they think they are.	Getting a little more personal, its worth mentioning that its an uncomfortable and slightly sad idea for me that my existence as a trangender person ""undermines"" pre-existing understandings of gender, because we simply don't have the answer to this. Rest assured, I'm not criticizing your point - just responding to it.	<p>I think you are misunderstanding the pronouns, and I don&#39;t think they are correct. I think the pronouns are poorly phrased, and the pronouns should be used as an example of what is wrong with the pronouns.  I think they should be reserved for women, not men.  It&#37;s not the same as saying that men are bad.</p>
Anyone who lies about being rape should be prosecuted.                They should get the same amount of time the person they accused would have gotten.               They should have to register as a sex offender for life.	<p>I don&#39;t think the argument is equal punishment I believe it&#39;s more like they both deserve to be called pieces of crap and the police should use every measure thei have to arrest both people.</p>	<p>If the only person who ever told a rapist they are lying about is a pedophile, that should be a violation of their free speech rights.  If the rapist is caught, they should be tried for rape, and if the child has a history of abuse, then the child should be sent to prison for life.</p>

Oh look, you can read. You just choose to ignore reading the sources I provided that prove you wrong.   Keep on defending rapists. Keep denying women victimize men.   Then fuck off.	Regardless of what she wants, she says she’s not interested, and glorifying the idea that men should ignore her attempts to leave the situation just makes more rapists."	<p>I&#39;m reading through your arguments. I don&#37;t think you have a right to defend rapists, but if you do, then you just continue to ignore the evidence. You just continue ignoring the evidence that proves your point. </p>
This is very true and a major cause of the political division nowadays. The two political parties are becoming more polarized cause their constituents are increasingly treating politics like a religion.	I argue that, many Americans are instead upset because they feel that political discourse is seeping into a space that they feel is apolitical. Thus, the cause is not the only reason for the backlash.	<p>That’s a classic example of political polarization in our country. The polarization caused by the polarization of the political parties is now so great that people are choosing to throw their money at the political party and instead support the candidate who is more popular than them.</p>

I hate when people assume that life on earth is meant to be perfect, as if it’s heaven itself. I’m not going to condone any further. Just wanted to make that statement cause my days of headaches arguing with stupid arguments are over.	Having said that, I consider any discussion with Qanon, anti-vaxer, flat-earth, climate change denier, ultra religious/dogmatic moron a complete waste of time. Such people have no capacity for critical thinking, as evidenced by their beliefs. But try to accept that rational, well meaning people may have spent their entire life in a bubble they didn't create and be honestly ignorant of what's happening outside that bubble."	<p>I hate when people assume that life on earth is perfect, as if it’s heaven itself.

Yeah, I'm brainwashed, not the people who think chopping off healthy body parts is treatment.	My point is that because the brain dead *are* human beings, being human isn't enough to warrant the moral consideration called for by the person I was responding to. Pulling the plug isn't murder.	<p>But I’m not indoctrinated by the idea that fat people should be allowed to have sex, so I don’t think it’s a good thing.

Not to change your view but to chime in on opt-out system elsewhere. Singapore automatically enrolls adults above 21 years old regardless of religion; you can opt out, but you will be moved down the priority list to receive organ donation should you ever need one after opting out	Physical Transition (if desired) follows Affirmation. Social affirmation is pretty much always done immediately. Puberty blocking is done after a decision is made, before the legal age of hormonal therapy is reached. It's not to postpone a decision. And just in case, since 7-8 months ago, the nhs no longer claim it's reversible or doesn't impact development."	<p>You can also opt out of the policy by clicking this link. The policy is that if you don&#39;t want to, you can still opt out. If you do, you will be moved down the priority list to receive organ donation should you ever need one after opting out.</p>
The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I’m lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it’s very comforting to know I have an option.	<p>It is wrong to encourage suicide because you discourage people from trying to fix their life. You discourage hope. You discourage healing. You encourage people to be cowards and give up. That&#39;s the opposite of helpful. Suicidal people often feel helpless or like they have no way to make their situation better, but they&#39;re wrong. We just have to make them see it. Also, if you were to encourage someone and they completed suicide, that would be immediately harmful to their family, friends, coworkers, etc who would have to deal with the grief and readjustment of their lives. Suicide is selfish because it bastardizes the effort of people who have given their blood, sweat, and tears trying to help, and then they traumatize them by dying. Suicide hurts everyone, not just the person who dies. If you encourage suicide, you force grief, and that is very wrong.</p>	<p>I&#39;m also worried about the possibility of people dying from the disease.  It could be that the disease is extremely contagious and a person suffering from it would die from it.  Or, it could be the disease itself.   It&#

I’m fully vaccinated. I’ll get my flu shot and whatever boosters I need every year.  But you sound like you’re in a cult. Your argument has a cult vibe. If you think of it in that frame, you might be able to change your own mind.	<p>What are you talking about?  Yes we have.  Get yourself tested for flu and cold antibodies, I guarantee you have them.  You&#39;re just not <em>totally</em> immune to every strain; you have partial and varying resistances to the whole slew of them, waxing and sometimes waning with time, exposure, and vaccines.  You are born with some you inherit from your mother, you get more from her breast milk, you gain some from exposure over your life, and you develop them from vaccines.  Same thing will happen with COVID.</p>	<p>The flu is a pretty big deal in the US, and I&#39;ve been vaccinated for years, and every year I get sick I get vaccinated for the flu. I have a vaccine that I take every time I go to the doctor. So it&#37;s not a big deal for me to get vaccinated, but if I get a flu, I can take it. </p>

I said prescription drugs after you edited your comment to narrow down to a specific decade. All of those things have been used to treat hysteria, factually.

Six times this has been explained, and you're still arguing something irrelevant to the comment you first replied to. Stupid people are so tiring.	I've read down this far, and every time someone comes up with a well thought out argument, you respond by changing the goalposts (""I meant *illegal* drugs""), repeating misinformation/propaganda as fact (""Drugs aren't illegal for social reasons""), or other disingenuous things (like a completely unfounded claim about impaired driving statistics based on your own speculative opinion that you haven't even actually researched).	<p>I was talking about drugs that were used to treat mental illness.  It was the first time I ever heard someone say that a substance abuse problem was a mental health issue, and it was the only time I heard people say that.  You are wrong.

There is no future for the meat industry.  You are suggesting that farmers would simply pay to destroy their only assets, destroying their business and choosing bankruptcy in one fell move? Instead of making a significantly more passive income from supplying to the organic fertilizer industry and local arable, fruit and etc farmers which would boom in response to the massive increase in demand.   Forgive me for calling BS, you come off as either a fantasists, delusional, or just intentionally feigning ignorance in an attempt to justify the continuation of what you have always considered the norm.  Yes I'm alright but I'm getting tired of obtuse poorly thought out opinions and having to hear them come out of what I would hope are usually intelligent people, it's extremely wearing.	<p>Except we haven&#39;t stopped breeding dogs, we just control their population. And we continue to breed them because there is a massive demand for them as pets. By eliminating the meat trade you would eliminate all demand for animals such as chickens. If no one buys chickens for food or eggs, then no one will keep chickens around. You&#39;re right that this probably wont result in their killing, as that takes time and resources. Rather farmers would probably just release them all into the wild where they&#39;ll die from starvation, unable to acquire food for themselves, or be mercilessly devoured by local predators.</p>	<p>Agriculture is one of the most poorly run industries in the world. You don&#39;t need a huge farm to support your crops, you can only rely on a small number of cows and a relatively large number of chickens. You can only grow one or two crops per hectare, which is what we need for a decent living. Growing crops is inefficient, inefficient and inefficient, and inefficient. Growing food requires a huge number of inputs, which leads to inefficient, wasteful and inefficient farming.</p>

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.	<p>You listen to them because that truth is the most cosiest one. People only consum the media that strengthens they own few. If you really want to know what is going on try to expand your horizons. A good start is &#39;this American life&#39;, &#39;citations neede&#39; and maybe objective news. Like BBC</p>	<p>If you&#39;re looking for a therapist, there are a lot of resources out there. I know you are in the US, but I have personally never heard of someone saying that &quot;I can&#37;t relate to them. I have never heard anyone say that they are victims of sexual abuse. I don&#38;t think they are. I think they have a lot to do with it. They are also trying to help people feel better about themselves and their relationships. </p>
I've already said why.	i already said that (and yes they do)	<aphrase: I already said that.
I think while it is arguable that the state should decide if I know trigonometry or not, you can go and fuck right off if you think I should have stronger community values or be more considerate.   It seems you really are approaching compelling a certain worldview. You think the range of views under your framework is wide and acceptable, but that is probably only because you don't possess a worldview outside of that	I also firmly believe that it feels to us like we have free will, so I act accordingly. You can keep missing the point of my responses on purpose if you want, but I'm not going to be convinced by that. Do you think free will not existing, but functionally it feels like it does, is an impossible thing?	<p>I think it’s fair to point out that there are other ways of doing things, and I think that having a coherent worldview is one of them. You can’t make a coherent argument based on one viewpoint, but you can certainly make one based on another based off of one viewpoint. If you can”t make coherent arguments based on that viewpoint, then you can still make your own argument, which is fine, but I don’m not sure how you can do that. I think you can make a more coherent argument with your own arguments.</p>

because...  you don't like that ur racism is being exposed?  it exposes the war on white people you've been trying to covertly wage- and u can't covertly do anything if it's brought to light?  is that why?  "to see who rules over you- simply find who you are not allowed to criticize"  -voltaire  I find it interesting how quickly those with even a little bit of power rush in to desperately silence any talk of how the roles are being reversed.  liberals openly denigrate white people in private and in public but bringing it up gets u silenced.  I wonder why?  I wonder what ur group is trying to cover up?	<p>That’s why if you read between the lines: we aren’t about race but about oppressive systems and the white race happens to sit atop because of history. That’s why being anti system is erroneously perceived as being anti white by some idiots. Athletes kneeled down to denounce systemic racism, immediately idiots change the narrative for « they’re protesting against us/our country »</p>	<p>And if you&#39;re looking for a solution to the problem, why would you not look into it? Because it&#37;s a very different issue than the one you are discussing here. The problem is that a lot of white people are looking for the solution, not the solution itself. You don&#38;t want to admit that you are racist, but you don't want to acknowledge that. So you are looking to the solution by identifying the problem as systemic racism, and then you will see people who are doing the exact opposite of what you are saying. And you will
If you eliminate rental properties, then demand for decent property to own would go WAY up. Then home prices would skyrocket along with the number of trailer parks.  That's how economics works. Landlords make it possible for young people with limited resources to have a safe place to live.  I rented for 16 years before buying a house.	<p>When we had our first child we knew we wanted to move out of that neighborhood to a better one by the time they reach school age. We scrimped and saved every penny. When we finally got to the point we could afford to buy a new house (took about 4 years of saving). We decided to rent our duplex since the housing market was cheap at the time. That&#39;s when we found out how difficult it can be to be a landlord. The local municipalities have all kinds of expensive regulations to adhere to, to protect renters. Now, we had two properties to maintain. Also, the process of weeding through potential tenants can be very daunting. Our hard work paid off. Over the 5 years we rented we had wonderful tenants and we never raised the rent regardless of the prevailing rent prices around us. When the housing market came back we sold at a modest profit. </p>	<p>If you&#39;re not able to afford a decent home, the cost of living would skyrocket. You would also be forced to live in a place where the population is very low. You could have a housing market collapse, and people would sell their homes to get a better quality of life, but you would still be short on housing.  You would be short of money.  So you would be out of luck, and you would have to sell your home for a decent price.</p>
Logically you are correct  if it's offensive to do it to one culture its offensive to do it to all cultures. But the die hard sjws only care about nonwhite cultures being appropriated. Because cultural appropriation is racist and you can't be racist against white people because they have all the power. At least that's how my former liberal friends screamsplained it at me when I made tacos for my superbowl party.	<p>In my hypothetical, that driver is also not getting vaccinated because they &quot;know their own health risks&quot; better than the vast majority of doctors, and they also design disgusting burgers because they know better than the chef.</p>	<p>I agree with you but I think it&#39;s a bit hypocritical to say that the only thing that separates white people from black people is the fact that white people are disproportionately disadvantaged and disproportionately disadvantaged. And that doesn&#37;t mean that racism is okay. I mean, I think that all white people should be able to have a decent time at a party and enjoy the culture, but I don&#38;t think that being able to do that would be the same thing. And I think having a fair amount of tolerance for white people is fine, but not when you&#

The joke when it comes to health care in the state is that we currently pay the most for it and get some of the worst bang for the buck.   If I'm a citizen making 20 k a year health care is free.   I would much rather have a free service from the government in which where I'm guaranteed health care than the piecemeal system we currently have.	Add in the facts that controlling costs with Medicaid and Medicare forces companies to charge its paying customers more to cover bottom line and profits. The end customer doesn't really see costs since insurance obfuscates the price. American demographics are also highly skewed towards higher cost per individual plus more individuals in the system that anywhere else, 300 million. Also, the American medical system is one of the most regulated markets in the world. It's a perfect storm of half measures. There's no other system quite like the American medical system in the world to compare.	<p>I&#39;d prefer to have private insurance, but I think that if you have a private insurance program that covers most of the cost of your care, then you can have a much better quality of life. But if you choose to pay for private insurance you will be at a higher risk of not being able to afford it. And if you don&#37;t want private insurance then you could get private insurance that covers all the costs of your services. </p>
Totally an asshole move to chastise people for having more children than you deem appropriate. Let people live, damn.	Also what about the complete sexism in custody battles and what about the abolishment of child support? Do you support those things because all that negatively harm men more then it does women."	<p>It&#39;s an easy argument to make, but I think it’s a bit over-simplified. You can have more children than you want, and you can also have more child support than you need.</p>
Clarification =/= lying my guy. I may have phrased it poorly but that doesn't mean I'm acting in bad faith or gaslighting. First off, It's literally impossible for me to gaslight in this situation because there is a history of what I've said. Secondly, saying someone is lying when they misspeak is disingenuous and toxic, and am *actual example of gaslighting.* How could you possibly know my intent better than me?	<p>How is that a misinformed position? Its still a lie, you said so yourself: He knew the effectiveness of masks, and he decided to tell the public otherwise. You might think that it&#39;s a reasonable lie to make, given the circumstances. Personally, now I know that the CDC has no problem misrepresenting things if it thinks it will cause major undesirable problems if there is a truth they know but don&#39;t want revealed to the public. This makes me have to think twice when I hear something from them that sounds counter-intuitive to me, if I think there&#39;s a reason they&#39;d prefer people to think that than to know what they know. In short, it seriously damaged the CDC&#39;s reputation for me, which already wasn&#39;t stellar.</p>	<p>I may have phrased poorly but that doesn’t mean I’m incapable of understanding or responding to your questions. I may have misquot; but I don’T think I am capable of understanding the nuance of the situation.  I am incapable of explaining the nuance or nuance of a situation because I am not able to predict the outcome.  This is why I dislike you so much.  You’re just as susceptible to being manipulated and manipulated as I am to being betrayed.  </p>

The CDC is saying that people who are vaccinated are more likely to survive if they are given the vaccine than if they were given the vaccines. You&#37;re arguing that vaccines should protect against pathogens, not protect against them. </p>

I just think using logic to argue for god is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove."	<p>The OP is not trying to make an argument that racism is inherent in all forms of oppression.

Christian conservatives(maybe not as hostile generally but very oppressive   3. laws that don't protect us around the world(many laws of oppression still exist)   .. after that i think it gets a bit more confusing as to where the source is.. but there sure are a lot of assholes out there.	<p>Not criticising the extremist aspects of Islam actually harms moderate Muslims who are lumped in with the extremists and gives actual racists the opportunity to recruit more people as the perception is that the mainstream left are hypocrites who condemn in Christianity what they seem to ignore or excuse in Islam (I won&#39;t go as far to say &quot;condone&quot; as I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard many on the left say they agree with the more extremist aspects of Islam, but &quot;condone&quot; could be used if meaning staying silent)</p>	<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that all conservatives are bad people, but I think there&#37;s a lot of people who think that being gay is a bad thing and that it&#38;s okay to be gay but that&#

Based solely on the title, I agree completely.  To me, the answer is a very small tax on assets. People who accumulate a lot to themselves drain the economy and distort society with their increasing wealth gap.	<p>Most people who run corporations like this only care about their avarice, their love of wealth, their obsession of maximizing profits. With little care for the well-being of their labor or the working class in general. What matters is money, money, money. Not just profitability, an unsustainable and harmful level of wealth generation that engenders the conditions that increase suicides.</p>	<p>I agree with you in your argument that there is a huge wealth drain from society. However, I think that only one of those things is a wealth drain. The other is a massive debt, which is caused by the fact that there are too many people in the world, and the debt is the largest issue. The debt is more than enough to provide a decent living for everyone. It should be able to be used as a tool to create more wealth. But it doesn&#39;t have to be. The problem is that debt can be used to finance growth and development. </p>

Firstly. Didn't say ban renting. I said give it over to the local authority.  And secondly the fact you don't realise that in the UK the local authority (council) were in charge of building houses from 45-79 and you think it's somehow some communist utopia shit. Or are you saying the country which every other country has based it's housing regulations on for how good they are is communist?  I didn't even advocate anything socialist you moron. This is just social democracy in a capitalist state.	And, specifically, in our democratic socialist society in our capitalist economy, taxes help balance these things. We don't let people show up at the ER and die just because they don't have insurance. We, as a society through Congress, decided in the 1940s that we wouldnt let workers have to work until they died, or become disabled, widowed, or children just starve.	<p>I don&#39;t think I said that. I said let people buy their own homes and sell them at a reasonable price. That&#37;s not socialism, but capitalism. You think that if you can just give people the choice to live in one or two homes, you can have a decent life, but if you give people a choice of living in a home that is affordable and free for everyone, then you are not living in socialism at all.</p>

I agree with you completely, but as a white guy when I get asked about race on an application that spends more time talking about efforts at diversity than the job requirements… it’s clear I’m not the type of applicant they’re looking for.  Honestly though this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.  The sooner we start focusing on giving everybody an equal opportunity in life instead of measuring equality by outcomes, the better.	<p>Then write this to the OP of the CMV article? I don&#39;t think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn&#39;t be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can&#39;t even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not sure how you know that, but it&#37;s obvious that they don&#38;t want to recruit people who are white or black, because they think they can be hired by white companies, but then they decide to not hire people from predominantly white companies. I think that would be a pretty bad thing to do, but I don&39;t see how that could happen.  They just don't need to recruit white people to be hired.  I think it would be pretty bad for people who have a higher likelihood of being hired
I know what you're intentions are posting here. You are trying to make it come across like what I've said is confusing when you know fully well you are the one trying to confuse and dilute the conversation. How about answering what your thoughts were on the article about Covid vaccine passport chips being created in Sweden? Like are you really going to try to discredit me by saying key terms you think will help label me as a deranged person, when the topic you bring up is a literal thing being implemented in real life. Are you going to pretend like the world economy isn't on the brink of collapse because of the pieces of shit in global power who failed to respond an international pandemic with a sense of duty, and instead chose to find ways to profit off of it at the sake of millions of deaths? Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?   If the answers to those questions are yes, then I want you to know I truly think you are a pathetic person who brings no value to society, and you should shut your fucking mouth when others are trying to have grown up conversations about crime and corruption.	As to the part about the government having confusing messaging, I would encourage you to try and separate the guidance on vaccines, which has largely been consistent and is in line with the guidance the rest of the world is getting, and messaging regarding other of health practices like mask, social distancing, isolation, etc. I could go into detail as to why the messaging wasn't consistent but long story, short, messaging regarding mitigation steps will always evolve when dealing with a novel virus, and things like shutdowns have an added economic and policital element to them that vaccines don't have."	<p>You&#39;re trying to discredit me by misrepresenting my opinion and making it seem like I was an intellectual dummy. You are not, and I&#37;m not, an intellectual maverick. It&#38;s a symptom of a larger systemic issue. That is, not a cure for global warming. It is a symptom. The real issue is that the US government is failing to protect citizens from global warming, which is why the global economy is suffering. </p>
They're just mad that the heroes of newer TV shows don't get to be openly racist and misogynistic and still be the good guys. The old racist shit is still up on Netflix or Hulu or whatever streaming service you prefer if they really want to watch it. The newer stuff is just better.	<p>Frankly, a lot of what you wrote seems to be just sour grapes that they make content that you don&#39;t like. Netflix should make content to satisfy their different types of viewers. If they made only the critically acclaimed movies that you mentioned, they would not achieve commercial success. Let&#39;s face it, the average viewer is not that discerning.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not saying that they don&#37;t care, but if they want to watch a lot of black and white shows, they can. And if they don’t, then they can still watch Black Panther on Netflix or whatever streaming service you prefer if they really want to. The newer stuff is just better. The ones that are on Netflix are still the ones that have the biggest impact on black people. </p>

CMV: Student debt shouldn't be cancelled. I was making 60k a year out of school with 50k of loan. I lived very frugally for 3 years ( shared accommodation, no car, barely eating out, no vacations) to get rid of that debt. I don't fucking want to pay more taxes for other people to get rid of their debt.	<p>I decided to rent out my house when I was living overseas, and decided I wasn&#39;t going to go back to the states.  Instead of maintaining a house that I only occupied for at most 45 days per year, I decided to rent it out. Rent is set to market rate, not to how much you pay in mortgage.  I have friends that the rent doesn&#39;t even cover their mortgage.  In my case, my house had been paid off for 2 years before I decided to rent it out , so I was fine. </p>	<p>Also, I don&#39;t think you should be forced to live in a society where everyone has a debt. I could live on 100k and get a decent living, but that&#37;s a lot of debt. And having a debt that is so high that you can barely afford to pay it off is not a big deal. So I&#
>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having rac	Racism"" has evolved as well. It used to be a catch-all for anybody experiencing degradation from another race, but now it's evolved to the use of degradation to keep a minority/marginalized group ""down"". That's why white people (in America) can't experience ""racism"", because it's not a tactic used by people in positions of power to keep the white race from advancing its standing in America. This is why you'll often hear ""systemic racism"". So while white people can still experience ""prejudice"", they can't experience ""racism.""	<p>I don&#39;t think we need to redefine the definition of race as a whole. We can still define it as something that is inherent to our culture and our system, and we can even redefine it as a category of races. It&#37;s not as simple as that, but it is more complex than that. The only way we can redefine race is if we define it in terms of the degree of severity of the problem, and then we can just redefine how it should be represented.  We can only do that if we can

Not sure what you are trying to say here.  >There are over 11 million small businesses. Meaning 11 million small business owners. Do you really think 11 million is a small number?  Again, we are talking about means of production. Being a self employed accountant isn't it pal.

Ok so you're not even going to try to speak honestly? You're just going to blatantly lie? Ok, nothing more to say then. Pretty pathetic.

As a bit of trivia:  re: redistribution of high level employees wages — this would generally have very little effect.  The number of low-wage employees is so huge that you can, for example, divide a CEO’s entire wage amongst them and you’ll get something like $5 - $10 *month* difference for even smallish businesses.  And just a few cents for huge places like Walmart with millions of employees.   — The human mind like to compare exemplars (example individuals) to each other and neglects scale.  Things like CEO and related salaries are usually a very, very tiny % of a businesses operating costs."	<p>I&#39;m not claiming that the size of the population is representative of the national average, but I think that it is a reasonable estimate. The average American would be about 10% of the world’s population. In other words, about 11% of American adults are considered “small business”, which means that there are at least 11 million people in the world who are considered to be small business owners. This is a pretty small number.

Hm - where have I seen that before? seems so familiar.	<p>The idea that vaccines can cure everything is a pretty silly one. It&#39;s not the first time this has happened, but it was a very effective way of legitimizing it. You could have the government force people to give vaccines to non-vaccinated people, then force them to take them, and then have them die, then have their brains mutilated by the vaccine (or whatever) they choose to take. It would be the most effective way to legitimize the drug, and it would also be the best way to stop it from spreading misinformation. It could also be used as a

The easiest one for me to personally compare to is Canada, since I went to school there and considered staying permanently, and know many classmates who did. It is <em>wildly</em> more difficult to immigrate to Canada than the US. If you don&#39;t have a skill or education that makes you uniquely employable, you&#39;re probably not getting in. If you don&#39;t speak the language (in Quebec, that&#39;s English AND French), you&#39;re probably not getting in. If you&#39;re not the right age, you&#39;re probably not getting in. They have very high standards, and if you don&#39;t meet them, they just say no; in the US, almost anyone can come, it just takes some time and commitment.</p>	<p>I&#39;m under the impression that most developed nations are incapable of doing anything about it, and the US is the only one that can do anything about them, because it lacks the political will to do so. </p>
