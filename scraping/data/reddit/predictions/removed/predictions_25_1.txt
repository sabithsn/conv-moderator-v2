[They say it’s to shift plan as opposed the more common sense reason: to highlight the hypocrisy](https://i.imgur.com/BpuHhvg.jpg)

Truth:
<p>Edit to add: and also equate justification with incitement, which is objectively wrong. You need some definitions to help you out?</p>

Prediction:
<p>It’s also the case that you can’t change the past. It’ll only improve the future.”</p><a href=""https://imgur.com/BpuHgvg.jpg">#39;</a>
<p>It’s as if the government is trying to make the situation worse by trying to get more people to switch sides.</p>
<p>You’re trying to take away the moral superiority of the left. You’ve got to stop pretending that they are “right”.</p>

It's almost like too many people still worship Trump. Notice how Trump only exists in America as well as the extreme push against vaccines, and America has the most deaths despite starting in China.

Truth:
People like to say its ""nazi"" esq, yet 10 million plus Uighurs are living, working and eating alongside everyone else. As conservatives love to say, follow the law and you won't be punished. If you do actions that might support or encourage a terrorist group, you will be punished regardless of your ethnicity as Han Chinese have been executed for similar crimes.  The alleged ""genocide"" I would clarify doesn't actually involve killing. Not even the far fetched sources report mass killings. On top of this the majority of law abiding Uighers are free and living normally in China among other Chinese, enjoying their benefits as they should.

Prediction:
<p>Trump is also the most anti-vaccinated person I have ever known. He has the highest rate of deaths in the world and is the most popular politician in the US. He’s also one of the most unpopular politicians in the country. His policies have led to a massive increase in deaths, and he’ll continue to do so despite the fact that the country has the lowest rate of abortions in the developed world. He is a fraud and a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Trump is one of the most corrupt politicians in the world, and yet he&#39;s still the most popular politician in the country. His policies are incredibly anti-vaxx, anti-vaccinated, and anti-transphobia. His administration has a lot of bad policies that have led to a massive drop in the number of deaths. And yet he still gets elected and still has a huge amount of support from the left.</p>
<p>It&#39;s sad to see how many people are still against the vaccine despite the fact that we have the highest percentage of people who are vaccinated.  This is the second highest rate of deaths in the world, after the US.  And I think the vaccine is the most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus.  You can see why so many people want to kill the vaccine.  I&#40;m not saying the vaccine isn’t safe, but the vaccine itself is not safe.  It’s just not working.

Ewwww. . .I mean, I'd take a second glance at her leaked nudes, but date her? She got me fucked up. It's not socially acceptable to date someone with a significantly lower IQ than me.  That would be the equivalent of me taking the girl with down syndrome to prom for social credit. It's innocent on the outside, but really creepy if you peel back the layers.

Truth:
Saying Rittenhouse shouldn't have the right to defend himself for being out after curfew at a riot is like saying a woman should lose her right to consensual sex if she dresses like a slut and gets absolutely wasted.

Prediction:
<p>You’re right, I’m not going to take a second look at her leaked nudes. She’s not a good person. She isn’t a great person, and she’d be a bad person. I don&#39;t want to be a hypocrite, and I don't want her to be able to say anything to me about it. I wouldn&#40;t even want to admit that she was a fucking hypocrite. I would not want her in my life. I”m not a bad human being.
<p>I don&#39;t think I should be offended by her behavior just because I think she is a good person or something. I also don’t think it’s right to judge someone for being an idiot. I think it is morally wrong to judge a person for having a low IQ, and I think that is the whole point of it. I’m not saying that because I don”t think she’d have a better chance of finding a job than I do of finding one. That would be a real shame. </p>
<p>And the fact that I&#39;m a straight up racist is just stupid. I&quot;m not a racist. I don't care what your opinion is. I just want to be able to laugh and laugh at the absurdity of it all. I mean, let's say you are a straight white dude, but if you are straight white, you don&#40;t have to be racist to get a job, right? I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I do know that it’s not right to feel sorry for yourself.

Isn’t it just common sense to buy stock in a company that you know is going to skyrocket? I hate everything about the vaccine mandates, and I believe that the vaccine is complete garbage, but I bought 100 shares of Pfizer as soon as I heard that they were going to be one of the top vaccines available…  I won’t put it in my arm, but I’ll put their money in my wallet.  Now if only I had listened to my buddy and bought those damn tesla shares at $369…

Truth:
<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is also in part back door gun control, a la 2012 Obama DHS where they were buying billions of rounds of ammunition for the simple sake of starving availability on the market. DHS discretionary spending report for the year will not be released until after October, but who knows. Would be curious to study that when it comes out.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’re not going to get the vaccine. It’s too late. If you’ve got the vaccine, you should get it now. If not, then let the vaccine be the best thing you can do for your kids. I don’t think we’ll be able to afford it. We’d be better off getting the vaccine if we just let it go. If the vaccine works, we can pay for it. So if we want to get it, then we can buy it now.</p>
<p>If you want to say that I am against the vaccine, you can say that you’re against it because I don’t agree with the idea. I’m not against the vaccines, I just think that they’d be better off if you could give me the vaccine at a lower price. I also think that the vaccine will be a better option than the one Pfizer currently has and I have no problem with that. I think it’s a good idea to give them the vaccine for the sake of their patients. But I also do not agree with Pfizer’

How about we just all identify as vaccinated?   I mean if their side can identify as a purple spotted giraffe, and we have to accept it, then they can accept what we identify as!

Truth:
Full vaccination? The CDC says themselves that those who are vaccinated can get and spread the virus. Ireally hope I do not have to provide proof on the CDC point, especially with the left being arbiters of science. They should know. It only helps to lessen the symptoms. So that is obviously not the plan. Also with consistent variants, we will have to consistently do boosters.

Prediction:
<p>You can’t get a vaccine if you’re not vaccinated. I’m not a vaccine expert. I think the vaccine is the best option for those who are vaccinated. If you are vaccinated, you are not going to get a bad flu shot. It’s not the best choice for you. You have to get the vaccine.”
<p>The vaccine isn&#39;t for everyone, it’s for everyone. The vaccine is for everyone.</p>
<p>So you have to get vaccinated? I mean if the vaccine is not effective, then you can get vaccinated. If you don&#39;t get vaccinated, then your body will have to accept the vaccine. If not, then it won&#40;t work. </p>

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!

Truth:
<p>However, enforcement was a tricky subject. Any time a politician said we need to prosecute unregistered firearms hard and start throwing the book at them you would get pushback because that would disproportionately affect the black community. Historically, the government has found various ways to try to discourage minorities from legally owning guns in a way that rural whites never fully experienced, so there is some grounding there.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not sure why you’d think that would change, but I’ve seen it happen in other states. It’s not like we’re trying to push a button on the issue of race, but it is happening in Texas. You can’t change the history of the state, but the state of Texas has a history of doing so. We’ll see what happens with the current political climate. There are still people who want to ban black people from entering the state. We are not allowed to ban them from the state because they are not black

Defend her rights, sure. She a Marxist,  and by definition marxists are domestic enemies.  She should be on trial,  not in any position of power. I would not lift a fitness to stop her or anyone like her from being drug or off office and out into the street.  We're in thecurrent mess because we stopped McCarthyism and have been playing nice with degenerates and enemies of America for the better part of a century. It has to stop soon or the country is lost.

Truth:
<p>Couldn’t agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn’t matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns. If not, then we just become another failed authoritarian state with no freedom. People who are deluded enough to attack others over differences of opinion threaten our freedom. They’re just doing the corrupt government’s job, shutting up dissenters and allowing them to function completely unchecked.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’re wrong to think that because she’s a “left wing” she is “anti-American”. She is a racist and a bigot. She should be fired from her job, but she isn’t. She’d be fired for being a hypocrite. She isn”t a racist or anti-Semite. If she”s going to be fired, she should be removed from her position. She&#39;s not a leftist, she&#40;s an anti-American. She &#39";s
<p>This is a farce. I’m not saying she’s a racist or a hypocrite, but she is not a liberal. She is a communist and she is a racist. She should be fired from her job and locked up for being a communist.  If she is fired, she should be thrown out of office.  She isn’t a racist, she”s a leftist, and she should not be fired.  I”m sure she would have been fired if she weren”t trying to help her country.  The country is in a bad place
<p>I would never agree with her, but I don’t think she’s a racist. I think she should be shamed for her actions, and I think it’d be a shame if she were in office, but she could be fired for being a racist, if she wanted to. If she was fired she would be fired, she would have to be thrown in jail. She’ll be fired as well, because she was a horrible person. She&#39;s a fucking hypocrite. She should be thrown out of the office for not being a decent person.

Sorry for being impolite to traitors. No evidence of fraud, but I’m supposed to just trust this fishy gut feeling that trump supporters are getting. The proper avenue to challenge an election is to go to the courts , which they did and the courts sent them home. Conservative, trump appointed judges mind you. I have nothing against going to the courts. I do have a problem with Jan 6 and the fact that they’re still pushing this lie

Truth:
<p>Reasonable people get taken in on scams all the time. Trump resonated with people for a reason, and arrogantly dismissing that to stroke your own ego just ensures the field remains ripe for a recurrence. Even if you don&#39;t think they&#39;re particularly reasonable, or even if you think they&#39;re particularly unreasonable, it doesn&#39;t hurt you to treat people with respect. If folks on both sides of the spectrum remembered that a little more often, it would go a long way towards innoculating America against a second January 6th. The way y&#39;all treat eachother, on both sides, is abysmal.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don’t think there’s any evidence of fraud in the election. I don&#39;t think they’re going to get away with it. If they do, then they should be able to move on and not be surprised by the results of the election, which is exactly what they did. I’m not saying they should have won, but I think they should. They should be allowed to do their own thing. They shouldn&#40;t have to.
<p>The fact that they’re still trying to convince the public that there’s no evidence of fraud is not a reason to believe that the election was rigged. They were trying to tell the people that there was no fraud. They’ve been lying to the public for months. They don’t want to hear it. They want to convince people that it was rigged, which is a scam. They also want to make it look like there was fraud, not a fraud. I’m not going to let them get away with it. I have no reason to think they are lying
<p>I&#39;m not a believer in election fraud, I&#40;m also not a fan of it, but I don't think you can say the same thing about the election results. You can&#38;t make up your own mind about it, and you can’t say that’s not the case. If the election was rigged, you’d know it was rigged. You’re not going to find out until the next election. I don&#41;t think the election is rigged, or rigged, and I don &#39

IDGAF about her, but the principle of banning for wrongthink is troubling

Truth:
<p>As for MTG, she is bonkers, but the established precedent for deplatforming for wrong think is deeply troubling.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m sorry to see this, but the idea of banning people for being a bigot is just wrong.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t agree with her on anything, but I also don&quot;t like the way she treats conservatives. I don&*t agree that she should be banned from the United States for her actions, but she should not be banned for her beliefs.</p>
<p>This is a very real issue, and the fact that you are doing it in the name of protecting the rights of others is very, very sad.</p>

agreed the jews were very mean to hitler, who was trans and just trying to be xerself  https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nazi-doctors-hitler-was-gay-took-female-hormones

Truth:
<p>U much prefer &quot;drumph is a racist hitler and must be stopped&quot; from the fake news washington post loll</p>

Prediction:
<p>I agree with the statement that this was a racist hate crime, and that it was racist to use the term “transphobia” when it was used in the past. It’s also very offensive to use it in the context of a hate crime against trans people.  It is racist to call transphobia a “morality” and to call it “gender identity”.  I agree with it.  But it is also racist and offensive to call someone transphobic.  You are a bigot.  What are you against? </p>
<p>The worst thing about it is that it’s not about the trans community, but about the fact that it&#39;s about the LGBT community, not the people who are anti-trans.  It&#40;s just about the whole trans community and what they think.  They’re trying to hide it from you because you’ve been sexually harassed by trans people for years.   The people who want to hurt you are the ones who want you to be left alone.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why people are so critical of the Trump administration, because it’s anti-transphobia, anti-misogyny, and anti-Semitism. I think the president wants to punish trans people for being trans, but I don&#40;t think he’ll do it. I don’t think the Trump Administration should be criticized for it. They’re also not doing it because they’ve been criticized for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus, which is anti-vaxxer, and harmful to the environment

No, that's a false equivalence. You're not morally obligated to support a company if you own it's stock. I own stock to make money, that's all. Same as most of everyone else.

Truth:
<p>I honestly don&#39;t understand why stock buyback is not taxed hired or banned It serves no purpose, other than provide a tax loophole which many companies exploit.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think that is a good thing. I think it is morally wrong to support a company that makes money when you’re not doing your job. It&#40;s not a good idea to not do your job and not do it for the sake of your company.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think the government should be able to make money from the companies that invest in them. The government should have the power to make decisions on behalf of the people who own them. It shouldn&#40;t be the responsibility of the government to make those decisions.</p>
<p>There is no reason why I should not buy stock in a company that makes money. There is no moral reason to buy a stock in the first place. It is not a business. It isn’t a political issue. It’s just a business issue.</p>

I bet she is vaccinated too, just hoping to get supporters from antivaxxers imo

Truth:
I’m telling you, lots of Covid is being spread amongst the vaccinated with their “freedom” under the false / fauci pretense they are protected against covid.

Prediction:
<p>That&#39;s not to say that they are not getting vaccinated. They are just doing it to get the word out. I think they are doing it because they know the vaccine is good for the immune system.</p>
<p>I hope she gets vaccinated soon.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to get the vaccine in the first place. If you need it, I’d be glad to get it.</p>

<p>It’s possible to have a broken clock and not know what time it is.  Even a good hour is not enough time to know when the clock is going to start.  The clock is always right.  I don’t know how long it will take to get to it.  </p>

Because the answers don't draw the results in observation and the vaccine implementation actually resulted in more deaths in testing. We also have the CDC tampering with data and the drug companies being made immune from prosecution. If vaccines work, why are there more deaths this year than last?

Truth:
Didn't Biden run on the promise that he would end covid? But, DESPITE HAVING A VACCINE, there have been more covid deaths under Biden than Trump? How do you reconcile that?

Prediction:
<p>It’s not as if the vaccine was the only thing that went wrong. It was the fact that the vaccine didn’t work. The fact that it was the first time in history that we got a vaccine is why we got it and why we’re not getting a second one. The vaccine is not working. The reason it’d work is because the vaccine has been around for so long that we don&#39;t know how long it will be used. If you’ve never had a vaccine, why are you still using it?</p>
<p>The CDC has not been able to prove that the vaccine is safe. The CDC has been unable to prove it is safe because of the risk of false positives. The FDA has also been able not to prove the vaccine works at all. There are still many unanswered questions, including how to ensure that the vaccines are safe and effective. The vaccine is not meant to be used to protect people from disease. There is no vaccine that will protect them from infection. There isn’t a vaccine that can protect you from infection.</p>
<p>It’s not as if the vaccine didn’t work, which is why there’re more deaths in the US than there have been in the past decade. If the vaccine works, then the CDC will be able to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective. If not, the CDC can be able make it more difficult for people to get the vaccine.</p>

You are not naturally vaccinated you goober. Having COVID and then catching it again is actually a marker for a bad reaction, not a lesser one.      &nbsp;   >But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.  Your mind has been poisoned with lies. You don't have natural immunity and tons of people on HermanCainAwards were previously infected with COVID at the start of this nonsense, and then die when they catch it again. Your a fool.

Truth:
When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not a doctor, nor am I a medical expert, but I don&quot;t think there is any such thing as a cure for COVID. I&#40;ve never had a case of COVID, nor have I ever had a problem with it. I have no idea how anyone got it, and I know that my doctor isn&#37;t a doctor or a pharmacist, but he doesn&#38;t know how to make people feel better about themselves, so I don't think he should be able to make me feel better.
<p>If you don&#39;t have the vaccine, then you&quot;re not getting the vaccine. The vaccine is not a vaccine. It is a preventative measure. It will not help you when you get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Also, the CDC doesn&#39;t have a vaccine for COVID. It does not have a cure. You have to get the vaccine to get it, and it will be extremely difficult for you to get a cure if you get it.  It is not a cure, it is a vaccine. It is a disease that is spread through the body.  The vaccine works for you, not for me.  I will not use it for my own benefit.  If I get a vaccine, I will get it and I will be fine.</p>

The current Republicans are more likely to be supported by voters who don't know the history of the Civil War (hint:  the Southern states seceded over wanting to continue slavery).  Dixie flag and all that.    More concerning is why any elected official, of any party, would think it acceptable to proclaim registered American citizens not be allowed to vote because of what state they lived in previously?  That's the part to focus on  because it's unAmerican.

Truth:
If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.

Prediction:
<p>I also think the current political system is just too racist and anti-American to allow minorities to vote, which is a shame because the current system has always been a racist system, and I think it's also racist to allow people to vote when they don’t want to. It’s not the same as allowing black people to run for office, but it’d be a bad thing to allow them to vote because they are black.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to ban people from voting, you can simply ban them from voting because they don&#39;t know the history of the Civil War. If you have a history of slavery, then you should have known that it was a civil war, not a civil rights struggle. </p>And so, the question is, why would you want people to refuse to vote for you?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why they want to ban black people from voting, but I do know that they have a higher likelihood of voting because of the Civil War and the fact that they are born in a different state than most white people.  What I don’t know is why they would want black people to vote.  I also don”t think that’s a good thing, because I think it’d make a lot of sense to ban people from doing so because they’re minorities.  That would be bad for black people.

No one's claiming that anything in the video isn't true as far as I can tell...    [https://www.canadiancovidcarealliance.org/](https://www.canadiancovidcarealliance.org/)       A lot of bitching and gossiping about Malone as a person -- but no rebuttals.  Isn't that odd?

Prediction:
<p>No one is claiming that anything in the video isn’t true. It’s just that there’d been no discussion of it. There was no discussion. No discussion of the video. There has been no mention of it at all. There’ve been no conversation about it. It just continued to spread like a wildfire. There is no discussion about it at this point.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no proof that the video was doctored. There is no proof at all that it was faked.</p>

<p>Democrats are hypocrites. They’re entitled to their own opinions and their own views, not ours. They are not entitled to what they want.</p>
<p>If you want to be a Democrat and believe that you are a good person, you should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

Yeah all these idiots saying we're the racists when they did and continue to do racist shit

Truth:
Its completely shameful when things like this get posted on this sub so that you can all pat eachother on the back and say things like ""yes, the libs are the real racists because they are racist to us whites"".

Prediction:
<p>And now they&#39;re saying racist things about us because of our race.</p>
<p>The racists don&#39;t deserve to be called racists because they&#40;re a racist. They deserve to get blacklisted for being racist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it’s true. They’re racist and they’ve been doing it for years. They should be ashamed of themselves for doing it. They shouldn’t be ashamed.</p>

If less ppl die when they’re vaccinated as opposed to those that aren’t. Even trump said “ the vaccine works, those that are dying are mostly unvaccinated” like I just don’t get it lol u think because covid hasn’t magically disappeared then the vaccine doesn’t work? It was never a cure it’s just armor to white off being killed or hospitalized and it doesn’t stop spread which we always knew. Who told y’all this vaccine should magically stop all covid and spread of it or it doesn’t work

Truth:
<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it. If you have it, you’re protected. It’s not 100% but you’re probably more likely to die of a lightning strike than die of a breakthrough case. So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way. If they get sick and die, that’s their problem, not yours. </p>

Prediction:
<p>Also, I don&#39;t think it’s a good idea to vaccinate people if they’re not getting the vaccine. I think the vaccine is a good thing because I think it will reduce the spread of the virus. Otherwise, I think we’d be in a much worse situation. I don’t think there’ll be a huge difference between getting the flu and getting the mumps. The mumps are still there, but they don”t have the same effect on the spread as the vaccine did. They don“t have to be
<p>The vaccine is not a cure. It is a preventative vaccine. It doesn’t stop people from dying from the virus. If you’re not vaccinated, the vaccine does not stop the spread of the disease. The vaccine is no cure. You can’s vaccine. You’ve got to get vaccinated. If your not vaccinated you have no chance of survival. You have to get the vaccine. If the vaccine works, you have to be vaccinated. I don&#39;t know how that works, but the vaccine is a stopgap measure to keep you from getting sick
<p>But I don&#39;t think the vaccine will stop the spread of the virus. I don’t think it’s going to stop it from spreading. I think it will just make it harder for people to get the vaccine. It’ll make it easier for them to get it. And if it does, then it will only make it more difficult for people who have the virus to spread.  I don't think it can stop the spreading of the disease.  Even if it did, it will still make people less likely to die from it.  It will make it

The civil war wasn't about black people at all. It was just the next round of the English Civil War.

Truth:
<p>We have bigger welfare states etc here, but we never had the US notions of race until very recently. The general European attitude was that race is a pit we want to steer far clear of, and we are better off ignoring it as best we can. There are no African-Englishmen, just Englishmen who happen to be of African descent.</p>

Prediction:
<p>In the last century, the Civil War was about black people, not white people. It was about white people, and it was about racism, not black people.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that the Civil War was about black people. It was about white people. I think it was about slavery.  It was a black civil war.   I think the civil rights movement was about civil rights and the rights of black people.</p>
<p>The Civil War was about black people. It wasn&#39;t about black racism, it was about white supremacy.</p>

Prediction:

I don't entirely disagree, but if he's willing to play ball now, there's no point in it. You can't not let people convert, that's just bad politics.

Truth:
<p>Moreover, anything against Free Speech is something bad. You do not show the World that the other person is wrong by shutting them down, making them not able to speak to any audience, you let them tell their part, and you make sure to destroy them with arguments in a CIVIL DEBATE. You just show the world that they have something to say, that you are so afraid of (for some reason) that you dont want it to be even heard by other people.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The problem is, I don&#39;t think that the election results are going to be very positive or positive for the country. If you think that's the case, then you are not going to help the people. You are not helping the people, you are supporting the people and not helping them.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t think that is a good thing. If you think it would be good for the country to get rid of racism, you are wrong. If it is good for everyone, then it is bad for the world.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t think that's the point of the debate. I think it makes it easier for the left to make it harder for the right to make their own choices. If you want to make a difference, then you need to be willing to do so.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m sorry, I&#40;m only paraphrasing a sentence from a story that says, “This is a satire”</p>
<p>I think they’re trying to make it more of a joke. </p>
<p>But I also think this is what the term “murderedbywords” was supposed to be used to describe the way it was used.</p>

http://factmyth.com/factoids/democrats-and-republicans-switched-platforms/  Truth is it was always conservatives, it didn't matter the party.

Truth:
<p>It was never about Trump or “racism”. Now it’s literally anything conservative</p>

Prediction:
<p>Conservatives have always been the most conservative party in the country. They’ve always been a staunch conservative party. They don’t want to be left behind, they’re a party of left wingers. They want to have control over the future of the country, and they want to do that with the people they know.  They want control of the future.  But they want control, not control.  </p>
<p>The right is always right, but the left is always left. The left is never right, the right isn&#39;t left, and the left isn't left, they are always right. The right has always been left, the left has always left.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what they are talking about, but they certainly don't seem to have a problem with it. It&#40;s just that they&#38;re not the same party as the Republicans. They&#37;re the same as the Democrats. They are not the party of the people.</p></p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Great.  Lots of Dems didn’t think Trump won legitimately.  I guess this is the new game- be a sore loser every election!

Truth:
<p>As of now...Trump can run again. Pelosi and Schiff have failed miserably. &#39;America First&#39; is going nowhere and Biden &#39;n&#39; his pen are burying the Democrats. And stop trying to say &quot;there is zero evidence&quot;. Anyone who says such things are really silly.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think Trump won the election. I think he was in a bad mood. He&#40;s a bad guy. And I think we can all agree that he&#38;s one of the worst presidents ever. He is a liar and a liar. He should be ashamed of himself. He has no redeeming qualities. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think Trump won the election. I think it’s fair to say that he was a loser, but I don&quot;t understand why he would lose the election so quickly. He was a fraud. He’ll be impeached. He&#40;s a liar.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that most of the people who are still in office are not convinced that Trump won. They are convinced that he won because they know he won’t have a chance to win. You’re just going to have to believe it. They’ll just keep playing with it. It’s not going to work. It will make it harder for them to make it work. </p>

Gotta love how people like to downvote, but can't actually show some balls and say why they dislike your comment. He said something about mah guns, Imma gonna downvote!

Truth:
<p>Also, if you’re looking for non-verbal jokes to use to demean these guys a good one is “I bet you’d take that mask off quick if I pulled my Dick out, probably reflexive for a cocksucker like you.” If they respond by challenging you to do it, “no thanks, I fuck women, not bitches.”</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of the right to vote, but I don&#40;t think it’s fair to punish people for voting for their beliefs. It’d be a shame if you were a white supremacist, because you would be able to tell the difference between the left and the right.</p>
<p>But you don&#39;t need to be a bigot to be offended. If you can’t understand why people are offended by someone else’s statement, then you’re not allowed to say anything. I&#38;m not a bigot. I don”t think people should be offended by people’ opinions. If they are offended, then they should be allowed to feel offended.</p>
<p>It&#39;s funny, the fact that the media wants to downvote people when it doesn&#40;t like them, but they don&#41;t want to do it because it&#38;s not their job to influence people. If you’re a Democrat, you need to be able to say what you want.</p>

AOC called him a sick, weird, foot fetishing, frustrated pedophile who wants to have sex with her after she heard about the criticism. Then she attacked him for taking his wife to a cancer treatment.   Normal and understandable for Sandy. You cant make it up, but fully understandable.

Truth:
If you want to talk about abortions because your stupid husband rape your stupid body, go and find abortion thread to discuss all you want. Jeez, so stupid.

Prediction:
<p>I understand why you are pissed at me, but I don&#39;t want to get involved with someone you think is a pedophile. I understand why people are pissed about my choice to have sex with my wife. I also understand why some people want to hurt her, but if you want to destroy her life, then you need to get over it. It’s your choice. You can’t have it both ways.</p>
<p>This woman is a horrible person. She is a victim of a pedophile who wants to kill her unborn child and her unborn unborn child, and she wants to rape her unborn daughter. She wants to give birth to a child and then rape him because she thinks he&#39;s a liar and a hypocrite.</p>  She also wants to have sex with a man she loves.  She wants him to kill the unborn child.  The whole thing is a complete hoax, and it is completely absurd.  You should be ashamed of yourself for allowing it to happen.
<p>The left wants to destroy her life because she’s a hypocrite. They’re tired of her whining about her life and they want to destroy it. They want her to be destroyed by the left. The left wants her to destroy everything she loves. She’ll destroy everything they have left. And the right wants her own life. She wants her family to destroy the world. They are destroying her life.   She wants it to be her own.  She is a coward.  They want it to end.

Truth:
<p>Sane America is sick of their lies</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think the American people are the worst of all time at this point. They’re the worst at understanding what’s going on in the world.  And I don’t think it matters to them.  It’ll get better.</p>
<p>The worst thing about America is that it’s not working out.  This is a very bad thing.  It is a bad thing, because it&#39;s a really bad thing.</p>

> the Liberals said they wouldn’t take it  This you right?  >Going off the rails  Really? I asked a question is all, you seem to be more off the rails changing story mid-stream but this is an obvious waste of time and energy... Have a great day!

Truth:
<p>The high road means very little to liberals. We&#39;ve already made headway. They&#39;re scared. They know they can&#39;t lie forever. That their fascist bent will eventually be exposed.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The Liberals said they wouldn’t take it because they’re afraid of the backlash. That’s not what they want to do. They’d rather be in control of the situation than trying to control it. That&#39;s not their goal. They want to control what happens in the world. They don&#40;t want to make that happen, they want control over what happens on the ground.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why they refuse to do anything. They are not willing to do something that would actually help their constituents. They’re willing to give up their livelihoods, but they’ll wait for it to happen. </p>
<p>It’s like the left is going to tell you that they won’t allow you to vote because they want to keep you in the dark, and the right wants to make sure you’re not voting for them. It’ll be a shame if they’d just do it as you say. It would be better for you.</p>

No he conned them alright - he said he’s not mentally impaired or too old. He has done nothing and botched every single issue. He’s been unable to talk to any media and his handlers manage him. People assumes he’s Do the bare minimum and he’s proven he couldn’t even do that,

Truth:
<p>His gameplan was to do nothing and then blame everyone else who acted, but he is supposed to be a leader. He never led. And he is not a conservative.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think he’s a hypocrite. He is not a liar, he is not corrupt, he”s not a conman. He has no credibility. He doesn’t have any qualifications. He’d be a fraud. He was a fraud, he didn&#40;t have a job, he was a moron. He did not have a degree of confidence in himself. He just has no qualifications. </p>
<p>No, I’m not a moron. I don’t think he’s a degenerate. I think he just had a bad day. He’ll get over it. He has a pretty good grasp of the rules of the game, but he can still get away with not doing anything. He can only do so much. He could do so little, and then he can get away without doing anything at all. He is a fucking moron.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you need to be convinced that Trump is mentally ill. He has no real qualifications and no experience. He is just a guy who can make a lot of mistakes. He can’t do anything about it. He’s not a politician. He doesn&#40;t have a job. He just wants to make a living. And he’ll make a bunch of mistakes, but he”s not going to be able to change anything, and that’d be a disaster. </p>

You know women aren’t responsible for giving you a hard on, right? Cringe, mate. Yikes.

Truth:
<p>She is not. Duty you believe to exist is not the same thing as a legal duty. Regardless, that is not an element material to libel, which again, is written. The tort you mean to talk about, but are still wrong about, is slander, not libel.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’re telling me that women are the problem? I don’t know. But if you think that’s the case, then you’d be wrong. You’ve got to be kidding me.  You don&#39;t have to be a feminist to understand that.  I’m just saying that it’ll be easier for women to have sex with men than men.</p>
<p>The point is that women aren’t responsible for what happens to men, but women are also responsible for their own actions. The right to be offended by someone else’s actions is the same as the right to get offended by another person”</p>
<p>I get it, but you don&#39;t have to be a woman to get a raise. You are not a woman. You have to accept the fact that you are a woman and accept the facts as they are. That’s the whole point of being a woman.</p>

<p>I would say that I’m being hypocritical. I don’t want to get too emotional about it. I want to be open about it.</p>
<p>You’re right. I’m not suggesting that the “p>left” should be excused, but the right is to say that the left should not have been excused. That’s not what the left wants.</p>

She claimed the vaccines have caused thousands of deaths. If that's not misinformation I don't know what is.

Truth:
>How will your America look when you starve millions of people because of vaccine status?

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know if there is a scientific consensus on the cause of the deaths of millions of people. If there is, I&#40;m not sure what the scientific consensus is on the matter. If you want to know, you can find a study that is of the same kind. If it is, then I don't know why they&#38;re doing it. If not, then why would they want to get the vaccine?</p>
<p>There’s so much misinformation out there. It’d be a shame if you didn’t know the difference between the vaccine and the actual virus.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why this is a problem. I don&quot;I don't know why it is a big deal. I know it is. I just don't get it. It&#40;s not a scientific fact. I believe it is because it is based on a theory that vaccines are harmful to the human body.</p></p>

There are a lot of Rinos like you. On Jan 6, my very Republican uncle was watching the news, turned to me and said “there goes trumps chances of ever winning again”. The funny thing is , if the RNC just pivots slightly to the center, and has more sane, responsible moderate-conservative candidate , I believe they will wipe the floor with Biden. But if it’s trump , trump jr or anyone who appears extreme, people are going to play it safe and stick with Biden

Truth:
As far as DeSantis, I hope conservatives wake up and choose him over Trump, if Trump does run. As much as people love him, they’ve gotta realize he’s old as shit and dementia can come on quickly sometimes.

Prediction:
<p>I’m a conservative, and I’ve always been one. I have never supported a candidate who is too far behind the curve to be fair to the people, but I do support a person who is willing to challenge their beliefs and values. I also think that if Biden were to be the next president, he’d be the best choice for the country. If Biden was the next President, I think the American people would be more than happy to let him be the one to push the limits of the political process.</p>
<p>I also think that if Biden is impeached, it’s a very good thing that Biden is the next president. I’m not sure how the GOP will respond to that, but I think they’re going to try and make it work. I think the GOP is going to be a bit more conservative and conservative than the Democrats, but the GOP has to make a big effort to be conservative. I also think they should be able to get rid of the “left” and “right wing”, which is a good thing. I don’t think they
<p>I&#39;m not a conservative, I&#40;m a moderate Republican, and I think it's pretty clear that Biden will be a good choice for the Republican Party. I think he’ll be a great choice for a presidential bid, and if he gets there, it’s going to be a lot harder for the party to make a real difference. I don’t think we’re going to see a lot of change in the party, but I think there is a good chance that the party will be able to make some major changes in the future.

I can't remember....am I a victim if I was vaccinated or if I wasn't vaccinated?  It's all so confusing.

Truth:
We don't know if you can be an asymptomatic carrier if you're vaccinated

Prediction:
<p>I don’t know if I’m vaccinated or not. I don&#39;t know why I”m not vaccinated. I can only imagine what you’re thinking. If you”re not vaccinated, then you may not be able to get the vaccine.  You may not get it if you don”t get it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if I got vaccinated or not. I&#40;m not sure what the difference is between the vaccine and the vaccine itself. I just don&quot;t have the information to tell you.</p>
<p>I can’t remember if I was vaccinated or not. I’m not sure. I haven’d gotten the flu shot yet. I have no idea how I got the vaccine. I don”t know how I was given the vaccine, but I certainly don’T know if it’s safe to get the vaccine.</p>

The ignorance of this thread is appalling. Context is very important.  Not sure why Reddit put this in my feed as I couldn’t be more liberal.

Truth:
<p>It&#39;s disappointing to see so much preoccupation with owning the libs over making an actual point. I don&#39;t know what the right thing here is but the whole controversy seems stupid from the sidelines.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s a shame that Reddit has turned a blind eye to this situation. I’m not a fan of the idea of censorship, but I think it would be better for the left to focus on what&#39;s happening in the real world. I think the left is a better choice than the left.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a good idea to post a political commentary on something that isn”t a political issue. It’d be a shame to post it on a website that is just as bad as it is. I’m not a big fan of political commentary, but I”m not one of those people who would think it would be good to post something like that when you’re a liberal.  I think it makes sense for people to post things like this on the internet.
<p>The argument that this is a hoax is absurd. It’s not even fair to pretend that this isn’t a hoax.</p>

On one hand Reagan said some based shit but on the other hand he took away our machine guns and started the war on drugs

Truth:
<p>Maybe he did die as result of the pepper spray, who knows how he got sprayed though. The actual story is far different than the &quot;Trump supporters beat a cop to death with a fire extinguisher&quot; that Democrat media pushed in the days following his death.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not sure why, but I think it was because they were afraid of the consequences of their actions. They were afraid they would be labeled as anti-vaxxers. They wanted to be able to take control of the country. They feared they would lose control of it because the government would come after them.</p>
<p>You’re saying that the Obama administration did a lot of stupid shit, like they said they were going to kill the black people for being black, and they weren’t. It’s the same as the Clinton administration. They’ve been doing it for decades. They did it for the black community, and now they want to use it for their own purposes.</p>
<p>President Trump said he wanted to kill illegal immigrants. He also said he wants to end the war on drugs. So he did it. He did it with the help of the Russians and the US government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not science. Science is not what it is. Science isn&#40;t what it used to be.</p>
<p>How do you make a decision based on your own opinion? That&#39;s not how science works.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it’s a good idea to call science a “fake” or “not” a science.” It’d be much better to call it “science” instead of “information”. It”s not a science, it‘s a culture.</p>

Me too. And I’m trumpy af. Bush was a loser. Now we comin for the next sacred cow.

Truth:
<p>Lmao you tell me that I was told to be scared yet the conservatives are the ones dying which proves how much of a sheep you are lol.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You&#39;re right. George W. Bush was a loser. I&#40;m sorry, but you&#38;re a fucking liar. I should be ashamed of you. You are a liar.</p>
<p>Bush was a loser, and now he’s going to be a tyrant. I’m not going to tolerate that, but I think he deserves it.</p>
<p>I agree with you, I’m a liberal and I think that’s a good thing. But I also think that the GOP is a bad idea and is not the best choice for the future. I think they’re also a good idea for the next generation of republicans.</p>

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?  Since 2018 there has been 92 school shootings in the USA, that number would likely be higher too if a lot of learning wasn’t done remote due to covid.  We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children

Truth:
<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok. Oddly 2020 had relatively few mass shootings, so gun control was mostly ignored in the news and debates.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m glad that you’re seeing more and more gun deaths and less gun deaths per year. I think that’s pretty good. If you want to reduce the gun deaths, you can’t do it without a gun. There’d be a huge difference between the rate of gun deaths in the US and the UK, but I think you could argue that the US has been doing a better job of reducing gun deaths than the UK. The UK has had a high rate of shootings since the 1970s, and the majority of them have been in school. I
<p>I’m not a gun owner, but I think the gun control policies in the US have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families. I think there are a lot of people who want to buy guns, but don’t have the ability to use them for their own purposes. I also think that’s a huge problem with the way the US is going to address gun control, because there are far too many gun deaths per capita in that country. There are far more people than there are people who are willing to buy a gun for themselves and their kids. That’
<p>I think it’s pretty clear that gun control is working in the United States. There are over 600,000 guns in the US, but the majority of them are used by the police, which is a huge amount of guns. I don’t think the police are going to be able to stop a mass shooting in one of the most dangerous places in the world, and I think the reason they’re doing that is because they want people to have guns in their hands. It’ll be easier to reduce gun deaths in other countries than in the UK, where there are a lot

Why don't you share those tags to help get that stuff shut down?

Truth:
<p>We need to just rip of the bandaid and call it quits. Split up and have each state truly self govern. Let the poor choices destroy them instead of being bailed out by the rest.</p>

Prediction:
<p>But what are you going to do with all of the people who have been shutting down the internet? Do you think that’s going to help?</p>
<p>Why don’t you do something to stop the spread of misinformation?</p>
<p>Why don&#39;t they do that?  What are they doing?  Why aren&quot;t we getting involved?  I don&*t think they have any idea what these people are doing.</p>

If you speak English like American citizens do, why do you need the welfare office to be bilingual…oh…wait…

Truth:
<p>By the way, can she speak English, I don’t understand a word she says unless they show captions when she speaks.</p>

Prediction:
<p>If you don’t want to be bilingual, why do you need to be in the government?  I’m not sure why you’re in a position where you want to tell your children that they’ll be able to read and write English?  </p>
<p>The answer is no, because the federal government wants to make sure that the people who work in the government are bilingual. The government needs to be able to provide services that are affordable to all. The federal government should make sure the government is willing to pay for them, not the government.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the federal government doesn’t need to be bilingual. It’d be a shame if they were to be more bilingual.</p>

I agree with the sentence reduction. The guy should never drive a semi again but a life sentence was too much.

Truth:
Like I said on another post, I still like the idea of “thou shall not kill”. I think this principle should also apply to the state. Sure this illegal is a heinous person, and did awful things, but I think it would be better to stick him in an isolated cell 24/7 365, and just let him suffer for the rest of his life. IMO It would be a far worse punishment than a quick death.

Prediction:
<p>I agree with the statement that it was a mistake to not give a damn about the merits of the case, but I also think it was unnecessary to give a life sentence for someone who did not deserve it.</p>
<p>You’re right. I don’t think that is a good thing. If you think it’s a bad idea, you’d be wrong. You’ve got to be kidding yourself. I’m not going to tell you that. I think you should be allowed to drive a semi in the future.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t agree with the argument that the government should be able to reduce the amount of time they can impose on a person. I think the government would be better served by limiting the time they are allowed to drive a semi. That would be bad for the economy.</p>

Fox News is really obsessed about joe biden, huh? The article should really be about how Delaware needs this state of emergency so they can employ their national guard as nurses and so they can keep providing free testing. Instead, it’s obsessed over the president because it thinks it’s readers are dumb enough to eat that up. Don’t be sheep, don’t just take this at face value.

Truth:
<p>The American people should wear masks, vaccinate, and socially distance -&gt; I can bend the rules because it’s just me, not like I’m advocating this policy for everyone -&gt; oh we’re getting yelled at, this is horridly inconvenient -&gt; I’ll tell everyone we will follow the rules (but secretly do it anyway, not like I’m gonna have a shitty bday party just because of some bullshit rules we’re pushing for political gain right?)</p>

Prediction:
<p>This is what happens when you have a pandemic like this. It’s like the media is trying to convince you that you’re a moron and that you need to get help. You can’t have a scapegoat when you don&#39;t have one, and you can have one when you want to.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like they’re trying to convince you that the state of emergency is a real emergency, that it’s not a crisis, and that the governor is going to be able to get out of it quickly. They’ve already gotten out of the way, and they know it. They know how to make it happen, but they don’t know how much the state is actually going to help them. They don”t know what to do with it.
<p>I’m not sure why there are so many covid covid stories out there. I think it’s because they want to keep covid out of the country. I don’t think the covid narrative makes sense when you’re talking about covid. It’d be easier to just say “yeah, I’ll get covid” when you say covid is a hoax. It is not. I just think covid makes it look like covid&#39;s a hoax.</p>

And yet the “pandemic” focus is on locking down to stop the Rona?    We should be locking down abortion clinics instead.

Truth:
<p>“We are moving from a health system where we have everyone locked down – we are going to move to a situation where, to protect the healthcare system, we are going to lock out people who are not vaccinated and can be. If you’re making the choice not to get vaccinated, then you’re making the wrong choice… It’s going to be a vaccinated economy. And you get to participate in that”</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’re telling me that you’d rather ban abortion because the state is trying to control the abortion market? Or because the federal government wants to stop the illegal abortion trade?</p>
<p>And the same thing is happening with abortion. There’s no reason to think that the federal government should be doing anything about it. You’re not doing anything to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. You want to ban abortion? That’d be a disaster. You don’t want to see the deaths of millions of Americans, you want to let them get away with it?</p>
<p>You&#39;re saying that abortion is a crime? That&#40;s not the case. The case is one of the reasons why we need to stop it from happening. You should be willing to let the government do its job. It&#38;s been a long time since we had a crisis like this. You&#37;re not going to get out of the way of doing your job. If you want to stop abortion, you should be able to do so. It's not a crime. It’s a crime.</p>

The camps for unvaxed are called hospitals and cementarys

Truth:
the hospital.”</p>

Prediction:
<p>The camps for unvaccinated are called hospitals and are called “camps”.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why the state has been trying to get rid of unvaccinated people. They have to be cared for by the state.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why the camps are called healthcare, and not health care.</p>

So when did the left say not to get the jab? The libs are jackasses, but they never said this widely.  Seriously, people on the Right need to make up their mind on what the narrative is... Is the jab a Dem plot, or is it Trump saving the world? it can't be both.  Get the fuck outta here

Truth:
<p>What are they?  People keep acting like I&#39;m a moron, and maybe I am, but not a single commenter has laid out any benefits to banning a mask mandate.  How am I supposed to ever be right if no one can explain to me why I&#39;m wrong?</p>

Prediction:
<p>The left isn&#39;t going to stand up and say that the left is anti-vaxxers, they are anti-theres, anti-Trump, and anti-piracy theorists, and they don&#40;t want the left to say anything about it. The left is right, they want to attack the left for being anti-conservative, and the left wants to destroy the left, so they are going to attack it for doing that. The right is not going to stop them from doing it. They are not supporting the left.</p>
<p>The left is so stupid and stupid and can’t understand why they’re talking about it. It’s not like they have a choice. You can always tell by what they say, but the left has a hard time understanding what they”re saying. They can”t make it up to them. They’ve always tried to make it look like it”s all about the left”</p>
<p>The Left has been saying for years that the left needs to get the jab. It’s not true. The Left is not a party that wants to give it to the left. They want to give the left the choice. They don’t want to make the switch to the right. They’re a party of the left, and they want to keep it that way. They are not a team of left wingers, they want the right to take control of the world. They have no reason to believe that the right will be able to control the world if they want it to.

A level playing field would be a new division, men, women and trans leagues.

Truth:
<p>No. Gender roles are clearly not static. They have changed dramatically over time and vary with geography. Compare gender roles now for just straight men and women to those in the 90s, to the 60s, to the 20s, to the 1820s, to the 1720s, to the 1620s to ancient Greece, to ancient china, to tribal societies (some of which are matriarchies). Gender roles are a facet of culture and change alongside culture as culture evolves.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think the best thing for women is to have a more inclusive culture and a different attitude towards women.</p>
<p>&quot;p>The future of sports would be much more equitable for both genders.</p>

They also believe you voting for anyone other than a Democrat a "threat to democracy."

Truth:
If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.

Prediction:
<p>Democrats have a vested interest in making Democrats look bad, which is why they’re calling Republicans a threat to democracy. They’ve also said that if Democrats are willing to take a step back, they can make them look bad.</p>
<p>This is a very real threat to democracy. You’re not a democrat, you are a racist.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t think that’s the case. I think it’d be reasonable to say that if you think that you’re voting for a Democrat, you are a threat to democracy. I don’t think you can say that about someone else.</p>

Uh no — liberal peruser here and me and all of my liberal friendie friends want shit to be back to normal. I am annoyed as f*ck that I am still dealing with this BS after almost 2 years.   And it’s not the government faking shit. People are still being hospitalized and dying — but, strangely, it’s the weirdos who refuse vaccines! They’re the ones dying!   If you guys were actually conservative... drawing on the root meaning of the word... you would be risk averse and recognize that your chance of vaccine issues is minuscule in comparison to the aggregate affect of non-vaccinated people filling the hospitals, necessitating further mandate, etc.     [If I’m removed from this sub, it’s clear evidence that conservatives actually love censorship, when it’s convenient. Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]

Truth:
Deaths have been on a decline for a long time now, and whether that's from the vaccines or from less virulent strains of the virus, facts are facts and this pandemic has been winding down for quite a while. I know people like you hate hearing this, but the pandemic is looking like it's in the rear view mirror, and you'll have to get your sick entertainment elsewhere instead of laughing at people dying of covid with likeminded degenerates on reddit.

Prediction:
<p>I’m glad that you’re getting rid of the vaccine because it’s making you feel better. But I’d also like to think that if you&#39;re not getting the vaccine, then you”re not going to be able to get it. You’ll be stuck with it for a long time, and you“ll be forced to pay for it.” I think that”s a fair statement, but I think it”d be better to just ignore it as it is. If you are a conservative, I think
<p>I am not a liberal, but I do think that the government should be ashamed of the fact that they let the people who have been infected get the vaccine. I don&#39;t think the government is going to get rid of the virus, but the government shouldn&#40;t be ashamed. The government should not be afraid of people who get the virus. People should be able to get the vaccines if they want to. I think the reason the government wants to do this is to make sure they get the best possible outcomes for the people with the disease. If it was a matter of public
<p>I don&#39;t think that you can be a conservative and not be outraged by all of the things they say, but you are a conservative. I think you should be more cautious about what you say, and if you think it's a good thing, you are not a conservative or a liberal. It&#40;s not the case, it's that you are an idiot, and you are the one who thinks that because you are conservative, you should not be able to say that. It is not your fault. It's your responsibility to be a good citizen. If you don&

You're right in pointing this out. It is, however, the least bad choice in a situation of many bad choices. We accept that their ballots will be inherently less secure because we think the people who have volunteered to fight in our military should not be disenfranchised. It is a tolerable compromise to ensure that Americans who are often quite literally on the other side of the planet have a say in their government. However, if you're an able bodied person in Altoona, Pennsylvania, you can go to a fucking polling place.

Truth:
<p>Of course its appealing if you are proposing a world with no crime, lower taxes on most things and while all safety nets are increasing. But its typical of populism and i just dont think they could pull it off, their immigration policies will for sure not pay for all of that and i think they favor oversimplification over real world impact.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not saying that voting is the worst thing on the planet, I&#40;m just saying that the people who voted for Trump are the most likely to be disenfranchised in the future. I don't think that voting for Trump is the best thing, but it is not the only thing that can be done to make a difference. If you are a non-voting voter, you can vote for someone else who is a nonvoting member of the same party as you. You don't have to be a Democrat to vote for you. Even if you don&#
<p>I don&#39;t think voting is a bad thing, it&#40;s just not a good idea. I think that most people would agree that the right to vote is a good thing, but I do think that the left is going to push for more restrictions on what they can and cannot do, and the left wants to make sure that we get the votes we need, not the other way around. If you want to vote, you need to be a member of the left, not a slave to the right. If your party wants you to vote for them, you can vote for

This seems like an overwhelmingly positive change. Why wouldn’t we want insurance companies to better be able to assess situations? This will allow police to more concretely arrest the right people. Many people choose to have this happen in their card already because it’s incredibly useful information to have. Would love to see this become standard in American models too (and that wouldn’t have to happen with a law mandating it)

Truth:
<p>That was what solidified my views on immigration. We should be generous but firm. If you want to come here and work, great - there&#39;s nothing more American than having a dream and working for it. But if you want to bring cartel crap or cause other trouble here, GTFO. (And, yes, I did know more than a couple people who were a little too close to the cartels for my liking.) But above all, let&#39;s do it right - legally, with proper vetting, and with proper support once people arrive.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s great that we’re going to be able to have more police officers on the streets when we need them, and we can be more vigilant when it comes to our own safety. It’ll be much easier to get the police involved and more effective at preventing crime. It will also be easier to keep people from getting in the way of crime. I think that’d be a good thing. It would be great if we had more police in the streets, but we don’t have to do that every day. </p>
<p>I&#39;d also like to see the police get involved in cases like these so that they can get involved and make sure they have a reasonable response. If they do, they will be able to make a more informed decision. If you don’t, then they’ll have a harder time finding you. In the future, they”ll be more willing to help you out. It’s a win-win situation.
<p>To be fair, I think it’s great that we’re trying to make a bit of a difference with the way we do things. I’m sure that’ll get used to it soon, but I think a lot of people are looking for a way to make it easier for them to get their health insurance. I think that would be a great idea. I also think it would be great to see the government use it to help reduce the number of uninsured Americans in the United States. It would also make a big difference in the long run for the overall quality of life of

Kill all pedos. Why are we entertaining this madness

Truth:
<p>.. which begs the question.. DID THEY enter into this &quot;administration&quot; with the intention to destroy everything possible? Utter and complete chaos at every turn? At every decision?</p>

Prediction:
<p>How dare you! You’re being so stupid.</p>
<p>Fuck all pedos. Fuck all pedo.</p>

I think he is largely responsible for what happened on Jan 6, too. He motivated millions of patriotic Americans to make their dissatisfaction with leftist government known through a large peaceful protest.  The "Authorities" controlled by the deep state and Speaker Pelosi are responsible for the rest.

Truth:
<p>I remember Biden saying this after encouraging it weeks before.  He only condemned the riots after people were complaining it affected minority citizens.  He was buying votes with this speech.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think the president was the most effective politician of all time. He made a big difference in the world. He pushed the limits of what could be done, and he pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable and what was not acceptable. He was the best at controlling the media and the media. He got rid of the media, and now he wants to control the way the media&#39;s run. He is the worst at controlling what is acceptable and the most popular media in America.</p>
<p>I agree that the election was a good one. It was a very positive one. I think it was a great one for the country. It gave people a chance to make their own choices. It also gave people the chance to express their opinions and feelings.  But it also gave us a chance for change.  If you want change, you need to change the culture.  That&#39;s why we want to make it so much more difficult for the left.</p>
<p>President Trump is the most responsible person for the violence that took place on Jan 6, but he was also the most effective at making the situation worse. He was also one of the first people to admit that he was a bigot, and he made it worse by making it harder for people to listen to him. He also made it easier for the left to attack the left, and the right to punish the left for doing the same. It’s all about maintaining control over the left. </p>

I'm naturally vaccinated, had it last year.  But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.

Truth:
<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you’re immune to this virus. It’s not your fault. I’m not immune to it, and I don’t think it’ll stop spreading. I think you have a right to know that, and to think that the vaccine is somehow somehow immune to the virus.  If you think it is, then it is.  There are people who think that it is a good idea for you to get vaccinated.  You don”t have to be a doctor to get it.
<p>You’re not saying you’ve been vaccinated for years. You’d be wrong. I’m not saying it’s a hoax. I just don’t think it”s true. I think it is a good idea to get vaccinated. I don”t think the government has a way of making sure you”re not getting the vaccine you want.</p>
<p>I'm naturally vaccinated, I just don&#39;t have the flu. You can't give me the flu because I don&quot;t know anything about it. I&#40;m a natural born immunocompromised person, and I don't have a virus. I'm not a vaccine person, I don’t have a vaccine for it. It&#38;s a virus, so I don &#39&#41;t get it. </p>And the fact that you&#43;re not vaccinated is a big problem. The
________________________________________________________________________________
That's because you were not giving a vaccination you were given a shot that alters the blood in your body and the way your DNA reacts to everything not just covid. You better start praying!

Truth:
<p>Either way we are discussing MANDATING a COVID vaccine for a virus, which has no cure. Forcing someone to take shots is unethical, but I guess you’re ignoring the medical ethics courses they taught. The alternative is to let people go to the doctor for consensual treatment when they’re sick, let people who wish to get vaxxed get it, don’t bash people for getting vaxxed or not getting vaxxed, and respecting other individuals freewill for medical treatment.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The reason I say this is because I believe that the vaccine actually works is because the vaccine is not effective at preventing spread of infection. It just works. If you get a covid, you will get a better chance of survival. It is not a virus. It’s a vaccine that works. It works for you.</p>
<p>If you’re not getting vaccinated, then I’d suggest you get the flu shot, because the vaccine is not the same as getting the flu vaccine. It’s the vaccine that gives you the vaccine, not the virus.  It”s the vaccines.  If you don’t get vaccinated, you don&#39;t get the vaccine.  The vaccine is the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if you’ve been vaccinated or not, but I think the fact that you have been vaccinated is a good thing because you are more likely to get covid in the future than not have it. It’s not a matter of getting covid, it’d be a matter for you to get it. I’m not saying that the vaccine is the best way to prevent covid. I just think it is the most effective way to reduce the spread of covid.</p>

Bad shit happened that day. People broke the law. People died. And it was a tremendous failure of government and law enforcement.   Those who wanted to investigate Benghazi should want to investigate 1/6.   It was also an historic day in the Capitol - and the country’s - history.

Truth:
The storming of the Capitol and murder of two police officers to overturn our election was also bad, and was directly called for by our sitting president and his allies at his own rally. It also was over no actual evidence. That's really bad.  Those people belong in jail.

Prediction:
<p>The people of Benghazi are in a state of absolute crisis and we should be ashamed of them for what they did. They should be proud of their actions and not ashamed of their own actions. It was a horrible day for the country and we need to get over it. We need to fix this so that we can have a better future.  We need a better country.</p>
<p>The fact is, the federal government did a terrible job of protecting the American people. They have been very negligent in doing their job, and they deserve to be ashamed of their actions. They should be ashamed. They need to admit that they were wrong. They shouldn’t have been doing their jobs. They’re not ashamed of what they did. It’s a shame that they’ve been doing it for so long. They are not afraid of the consequences. They want to punish them.</p>
<p>It’s a sad day for the United States, and I think we should be ashamed of the people who lost their lives on that day. It was a horrible day for our country, and we’re still in the process of trying to recover from it. We should be proud of the accomplishments of the past few years, but we should also be ashamed for the failures of our government and our people. We’ll never be the same again.”

History by a guy that apparently doesn't know George Wallace existed.

Truth:
<p>That or he never vetted his story to understand how and why the changes were being made.</p>

<p>I’m not a racist, I just don’t know how to be a decent person.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know George Wallace. I don&quot;t think he was a real person. He&#40;s just a weird guy.</p>

What will it take for you to believe the next election is legitimate?

Truth:
<p>There should be verification that a person is who they say they are and are eligible to vote.  Shouldn’t there be?   Or do you think anyone should be able to vote with no verification?</p>

Prediction:
<p>You are going to argue that the election was rigged and that the people who lost it are still in power. </p>
<p>I hope you can convince me that the next election will be legitimate.</p>

Your scenario. And your man op doing the lumping. Also lumped, conservative republican pedo Matt Gaetz

Truth:
<p>I&#39;m thinking this ain&#39;t a conservative my dude</p>

Prediction:
<p>But I think the left is doing a good job at playing the conservative card, and it’s working. I’m a big fan of Joe Biden, the guy who has been in office for a decade, and I think he’ll do a great job at getting people to vote for him.</p>
<p>You’re right, I’m not talking about the left. The left is talking about Trump, and the right is playing politics with the left, and you are talking about conservatives, which is not the case. You’ve got to look at the left’s position, and then look at what the left is doing with it.</p>
<p>You’re talking about conservative Republicans. You’ve got to be kidding me here. They’ll get rid of you. They are in charge of the entire state. They want to punish you for being conservative.</p>

I tried to think of some smart ass post to get upvotes. After that, I just stared at my phone for 5 minutes. This isn't even funny anymore; it's dangerous. Who would have thought that massive advances in technology and accessibility would lead us towards a new dark age of ignorance? It's hard to be optimistic in a world shared with people like this, to whom words like fact, proof and evidence no longer mean anything other than what they want them to.

Truth:
<p>I forgot that in the days where $3.5 Trillion costs nothing, we might as well test someone for everything it could possibly be (never mind the cost! Remember it costs nothing if it&#39;s paid by taxpayers). Rather than narrow down the problem by potentially offending them by asking if they were born with one set of organs or another.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s ridiculous to think that because people are talking about it, they have no reason to believe it. You&#40;re not an expert. You are a fool. You don't know the difference between fact and fiction. If you are a rational person, you are likely to believe the opposite of what you think. It's not your place to make an informed decision. You need to be able to make your own own decisions. You have to be willing to listen to your gut instinct and not blindly follow your gut instincts. </p>
<p>You’re right, I don’t want to be a hypocrite and say that we’ve been lied to, but that’s not what we want to do. We want to make things better for people. We don”t want people to think that we want them to feel better about themselves. We need to learn how to be better at being better at the things we do. It’ll take us a long time to learn to be good at what we do, and not be afraid of failure and failure. I’m not going to tell you what
<p>I was just trying to get a feel for what was going on, and it didn&#39;t work. It just didn’t matter to me anymore. It was just too fucking stupid to look at it.  I’m not a doctor.  If we were, we’d be living in a world of convenience and convenience.  You’re not going to find out about it, or what it’s about.  It’ll make you look like a moron.</p>

Yep... The pedophiles being out in prison would be great, but it seems like it's out of reach now

Truth:
<p>To distill some of their ideas down to about as simple as I can make it, they believe that over-incarceration doesn&#39;t really make anyone safe or address crime, because once you have that on you record, it&#39;s almost impossible to move forward in society. So you offend again, go to jail again, it creates a cycle. </p>

Prediction:
<p>So you think that the pedophiles would be able to get out of prison? That’s just not the case.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it would be wise to keep the pedophiles out of prison. I don't think they would want to keep them out of jail. They are too afraid to get out. They have no choice. They would be better off being in prison.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think it would be great to see the pedophiles get out of prison. I mean, they&#39;re not going to be able to stop them from being in prison, but that&quot;would be great.</p>

What's idiotic about pointing out projection? Both sides do it, and it makes us all dumber. This is not a liberal/conservative thing.

Truth:
<p>What you do isn’t heroic. Why are you trying to act like you’re even in the same league?</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s absurd. You are a hypocrite, and you are a liar. You should be ashamed of yourself for being an ass**le.</p>
<p>It&#39;s absurd. Both sides are trying to make themselves look good. It&#40;s ridiculous. And the left is trying to tell the truth. That&#38;s the way it works. They&#37;re trying to push their agenda. And it&#36;s not working. They are making themselves look bad. They're trying to distract from the fact that the left&quot;s trying to get away with it. They need to be pushed. They should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>It&#39;s absurd to say this is a liberal/conservative thing. If you want to be left alone, then you’re not going to do it. You’ve got to be conservative.</p>

She posted unverified data and tried to sell it as truth of COVID crimes or something from the context of different articles. Sounds like she should have been banned a long time ago since this happened often with her.

Truth:
<p>You want to take a shot at MSM on speculating on what-ifs? Fine. But don&#39;t conflate this as both sides doing the same amount of harm. Even when these claims have been fully disproven, you&#39;re all still spreading the lies.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The fact is, there are people who have been doing this for decades, and they have a history of doing it. There is a lot of evidence that suggests it was done by a group of individuals. It&#39;s not the same group of people. They have a background in politics, culture, and media. They should have known what they were doing when they started doing it, but instead they were forced to do it. They didn&#40;t know what to do. They were just doing it because they were scared.</p>
<p>She’s a liar, a liar. She’ll say anything that makes her sound like a liar and make you look bad. But she’d be lying if she said she was doing it because she was a liar as well. She lied about it because it was her job to say it was a joke.</p>
<p>It’s like someone lied to the media and lied about the facts, or lied to get their own way. They’re lying to the American people. They should be ashamed of themselves for lying to them. That’d be a big problem for them.</p>

<p>There was no evidence. They did not have evidence. There was no proof of anything. </p>

I don't agree with censorship at any level, and I've had plenty of constructive arguments with people of the opposing viewpoint on this sub.

Truth:
<p>My comments are riddled with sourcing backing my claims. You have offered nothing of value, much less any sourcing. The more you continue with this inane pedantry, the more convinced I am you don&#39;t really know or care about any of this and refuse to learn.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not against censorship at all. I just don’t think there’s any benefit to it. I’ve been through a lot of things, and I think there are many good things I can say about it. It’ll be interesting to see what people think.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t agree with censorship at all, I agree with the argument that it&#40;s not censorship, but I do think that it should be allowed to be allowed at any time. I&#38;m not a fan of censorship, and I don't think that restricting access to the internet is a good thing. I think that people should be able to get away with it, and that it's not a good idea to limit access to other services.”
<p>There’s no such thing as censorship. There are no restrictions on speech. There is no censorship, and there are no limits on what you can say or do. It’ll just be what you do.”

Enough half measures, if you identify as feline then you should be kicked out of school because animals are not allowed to be enrolled in public school. You don’t want to be treated like a human then you shouldn’t be allowed to be in human school.

Truth:
<p>Honestly, the public needs to REVOLT if their districts want to do this, there is no excuse to keep gifted kids from the education they need and since they are the &quot;minority&quot; among public school students you&#39;d think some SJW types would be standing up for them.</p>

Prediction:
<p>This isn’t about being an animal. It’s about being a human. If you’re not an animal, then you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to be in public school. You’ve got to be a human to be able to be educated and to be good at your job. If your child has a genetic predisposition to be an animal that is not a human, then your child should be allowed into public school.</p>
<p>You’re saying that because of the nature of the animal, you’ll be kicked out of school because of your race? That’s not what you want to hear. You want to be a human, not a feline. If you want the privilege of being a human human, you don’t want the right to be treated like one.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there’s any difference between a feline and a human, and I don’t think you’re a racist or a bigot. If you think that’d be a good thing, then I think you should be ashamed of yourself for being an animal. I think it would be much better to be able to live with your family and not be a bigot if you were a human.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Covid&#39;s an immunocompromised disease, and the CDC has said that it has a high chance of survival, and that the disease will be treated with a vaccine, which is less likely to spread to other people.</p>
<p>I’d like to hear your thoughts on covid. I’m sure you’re not alone in your concerns. There’s a lot more covid out there than we know. It&#39;s getting worse as the year goes on.  We’ve already seen a lot of covid-related deaths in the United States.  I”d also like to know why they’ll get better.  You”re not going to get better as soon as you get the vaccine.  It”s getting better.
<p>The FDA says the FDA is doing a good job with covid. The FDA says there is no evidence that covid is harmful to human health. The agency says the vaccine is safe, but the FDA says it is not 100% effective.</p>

Lmao. Relax I don't hate kids or men and I don't pretend I believe it and you don't know me so don't call me a fucking liar. I believe it's not my fight. To me this is a women's right/issue and imo should be treated as such. This is just my opinion and doesn't mean I'm right or wrong... As conservatives we have way more pressing issues to work on because this ship sailed a long time ago and we lost so many elections because of it. Move on...

Truth:
<p>And I don&#39;t really care whether that alienates conservative women as voters. I care more about military effectiveness, which sadly is an increasingly unacceptable public opinion and one that would certainly prevent your promotion to field grade.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not a racist, I don’t hate anyone, I’ve just never been one. If you’re not offended by my comments, then I am not offended. I don&#39;t hate you, I just don”t want to be a victim of your own behavior. I do not hate anyone and I certainly don‘t hate the people who are offended by your comments. I just think it’s ridiculous that you think that’d be able to make such a big difference in your life. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not a racist. I&#40;m a conservative. I don't think there is any difference between right and wrong. If you want to make the case that women are more important than men, then you can. I think that is a good thing. I do think that it&#38;s not a good idea to pretend that everyone is a racist, and I think there&#37;s a reason for that. I also think that the issue of racism is one of the most important issues in American politics. I just don't know how to respond to
<p>But you don&#39;t have to pretend that you don't hate women because you don’t. If you don &quot;t, then you’re not a racist. If someone is racist, then they’ll be fired for it.</p>

Oh yes….the age old American right to tweet! We have to have better education than this.  This argument isn’t helping.

Truth:
<p>This was your premise. You&#39;re incorrect. I&#39;m hoping for everyone&#39;s sake youre just low functioning autistic and you need SPECIFIC singular definitions and usage of words and cant figure out otherwise. At least that way your stupidity isn&#39;t your fault then but a consequence of your cognitive difficulties. The alternative is youre intentionally obtuse and arguing in bad faith. I&#39;m not going over all this again. Pick up a history book</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s time to get a better education. I think we’re going to have to work harder to get better at this. You’ve got to be better educated.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a fact that you can&#40;t get a degree if you want to have one. I don&#41;t think it’s for lack of trying.</p></p>

Matt Gaetz is under trial for child sex trafficking  Pedo

Truth:
<p>Redmond, a registered child sex offender, is listed on the Illinois State Police child sex offender registry. In 1991, he participated in a gang rape and beating in the Roseland area. “He and three other people kidnapped and sexually assaulted two girls, ages 13 and 14,” Fox 32 noted.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s like child sex trafficking is a crime.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also under trial for child sex trafficking  Pedo</p>
<p>I’m glad you’re aware of this case because it’s a big one.</p>

The political parties swapped, assholes. Never seen a modern day democrat with a confederate flag.

Truth:
<p>Republicans are useless ffs, at this rate we&#39;ll never retake the house or Senate, let alone the presidency.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I never saw a politician in a republic with a confederate flag. I haven’t seen one of them with a flag.  I’ve never seen one with a Confederate flag.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen a politician who’s so anti-American as to be a racist.</p>
<p>I have never seen a Republican president and vice president in my life. If I could have, I would have. They would have been fucking mad. They are so stupid.</p>

Florida in the main may or may not be more right wing, but that part of Florida which is the most right wing is the panhandle, and as someone who likes the panhandle I have to tell you to take your suggestion and put it where the sun isn’t likely to shine.

Truth:
<p>Would prefer he get one more term and really turn Florida into a powerhouse</p>

Prediction:
<p>Florida is more conservative than California, but I think the most conservative part of the country in terms of the percentage of people who support the state that is conservative. If you want to be conservative, I think you can be as conservative as you want, but if you don&#39;t, you can also be conservative as well. If the state is conservative, then it is almost impossible to be a conservative in the sense that the state has a majority of people that support conservative policies. I also think that there are people who would rather be conservative than lean towards the left, and I think that is a
<p>Florida is one of the most conservative states in the country, but the one that’s got the most conservatives is the south. The south is also the least conservative, and the south is the most likely to be conservative. If you’re a Republican, you should be able to vote for the south side, but if you want to vote against the south, you can also vote for Florida. The west is more conservative than the south.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t say that Florida is more conservative than Texas, but I think the only state with a higher percentage of conservative voters than Texas is Florida. I also think that there is an argument that Texas is the most conservative state in the country, but Texas is a conservative state, and I think that’s just because they’re located in a region that has a high likelihood of being conservative. Texas is not conservative. It’ll be conservative, but it will be conservative.

Your really not doing Republicans any favor by associating Sherman with them. What's next, John Brown?

Truth:
<p>Further, he doesn’t deserve the attention of being put on a Reddit thread.</p>

Prediction:
<p>But that&#39;s not a good thing. It&#40;s about the same as supporting the Republicans in the past. They&#37;re not doing anything to help the left.</p></p>
<p>That&#39;s not the point.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that the democrats are afraid of the people who want to push them to the left.</p>

She’s been picked up from the bar too many times at her past career. She’s just a bar slut who had half a brain in college.

Truth:
<p>It had been months since I drank at that point and two beers actually got me kinda drunk lol.</p>

Prediction:
<p>She&#39;s been in the bar too many times. She&#38;s a dumb woman who had to learn to be a bartender. She was a damn good girl. She had to teach her kids how to be good.</p>
<p>She’s been fired from the bar too many times to count. She’d rather have been fired than be fired for being a fucking idiot and being a dumbass.</p>
<p>That&#39;s absurd. She is an extremely smart woman who should be able to make a career out of working in the bar. She was also a smart woman, but she has a bad record. She should be ashamed of her past work, not ashamed of what she did. </p>

2022. Trump will run for congress. He will become speaker of the house. He will impeach pedo Joe and the hoe. He will become potus. We will try Biden for treason in Afghanistan starting, funding and arming obamas isis 2.0.

Truth:
<td align=""left"">New Biden admin counter terror strategy; Democrat-led impeachment and social media banning of a US President and special congressional probes likely to last until the 2022 election season; lockdown of Capitol Hill; Capitol Police expansion of operations outside of D.C.</td>

Prediction:
<p>Trump will run for president in 2022. He will be impeached by congress. He’ll be banned from serving in the federal government for life. And he will be banned for life from the state of New York. It’s time for Trump to go. And we’re going to have a new president who’d be able to do exactly what he wants. You’ve got to be kidding me, I’m not kidding.
<p>Trump will be impeached for treason in 2020. He will be banned from the federal government for life. And if he is convicted of treason, he will be thrown in jail for life.</p>
<p>Trump will run for president in 2020. He will be impeached by the senate and be re-elected. He is also going to be the next president of the United States. And he will be the face of the free world.</p>

To be fair, most of them aren't actual people

Truth:
Like most of the left, he can’t answer a simple question.

Prediction:
<p>The truth is, there are a lot of people who don’t exist. Most of them are not people.</p>
<p>I don’t think that they’re true people.  That’s not the point.</p>
<p>They aren’t real people. They’re just people. </p>

Petition to change /politics to /leftist because it stopped being about unbiased politics years ago.

Truth:
<p>Audits aren’t possible on mail in ballots.  Evidence chains were already lost.  Maybe they could order new elections in certain states as a cure?  </p>

Prediction:
<p>The left has become a party of leftists, and we need to change that to be more of a party that is committed to social justice and equality.  We need to be able to say we are pro-life and not anti-socialism.  Now that’s not the way to go.  You need to make a change.  </p>
<p>I think it’s time to make a change in the politics of the left. I think the left should be able to do it, but we don’t have to. We’re not going to get rid of the Left. We need to change the political culture and make it a better one.</p>
<p>I’m not against leftism, I just don’t think it’s as good as it sounds. If you want to change that, then you need to change your mind.</p>

If Americans only lived in states where they love the state government we could finally forms teams and get on with this rumble.

Truth:
to buy from someone that is their right but when big corporations become political censors that is a problem.  Any rational person should be concerned.  America has long stood for political freedom and the right of free speech.  You might want to do some research as you may be too young to remember a time when Americans respected each other’s political differences and did not try to bring about financial ruin because of it.</p>

Prediction:
<p>If we could have a state government that would be able to provide services to its citizens, we could finally get off the hook and do something productive with the state. If we were able to get rid of the federal government we could get off of the hook.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to see the state government take a step back and let people know how they feel about it. Not just the fact that they are in control of the state but that they feel safe and welcome in it.</p>
<p>I’d love to see the states get rid of the “white power” that has been in place for so long. It’s time to get over the ‘white power.’  You know, the one that is supposed to be in charge, and not the one who makes the decisions.  That is the only way to do it.</p>

She's visiting her mom who lives in Florida.

While living with their mom and seeing their kid every other weekend.

<p>She lives in Florida.</p>
<p>She’s in Florida, she lives in Florida.</p>
<p>I&#39;m in Florida.  My mom is in Florida with her boyfriend.   I&#40;m going to Florida with my mom.  I'm going to see my dad in a few days.</p>

>AOC called him a sick, weird, foot fetishing, frustrated pedophile who wants to have sex with her after she heard about the criticism.   I genuinely don't understand why conservatives have a problem with AOC. She is a gift.

Truth:
<p>I&#39;m talking about how leftists can simultaneously call everything under the sun sexual harassment while also engaging in activities which solicits advances from men. They complain about a society which objectifies women while actively objectifying themselves. You personally don&#39;t think like that. Leftists, on the other hand, often think like that. That is my problem.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It’s not just the fact that she is a racist. She’d like to get rid of people for being racist.</p>   I don’t see why anyone would want to be a bigot.  I’m sure you’ve heard of her, but I also know that she’ll never admit it to anyone.  This is why she is such a bad person.   She is a bigot.</p><
<p>I don’t understand why liberals are so mad at her for doing something like this. It’s not like she wants to do something like that, or anything like that. She’d rather do something else, which is not a good idea, and I think her whole point is to make people feel bad about it.</p>
<p>AOC is a horrible person. She&#39;s an idiot, and she should be ashamed of herself. She’s a hypocrite.  She should have known better than to mock her.  I think she’d be ashamed to admit it, but she was a fraud.  And she&#38;s a fucking hypocrite.</p>

So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.

Truth:
<p>If it isn&#39;t petulant to offer my perspective, may I? I feel like this subreddit downplays how prepared for assault these people were. Also, my three examples aren&#39;t the only people who have been charged. I figured if I can&#39;t convince anyone with more than one example, more than three won&#39;t do it either. </p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know why people think that the police are not doing their job, but they are. They are doing their jobs, and they are doing it for a reason.</p>  I think it’s because they’re trying to convince people that they are stupid.  They are not.  You can’t convince them otherwise.  It’d be easier to convince them that you are stupid if you are not willing to do your job.  I’m not going to convince you otherwise. </p>
<p>The truth is, she was never arrested for assaulting a police officer. She was never charged with a crime. She wasn’t charged with any crime. Even though she was charged with assaulting a cop, she wasn&#39;t arrested for being a racist. She just got out of jail for being racist.  I’m not a racist, and I don&#40;t think she should have been convicted of anything.  She should have gotten out of prison for her crimes.</p>
<p>The problem is that you want to make people feel bad for doing something they don’t want to do. It’s not what you think. It is what you do. You want to convince people that they’re wrong? It is not what they do. They are what you say. You have to listen to your gut instinct to know that you’ve been wrong. You need to understand what’m going on. It isn’T what you believe. You are not doing the right thing by being a racist.</p>

https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-designed-in-hours-one-weekend-2020-12?utm_source=reddit.com  Yes I guess it was actually 1 day not 2 silly me!

Truth:
<p>Can you explain this? Because I&#39;m sure people knew about the Pfizer vaccine months ahead of Trump leaving office. <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19"">It even got emergency approval from the FDA in December 2020.</a></p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s been a month and a half and I&#40;m still not sure how long it will take to get the vaccine to work. So why wait until the FDA approves the vaccine?</p>
<p>The vaccine was developed by Pfizer in a single day. You’ll see the results in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about the last 2 weeks of your life, you can read the CDC’s website, https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-study-on-p>I&#39;m not sure how long you have been doing it. I’m sure you have heard of the vaccine, but I think it’ll be a while before you know it.

I identify as patriarchy and my pronouns are ist and phobe/phobic.

Truth:
<p>GTFO with that authoritarian BS.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m a conservative, I’ve always been one, and I still think it’s ridiculous to call me a “conservative” or “anti-woman”. I think it is pretty funny, but I also think that being a conservative is not a good thing.</p>
<p>You&#39;re right. I&#40;m anti-feminist. I am anti-choice.</p>
<p>This is a very conservative opinion. I don&#39;t agree with the views of some conservatives. They are anti-feminist and anti-woman.</p>

Based and honest take. Yeah certain ethnic groups are predisposed to such atrocity

Truth:
<p>The hypocrisy is strong in this one.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not saying that all black people are racist. I just think that’s just not what Black people are.  But black people don’t have to be racist to be black.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that there are certain groups that are predisposed to the same behavior as others. I just think there’s a difference between them. There’re people who are more likely to be offended by it than there are others. There are people who would be offended if it were not for the fact that they’d be more willing to listen to their concerns.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just sad that so many people are afraid of something like this.  You can be sure that the same people who are in power, and that's what the American people are.  It&#38;s not the case.  I don&#40;t think people should be afraid of what they see.</p>  </p>

To be fair, she's an idiot and needs to be voted out. We need to not be defending her at all. However, she doesn't deserve to be silenced.   On the other hand, Twitter is a sesspool and no one should be using that damned platform. Same thing with Facebook and IG. These social media Giants just love permabanning people for stuff like this when their fact checkers are nothing more than opinionated clowns.

Truth:
<p>Like I said I won&#39;t argue with your kind, you live for violence and confrontation online because you are far too weak to do it in person. Your narcissistic ways will ultimately be your downfall and you will only have yourself to blame.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s ridiculous to think that the media are somehow trying to make her look bad. They are not, and they are not. If you want to get rid of her, then you should stop using her platform. She is the voice of reason and not a threat to the world. And she is a fucking hypocrite. She should be shamed for her actions. She&#40;s a hypocrite, and she should be banned from the internet for failing to understand the consequences of her actions.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think the current administration is going to be able to stand up to the media and say, “No, you’re wrong” when they are trying to do the same thing. I think they should be ashamed of their actions, and not be able stand up for what they think. They should be allowed to say what they want, not be left alone. It’s not their job to tell us what to do, and it”s not the job of the media to tell people what to think.
<p>The left is a total moron and needs to be shamed for it. The right is not allowed to say anything at all. They need to be silenced. They&#39;re a joke and that&#40;s not what the left wants to hear. They want to silence the left. The left&quot;t want to hear anything that is different from the right. They deserve to be banned from the internet for being a moron. They are entitled to their own opinions, but they&#38;re not entitled to those opinions. It&#37;s their

The administration changed hands, just not legitimately. Nothing can be done now. Shoring up election integrity has been and should continue to be a priority for the right going forward.

Truth:
<p>Problem is, I don’t see a way around it.  2022 elections are too far away.   We don’t have enough time.   We are being left with no option but to punch back, and we’ll have to in order to preserve our way of life/freedoms we have left, even though we know that is exactly what they want.</p>

Prediction:
<p>This is a political issue, not a policy issue. There is no single issue that is going to be addressed by a new administration. It’s not like we’re not going to have a single issue. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. We can’t wait for the next administration to address it. We need to be able to do better than this. </p>
<p>The Obama administration was never elected. There is no reason why they can’t change that. They’re just not going to. That’s the way it is. We need to change. We’ve got to make things better for the American people. Not just change the electoral process. We have to make it better for all of us.</p>
<p>The election was rigged. There was no way to change that. There is no way that it could have been done. The election was not rigged. It was not a rigged election. There were no results. There are no outcomes. There’s no accountability. There isn’t any accountability. You can still vote. There will be no accountability, no accountability.</p>

> should result in monetary loss and not "retaliatory violence", not all deterrence are necessarily violent.  i is still a kind of violence. when you take someone's money from them without choice there is an implied violence to follow should they not pay. in any case the garnishment isn't intended as a deterrent it is meant to repay those who lost property and family.

Truth:
No really. In the darkest corner of your consciousness where no one can hear you scream, what did you think? Let me make it easier for you to admit that it was something along the lines of the second option. It may be rash, even irresponsible, to support impromptu vengeance, but it is not shameful to feel outrage on behalf of innocent people who are exercising their right to use the public highway to earn a living or travel for private purposes.

Prediction:
<p>If the government doesn&#39;t pay, then the government will. There&#40;s no reason why it would not pay. It&#38;s not the point of the lawsuit. It's the point that the government wants to make, and not the goal of their actions. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to be a victim, you’re not a victim. You are not the victim. There is no such thing as a victim’s choice. You have to be willing to take responsibility for your actions. If you want to pay for something, then you can. If someone else wants to pay, then they can do it. If they’d rather not pay for that, then it’ll be easier for them to do so. And if you do, then that is your choice.”
<p>I think the point is that a garnishment of your property is not a deterrent to others. It is a tool to reduce crime, it is not an end in itself to reduce violence. If you don&#39;t want to reduce your crime, you can just take it out on someone else. It&#40;s not a means to reduce it. It's not a way to reduce the crime of others.</p>

The leftist hypocrisy has numbed me to caring. Remember the summer of love? Billions of dollars of damage and hundreds of officer casualties? Seems kinda worse but who am I to say?

Truth:
<p>I&#39;m all for speaking up for what is right, but if you aren&#39;t actually going to be able to do anything to fix it, it&#39;s out worth the billions in trade lost and the families bankrupted over a virtue signaling vote?</p>

Prediction:
<p>This is a really bad example of the hypocrisy of leftist politicians. I don&#39;t care what happens to the people who are offended by it. This is a very bad example. It&#37;s not about the politics of the day, it&#38;s about the lack of moral outrage. They should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of behavior to exist in the first place.</p>
<p>The amount of violence that has been committed in the last year has been far greater than the number of deaths that have been reported in the past year. You can see the difference in the death toll from gun violence, the amount of injuries that have occurred, the sheer amount of deaths, and the scale of the overall amount of casualties. It&#39;s not a surprise that this is happening right now. The only reason we have to worry about it is because of the amount that has gone on since the election. It is a crisis of self-interest and self-righteousness.
<p>I hate it when the left attacks us and claims we’re doing the right thing by not listening to them. I hate the fact that you’ve made such a big deal of it and now you”re blaming us and blaming us for it. You’d be wrong. It’s not fair. We need to listen to the facts. You don’t listen to us. We’ll take what we can get from you. You can’m in jail for a year. You should be able to talk to your friends and tell them what to do

Arrested 3 times.  No jail time.  No bail required.  In one case he/she/it used a "high powered" laser to shine into the eyes of police officers.  That could have damaged the vision of the officers.  Ultimately, he/she/it performed a day and a half to community service and had all charges dropped.  Aren't there still people in jail for the January 6th "riot" just because they were present?

Truth:
<p>Rioting and protesting aren&#39;t synonymous. But on the subject police were at every major BLM riot and shot almost no protesters at all, acrossed the entire 325 million person nation. So once again youre talking out of your ass. Please come back when you dont believe your nationality increases your intelligence and you actually have something of value to say.</p>

Prediction:
<p>That’s not how it was. There was no threat to the officers. It was a threat to them. They were not fired. They are not under arrest. The police were not arrested for any crimes. The officers were not charged for any crime they were not convicted of. They did not engage in any illegal activities. They weren’t arrested for being a felon. They just did not want to be arrested. They didn”t want to engage in illegal behavior. They wanted to be able to get away with it.</p>
<p>No jail time. No jail time and no jail time at all. I don&#39;t think there was any reason to think the police would have stopped the riot. I think there were a couple of reasons for the police to stop it. The first is that the riot was so bad, they didn't want to arrest the rioters. The second is because they were afraid of the police. The police were scared of the riots because of the crowd. They were afraid they would be arrested and the police were afraid to stop the riot because they didn’t want the rioting to spread.
<p>The police did not have to do anything to stop the riots. There was no need to get arrested. It was not a riot. The police did nothing to stop it. It wasn’t a riot or a riot, it was a riot and they were arrested. They did not get arrested, they were not charged. They were released on the promise of not being arrested. That’s the whole point of this story. It’ll be interesting to see how the police handle it after the fact. There were no arrests. There are no charges being filed against them. The cops did nothing

Prediction:
<p>Biden wants to make Texas a state that is going to be one of the worst in the history of the world. He wants Texas to be the first state in the world to do so</p>

It was obvious that the Maxwell trial would amount to nothing, nonetheless it would be great if they investigated everyone further.

Truth:
<p>Fact is that Biden has done nothing new that would make any difference at all.  This has been discussed many times, the masks don&#39;t work and what would really help is being more honest with the people and not divide them.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not saying that the case is over, but it would be great if they investigated the case more thoroughly. It would be very, very good to see if they did. </p>
<p>I mean, I’m not saying it’s all that bad, but I do think it would be great to have the law enforced on people who don’t agree with you. The only thing that would make a difference is that it would reduce the amount of misinformation that you’d see on social media. I think that would be a good thing.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that the investigation has been going on for a few months is not a surprise. It&#39;s not to say the investigation is over, nor is it to suggest that the government has not done anything to stop the investigation. The government has done nothing to stop it, and they should be able to do nothing about it.</p>

Nah you guys willingly lick the boots while screaming back the blue. That's the difference between you and dems. They hate cops just in general, I hate cops because they'll be the first to impead on the 2A (which they do) and you hate them because it's a different CiC.

Truth:
<p>These people hate this country, like, with a burning passion, and they are doing everything they can to burn it to the ground, and all the wannabe brown shirts that lick their boots are fully aware of that- theyre inverting reality on purpose because they think more and more people will cheer for the death of this country thinking that theyre saving it. </p>

Prediction:
<p>You are not a liberal, you are a liberal. You are a conservative, you have a right to say whatever you want, but you don&#39;t have to say anything about how you think about it. You can say anything you want about it, but that is not what you think. I think you are an anti-police person. You think you can just ignore it and get away with it?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that you hate cops because you&#40;re anti-police, but because you are anti-policing, you are also anti-theft, anti-transparency, and anti-vaxxing, which is the same thing as anti-black racism. If you don’t like the cops, then you are bad. You are anti–theft and you are pro-trans, and then you’re pro-police.</p>
<p>I also don&#39;t think it’s fair that the police have a special interest in protecting the people they care about. This is the same reason why I&#40;m not a fan of the police, because they’re the ones who are trying to control the lives of the people who care about them. They’ve got a vested interest in making sure that they are safe and doing their job, which is why they don’t have to be afraid to stand up for the rights of others. They don”t need to be scared of the law

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 

Truth:
<p>Israeli breakthrough has also substantially changed especially when they actually study the population as a hole and not just healthcare workers.  Jerusalems hospital had a caseload of 72 patients - not a lot, but 72 hospitalization 85% of them were vaccinated and they have continued to see this trend.  4 days ago - of all the severe cases in Israel 324 total, 209 were fully vaccinated. So you are telling me they are not the ones spreading it - but are the cohort that is getting the worst symptoms at this time. The situation is fluid, just like this virus - which is why the statistics, Israel&#39;s game plan, and CDC changes its mind with the wind. Months ago they said Pfizer dropped transmission rate by 90% last week the CDC said it&#39;s as likely to spread and is showing the same viral load. The data is incomplete, its fluid,  and it&#39;s that simple. Cognitive dissonance is a thing whether you consider what I said to be a concise zinger or not.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics said that while they have not received a definitive report on the situation, they are confident that the virus is being spread in the US. They also believe that the vaccine is safe and effective. They are also confident that there are no new cases that are being identified. It just seems to me that there is a large amount of misinformation out there about the vaccine and the effectiveness of the vaccine. The vaccine is very effective at reducing the spread of the virus, which is not a surprise to many people. It also reduces the likelihood of contracting the virus over time. I know people who have been
<p>Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is the largest non-vaxxing organization in the world, says that while they have been working on the vaccine for many years, they are still having a hard time finding people who are unvaccinated. As a result, many of them are getting sick, and they are getting hospitalized. There are also cases of people who have been hospitalized because of the vaccine, and many of these people have had a mild case of the virus, which has been shown to be extremely dangerous. They have also been hospitalized for more than a decade. The CDC says they have
<p>The CDC has released a report that shows that the unvaccinated have a higher risk of contracting the virus than the vaccinated. The CDC says that there is a high likelihood of contracting it in the future. The agency also says that the vaccine is safe and effective, but that the majority of people who get the vaccine are not vaccinated. A small percentage of the people who are vaccinated do not have the vaccine. And the CDC says there is no evidence that they have the disease at all. That means that the CDC is not able to provide a full-spectrum report of the situation. </p>

<p>We conservatives need to vote out almost every incumbent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a conservative. I&#40;m a liberal, but I don’t agree with every single single opinion you make. You’re a conservative.</p>
<p>You&#39;re right, I&#40;m a conservative, but I don’t think you’re a conservative.  I think it’s because of your views.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that conservatives think you’re a cuckoo. They’ve been known to make fun of conservatives for a long time. I guess that’ll change.”</p>

I had it back in March and was sick for two days, and then fine. Back to shoveling snow and light workouts…though carrying my kids upstairs left me winded. I’m in great shape so the additional symptoms lasted about a week. I’m vaccinated now but hesitant to get booster after booster. Some of these people are gonna take so many their skin color is gonna start resembling a Mountain Dew color.

Truth:
<p>I wouldn&#39;t really say it&#39;s mild for everyone though. I have a VERY strong immune system and I get sick maybe once every 2-3 years. So the fact that it knocked me on my ass like it did surprised me. I cancelled all my Christmas plans because some of my family members are unvaccinated and there is no doubt in my mind that if I were to attend, they would catch it.</p>

Prediction:
<p>And I got the flu in March. My kids got it a month later and were fine. I didn’t get the flu for two weeks. I’m not getting the flu anymore, but I do have a pretty good case of it. I have a mild case of the flu, and I think it’s going to go away soon. It’ll just be a matter of time before I get it back. I don’ts think I can get a flu shot for a year. If I get a shot, I don&#39;t think I will get
<p>I got the flu back in March and was in the hospital for two days. I had a cold for a few days and it was pretty bad. I'm glad I didn’t have to deal with the virus. It’s pretty easy to get the flu, and I can get over it without having to take the flu. I’m not going to get it again until I get it in a month or so. I don’¿t want to be a doctor just because it’ll get worse and worse.  I don&#39;t want my kids
<p>I got my first flu shot in January and was able to get it in about a week. Now I’m back to normal and feeling good, but I still have a few days left to recover. The flu is still bad for me, but my immune system is still strong enough to get through it. My kids are getting it, and I am still getting it. I have to be careful when it comes to getting it since it’s so bad for them. I can’t get it back, but if I do get it, I”m gonna get it.</p

Truth:
<p>I see that I just trapped you, so now you&#39;re backpedaling because you realize your options are to admit you&#39;re dumb or admit you&#39;re a racist.</p>

Prediction:
<p>When you say they are racists, then you are a racist.</p>
<p>When you are in a bad mood, just say something like, “I’m not racist.””</p>
<p>You’re not going to win the debate. We’ll just tell you what we think. You are a racist. It’s not your place to make that choice.</p>

Vaccines make you magnetic   Covid is caused by 5g towers  Vaccines have tracking microchips   Covid is fake  No one dies from Covid

Truth:
<p>A vaccine puts something in your system, teaches your immune system to fight it, and is gone within 6-8 weeks. There has never been a case of where someone took a properly created and administered vaccine and something randomly came up 3, 5, 10 years later. It simply won&#39;t happen based on the mechanism through a vaccine works.</p>

Prediction:
<p>This vaccine doesn’t make you sick. It’s a vaccine. Vaccines do not make you ill. Vaccine makes you sick.</p>
<p>The vaccine is not a vaccine. It’s an immunocompromised vaccine.</p>
<p>It’s not that there are no deaths from Covid. The only deaths are from the virus itself. The virus is caused by the virus’ virus, not by the vaccine itself. </p>

They have to backpedal furiously because they know people are waking up to the scam. Do NOT comply.

Truth:
<p>That is when they really go hard on shutting them up by any means necessary.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The government is trying to get people to change the fact that they are doing this because they want to get rid of it. You have to be willing to admit that they’re doing this to make it harder for you to do it. They are trying to make you believe that you are doing it for them. It’s a scam.</p>
<p>The media is trying to push the issue, and they’re not getting it. The media is pushing the issue. They want to push it and push it, but the media is not going to listen to them. They are pushing it. They’ve already pushed it, and now they want to blame it on the media, and it’s working. It’ll all be over with.</p>
<p>The government should be doing a better job of appeasing the people who are being duped. They should be able to control their own resources and get away with it. Not just pretending like they aren’t there.</p>

Your mind has been wrapped in misinformation and you probably actually think that what you just stated is true, but unfortunately for you…fortunately for everyone else, it’s simply not

Truth:
It's convenient for you to represent that I said something different, but you're just lying to yourself and to others who read your comment.  I don't understand why people debate in this manner.  Do you actually believe this is what I said?  And then to thank me for ""making clear [my] priorities"".  That's obnoxious. Your reply is in bad faith.

Prediction:
<p>Also, this is an argument that has been made for decades. I think it’s important to be clear that there is no truth in this statement. It is also not a discussion of whether or not the statement is true. If there is, then you’re likely to be left confused. There is no reason why you shouldn’t be able to say it is true.</p>
<p>I do think that the majority of people in this community are ignorant of what’s going on in the world. If you’re a liberal, then you are ignorant. If not, you are a leftist. If someone in the mainstream media thinks that you are an idiot, then they are not listening to you.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a hypocrite, I think that’s great, but I don&#40;t think that you’re making any sense or anything like that. I think your point is that you are making a huge amount of money from your actions and you are not doing anything about it.</p>

Bruh use a different Republican president; Reagan was out of it with dementia for most of his second term.

Truth:
<p>Also, Reagan was 70 when he took office at it is well know that his last couple years he was not mentally capable. Biden TOOK OFFICE older than Reagan left office.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious he had a long term illness, and he was in office for most of his first term. That&#40;s why he was not elected president until he was out of office for a year and a half. He was a good president, but he was also a bad president.</p>
<p>Reagan was the first man to be elected president. He was in office for a year and a half, and then he died in office. His wife was a nurse, and she died in the hospital. He had a heart attack and died in January of 2016. So, what happened to him?</p>
<p>Trump had a different health policy than Reagan did, and he had a pretty bad time with it, but he was able to get out of it and get on with his life.</p>

That didn’t happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies. Just face that your guy lost and he lost without honor because he’s a conman. Grow up and face reality

Truth:
<p>Corporations only care about money, and Trump&#39;s realignment of the GOP voter base means the Democrats have significantly more of it. Trump brought a ton of new voters to the GOP but at the cost of educated suburban voters that didn&#39;t like his fiery rhetoric. Trump&#39;s new voter base is mostly rural and uneducated, two factors strongly correlated with lower income. This is why it seems like the left has so much influence on American companies now. They do. </p>

Prediction:
<p>Also, I think it’s important to point out that most of the people who support Trump are not white, they’re from suburban communities, which is why most of them vote in the states. Also, if you want to know how you can make a difference in your communities, you’ll have to look at the fact that the Democratic Party is in power in the state. And if you don’t want to see the results, you can still get rid of them. If you want the results to be counted, then you have to make them public.</p>
<p>The only reason I think Biden won’t is because it’s more difficult to get people to vote. You’re going to be voting, you’ll be voting by mail, and then you have to vote by mail. I think that’d be a good thing if Biden won the election, but it”s also a bad thing if you”re not in the minority and you can”t get votes in the general election. You don’”d be able to get more votes in a general election than in a presidential election. If you

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.

Truth:
<p>Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us. I’m also wondering if they’ll turn it into a yearly thing.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The flu vaccine is not the same thing as the other vaccines. It’s a single vaccine, and it can be used multiple times. The vaccine can be easily spread through the entire population. You don’t have to spread it across millions of people. It will spread over millions of years. If you have the flu, you’re going to have a much more difficult time getting the vaccine. You’ll have to be careful about spreading the vaccine because the vaccine will spread spread the virus throughout the population. There are multiple strains that can spread the flu virus, but each has a
<p>Vaccines have a wide spread spread, so there are many different types of viruses that can spread and cause the same symptoms. You can spread the virus across a wide swath of people, and you can spread it across a broad spectrum of countries. That&#39;s why you have a higher chance of dying from the flu. There are also many other types of viral infections that spread across the world, which can spread across a wider spectrum of people. And the virus can spread from one virus to the next, spreading across multiple different countries. So you have multiple strains of the same virus that spread from
<p>The flu is a global pandemic. If you have a different type of virus than the flu, you can often have a much different disease than a flu virus. The flu vaccine is not the same thing as the flu vaccine. It is the same virus. There are millions of different types of viruses, and they all have the same spread. There’s a lot of different strains and strains that can be spread over multiple years. There is a huge amount of overlap between different strains of the virus, and each one has a different spread rate. So the flu can spread across multiple strains. It’

Yea you are only exposing yourself as anti vax and anti science.    > I am considered an antivaxxer according to Webster.  Oh whatever dude. Your anti-vax, unvaxxed, and unwilling to see reason. I hope you don't collect a HermanCainAward for a preventable virus.

Truth:
<p>I havent spread any misinformation. Why are you inmediately calling to ban me? Talk about being a censorship commie. Yikes. Like come on bro, decouple your political biases from science. Kind of shameful to ask to silence someone you don&#39;t agree with.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think you’re wrong when you say that the vaccine is not safe, but it is. You are not a scientist, you are an expert, and you are a liar, and a hypocrite. I don’t think you are trying to be a doctor, but you are also a liar and a liar. I think the vaccine should be a non-vaxxer, and not a vaccine. </p>
<p>I am not a doctor, I don&#39;t have a medical degree, but I don't think I have a choice in the matter. I don’t think I am a doctor. I think I’m a medical student, and I don &quot;t think that’s what I want to do with my life. And I think it’d be good for me to be able to tell the difference between a virus and a vaccine. </p>

Shhhh don’t tell us about facts. We feel that the American elections aren’t fair if we don’t win. I mean democrats suck and Republicans suck so how is it that democrats won?

Truth:
<p>I really don&#39;t think the Biden/Harris administration cares about fixing racism.  Why would they when they use racism as an election cycle tool.  Bunch of fools they are.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think the election was rigged. I think that the voters were just trying to make up their own mind about it. They didn&#40;t like the fact that the election wasn’t rigged. It&#41;s not fair to them, it&#38;s wrong to think that they&#43;re somehow going to win because of the results. They are just going to make it easier for them to do so.</p>
<p>You are telling me that I don’t have a chance to win? That’s the point.</p>  You are also saying that I did not have a good chance of winning the election because I did have a bad election and I did.  Why would I have a better chance of doing so?  I’m not sure, but I did find a way to win the election and it’ll be a good experience for me.  I have no real problem with that.  You have to admit I have an issue with the fact that I didn&#39;
<p>The problem is that people don&#39;t know what they’re talking about, they just don’t want to hear it. They want to be left alone, they want to believe it’s all a bunch of lies. They’ve never been left alone. It’ll be hard for them to find out what the truth is. If you’d like to know what the facts are, you can just read the Wikipedia article.  It”s not the truth.  I’m not going to make you believe it.

At the time I joined reddit, it was clearly left leaning, but the sub name was still kind of justifiable.  It is now a propaganda sub.  And that is how they are planning on taking over everything, from governments to universities to corporations.

Truth:
<p>This cancel culture wasn&#39;t started by conservatives or liberals really. It&#39;s been happening for a while. Bill Maher comes to mind. But the left gas stepped it up to a fanatical level and intensity, and controls much of the media and big tech. Our culture swings often like a pendulum.  But there needs to be a reaction to swing it the other way or get ourselves centered.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The left is still very pro-corporate, but it’s not the same as the right. It is the left that wants to control everything, including government, business, and the media. It’ll never be the same again. It will always be the left, and it will never be. It won’t be the right, and they will always push it, but they’re going to push it. They’ve got to change the rules.</p>
<p>This is a completely different argument than you might think. It’s about the power of the government to control the media and make it more difficult for the media to do their job. They’re trying to make it easier for the public to get involved in the political process. They want to control everything, including the media, so they can control everything they want. They are also trying to control what the media does. They have a vested interest in making the media look good, and they want to make the media feel good.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that reddit was a “right wing” website, but I think that’s what it is. It was a place where people could get their ideas and opinions from, and it was a good place to start. It has become a place for people to get their opinions and ideas from. It is a place that is open to all kinds of people, and I think it is a great place for them to start.</p>

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.  Nuance breaks this sloppy meme into the shit that it is

Truth:
In light of current narrative that the jab has basically no side effects (at least that are allowed to be talked about lest it lead to ""vaccine hesitancy""), It's hilarious to watch drug commercials and their inevitable list of horrific side effects that often include death and several other things much worse then the thing they purport to help symptoms of.

Prediction:
<p>It’s not about the vaccine being a “fraud” or “racket”. It’m about the fact that the vaccine has been proven to reduce the spread of the virus. The vaccine has the potential to prevent spread of it, but it also prevents spread of other viruses, like the flu, which can spread through the body through the bloodstream.  The vaccine does not prevent transmission of the disease, and it is not a vaccine that reduces the spread.  It just makes it harder for people to spread it.  I don’t think the vaccine is
<p>I&#39;m not advocating that the vaccine be banned for the duration of the pandemic, but we don&#40;t want people to think it&#38;s because the vaccine is ineffective. If you want to know why the vaccine was so effective, just look at the numbers. The vaccine is not an excuse for people to not get vaccinated. It is a tool for preventing the spread of the virus. It prevents people from spreading the virus, and it prevents the spread. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that the vaccine has a negative effect on the human race, but I don't think it has a positive impact on the overall human health. The only thing that has caused the vaccine to come out of the blue is that it has decreased the likelihood of people contracting the virus. The vaccine has not decreased the risk of contracting the disease, but it has not reduced the likelihood that people will develop it. It is not a vaccine that is going to reduce the risk to others, it is a vaccine. It will reduce the chance of people dying from the disease. I&#

Didn't Regean have actual dementia by the end of his last term? He may not be the best example for this meme...

Truth:
<p>Since he has dementia maybe one day he’ll slip up and say a name. If the media wasn’t protecting him so much someone should ask “who told you you can’t answer questions?” He’s so out of it he’d probably answer</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s possible that he had dementia by the end of his time in office. But I would have thought he would be better off in the past year, not at this point. He was a very good president, but he had a lot of health problems. He didn&#40;t have a great career, and he was a good president.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say that the current president is not a bad person. I mean, he's a good person, but he is not one of the best politicians.</p>
<p>It’s not clear that they’re going to be able to have a full term of office by the end of the year, or if they are going to do so. It would be a shame to have to wait until the last day of the term and then see how long the term lasts. They’ll be gone by then.</p>

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm  That’s a link to a study finding 90% effectiveness of preventing infection. That’s some pretty good evidence (since 90% is way higher than other very effective vaccines in the past)  https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness  There’s a link to a cdc page that collects studies that show vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections and hospitalization

Truth:
We've already seen that the natural asymptomatic rate is about 90%, and the natural survival rate is around 99.903%. Even if the booster shits they're calling vaccines did EVERYTHING they promised (and they don't , but IF), how many lives could they possibly be ""saving""?

Prediction:
<p>The CDC has a website where you can find the full list of vaccines that have been shown to have been effective in preventing the spread of certain types of infection. It’s also a website with information on the effectiveness of the vaccines for people with high immunodeficiency and high blood pressure. They also have a website that shows how well they’re doing with the vaccine and how effective they are with other types of illness.</p></p>
<p>The CDC has a vaccine data tracker that is based on the CDC’s own data. If you’d like to see a link to the CDC data, you can go to https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-data-tracker/index.php?id=3&id=901;id=3939;id =3939&id = 939;
<p>The CDC is also working on a vaccine that will improve the effectiveness of the vaccine. It’s based on vaccine data, not on actual data. The CDC says the vaccine is 100% effective, and the CDC says it’ll be able to provide more data if it needs to.</p>

No it isn't. Because they can spread it to others and get people killed.

Truth:
<p>Basically, if you see a crowd of angry people, steer clear. Mobs get people killed.</p>

Prediction:
<p>No, it isn’t. It’s a threat to others, and it’ll only spread to people who are willing to fight it. It is a tool of the state to control it and control it. They are the people who want it to spread. They want to stop it. And they want it. So they are going to kill you. </p>
<p>It is not an excuse for people to not get involved in politics. It is an excuse to not be involved in the lives of others. </p>
<p>It’s not the same as the virus that spread it to others. It is the same virus that spreads it to the general population.</p>

To be a Vaccine,  doesn't it have to prevent disease?

Truth:
<p>If the definition of an effective vaccine is one that prevents hospitalizations rather than infection then just come out and say it.</p>

Prediction:
<p>But the point is that vaccines do not prevent disease. They don’t prevent it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not to say that vaccines do not prevent disease.</p>
<p>The Vaccine is a vaccine. It doesn’t prevent disease. It’s a precaution.</p>

Love that this comment is sitting at negative votes.  Increasing manufacturing? Ensuring supply chains are better? Ya know, so we don't get caught with out cocks in our hands the next time this type of thing happens? Naaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.  Why bother?  There's CRT and phony vote recounts to worry about.

Truth:
<p>You must realize that once you allow a harmful behavior that increases profit margins, companies <em>must</em> take part in it even if they don&#39;t want to.  Manufacturing companies that don&#39;t move their plants overseas to cheaper places risk being run out of business by cheaper products from their competitors... in that way capitalism only allows for the most unethical companies to survive.  This is basically the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; talked about in economic circles:</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’d think they’re also worried that the election results would be rigged so they could make a big difference in the economy? They don’t. They just want to make sure the elections are fair and free, and they want to know why the election was rigged. They want to be sure the election actually went well, so they can make sure that the results are fair. They are going to make it a lot harder for them to make a huge difference. They don&#39;t want to have to worry about that.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad that you’re not going to have to wait for the election to get done. It’s time to start making sure we’ve got a stable economy. If you want to take advantage of that, you can get involved and start making better decisions. </p>
<p>Also, the fact that the election was rigged is just another example of how much we&#39;re working to undermine the integrity of the system. We&#40;re doing the best we can to help the economy and keep it going. And the best thing we can do is reduce the numbers of people who&#38;ve died in this country because of it.</p>

Another "Rino" here who thinks Trump destroyed the Republicans party, put conservatives back 20 years and tried to ruin democracy itself.  We needed someone like Reagan not Hitler.

Truth:
<p>more accurately, he was impeached for being a republican president when there was a democrat house.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Trump is a liar. He is a moron. He was a bozo. He should be impeached. He's a liar, a bigot. He’s a racist. He shouldn’t have been impeached for doing that. He&#39;s a fool.</p>
<p>Trump is a “failed authoritarian” who has destroyed the country. He’s a racist, a racist and a liar. He should be fired from his job, but instead he’ll be fired for being a racist. </p>
<p>Trump is a racist, authoritarian authoritarian, who wants to destroy the freedom of the people. He&#39;s an authoritarian, a tyrant, and a racist. He is a fascist. He wants to kill us all. He wanted us to be able to follow the rules and follow them. He’s a fucking tyrant. He should be impeached.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Gotcha.

Truth:
<p>Yeah, gotcha.</p>

Blue is right in sweden (and i assume those other countries aswell) and the left is red, which was op's point

Truth:
<p>California is a blue state. Zona is purple. New Mexico is purplish. Texas is red for now.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The left is red, the right is blue, and the left is blue.</p>
<p>The left is the same as the right. I don&#39;t know what the difference is, but I think it’s pretty clear they’re the same.</p>
<p>It’s true. If you look at the blue states, you’ll see that the red states are the same as blue states. Blue states are blue states.</p>

Senile dipshit is a qualifier for 100% of the senate and most of the house.

Truth:
Now compare that to Senators Sinema and Manchin who actually do vote rather consistently and like 95% vote along with the Democrat party. Look at how the Democrats are treating them right now.

Prediction:
<p>Also, you’re also a senator, which is a privilege that is not given to you by your party. You are a senator and you are a member of the senate. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you’re allowed to vote for one of the senate’s top senators. I think you are allowed to choose your own senators. You have to be a democrat to vote in the senate. You can’t have 100% control over your own body. </p>
<p>The Senate has over 100% of the votes, which is almost as much as the House&#39;s population. If you don&#40;t want to hear it, you can just say that the senate is the best place to do it.</p>

I see she has taken the provision of hiding herself entirely so as not to infect anyone with her unequivocal stupidity. Lady Justice dropped this one on her head. Beat to stay home.

Truth:
<p>And sorry but I don&#39;t buy your argument, <em>every other</em> conventional healthcare decision a woman (or any human for that matter) can make doesn&#39;t involve ending another human being&#39;s life. She made her decision to take on that risk when she chose to have sex. If she didn&#39;t choose to have sex (as in she was raped) or the unborn person is putting her health at risk, then I understand. Otherwise, the right to abortion for convenience and the right to bear arms freely aren&#39;t even in the same political zipcode.</p>

Prediction:
<p>That&#39;s why I believe that the president is so intent on protecting the people who are most at risk of being hurt by the way the administration treats them.</p>
<p>I don’t see how she’s going to stop the virus from spreading. She’d rather keep her mouth shut and not go to the hospital, so she can avoid the virus.  She can avoid it, but she shouldn&#39;t be allowed to ignore it.  I think she”s got it under control, and she is not going to let it spread.</p>
<p>She’s been doing this for so long that she’ll never be able to admit that she lied about it, and that she was forced to admit it. She’d have to admit she lied to her husband and her children. She would have been able to explain it to them, but she didn’t. She did it because she was afraid of the consequences of her behavior.</p>

No, they’re a superpac for the Dems

Truth:
<p>For one of the great, unspoken, benefits of the US-led coalition<br/>

Prediction:
<p>Democrats are a super power, they’re a super PAC for the Dems.</p>
<p>The Dems are a super PAC for the Dems.</p>
<p>You’re talking about Dems, not the Republicans, and you are talking about the Democrats as the party of the future.</p>

Scum, hate these politicians and their double standards. Pelosi, Perdue, Loeffler, Cruz, Manchin et al.   Hold them accountable

Truth:
<p>Both the left and right hates him, a true corrupt party politician!</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m tired of the hypocrisy of the Left. They’re fucking ridiculous. You’ve got to be ashamed of yourself for being a Democrat and not a Republican.</p>
<p>I hate it when you tell me that it’s a joke. I’m going to call them a liar and call them all liars and liars. I think they’re all lying.  I don’t know why they are lying to me.  If they are, then I think you’d be a liar.</p>
<p>I hate these people, I hate the people they’re serving, and I hate their hypocrisy. They’ve been elected for their crimes, and now they want to punish me for it.</p>

Was there anything unusual that occurred on election night ?  are republicans just crazy conspiracy theorists ?

Truth:
> This is a conspiracy theory. Which taxes did which billionaire not pay illegally? Be specific.

Prediction:
<p>The election happened on election night, and there was no proof of fraud. Why would you be surprised if there was?</p>
<p>No. I don&#39;t think that’s the case. It’d be a lie to say that Trump was a fraud. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that the election was rigged. I just think it was a hoax. </p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Not as much desperation as it is them being barbaric pieces of shit that cant evolve past cavemen

Truth:
And while you may hate Biden he hasn't done too much yet so even that is irrational.

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of the idea of “anti-science” as a whole.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of the caveman, it is a critique of the nature of their culture.</p>
<p>The only reason I’m not against the cavemen is because they’re stupid. If you want to be a caveman, you’ll have to admit that’s not the case.</p>

6 is too high

Truth:
Cause cost of living is too high

Prediction:
<p>I don’t think 6 is too high.</p>
<p>A higher percentage of the population than the CDC says.</p>
<p>That's too high.</p>

Oh no a US representative spent time *in the US* during a *national holiday* weekend, whatever will we do?   Ted Cruz fled the country during a natural disaster in his state, don't pretend it's the same.

Truth:
<p>I think newsom is a peice of shit but during our huge wildfire seasons even tho i know he wont be flying around figthing fires i couldnt see him leaving the country to go on vacation.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not saying that the government did not do something to help the American people. If you’re not in the US, then the government should have done something. If they didn’t, then we’d be in a different place. If the United States government did something that would help the people in the Middle East, then it’s not the US government. The US government should be doing something about it.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a crime to travel to a country to spend a weekend with a bunch of immigrants. If you’re traveling to a different country, you can still travel to another country, but you can never travel to the United States as a tourist. It’ll just be a different experience.</p>
<p>No, I am not talking about a former senator who went to Texas for a conference. I am talking about the fact that the US government has a mandate to ban people from entering the country for the duration of a presidential election. I don&#39;t think that is an issue for the US. I think the US should be able to ban undocumented immigrants from coming to the country. It’s not the same as it is for the UK. I would say that the UK should be allowed to ban foreigners from coming into the US, but the UK has a different mandate than the US.</p

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket. If Boebert and MTG are the future of the party, then Alex Jones deserves to be the chairman.

Truth:
<p>And all that being said -  twitter is essentially a monopoly to a politician getting their message out.  Ron DeSantis can’t afford to go create his own twitter while running for public office.  Within the current market place Twitter is a monopoly to him.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It’s a public company, not a private company, and it is not a government entity. It is not an independent business. It has no vested interest in its employees to keep it from happening. It isn’t a private entity. That’d be a shame. If you’re a business owner, then you have a vested interest, and you have to be willing to give up your rights to do so.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not saying that Twitter is not a public company. It’s a private company with a mandate to provide services to its customers, but it doesn’t have the mandate to do so. It&#39;s not a government entity. It is a private entity that has a mandate and mandate to serve its customers. It isn”t a public corporation. It has a responsibility to serve the public, not to be a private corporation. </p>And I don&#40;t think it’d be good to have a private website like Twitter
<p>I don&#39;t think it’s fair to claim that Twitter is a private company with a duty to protect the rights of its users. It’d be hypocritical to claim the company has no obligation to protect its users, but it is not a public company. It is not an entity, and you can’t impose your will on others. It doesn’T matter if you are a non-believer or not. You can”t say that because the company is a public entity. You have to be a nonbeliever to say the same thing. And

Obesity takes years to kill, is totally reversible, and is not contagious. Previous strains of COVID killed in a couple weeks and were/are wildly contagious.

Truth:
Season 3-8 were some of the best television of all time. After that, it declined over the next few years. It had some good episodes every now and then, but on the whole, the show has been a walking zombie since around season 12.

Prediction:
<p>You don&#39;t need to be a doctor to know that COVID is not contagious. It just makes sense to be cautious about it. It’s not a vaccine, it’ll work. </p>
<p>It’s not contagious. It doesn’t spread. It’ll only spread to people who have a high risk of dying from it. It only spreads to people with high risk. It is not contagious to people without high risk.</p>
<p>This is a vaccine that is completely safe and effective. It’s not a virus, it’ll only spread to people who get sick. It doesn’t spread. It is a preventable disease, and it will never spread to anyone. </p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Does that mean you don't support these Twitter bans? Misinformation is any pushback against the crazy left. It's as clear as day.

Truth:
<p>Even though the CDC agrees with you, saying what you just said will get you banned from Twitter for misinformation.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don’t think there’s any reason to think this is a good idea. I think it is a bad idea to punish the media for spreading misinformation and misinformation on the internet. It’d be a mistake to ignore the facts when they’re already there.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need to be convinced that this is a hoax. It's not. It isn&#40;t a hoax.</p>
<p>This isn’t about censorship. This is about censorship, and not about censorship because you’re not allowed to say what you want. </p>

Now do the right wing (propaganda matererial) books

Truth:
<p>Except the DMN is right wing. </p>

Prediction:
<p>The left wants to get rid of this propaganda. They want to destroy the left’s platform.</p>
<p>You are saying that this is a hoax? I am saying that the right wing is trying to spin it as a hoax. I don&#39;t think it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you’re right. You’ve got a right to think that way.</p>

Cool. Misanthropy means wanting the planet to be hospitable to life for another millenia. Words are cool.

Truth:
<p>Thats all good but not sure how that changes because of covid? R states say be free and your like nope im a totalitarian now.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s good that we want to reduce CO2 emissions in the world, and make sure that we have a stable and healthy population. I think we’re all in favor of that, and I think that’ll be good for the planet, and for the world. </p>
<p>That&#39;s a good thing.</p>
<p>But I also think it’s good for the planet to have a chance to survive.  I think you’re looking at the world as a whole, not just as a tool to control it.  It’ll be good for all of us.</p>

Just who is using these erratic, malformed missiles as footsoldiers?      Is it the leftists?   Is it the liberals?   Is it the elites?  Is it the Democrats?   Is it the statists?   Is it the corporatists?   Is it the globalists?  Is it the Atlantic ists?   Is it the media?  Is it Hillary?   Is it the Chinese?  Is it the Jesuits?   Is it the Masons?  Is it the billionaires?   Is it Kamala?  Is it Internet influencers?   Is it social inequalty?  Is it Greta Thunberg? Is it the panelists on The View? Is it George Stephanopolis? Is it Soros?  Is it the NFL?

Truth:
<p>So why is a leftist trying to troll conservatives in their own subreddit? Do you think you can own me? Come back when you can argue factually and point for point.</p>

Prediction:
<p>This is a very interesting topic, but I would love to know why it is that the left isn&#39;t doing the same thing as the right.  Is it the left?  Is the left doing the opposite?  I would like to know the answer.  If you want to know, I would suggest you do the same.  You would be surprised to hear the answer.</p>
<p>You’re asking the question: “Is it the left?”  Is it the right?  If so, why is it the Left?  It’s the left.  If not, then the left is the right.  You are asking the wrong question.  Why is it that the left doesn’t want you to be a socialist?  Why are you asking the right to control the media?  You want to control what you think?  The left wants you to control your own media, and the right wants to control you?  What do you think
<p>Also, why are you trying to convince people that this is a hoax? Why are you pretending to be a conservative?  What are you doing?  Why are they pretending to care?  Is it because of the media?  It&#39;s all about money, and the media is just trying to distract people from the fact that the media isn&#40;t doing anything about it?  Do you think the media are trying to influence the election?  The media is trying to manipulate the election to favor the Democrat party, but the media wants to distract the public from the real issues

That’s not the same as Ted Cruz fleeing Texas during the snowstorms is it

Truth:
The same regulations that the federal government would not allow to be lifted right before one of the worst winter storms Texas experienced in over 100 years?

Prediction:
<p>This is not the same as Ted Cruz fleeing Texas during the snowstorms.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you’re going to be able to say that because of the snowstorms that are still in the area.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that the Trump administration is trying to sabotage the state’s infrastructure or that they’re trying to save the state from the worst of the worst. That’d be a different story.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Doesn’t fit the bill of being the “correct” skin color and with the party that is deemed “bad”. So it’s naturally a no go.

Truth:
<p>They are scared RINO’s and provide very little to the party.  Can’t move forward if those 2 remain.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It’s not like you’re a racist or a victim of racism, it’d be easier for you to just say “no” to someone else. You are a racist. It&#39;s not what you want to hear. It is what you do.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see why that would be the case. It just isn’t right. It’s not right.  There’ll always be someone who will disagree with you.  I’m not going to tell you why you’re racist or what your opinions are.  It”s just not right for me to say it.</p>
<p>No, I don’t think it’s fair to punish someone for being a racist.</p>

Also the OP isn't even a US citizen which makes his investment in Jan 6 (and habit of posting fringe-y sources) all the weirder.

Truth:
Further, yikes. That video is indeed tough to watch. Joe is absolutely creepy in it. Unfortunately, that doesn't make him pedophile, and you never even addressed Kamala.

Prediction:
<p>That&#39;s just a very small amount of money, and the fact that the US government is not allowing you to buy property in the country is ridiculous.</p>
<p>You’re not a US citizen, nor are you a European. You’ve never been in the US. Which is why the fact that you are a foreign country is so absurd. You can’t be a European, and you’ll never have an American passport. So what’s the point of being a European? </p>
<p>The fact that Trump was born in the US makes it even more absurd. The fact that he’s a non-American makes it all the more ridiculous. It makes it much harder for me to believe that he&#39;s a US citizen.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
deplatforming works, see how no one but his fans hear about Trump anymore

Truth:
<p>Do you understand what I&#39;m trying to get at? You&#39;re faith is in individual people who haven&#39;t done anything to earn that faith. At least the voter fraud investigations turned up some things, but were found to be insignificant and they adjusted the votes anyways. Trump had hotlines made for people to submit evidence and still nothing turned up. Trump still hasn&#39;t released everything he has on the matter.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Trump’s supporters are still saying he is a racist, but he is no racist.</p>
<p>Trump’s supporters are so pissed at him that they don’t want to listen to him anymore. They’re pissed that he’ll never listen to them.</p>
<p>Trump’s “fake news” is a joke, which is not true. He never says anything about it. His supporters have no idea what he is talking about. They just say “yeah, he’ll say something about it”.</p>

No self respecting conservative dude would date that horsed-face hoe bag

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you should date a conservative, I think you are too liberal.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a conservative. I&#40;m a conservative, and I don't think it’s a good idea to single out conservatives for being racist.</p>
<p>No self respecting conservative dude would date a liberal dude like that.</p>

Give guns to kids, great idea. Makes you wonder how school shootings even happen. Idk, maybe it's because this specific tread draws in idiots who act as if they stand on standby, guns ready for when a new Hitler comes to power and think Germans should arm themselves to prevent it from happening again. They really like to say that Germany should become as "free" as the USA, even though the USA is the one with a serious gun problem.

Truth:
<p>I&#39;m going to go with this one, considering that same government introduced anti-gun legislation immediately after this event. Obama was a nasty globalist but he wasn&#39;t stupid, Sandy Hook was a KGB style false flag down to the training script. How would the wreckage make money off of hurting parents? Taunting them with blackmail/gangstalking type stuff? Please expand on how you would see that working</p>

Prediction:
<p>I love the idea of gun control, but I also think it’s ridiculous that the federal government would have to make it harder for children to get a gun. It’d be absurd to think that the government would make it easier for kids to get one. It&#39;s just irresponsible to think about the consequences of gun violence. If the government wants to reduce the number of gun deaths in the United States, it should be more difficult for them to do so. They’re in a position to do it by making it harder on kids.
<p>It&#39;s not like the gun control movement is a threat to the American people. It&#40;s a way to protect our kids from gun violence. It's a way of protecting our freedoms, not a way for the government to keep us safe. And the government is not a force to be reckoned with. It is a tool of its own making, and it is not meant to be used against anyone. If you want to be a free country, you should be able to do so. The government should be willing to help you if you need it.</p>
<p>I also think that it is a good idea to give kids guns to protect themselves when they are in school. It would be great to give them the ability to defend themselves from the gun-control virus, but it would also be good for the kids to be able to get guns to their friends, which would also make them more susceptible to the virus. It&#39;s also good for them to get away from the virus, which is why the CDC says that the virus is a real threat to their lives. The CDC says it is not able to prevent the spread of the virus because of the lack

So you agree that today's capitalism sucks ass?

Prediction:
<p>I agree that capitalism sucks. It&#39;s fucking disgusting.</p>
<p>I agree that capitalism sucks, but I also agree with your argument that it’s really bad for the environment.</p>
<p>You’re right, capitalism sucks.</p>

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.

Truth:
Regan signed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act and shifted all the  responsibilities of taking care of homelessness and mental illness away from the government because his wife Nancy thought good people and corporations would foot the bill for taking care of other people. It’s just too expensive for regular people to support and private companies don’t care about people, especially not people that don’t work for them.

Prediction:
<p>The pandemic was a non-negotiable issue. It was a pandemic and people were dying.   The pandemic caused the death of millions of people.  It caused a huge pandemic, and it caused a massive backlash.  This pandemic is not something you can just ignore and ignore.  Even if the pandemic were to spread in the United States, it would have been much easier for the CDC to help.  That would have made a huge difference.  The government would have done more to help, but they didn’t.  Now they’re trying
<p>I don&#39;t understand why people are so afraid of Trump, but he&#40;s the one who is making the most of the pandemic. He&#41;s not going to take advantage of it. His decision to go to the states was completely un-American.  He didn’t go to any states, nor did he go to a country that had a lot of people who had to suffer from it.  This is a totally different situation than the one in the states.  His decision was made to stay in a state that has a ton of people
<p>She&#39;s a hypocrite. She&#40;s not the only one who seems to be suffering from the pandemic, but her actions and decisions are very different from that of the previous president. Her decision to go on vacation for the holidays was a complete waste of time and money, and she&#38;s doing the same thing with the flu pandemic. Her actions were completely unworkable and a complete failure of her ability to deal with the virus and her decision to stay home was completely self destructive and self destructive.  She could have avoided the flu, but she

yeah I feel like the original criticism lost the plot when he brought up her bf's sandals in Florida.  had he stayed on topic he might have had a better case, but it makes him seem like a hater

Truth:
<p>And then what? DeSantis solved covid and  hospitalization rates are doing down in Florida, because those things were smears which never landed on him. The left might hate him but his numbers among independents are fair because he doesn&#39;t scare new voters away.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s also possible that Biden was a victim of the “p>shooting” of the media because he was a hypocrite. If he’d been more careful he might have been able to stop the shooting. But instead he went after the media and criticized the whole thing.  As a result, he was able to distract from the real issue and continue to blame the media for the shooting on the victim.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but I just didn’t get the point. I just think he’s not as good as he was when he was in Florida. I think if he had been a better person, I think he would have been a much better person.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it was a bad idea to bring up the fact that she was wearing sandals in Florida. I think if you were willing to look at the facts and be willing to admit that she wore sandals, you could have been able to look into the facts. But if you weren’t, you would have been surprised to see that she’d have had sandals at all.  It’s not a good idea.</p>

>This is the left's argument for any time someone brings up censorship they will say a private business has the right to run it however they want.  That is the rights argument as well isnt it? That private businesses get to run however it wants.. I think it is disingenuous to pretend there is no difference in a public space and a private space.

Truth:
<p>For what exactly? They have the right to refuse service if they want, it&#39;s a private business. You don&#39;t have to agree with their choice, and can choose not to financially support their choice. It&#39;s a bit much to say they should be closed for that though.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think that private businesses are going to be able to control the public space. If they want to, they have to be willing to do so. They are not allowed to control what people do, which is not their business, and they have the right to do it. I think that’s the whole point of private businesses. It’ll be hard to convince people that they are allowed to do what they want without being forced to do. That’d be stupid.</p>
<p>The left is always trying to convince people that the private sector is somehow more important than the public realm. If you are against the private sphere, then you’re wrong. The private sector can and should be allowed to be a part of the public space, but the public can’t be a monopoly on it. It’s not the same as the private market. You’ve got to be willing to pay for a private business to exist. That is the way it is. You have to be able to control it.
<p>This is the left’s argument that if a private business wants to take a public space, they should. If a private company wants a public place, then they should take a private property and run it.  The left wants to make sure that private businesses don’t take that space.  That is the opposite of what the left wants.  They want to make private businesses take public property, not private businesses.  This is not what they want to do.  It is what they’re trying to do with private property.</p>

I swear dude, you guys all just look for a reason to be mad at anyone but yourselves—I hope your illegitimate children come home one day and disavow Jesus and talk about Critical Race Theory ;)

Truth:
<p>Mask mandates were never meant to stay forever lol, they were meant to frenzy prople into the covid scare whose aim was to 1.get rid of trump  2.control and suppress the right (shapiro couldn&#39;t do his usual college talks right at the most crucial political time while leftists were encouraged to riot freely) 3.make people bow down to political &quot;scientists&quot; while convincing said people the right is anti science and therefore responsible for grandma dying, they got all those aims</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t want to be a hypocrite, I&#40;m not a racist, I just want to think like you&#38;re a normal human being. I don’t want you to think that you’re anti-black, you&quot;r a bigot. You&#37;re not a bigot, and you are not anti-white, you are anti-racist.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that I’d rather not see my children suffer. I just don’t want to see them suffer for it. I don&#39;t want them to suffer for the sins of others. I want to be able to tell my kids that they are normal people and that they’re normal people. I also want to tell them that you’ve got a right to be a decent person and not be left to judge them for what they are.  I just want to know why they”re doing it.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that the racist media is a good thing, but I think it’s a good idea to look at the evidence and see if you’re willing to engage in the same behavior as the white supremacist media.</p>

Government collapses is a little overdramatic for a PM resigning, it will just mean another guy from the party will replace him. Also finlands healthcare is free and much better than in the US.

Truth:
<p>This is not to say that no one should get the vaccine because getting the vaccine seems to be much safer than getting COVID for many people, especially the elderly. Just to show that the millions of people already infected are likely now more safe from the virus than those who only got the vaccine. The number of lab-confirmed cases of covid is also probably a very low estimation of the true number of cases.</p>

Prediction:
<p>This is a little overdramatic for a government that wants to make sure it’s working, but I think it makes sense for us to make it work. It’ll also make it easier for other countries to do the same, like China, which has a much better economy than the US. If China were to take over, we’d be in a much worse situation than we are right now.”
<p>I would also say that if you want to throw your party out of power, you can vote for someone else. That is not what the left is doing. It’s just a political party. They’re trying to make a living off of it. The left is trying to convince the left to throw their party out, but the left isn’t listening to the left and is not listening to them.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that the US government will be able to get rid of Trump because of the election, but I do think he will be more effective in the future and the US will be better off without him.</p>

if they were vax'd it would have probably been a more mild case of death

Truth:
<p>If Floyd was choked to death, you could remove Chauvin from the equation and Floyd wouldn’t have died.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Vax is a very mild disease and I would think it’s a more mild case than a mild case. </p>
<p>That’s probably a good thing, because it’d be a lot less likely to spread. It’ll just be more likely to make people sick.</p>
<p>Also, I think it would have been a much more mild case of vax death than it is now. I don&#39;t think it was a very big deal. I think the virus is still a very small risk.</p>

Just remember: double-aught buck makes composite materials shatter.  Also remember: US army helicopters use composite rotor blades.  Two independent thoughts.

Truth:
Shoulder fired SAMs = America has sold Stingers to Taiwan (although the real Chinese threat to Taiwan comes in the form of bombers and fighters that fly much higher and faster than Stinger is capable of hitting. Stinger is mainly an anti-helicopter weapon)

Prediction:
<p>Also, I don’t think you’re convinced that the whole thing is a hoax. I think it’s just a matter of the fact that the US has a bunch of helicopters that are completely unvaxable and are not safe. That’ll be the end of it. </p>
<p>Also, the fact that the vaccine is manufactured in the US is not a surprise. It&#39;s a fact.</p>
<p>But don&#39;t forget that the US Army uses composite armor, which makes it easier to destroy the enemy. </p>

*Law v. Whitmer,* No. 10 OC 00163 1B (Nev. Dist. Ct., Carson City)  "Nevertheless, the court went on to rule on the merits that there was no proof of machine malfunctions, improper votes, election board malfeasance, or vote manipulation. The court dismissed the case with prejudice."

Truth:
<p>However none of that applies here. Your TOS argument is not the unforseen result of some rider on the Civil Rights Act.  There is no law that allows tech giants censorship or disallows (although 230 enables them). You can make an argument for Sherman violation, which I think Parler is a great example. The 1st amendment did not predict extremely powerful corporations that had the unique power to control information and restrict what was deemed an inalienable right (still deemed by half the country).</p>

Prediction:
<p>The Court ruled that there was no evidence of election fraud at all. It also ruled that the election board did not have the authority to issue a final election result. The Court also ruled on the merits of the case, finding that there were no election fraud claims. The court also said that the ballot was not fraudulent. The courts did not find evidence of fraud. There is no proof of fraud, and the courts have not ruled on whether there was any evidence of fraudulent ballot stuffing. </p>
<p>The court also ruled that there was no evidence of election fraud or election fraud. The court said there was zero evidence of fraud. It also said that the election board had not made any such claims. </p>
<p>But the court ruled that there was no proof of election fraud. The court said there was not. The case was dismissed with prejudice because there were no allegations of fraud. It also said that the court did not find evidence of voter fraud. </p>

Repent to your imaginary God so that I'll accept your conservative human values? Religion is supposed to be about connecting with something higher, forming community, pondering questions we don't yet have answers for, helping people. Not projecting your values onto other people and treating them like spiritual law.

Truth:
Those of us who believe are afforded grace thanks to the sacrifice of Jesus. That does not give us leave to continue in our sin. A heart that is truly repentant will obey God, so they will not look at sin the same way as you’re viewing it right now.

Prediction:
<p>You’re a conservative, you should be able to choose what you want to do with your life, and that’s what conservatives are all about. You’ll have to decide what you think and what you believe, but I’m not going to tell you what I think. I think you’d be surprised at how many people in your life agree with your beliefs, which is a huge disservice to yourself and to others. You are going to have to listen to your gut feelings, and if you don’t listen to them, then how will you react?
<p>You think that Christianity is all about being a good religion? It&#39;s all about serving others, not serving yourself. That&quot; is what Christianity is about. Christianity is a religion that is about serving the people, not giving them power and control. That is what religion is about, being good and caring for the people. If you want to be good, you can be good at that.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t agree with your definition of religion. I think it’s important to understand that the definition of “belief” is not about “being religious” but rather “doing something good” for others. That’ll make people better. It’d make them better people. </p>

So, I see the comedy, but this is an instance where I think pointing out this woman as trans is mean.   She isn't fucking up women's sports. She is just smart and won on Jeopardy playing by the same rules as every other male, female, trans, etc.   It is one thing when a trans person uses their biological advantage to gain an "achievement" they otherwise don't deserve due to biology. I don't think this is one of them.

Truth:
<p>It doesn&#39;t make them good or pleasant people,  but it has to be noted that military measures that stay within modern SOP simply can&#39;t eradicate them. It is perhaps to the Coalition&#39;s credit that they never entertained changing procedures to be less humane and more effective, but we are seeing play out in real life the conundrum posed by George Martin in the character of Tywin Lannister: his immense cruelty in doing anything to win can actually lead to more humane outcomes than can be delivered by softer hearted characters.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’re not going to say that I’m a racist or a bigot. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I think it’d be stupid to think that if I were a bigot, I would think that I would be able to laugh at a joke. I just think that being a bigot is a good thing. That’ll make me feel better about myself. That would be great, but I”m not a bigot and I don&#39;t want to make people feel bad for being a racist.
<p>I don&#39;t agree that this is a gender issue. I don't think it is a matter of gender identity, but it is one of the things that is so important to me that I think it should be a concern to people that are white, cisgender, or otherwise male. I also don't agree with the argument that the gender identity issue is a biological issue, and I don&quot;t think it&#38;s a social issue, I just think it’s one of those things that are so important that people should be able to say “well
<p>I don&#39;t think the people who hate me are racist, or are anti-trans, or anti-women. I think that the whole point of being a trans person is to make people feel good about themselves and make them feel better about themselves. It is not to make everyone feel bad about themselves, but to make them believe that they are somehow better than the person who is trans. I don't think this is an excuse for not being able to have a good time. If you want to be a good person, you can be one of the best at what you do.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Yeah, I’m curious to see what happens. I hope it’s a good thing. If you’re a fan, I would love to see how it goes. We’ll see.</p>

Oh yeah net good. Because myocarditis, stroke and death are on the same level as a week long headache and sore muscles. The "vaccine" is basically worthless since omicron.

Truth:
<p><em>&quot;Hurr durr but we don&#39;t know how long natural immunity lasts!&quot;</em>  Well, we DO now know that the vaccine doesn&#39;t last, to the point that without regular boosters, after several months, you are now actually <em>worse off</em> than had you never taken the vaccine at all.   </p>

Prediction:
<p>The vaccine has the potential to save lives, but it also will reduce the risk of dying from the flu. If you have a mild cold, you don&#39;t have to worry about it. It's not your fault, it is your responsibility to take care of your body.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the vaccine is bad for your body. It’s not good for your immune system. It doesn’t help your body to get better. It just makes you feel better. And it’ll make you feel worse. You’re not going to feel better for it. I’d be very surprised if you’ve never heard of it. It makes you think it”s better for your health.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the reason the vaccine is so effective. It’s a no-brainer, since it’ll give you the best shot at survival. And the only reason it”s effective is that it doesn’t have to be used for the duration of your life. You’re going to get the best of both worlds, right?</p>

No he doesn't whenever the case gets to the point to present evidence their lawyers drop the case and re up it. Its perpetually in pretrial. Nothing they have said is on the record. Meanwhile many of these women have actually named people and no one seems to care.

Truth:

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.

Truth:
There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not a doctor. I just don’t know how you know it’s a vaccine. I have no idea how you’re able to know how it works. You can”t tell from the data. It’d be hard to tell. You don&#40;t have to be a doctor to know if you”re going to get the vaccine. You just have to know the vaccine is a risk factor. If you don“t have a vaccine, you don't have to get it. You’ve just got
<p>It’s just one of those things. If you’re unvaccinated, then you have to worry about the safety of your own body. If they don’t get vaccinated, then the risk of contracting the virus is greater than the benefit of the vaccinated person. If the vaccine works, then it’ll help.”
<p>It’s also a question of how you can tell whether a vaccine is safe and/or not. If you’re not vaccinated, then it’d be easier to say “no” to the vaccine. It’ll be harder to say that because there are different types of vaccine available. I’m not saying that vaccines are safe, but they are not always the best choice for you. If a vaccine prevents the spread of disease, then you are not a risk to yourself, and you have to be careful not to spread the virus to others. If your disease

Wooooooow. Good job you were able to name one thing about communism that is not the same as socialism. How about how they are the same since thats what you seem to believe? Try not to accuse me of psychotic shit in your answer this time. Be less pro stupid.

Truth:
<p>If I read an article that said &quot;communism is bad&quot; and then it listed the good qualities 6if communism, I would also think the article is actually trying to sway people to think more positively about communism, despite the article starting with a disclaimer saying communism is bad.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Also, I don&#39;t think socialism is the same as communism. I think it is. I don’t think it’s the same thing as communism, but I think the latter is more likely to work than the former. I mean, I think you’re not the only one who thinks communism is the right thing to do. You’ve got to be careful what you say and what you do.</p>
<p>Also, I don&#39;t think that’s one of the reasons why you’re a socialist because of the fact that you think communism is a good idea. It’d be a good thing if it were, but it’ll be a lot harder for you to get rid of that shit. So I’m not going to say that you”re a “leftist”. I don’t think it”s a good policy idea. You are a rightist. I think you are a leftist.
<p>I don&#39;t think that’s any different than socialism. There is no difference between socialism and communism. Neither is communism, and neither is communism. Both are not the same. Both have their flaws, but both are not different. If you want to be a socialist, you can be one of the few who is willing to admit you’re wrong.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines. All of the doctors I saw on major media outlets when asked responded with either "we don't know" or "the data doesn't suggest that". Thats how scientist approach any subject. In fact, stating any of these points, or even their counter point as 100% certainty is irresponsible and without nuance. It is rare that anything is ever 100%

Truth:
<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates. Logical contradictions are all over the place and most people don&#39;t notice or care, I find it really hard to describe the average person in that case as &quot;reasonable&quot;. They are brainwashed sheep.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You’re wrong. There’s no scientific evidence that proves that the virus is a pandemic. There is no scientific basis for a vaccine. There are no scientific studies that support the idea that the vaccine is safe. There isn’t a single scientific reason why the virus would be safe. No scientific basis. No evidence to support the claim that it is safe to spread the virus. No proof that the disease is safe at all. No conclusive proof that it’ll spread.</p>
<p>No, I don&#39;t think there is any scientific evidence that supports the claim that the vaccine is safe. There is no scientific evidence supporting the claim. There are no scientific studies that support the claim.</p>
<p>There are no scientific studies that support the claim that the vaccine is safe. There is no scientific proof of the vaccine's effectiveness. There are no epidemiological studies that prove the vaccine works, and there is no evidence that it is safe.</p>

Since no one is actually responding with the truth, it looks like they're still investigating: https://abcnews.go.com/US/gaetz-associate-joel-greenberg-agrees-pay-seminole-county/story?id=81753877  The investigation is ongoing and they've delayed the sentencing of his friend that is cooperating twice.

Truth:
<p>And mind you, something people keep forgetting, this case was COVERED UP, and wasn&#39;t uncovered till months later. So there&#39;s some corruption involved in this case. So you&#39;d think the media would be pushing more for THIS TRIAL to get justice.....but NOPE, they wanna pour their vitriol &amp; hatred on Kyle Rittenhouse...</p>

LOL, she should have fled the country like Cruz.   There is another headline that she was “dining maskless”. Yeah… nobody requires masks while you are eating not even NYC. LOL, their target audience isn’t smart enough to pick up on that though.

Truth:
<p>But as a business, I think that just taking precautions to help people stay a little further apart and doing your best to prevent infection spread should be enough. I think alienating people on this basis is just unwise. I think that there’s been very few clusters (comparatively) proven to have originated in restaurants like this. If it originates in a restaurant, it’s because a massive party of people drinking and fucking in bathrooms spread while they danced and screamed in close proximity to each other. Applebee’s probably wouldn’t be responsible for a single cluster even if it operated as usual.</p>

Prediction:
<p>She should be banned from the country. She should be kicked out of the country for not being a good human being. She&#39;s a hypocrite. She was never a good person, she was a terrible person. She shouldn&#40;t have been banned from her country for being a bad person. </p>
<p>She should have been fired from her job for being a mouthpiece for a group of people. She should be fired for not being a “woman”. She&#39;s just not one of those people, she’s not a politician. She’d be fired from the company she founded.  She”s a hypocrite, she should be shamed for being one of them.  You’re not a woman.  I’m not a fucking idiot.   I can’t think of a single reason why she should have left the
<p>You should have just gotten rid of the mask and gone home. That&#39;s the only reason why I&#38;m going to keep wearing masks. It&#37;s because I don’t want to be a hypocrite. I don't want to see people who are wearing masks in public, I want to get rid of them. You should be ashamed of yourself for wearing masks when you&#40;re in public.</p>

Didn't they used to hang train and stagecoach robbers out west?  That should put a damper on robberies.

Truth:
<p>What if a sheriff decided that theft laws were unconditional because it interferes with the robbers right to pursue happiness or some shit? </p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think they should have banned immigrants from going to Mexico. They&#40;re still illegal in Mexico and they&#38;re not allowed to travel to the US to work legally, but they should be able to travel freely and freely. It would be better for them to do so.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why they&#40;re doing this, but I think it would be a good idea to put a stop to it. If you want to make this a reality, you can just do it. It would be good for the economy, but it would also make it harder for the government to take action.</p>
<p>That would make a big difference in the ability of the US to get out of the way of terrorist attacks, which is why they have been doing it for so long. They should be able to go back in time and start doing it again.</p>

negligent homicide gets jail time, whether they deserve jail time depends on whether they pose a significant ongoing threat to society. jails are built to protect the public not to get revenge on people who make mistakes.

Truth:
<p>If you protest against violent criminals, who exactly would you be hoping to pressure to get criminals to stop being criminals?  It&#39;s not like those people if caught on camera and identified are not going to be charged, unlike the police who have historically not even been charged with a crime when they murder someone in the line of duty.  Which is why people protest over extrajudicial murders by the police.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The point is that if you’re guilty of a crime, then you should be locked up for the rest of your life. If you are convicted of a felony, the consequences are much greater than the consequences of your actions. If your life&#39;s not in danger, then the consequences should be far greater than what you think.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the person who committed the crime should be thrown in jail. The law is to punish the person for doing the wrong thing. It is to ensure that no one else gets hurt. This is to make sure that the individual who committed it doesn’t get fired. The government is not responsible for the behavior of others.</p>
<p>The point is that if a person is convicted of a crime, they should be thrown out of jail for a long time. This doesn’t make them immune from the consequences of their actions. It’s the same thing for people who are convicted of crimes. That’ll always be the case. They’re not in jail for it.</p>

1 flight, FLA to NYC/NJ. That's it.

Truth:
A) Its a fucking airline.

Prediction:
<p>BANTER TO FLA. BANTER to FLA.</p>
<p>One flight to NYC/NJ. One flight to NY/NJ</p>
<p>On the way to New York I took a flight to Newark. I checked in with the same people and they were all in the same plane. I didn’t know they were going to be there. I’m not going to get them. I know they’re going to come back. I will get them in the morning.</p>

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.

Truth:
<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think there is any such thing as a vaccine that is safe for anyone. There is no vaccine that would be safe for everyone. There are still millions of people who are willing to give it their all, but it has become a huge burden for people who want to get it. I think there are a lot of people out there who think that there is no way to get the vaccine, because there is just no reason to think otherwise. There isn&#40;t any real reason to believe that it is safe to get a vaccine, and there is a huge amount of
<p>I’m not saying that the vaccine was a perfect cure, but I don’t think you’re ever going to be able to get rid of it. It’s just not the case. I also think that the whole argument against the vaccine is a complete misunderstanding of the facts and that’ll make it harder for you to get it. I think it’d be easier for the vaccine to be effective than the vaccine itself, but the vaccine isn”t the only cure you”re going to get.
<p>I don&#39;t think that the vaccine is going to stop the spread of misinformation, but it is a very real issue. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous that people are still talking about it when they’re not actually getting the vaccine, and they don’t seem to realize that the virus is still there. The vaccine is not going to reduce the spread, and I don”t think it will stop people from spreading misinformation and misinformation. It’ll only make them more susceptible to spreading misinformation. </p>

Hey, are you me? I am trying to escape to Florida as well. Just hoping I can get a nurse to fake jab me for a bribe or wait until the restrictions are lifted.

Truth:
<p>When Democrats have tried to paint Florida as hell on Earth but then vacation there - yes.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Still trying to get a doctor to come to Florida to help me. I am trying to convince them to let me stay in Florida. I want to be able to go to Florida and stay with my grandmother. If they don&#39;t want me to stay, I will go back to Florida with my grandma and my brother. I would love to be in Florida with them.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get a nurse to come to my house to help me. I’d love to see if I can get a doctor to get me a prescription. I just don’t know how to get one. So, I am trying to find a way to get an abortion and get one in my state. I think that’s a good idea. But I don&#39;t know what to do with the money I got. I hope they can find a doctor who can help me.</p>
<p>I am trying to get a doctor to come to my house and tell me if I can get a nurse to come and help me. If I don’t, I’m going to have to go to the hospital and get a new doctor. I don&#39;t want to be a burden on you, I want you to be one of the first to know that I”m not going to be there. </p>

Lol. "No it isn't, but if it was it would be democrats." It is clearly political, it is the flag for a military unit. It is by definition politics.   The conservative movement didn't used to be identified with the Confederacy until it chose to continue to prop up hateful losers like Marjorie Taylor Greene.   There used to be real conservative policy makers and now instead of promoting real ideas conservatives are left with just trying to lie.

Truth:
<p>Liz Cheney represents the new normal that the democrats are trying to force feed us.  She isn&#39;t on our side.  We don&#39;t like the Federal reserve.  We don&#39;t like bailouts.  We are keeping our guns.  We don&#39;t wear masks anymore.  We are, as current numbers indicate, not interested in joining the armed forces anymore.  </p>

Prediction:
<p>But that’s not the point. If it was, we’d be okay with it. We’re not going to tolerate it. If you want to defend your freedoms, then you’ll need to defend them. You’ve got to be willing to listen to the people who disagree with you. You can’t just ignore them and continue to ignore them. It’v not the way to win. You have to be a conservative, not a liberal. You just have to accept the fact that you can be a bigot. That is your choice.
<p>A. You don&#39;t need to be a racist to believe that. You can be a conservative and be a liberal, but the left is a racist and the right is a bigot. The left is not a racist, they are a conservative, and the left wants to destroy the left and destroy the right. They are a reactionary party, and they want to destroy our democracy. They want to kill our freedom and our freedom. They don't want to stop us from doing what we do, but that&#40;s just not what they want.</p>
<p>The only reason I want to say that is because conservatives are a bunch of morons who think that is what conservatives are, which is to say they are not. They don’t think that’s what conservatives want to do. They want to be left alone and not have to deal with the consequences of their actions. They’re not going to be able to do anything to change the course of history. They need to be free to think outside the box, which means they’ll be okay with it. They are the ones who want to make things better for the country. They

I'm confused, is it a good thing then that without gun control the USA has the highest rate of gun related homicide per capita of all developed countries and the second highest total of gun deaths overall?  Is this what the second amendment was all about?

Truth:
<p>If Trump is responsible for the high death rate in the USA, is he responsible for the death rate in other countries? The UK, Portugal, Italy, and Belgium all have higher deaths per million than the USA. </p>

Prediction:
<p>That&#39;s not to say that the US is the worst country in the world for gun deaths. In fact, if you look at the US, we have the highest rate of gun deaths per capita in the developed world and the second highest rate per capita of all developed countries. The US has the lowest rate of deaths per 100,000 people in the US and the highest per capita homicide rate of all the developed countries.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not sure if there’s a reason that the US has the highest rate of gun deaths in the developed world, or if the US is one of the few countries with the highest rates of gun homicides per capita, but the US also has the lowest rate of deaths per capita of any developed country. If so, why is it that the country has the most gun deaths?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how that works, but I also know that the US has the highest rate of gun deaths per capita of all developed countries, and also the highest homicide rate in the developed world. If you look at the CDC data, you can see that the majority of deaths are attributable to gun control, and the majority are from people who have a gun. This is not a surprise to me. It is not the first time that the CDC has shown a decrease in gun deaths in the United States.</p>

Nobody’s crying. Just challenging disgusting behaviour - something maybe you’re not used to. :/

Truth:
Further, yikes. That video is indeed tough to watch. Joe is absolutely creepy in it. Unfortunately, that doesn't make him pedophile, and you never even addressed Kamala.

Prediction:
<p>I don’t think it’s offensive. I think it is a bit of a joke that they’re trying to make fun of. I’m not surprised by the response.</p>
<p>I can’t say that I’m offended by this. I just hate it when people say it, and I hate it if people do it.</p>
<p>I’m not surprised by your response. It’s just not something that I would expect from a person who would be surprised by it. I’ve never heard of it, but I certainly don’t expect it from someone who’d be shocked by it.</p>

What point was that? Any person who supports the Democrats is a nut job independent of what label you put on them.

Truth:
<p>Democrats lack any ability to think for themselves and literally believe whatever thier overlords tell them to believe.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Democrats are a bunch of morons. They’re a moron. It’s not their job to make you think they’ll be good or bad. They should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can call a Democrat a racist because they are a Democrat. You can call them a racist if you want to, but you can&#40;t call them racists because they have no reason to be racist.</p>
<p>You’re right, I’m not a Democrat. I don’t think you should be a Democrat, I think you are a Republican, and I think that’s the whole point of being a democrat. I think most of us would agree with that. I also think that the Democrats are a bunch of morons, but I think they’d be better off with someone who is more conservative than them.</p>

>Certain versions of speech are arbitrarily not protected.   I don't want to argue with you or change your mind, but I don't want to share a country with you either.

Truth:
<p>I do not believe there should be rights where you have to force others to provide you with something (positive rights). Healthcare is not a right as I should not be able to force anyone to care for me that doesn’t want to. I can not force them to do so because I do not have control over their time or their labor.</p>

Prediction:
<p>My point is that there is no such thing as free speech. I don&#39;t want to force people to choose between freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I also don't want to impose my will on others. I am not a free market capitalist, nor am I a free trader, and I will never be free to make my own choices. I do not want to be a slave to another culture. I will not force anyone else to follow my rules. I want to make sure my choices are fair and reasonable. I have no desire to impose any restrictions on others.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to be a part of any political party that thinks they are better than anyone else. If you think you are better, then you’re not. You’ll be left alone. I don’t care about your opinions.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to change the rules of the game. I&#40;m not a big fan of authoritarianism, but I don't want to see the consequences of it on my own. I also don't think it's fair to impose any restrictions on others in that way. I think it’s a very good idea for the government to respect the rights of others, and I don’t think it is a good idea to ban people from doing so.  I think this is a very bad idea.  If you want to ban someone from doing it,

The initial claim is that mRNA would totally stop the virus and people who get the shot can’t get or transmit the virus. And no booster would be necessary. And mandates aren’t practical. Practically everything about the virus by the people being paid by Pfizer has been misinformation so far. I’m just asking questions. Made no scientific claims unlike the people who “claim” they know. I ask things like, do heathy kids need this? But the burden of proof is on the people asking questions without long term studies. Fuck off troll.

Truth:
<p>By you&#39;re own logic, nobody should listen to you anyways, you&#39;re not a doctor. My own doctor told me not to get the vaccine, because I have natural immunity. It&#39;s fairly common for other doctors to give the same advice. But they all must be &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; huh? You know better than them.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think that the vaccine is going to stop the spread of the virus. The vaccine is not going to prevent it. It&#40;s going to keep the virus from spreading. It won&#38;t stop it from spreading because the vaccine will make people less likely to spread it. I&#37;m not a scientist, I just think it would be easier for the vaccine to spread because it would stop it.  I don't think it will stop it in the long run.  Why would it be easier to spread the virus?  It&
<p>There is no proof that the vaccine works. There is no evidence that the virus can be spread. There are no epidemiological studies that prove that the vaccines are effective. There has been no scientific evidence that can be made to prove the vaccine actually works. The vaccine is not anti-vaxx, it is not a vaccine. It is a vaccine, and the vaccine isn’t a cure. It will not stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>It’s not that the vaccine isn’t good for kids. It’d be better if there was a vaccine that would help. The vaccine is not going to prevent the spread of the virus. It&#39;s not a cure for a virus. If you get the vaccine, you’ll be fine. The reason why it’re not working is because the vaccine doesn&#40;t work. It just isn&#41;t going to help the kids. </p>

It's so crazy how science and common sense works!

Truth:
Into an argument about how the scientific method does not allow for much opinion in peer reviewed results is kind of impressive in a horrific way.

Prediction:

<p>It’s so crazy how science and common sense works. It’ll never stop!</p>

Everyone Omar is ISIS with lips! She’s a joke and in the end she has no power. Everyone is waking up to realizing Islam is a joke! I’ve read the whole Koran and it’s a laughable hilarity of contradiction lol and if we are arguing who holds the ownership of where the Dome sits? It’s not even close. The Jews have had that land for thousands of years before Islam was even an idea…the whole religion is a joke…why is Jesus’s name mentioned more than Mohammed in the Koran? Exactly 25 times when Mohammed’s name is only mentioned 4 times…why is the only woman named in the Koran Mary the mother of Jesus….reading it makes it clear that plagiarism and hypocrisy were the motivations of the writers of the Koran…Mohamed couldn’t even read or write for crying out loud…give it time, Omar will be a cold fart in the wind

Truth:
<p>The Trinity is a completely man made idea that is nowhere in the Bible. To act like it somehow is gospel because the Nicaean Council deemed it so it silly. It isn&#39;t an idea that showed up until over 150 years after Jesus&#39; death.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’ve read the Koran, I think it’s a joke. The idea that the Islamic state is a “terrorist” is absurd. I’m not saying the Islamic State is a terrorist, I just think the whole concept is a joke, and the fact that the Koran is a political statement is just a matter of fact.</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re a religious person, then you are a moron and you are not a Christian. You are a fucking moron. You have no right to think that the Koran is a joke. It&#38;s not. You can&quot;t claim that the bible is a hoax or that the Bible is a religion. The Bible is an argument for the fact that Jesus was a fraud, and the bible was written for the purpose of spreading Christianity. The Koran is an excuse for the sins of the Jews. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not a convert to Christianity. I&#40;m just a religious person who wants to believe that Christianity is a good religion and that God is the God of the universe. It&#38;s a joke. I don&#37;t understand why Christianity is so important to the people of the world, but I have no real reason to think that Christianity isn’t a religion that’s a religion. It’ll never be a religion, it’d be a religious cult. It isn&#36;t a religious movement.
