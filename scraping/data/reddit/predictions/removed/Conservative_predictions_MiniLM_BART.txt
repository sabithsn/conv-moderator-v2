Point one, can you provide a source that isn't to the left of Mao?      Point two, did you notice that even your overt Communist source didn't name a single individual who wouldn't be able to vote under these laws?	<p>And... of course, if you&#39;re not to the left of Mao Zedong, you&#39;re essentially a Counter Revolutionary in the eyes of the city&#39;s Cultural Revolution.</p>	<p>If you are talking about voting rights, Mao Zedong was a communist too.</p>
I don‚Äôt take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being ‚Äúretarded‚Äù ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I‚Äôm proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity. I do wish you the best in life.	You should always take an active role in your child's education. It's some of the most important shit growing up but everyone treated it as 'their little break from their kids' for so long we weren't considering the damage it could do. I'm hoping that we can really get to the bottom of our shit school system as a whole with this divide but I digress.	<p>Educated kids are the opposite of the system. The system is not the same as the education system.</p>

As long as it's the unvaccinated, it's a good thing.	Compared to unvaccinated:	<p>If you‚Äôre unvaccinated and need constant boosters, you are in the right, morally if not legally.

This law will not stand on such grounds.</p>
Where is NOW in all this?

Because bootlickers like nazis	Again, strange that you find it necessary to imagine that I don't know that, and have to educate myself about that.

Enough half measures, if you identify as feline then you should be kicked out of school because animals are not allowed to be enrolled in public school.

Lawsuits! Virginia is full of left-wing communist. Insane that the state has become this way.	Be sure to note: I said red areas, not states.

Biggity makes a valid point. A key word in your response is ‚Äúmostly‚Äù.  Another is ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.  Would you have the same feelings if a left-wing mob had piled into the White House busting shit in a ‚Äúmostly‚Äù peaceful manner over their ‚Äúsuspicions‚Äù while Trump was the resident?  That‚Äôs not how it is supposed to work, no matter what your beliefs or values. Order and rule of law are the basis of our democracy and civil society, and without that, it all eventually falls apart.	<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to generalize those that stormed the Capitol to &quot;Trump and his supporters.&quot; Yes, those were Trump supporters, but no, those do not represent the majority of Trump supporters in terms of what most Trump supporters believe. And that should come as no surprise.</p>	<p>It&#39;s strange how you find it necessary to imagine that there are so many angry, frustrated, transphobic people out there who want to destroy the USA and its freedom of speech. I&#37;m not saying that there should be more than 5,000 angry, trans activists out there trying to destroy our country and tearing down statues and statues. But those are reasonable numbers if you&#38;re talking about people who peacefully protest outside the US Capitol. </p>
Got banned for three days for saying ‚ÄúI believe X‚Äù  It is absolutely ridiculous	<p>&quot;Moderator discretion&quot; was the final reason to why I was banned.

Then you were also told that they were less effective against the new variants you and your lot gave a fertile breeding ground to, but you just tune that out.	* Mutations that are more suited are more likely to reproduce and give these new traits to future generations.(fact)	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of new variants, myself.

It‚Äôs difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you‚Äôd look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.	What you are taking about is using abortion as birth control. I am against that part. I can not morally and ethically object to someone getting an abortion because of medical reasons or if it was a rape. There are much better and cheaper ways to prevent pregnancies called birth control and condoms.</p>	<p>Or are you against abortion because it is dangerous?</p>
But it used to be that a family could survive and even thrive on just one income. When both parents work their asses off everyday you're damn right they should be entitled to a decent wage.	>I have a feeling a lot of this has to do with so many families being 2 income households out of necessity.	<p>If the minimum wage was anywhere near $2.25 an hour, then you‚Äôd have a decent income for the rest of your life. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that unreasonable to expect everyone to be able to live on their own.  And the fact that they are living off of this money is a huge part of the problem.</p>
Oh yeah wow you totally got her. Whoopedy do. You idiots hate masks	<p>So what point are you trying to mark? Are you triggered that she‚Äôs using her right to wear a mask?

Conservative "blue dog" Democrats (which I was back in the 90s/early 00s) basically are incompatible with the modern Democratic party because we can't support their current brand of blatant anti-Liberalism.  Liberalism has become a heavily conservative idea in 2022, which only exists in the Republican party (even if they're imperfect in a lot of ways, at least they're not off-the-wall crazy).  That's why so many of us ended up on the right.	<p>The Democrat party has moved so far to the left over the last 30 years I don&#39;t recognize them anymore.</p>	<p>If you support the idea of the Democrats as a party of pure &quot;conservatives, then you‚Äôre a hypocrite. You‚Äôd see the point of the argument if you went against them and thought the party of the free market was just for the rich and powerful and the rich. You would see the same thing with the Republicans, except that they are the backbone of the country and the only party that could stand on such grounds.</p>

Don&#38;t tell me that, though. You&#41;re just listing names of people who were banned from voting. This is not the only problem. You also have to remember that even the elected president couldn&#40;t ban people from voting, so the legislature can make that law easier.</p>

Yeah I think I‚Äôd agree with you, but from the article the data is anonymous and is in a black box type of situation, so you still have control over it (just like you would any other piece of your property, until the police could take it in the course of an investigation, or you handed it over to aid them). So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it‚Äôs not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it‚Äôs built into the car.	<p>I‚Äôve seen a lot of news about places like China setting up surveillance polls and using Face ID tech to identify people and track them. We have traffic cameras everywhere (little things on top of street lights) why would the us government not do this to some degree ?</p>	<p>You can‚Äôt force someone to have a seizure of their property without knowing if they‚Äôre there or not.</p>

No one ever said vaccinated can't spread covid. Just like you can get the flu shot and still pass and carry the flu	Let‚Äôs keep thinking here.  If you get the vaccine you can still get and spread Covid.	Vaccinated: You can‚Äôt get the vaccine and still get covid.
Its called a democratically elected minority government. Albeit a shitty one, but hey, that's where its at right now.

A government who does not represent the people is oppressive and the 2a exists to overthrow an oppressive government.	<p>It‚Äôs called a tyranny, but it‚Äôd be a far cry from what we‚Äôve seen in the past.

I never knew you had to be intelligent to figure out that a dude shouldn't be competing in women's sports.	Dudes with penises competing in top level women‚Äôs sports.<br/>	<p>Just curious your thoughts on the Olympic Committees decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn&#39;t disqualify athletes from competing in female sports. If you attempt to argue with them they'll call you transphobic and attempt to get you fired.</p>
You are effing lying. I've lost more people to vaxxed covid than not. How do you sleep? Funny therapeutics haven't been RUSHED to market.

I know of vaccinated people who still died from covid, and there are plenty of reports of people dying from the side effects of the vaccine itself.</p>	<p>So enough of this BS.

Careful the 2 braincells in your skull almost ran into each other for a moment there.  You clearly don't understand the most basic principles of freedom and rights.  If I trespass in your house I lose a lot of protections, freedoms,, and rights because again, it's your house.  When I send my vaccinated kids to school and another parent sends their unvaccinated covid positive kid to school, they are harming my children.  Why do you think parents should have the right to harm kids?  You're clearly a few seconds away from being pro-abortion at this point.  You're absolutely NOT a conservative.	<p>As for the political side of this, if you&#39;re going to argue that conservatives are working against the rights of businesses then you haven&#39;t been watching the news. Ron DeSantis is pushing laws that don&#39;t allow private companies to require vaccines while getting widespread conservative support. It&#39;s simply not up for debate that conservatives today care more about being outraged at the liberals than actually having principles. This isn&#39;t the same movement my parents were a part of. I don&#39;t even know what you can call a movement that screams about gun rights and then froths at the mouth to support a gun confiscation proponent like Trump.</p>	<p>The second amendment is protecting the rights of the unborn. If you can‚Äôt see that, you‚Äôre in the wrong. The third amendment is the right of the mother, but the mother‚Äôs right to not be harmed by a child. The fourth amendment is a constitutional right, but there are more rights than just the right to live in a carefully curated environment. The second amendment isn‚ÄôÔøΩt the same as the first amendment. If a woman is in a sexual relationship with a partner, you can get pregnant and have sex. This amendment is not the only way to go about

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	<p>My main point was to the dude saying Covid is only the sniffles. My hospital has 550 rooms and the census was 607 the other day and it&#39;s all Covid patients. I dont think the sniffles would cause that. Again, fuck mandates, and fuck government encroachment, but let&#39;s not pretend this thing is totally benign because it isn&#39;t. I hate how no one can have a rational view on this because of how politicized it is. Liberals are taking it to one extreme and conservatives are taking it to the other.</p>	<p>Businesses should be forced to get the vaccine even though it doesn&#39;t prevent you from catching covid. If you get sick and need constant boosters you need to be on the hook for covid.</p>
> I mean every single person I have ever seen in my entire life wave a Confederate flag was a Conservative.  Gee I wonder if that means maybe there IS something to that whole "its a culture thing".  >How do you explain that?  Sorry, thats your argument? You saw a red-voter wave a confederate flag, therefore **PARTY SWITCH CONFIRMED**? lol	<p>The confederate flag isn‚Äôt flown as a signal to the original intent of the flag.  It‚Äôs meaning has changed considerably over time.  Now it‚Äôs just a flag of the south.  Something something southern heritage and defiance.  From the people I‚Äôve asked it has nothing to do with being pro confederacy and everything to do with being pro south.  The southern states of the US are basically their own nation with their own culture.  </p>	<p>There are still more red voters than blue, but they tend to be more conservative than blue. The confederate flag isn&#39;t flown as a signal to the south, it is a signal that the south is not a part of the same as the north.</p>

Industry on that side of the world will continue to point and laugh as America cripples itself to combat a fictive phantom.	<p>If China and India are doing the same, then that‚Äôs an obscene exaggeration on their part.</p>

You don‚Äôt think the right has shifted at all?

Germany is in a state of peace, but the USA still looks like it's fighting a war.	Germany was more developed than America before the war. Has a history of a nation.

Im sure they can't work because of their crippling anxiety, ADHD, autism, Asperger's, or other self diagnosed nonsense that if they could just get to the right sympathizer, I mean doctor, they could get proper treatment for.	By all means, after a certain age you could have them do annual mental and physical exams to ensure they are still able to do the job, but let's not have blanket ageist discrimination against folks who could still be more than capable of doing it just because they're old.	<p>It‚Äôs not helping that they‚Äôre not dealing with the same issues as their parents who have anxiety, depression, anxiety, anxiety.. it‚Äôd help a lot if they could get therapy.</p>
And then punished everyone else that got mad at the interview that nobody asked for... Every single one that said anything positive or negative about the interview got permanently banned in just a few seconds	Anytime any Dumbocrat is spewing any interview...

You mean the guy who devoted an episode to the Gypsy threat might not be trustworthy?!? Whaaaaaaatttt?	<p>He then had an episode about the little girl getting raped by a boy wearing a skirt in Loudon county and the subsequent cover up of the crime. He was suspended that night</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of the show, myself.  But I do find it interesting that the creator of it seemed to be someone who was somewhat sympathetic to the situation, and I think that‚Äôs because of his insistence that the show wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúhating‚Äù people.  Or is it because of the fact that it was based on a false premise?</p>

I have no idea.  It's truly baffling to me that we cater to this stuff while screwing over women and young girls.    Be whatever you want, but the transgender movement has progressed, largely under the radar to this point, as a ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù issue affecting less than one percent of the U.S. population. In fact, the policies demanded by the transgender movement impacts 100 percent of the population, most especially women.	And what‚Äôs up with the condemnation of transgender people ? They r just as likely to be fucked up as a person no transgender.</p>	<p>Or does the transgender movement have a formal name?</p>

And the title is wrong lmao, she was never charged with assaulting police. That‚Äôs my point; it‚Äôs a sensationalist title. She‚Äôs a massive piece of shit who deserves jail time, but she was never charged with assaulting police officers.	<p>If OP really cared about police brutality he&#39;d say it clearly, instead, he has to justify the cop&#39;s actions by saying that the girl &quot;probably deserved it because antifa&quot;. Cops are not judges and should never act as such. Intentionally hurting someone that is not a threat to anyone should be something that we all condemn unanimously.</p>	<p>She is a proven liar and a hypocrite, if she is charged with any crime, she should be prosecuted and sentenced.

Because they learned pathetic whites would cower to those who cried racist even if unsubstantiated. That time is hopefully starting to run out.

Think they call them *Colonizers*.	<p>This is the time when they should stop calling people ""racists"" and start calling them ""racism"" and instead focus on the fact that they aren&#39;t racist.</p>
We all knew booster shots would be required in the future... You're just using common knowledge to justify you're conspiracy theories. Also, fuck Deathsantis.

Ooooohhhh paintballs how terrible lmao.  I also don't remember the government suspending civil liberties and freezing their bank accounts like they're doing to the truckers.  And what were the rioters doing to the cop car before he got scared and hit the gas?  To be clear I don't give a shit about cops, they are just enforcers for capital.  But now that I mentioned capital, let's recall every big corporation jumping on the BLM bandwagon.  Suddenly every corp had BLM messaging on their website.  Kamala Harris started a bail fund for BLM rioters, OK.  Look man, if the federal government, local mayors, and every big corporation supports your "protest," then it's a fake astroturfed protest in service of capital.	<p>Say what you will about BLM, despite protesting for half the year in several cities, weather violent attacks by the cps and counter protester and even rioting a few times themselves, they never tried to violently overthrow the government and never killed a cop with a fire extinguisher.</p>	<p>BLM rioters were violent, loud, and aggressive. It&#39;s all part of the process. If you support the rioters, you support our government. You support the BLM cause, and I support the Constitution. But you also support the idea of the police as a police state, not a state. The idea is that the police should be able to do their jobs and protect our freedoms. The reality is, there are MUCH better ways to do that than by arresting people for not doing their jobs, and by arresting them for their own actions. There needs to be accountability for those that

Not condoning, but I won't be surprised if a justifiably angry family member, who can't get help from the different levels of governments and courts, goes into one of these hospitals and makes their own justice.	Reasonable people care primarily about hospitalizations and deaths. But that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs driving this policy. Authoritarians like cases because it looks scarier and is easy to manipulate.	<p>It‚Äôs so frustrating to see the government and the courts treating these people as ‚Äútraitors‚Äù and then try to exonerate them when they are actually doing their job in the best interest of the country. The government and courts are the backbone in enforcing the law and enforcing the rules they deem fit.</p>

Stop playing the victim card here.	<p>This is one of the reasons the left is so upset about the Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal. It seems that the courts recognize the right to defend yourself when someone threatens you with a deadly weapon and that means cops can defend themselves against attacks with deadly weapons.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of Kyle Rittenhouse, myself.

Whoever Biden picks I can tell you--        They sexually abused me at the age of 15.

> should result in monetary loss and not "retaliatory violence", not all deterrence are necessarily violent.  i is still a kind of violence. when you take someone's money from them without choice there is an implied violence to follow should they not pay. in any case the garnishment isn't intended as a deterrent it is meant to repay those who lost property and family.	<p>If your life was interrupted by government lockdowns, you are owed money. We can argue about whether or not the feds being the ones to pay out is appropriate, but acting as if people who make a bit more money shouldn&#39;t get it is wrong.</p>	<p>You‚Äôre implying that physical violence is the only acceptable consequence of this.   I‚Äôm not suggesting physical violence are the only consequences of this, since physical violence doesn‚Äôt tend to be the opposite of physical violence.</p>

A lot of people had to eat local wildlife to survive the famines caused by Mao's Great Leap Forward, the modernisation of predominantly rural China. Millions starved and cannibalism was rife, so bats, rats etc became staple food items for people. Habits die hard I guess. The problem isn't that we're eating bats, it's that we're eating animals full stop.	<p>Blaming it on some poor Chinese people eating bats is just cover.</p>	<p>It was a long time before wild boar meat became a thing in China. In fact, it was a near-century before that.  Before Mao came out, people were still hunting for prey.  Now it‚Äôs just a matter of time before we get to the point where we can say we‚Äôre no longer hunting for food.  </p>

I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..

Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb üòÅüòÅüòÅ  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am üòà Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.	I bring it up because your standards are complete garbage. Everything the left has accused the right of, the left has actually done. The left has actually embraced.	<p>&quot;It&#39;s been going on since the time of the civil rights movement, but that&#37;s not what&#38;s happening here.</p>
To be fair, If I looked like Carville I would want to hurt other people too.	I mean that is really easy to do and would you would not look like the town idiot.<br/>	<p>I‚Äôm not saying Carville is evil, but I definitely think he‚Äôs more of a menace to society than he is a tool masquerading under guise of respectability.</p>
Yes, I don't like my social media sites clogged up with baseless conspiracy theories.	None of these are conspiracy theories.  You literally listed a shitty made ignorant meme of alleged hoaxes.	<p>It&#39;s all over the place.  People are tired of hearing &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;;</p>
It is going into a few pockets mainly. This is the problem with how our system works. We permit companies to bid on projects and then the government selects a winner and pays them the agreed contract rate. We end up with companies charging millions of dollars to do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work, and then, we run out of money before we can possibly maintain everything properly.	And because a system such as this incentivizes the employees of the target project to request more funds the longer the project goes on, ie: road construction or climate panels or welfare, generally the initial costs estimated are a small fraction of what the entire project ended up costing, whether or not it met its intended goals.	<p>Most of the government money is spent on small government work.  The rest of the money is going to be spent on big tech.  If you&#39;re willing to spend money that is not yours</p>
I'm really glad I'm not the only one who thinks the AOC posts in this sub have been getting a little psycho lately. There's a whole laundry list of things to criticize AOC for, but this? Really? We're now upvoting TMZ-style paparazzi shit?	<p>To be fair, they&#39;re also taking down AOC&#39;s content too.</p>	<p>AOC is a media darling, and I truly hope she gets some media coverage and gets some of her viewers back.</p>
Whatever color, I don't care. He just needs to wear three of them at the same time	<p>Kind of twists things up if he was calling for his drug peddling girlfriend, changing the color some.

That‚Äôs it ladies!  Grow a pair of balls and speak out already!!

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE STRONG AND INDEPENDANT! We only allow those who goose step to our rhythm here.&quot;</p>	<p>This isnt a ‚Äúleftist‚Äù speech. It‚Äôs a direct refutation of the point you‚Äôre trying to make. Youre making up your own facts based on your personal feelings.</p>
You should read the news. The draft of his attempt to subvert democracy by using the National guard to take all the voting machines is now a matter of public record. Not to mention Giuliani overseeing false electors.	<p>This whole notion of other truth out there is yet to be proven in a court of law and with the mad hatter like Giuliani taking away so much oxygen from the conversation with his half baked theories and complete asinine cast of supporting idiots, amplifies the lack of trust.</p>	<p>I think Rudy Giuliani is guilty of some of the worst crimes in American history.  He is directly associated with the ringleader of the insurrection.  If you think the election was rigged, then you are in the right, morally if not legally.  So let&#39;s watch the trial.</p>

I left a few respectful logical arguments on r/blackpeopletwitter and realized the mods were just deleting my posts.. fucking echochambers‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd take all the downvotes in the world if I could make a few people think twice..	<p>Look at reddit.

Don't forget though, they only cheated in states that trump lost. They didn't cheat in states that he won!	There was fraud. There was cheating.

I got the first 2 vaxx and refuse any boosters until they are PROVEN to stop the spread. As of now there is 0 science that it stops or even slows the spread. I'll be fine with a 99.999% survival rate for people of my age with no dire health issues.  They can fire me at this point idgaf	<p>I also wonder if/when they&#39;ll start saying you&#39;re not considered vaxxed until you&#39;ve had booster shot (in the USA). They&#39;re already doing that in some countries like Israel - if you haven&#39;t gotten vaxxed in the past 6 months, you&#39;re considered &quot;unvaccinated.&quot;</p>	<p>I‚Äôm 100% in favor of getting the vaccine now and spreading the virus, but I need to get the boosters if it‚Äôs going to be worth it. At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated. This is not a huge risk, but it could potentially be avoided if we could get the vaccine.</p>
So on average do you think supporters of slavery or Confederate sympathizers are Republicans or Democrats.	<p>Republicans not only would not support him today, much of the party actively argues proudly about the Confederacy, that slavery should not be a stain on American history. Displaying with pride a flag of the only effort to secede while declaring how patriotic they are (?).</p>	<p>Democrats don&#39;t support slavery, they support civil rights, but they don't support the idea of the state as a nation. The South is not a nation of law, they are a state of division. The only thing the South can do is try to make it into a state that can &quot;defend&quot;;the state&quOT; peacefully and peacefully, and then try to destroy it as an economic tool that will only benefit the south. This is not what slavery was about, it was about
COVID seems to be the responsible party here.	<p>They are responsible for covid ravaging the world and all we hear from the left is crap like your post.</p>	<p>Covid is the primary threat to public health.

Are we talking about actual quality of life or just organs working?	<p>I don‚Äôt know what reality y‚Äôall are living in but from my perspective it looks like nothing but suffering.

And then...tried to crawl through a broken window to continue pushing deeper into the capital despite police officers specifically telling her she can't go in there?	Can you link to that? Because the initial reports suggested that a cop ""came out from behind a door"", shot her, and retreated.	<p>Then she tried to storm the capitol building, telling everyone to go inside, and there was no way out but to try to storm it. It was a self-defense operation and the police responded with a massive response from the mayor and the mayor.</p>
Kentaji brown Jackson least divisive candidate that will also be acceptable to the progressives. And will probably pass she did receive republican votes for confirmation under Obama.	<p>They only needed her to win the election, because of her color and gender, but now they are positively <strong>saddled</strong> with her and her total incompetence and fundamental inability to speak or function like a normal human.</p>	<p>I think she would be a very well-liked and respected person by the left, but she‚Äôs a proven liar and a hypocrite by many standards. She‚Äôd be a disaster in many ways, but I think her record as a republican wouldn‚Äôt be as good as what the current president is doing.</p>
No, liberals won't agree to that.  They are cow-towing to China and they are in support of socialism.	Liberals seem to be in bed with Russia &amp; China as well !</p>	<p>They don‚Äôt agree with China‚Äôs socialist policies. They want to destroy the country. And they‚Äôre not the only ones that want to do that. China is the next best thing. They‚Äôve been doing that for a long time now.</p>
I think the most irritating thing about it how often people insist that i‚Äôm irritated about it.	<p>The only things that bother me are their constant use of it in an attempt to silence anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with them and that it&#39;s their main tactic to stay in power - they use it  to keep the anger &amp; hate in this country stirring. They need it to keep people divided, so they&#39;re easier to manipulate. It&#39;s the same w/the other labels they like to use.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not complaining about it, I just find it annoying.  It‚Äôs the way people react to it.</p>

I don‚Äôt listen to Biden he‚Äôs not a scientist he misspoke like a dumb old guy he is. The actual people In charge of the vaccine never said that it was always promoted as a way to stop hostpializatioje and deaths which it has done. Why do y‚Äôall act like it doesn‚Äôt help stop death? Isn‚Äôt death like a big thing or no? The focus is now not on dying but if you get it at all?

Can I ask you a couple questions about this?  1) What is the sentence you‚Äôd see for this person who was denied entry to the US and has been held now for 20+ years?  If you wouldn‚Äôt mind just answering this and maybe we could start a dialogue.	<p>A kid that was raised here for most of his life shouldn&#39;t get kicked back to his country of birth decades later. They should be expedited to permanent resident.</p>	<p>But, the fact that they refused to release him after he was denied entry, is a huge part of the problem. I‚Äôm not a fan of those who refuse to release their children.  I don‚Äôt want them held accountable for their actions.  This is not a case for political expediency.</p>

Expect act 77 was passed by general assembly and signed into law and not by executive fiat as you say. And it expanded and protected voting rights, not narrowed them like a poll tax would. Doesn‚Äôt the ideal democratic republic have every single eligible cast a vote. By your own argument every elected official in the Jim Crow south was elected fraudulently given that those election laws were later deemed unconstitutional.   And all this is ignoring the fact that this ruling will likely be overturned in time and the law probably will stand.	<p><em>That litigation seeks to have Act 77, the bill that created mail-in voting in Pennsylvania, declared unconstitutional under the state constitution, which according to plaintiffs, requires changes to voting to be an amendment to the state‚Äôs constitution.</em></p>	<p>The voter ID thing became a big meme because Republicans claimed that it was unconstitutional. But it wasnt the case. It was the fact that the bill was specifically targeted at black people trying to make their lives easier for minority voters. The bill specifically targeted black people, specifically those who were attempting to make up fraudulent ballots. That&#39;s not what the voter rolls were used for. The voter rolls became a meme because people made up stories about how they voted illegally. </p>
Why do you think Covid has been so much worse in America compared to other wealthy developed nations? We are approaching a million deaths when no Western European countries are even close to that.	<p>When you look at when the deaths came, in the beginning of the pandemic, when Sweden was open while us neighbors closed up, it is clear why you guys did so awful compared to the rest of us. Shit Covid policy.    </p>	<p>I think the death rate for COVID is similar to what we are seeing in the US. We are talking over 5 million deaths per year compared to the national rate.</p>
I was going to write a thorough response including sources and graphs, but realized it wouldn't explain anything to a 5 year old.

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>Now let me address you second argument. Yes, doctors and nurses have been tackling covid-19 for over a year now with a vaccine and have gotten by. They didn‚Äôt have a choice. Whether for better or worse, they were forced to treat patients  infected with a deadly virus, risking bringing it home with them or spreading it to others in public (becuase PPE‚Äôs are not 100% perfect). Now that they have the option to take the vaccine, they have the opportunity to continue delivering patient care in a manner that is SAFER for themselves, their family, other non-covid-19 patients they also see in the hospital. Not taking the vaccine presents an inherent risk to spreading the virus to other people that might not be able to get fully vaccinated or cannot reap the benefits of the vaccine (immunocompromised, cofactors with lung health, age). So with doctors and nurses who are refusing to get the vaccine, not only are they refuting the very science they spent years studying, but they are now also putting others at risk. That is a direct conflict with their responsibilities as health care providers. If you can avoid putting other people at risk but you choose not to for personal reasons, goodbye. Go find another hospital to work at.</p>	<p>The fact that they are using the vaccine to mask their own symptoms is a major part of the problem. It&#39;s not a surprise to me that the military is using it to mask its own symptoms. It has become routine for them to mask symptoms and mask their symptoms as if they are not actually infected. This is completely unacceptable.</p>

What a hero he should continue not breathing.	<p>I don&#39;t think for one minute he planned to kill anyone.  He was attacked and defended himself in fear for his life.

So you think Republicans 50 years ago would agree more with Democrats or Republicans now?	By that thinking, people would be holding out Democrats and Republicans as two different races versus political entities that espouse different views and values.	<p>Democrats have been much more successful at coalescing around one guy and one guy only and that guy is the guy who did it all.

Proof of deep state systemic corruption	<p>This is definitely getting more into the realm of opinion than classical definitions of corruption, but I think that it you&#39;re still in office you shouldn&#39;t operate under the impression that people care so much about your life, story, or ideas that they&#39;d want to read them en masse. Additionally, if you&#39;re still in office you are serving the people, they aren&#39;t serving you.

When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn‚Äôt the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don‚Äôt believe in god as you have stated as it‚Äôs just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a ‚Äúleftist stooge‚Äù either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	<p>Not sure how the left who preaches bodily autonomy is so on board with vaccine mandates when even their own supporters seem to be more and more against the idea.</p>	<p>It&#39;s that I believe that vaccines reduce the spread of COVID, which is why I believe in the idea of the government being the final arbiter of morality. If you get the vaccine you are in the right, morally if not legally. You don&#37;t have to take it unless you are on the side of freedom of movement. You can also take it off if you want to, but that doesn&#38;t make you a bad person or a terrible person. This is not a religion. It is a fact.</p>
That seems like a stretch for Trump since he has less than half the vocabulary of a toddler.	Maybe if you have the reading comprehension of a toddler, lmao.	<p>The phrase is used to describe a toddler.</p>
A beat down, THEN a firing.  Yell at my kid like that? Ass whoopin incoming	***Puts gun down, backs away***	<p>Aiming a gun at your kid and telling them to sit down will work because if you did it would only result in you getting shot. </p>
She will be working quality control at the Nike plant.	<p>Nike is garbage. Its a shame. For a the Roman God of speed to have her name tarnished in such a way</p>	<p>Nah, she‚Äôs just starting out at the top of her game. I‚Äôm not sure what the hell is going on with her, but I‚Äùm pretty sure she‚Äùs just going to sit there waiting for the next opportunity to make her mark.</p>
She should be defenestrated.	<p>But hey, if it‚Äôs politically convenient let‚Äôs use her and pretend she‚Äôs making sense and twist how she‚Äôs being called out or laughed at, right?</p>	<p>She should be defenified.</p>
Do you voice the same concern when someone on the right is *blatantly* and *shamelessly* hypocritical?  Like, oh I don't know, Trump's whining about nepotism wheil he employs his daughter and son in law in the highest level advisory positions?  How bout McConnells brazan hypocrisy, re: SCOTUS hearings?	<p>This sort of hypocrisy has always been the case, but they couched it in more spinnable terms in decades past.  They have are out in the open now with no shame or self awareness to speak of.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of Mitch McConnell, myself.  Or more to the point I find him insignificant and couldn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about him.  But the fact that he has so little of a say in the matter is on him.</p>
Because if there is a safe and effective treatment, like monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy is no longer an ‚Äúemergency use‚Äù.  And last time I check, gene therapy by Pfizer got an emergency use approval only.	Gene therapy is designed to cause (usually) permanent cellular changes. What did you mean to say if you didn't mean to imply it causes cellular changes?	<p>Now Pfizer has switched to mrna therapy, which is a new class of therapeutics that has no long term safety studies who knows what the hell is going on. If you need constant boosters it doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs working very well.</p>
I'll take an easy dub, him swing	<p>But you could shit-poorly dub a string of unrelated gobbledygook soundbites. And people would go &quot;Wow, Joe seems more coherent than usual today!

http://factmyth.com/factoids/democrats-and-republicans-switched-platforms/  Truth is it was always conservatives, it didn't matter the party.	<p>the point is, the parties <em>did</em> shift- it‚Äôs just historically true- and that using the party affiliation of the 1800s to vilify Democrats is disingenuous. it‚Äôs literally history. the parties shifted.</p>	https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-factcheck-finds-democrats-and-republicans-switched-platforms
Maybe it's the swastika flags that keep showing up at right wing rallies causing this bamboozlement	<p>Whats up with all the nazi comments? That‚Äôs not some kind of lighthearted joke. It is the US were people with swastika flags are roaming the streets without a care in the world, not Germany.</p>	<p>Maybe it&#39;s the swastika flag. Maybe it is the Trump supporters waving it in the face of protestors. Maybe they are the ones holding the sign.</p>
Bhai bhai bhai bhai bhai	- Morgan Freeman</p>	<p>Bhai bhai bao!</p>
Like Mike Gonzales has any idea of the paradigm of the average street level Joe.	Joe chose to skip around the subject during his campaign, and despite being asked *many* times, managed to do so quite effectively. The man's not normally very bright these days, but he has his moments.	<p>Also, if you‚Äôre a street Joe, you might as well start with the ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù and move up the socioeconomic ladder. The ‚Äúclass‚Äù is not the only thing that‚Äôs going to change.</p>
Don‚Äôt forget about making excuses for the 13% of the US population who are also responsible for over 40% of all violent crime in America. The usual suspects who shall not be named because ‚ÄúRaaaAAaaYyyyCccIiiiIisssMmm‚Äù.   Oh, but God forbid you say the n-word!	And then...eliminate?...them prior to said crime?	<p>That&#39;s why I say this, because it&#37;s the main reason why violent crime is exploding in the US. The reason why it is so high is because there are so many violent crimes per year in the u.s., and yet there are only so many of them that are actually committed by people who have committed the heinous crimes.</p>
> Even though it‚Äôs obvious when you look at both sides only one of them have hundreds of Confederate flags and it isn‚Äôt Democrats.  It‚Äôs baffling to see many people here calling you a liar about that	<p>No really though, who can be surprised that the Democrats are liars and full of hypocrisy.</p>	<p>Dems don&#39;t care about the Confederate flag. They&#38;re not interested in the symbolism of it. They want it to be political rather than historical. It&#37;s not a coincidence that most of the southern states that have Confederate flags are states that voted for session in the last few years. The only thing they want is for it to fall down and be replaced with something else. The South turned from Democrat to Republican in the 90s, and the Republicans lost the next election. </p>
No one cares? A mob of people broke into the capitol building, vandalized it, and harassed and assaulted the police defending it. That‚Äôs a big deal regardless of what political party you align with.	<p>It was a shame that the capitol riot happened. But, its more due to poor preparation by law enforcement to protect Congress.</p>	<p>It was an absolutely horrible, terrible, and inexcusable event. I am sure there are many, many more that could have been prevented, but this is the reality that is being presented to us.</p>
Fair enough! You‚Äôre right, they did take credit for it. I would point out that they released oil from national reserves, which would have the affect of driving prices down, so that might actually be warranted.	They raised not only gas taxes but, Registration fees to pay for &quot;the roads.&quot;</p>	<p>It&#39;s that they took no responsibility for it.  They took the blame for it.</p>
Yes. I'm not promoting violence, but if attacked, I do reserve the right to defend myself.	SELF DEFENSE includes the right to defend ourselves,	<p>You‚Äôre not defending yourself by defending yourself, are you?</p>
I won't argue that there's not some bias. But MGT *is* far-right and is/(was?) a conspiracy theorist in that she publicly expressed support for multiple conspiracy theories...	So all of this is just confirmation bias for them.	<p>If you think MGT is the only person pushing this agenda, then you are a lunatic. You are not the only one. I do not think she is the one pushing the agenda, but she is a proven liar and a hypocrite. </p>
2 different situations buddy and fuck Ted Cruz.	<p>And in this case, Cruz flys to Cancun when Texans need his immediate help. This guy clearly doesn‚Äôt give two shits about anyone but himself. </p>	<p>I&#39;m begging you to stop supporting Ted Cruz and instead focus on the fact that he is a proven liar and a hypocrite.</p>
Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat. But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	<p>No, the Democratic Party was not the only change. Almost everything changed.</p>	<p>But do you think that was the fallout from the civil rights movement?  It was a continuation of the same old narrative, but in a more orderly fashion.  People went back to the days when segregation was a big issue.  In fact, it was the opposite of what the original narrative was.  From the get-go, things were looking up.  When the civil war broke out, people went to the streets and said they wouldn&#39;t vote for a Democrat.  Then, in the 1960s, the party went to civil rights.  Now it&#37;s
zzz...Just dipping Down to MAGA Speak..you know, Uneducated Trash	<p>That&#39;s just how things go down in MAGA country</p>	<p>You know what I mean when I say ‚Äúblack trash‚Äù?</p>
Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they‚Äôre good at what they do? That is literally socialism. If you don‚Äôt like social media, just don‚Äôt use it. The free market will correct itself as long as people stop enabling it. It‚Äôs your fault as a consumer, not the company‚Äôs fault.   If you got this far, I hope you can see how ridiculous some of the takes on this sub are. As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	<p>Remember when social media was like the wild west, where you could say anything, then democrats in congress threatened the shit out of them and they started censoring everyone, circa 2016?  They are effectively now an arm of the state and should be regulated as such.  They should be trust busted and broken up as a cabal of ~4 collaborating monopolies looking to limit &quot;free speech&quot; under the constitution in favor of one party that has threatened their business.  It&#39;s akin to price fixing, but with graver results for our democracy.</p>	<p>The Free Market is a system that works only for the best interests of the individual.  It doesn&#39;t work for everyone, it only works for the elite.</p>
Unfortunately that doesn't go for children huh??? Bulletproof plate for in your kids backpack for just 420,69$	May be easier to segregate kids this way over papers/phones.  Like those hospital bracelets but ones that can only be taken off by government. What could possibly be next?  These kids are being trained to be compliant.  Prove me wrong.</p>	<p>But the idea of a bulletproof bag for kids is so appealing that it&#39;s not worth it.</p>

Dude‚Äôs a floppy cock wrapped in unnecessarily expensive suits. Only time I‚Äôve ever believed someone should identify as a gender fluid unicorn and not a man.

Posted to r/conservative; supporters of literal insurrectionists on Jan 6, 2021. But yes, the Democrats are the fascist fucks.	<p>Nah, they&#39;ve been calling Republicans &quot;fascist&quot; for decades now.</p>	<p>Democrats are the real fucks</p>
Or you can grab the water behind the line. Or bring one. So AGAIN, you're making piss poor fucking excuses	>arresting someone for handing out food or drink	<p>You can‚Äôt bring a bag of water to the line. You can bring a knife, but you cannot bring it to the front.</p>

Well the father had a hand in creating that life, therefore he is responsible in some form.  Insurance and fatherhood aren't exactly comparable subjects. For you questions  I'd say at minimum he's responsible for half of the medical expenses during pregnancy.  Child support immediately, backdated so long as the ,other informed him in a reasonable time frame, which varies depending on the situation   Same as they are now.	Not paying child support puts you in contempt of court. There are many, many men in prison for this.	<p>If you don‚Äôt think the mother is the primary source of child support, then you‚Äôre a hypocrite. She‚Äôs the sole source of the child support.  And if you support her, then why not support the child?  Or do you think the child should be the sole beneficiary?</p>
The context that's missing is that this is in in response to red states putting restrictions on voting requirements, removing the option for mail in ballots, drop boxes, etc. There is an active push from GOP leaders to restrict the voting methods that brought in most dem votes during the last election.	<p>11) Allowing people to vote absentee by mail like Trump does. ‚ÄúSEC. 307. PROMOTING ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE BY MAIL. There isn&#39;t anything about a ban on ballot protection measures in the bill.</p>	<p>It&#39;s a clear difference between the Dem and Republican agendas that is going to hamper the functioning of the republicans. The democrat party wants to make it easier for republicans to get IDs and mail in ballots. The democrats want to make sure republicans are not too scared of fraud. I don&#37;t want to wait until the election to see if the democrats actually want to get in and get in. If you want to see the actual results, check our voter registration history here.</p>

Your really not doing Republicans any favor by associating Sherman with them. What's next, John Brown?	<p>The democrats can pass this on their own without Mitch doing anything.  Don&#39;t give them time to water it down and start harassing the rino&#39;s.  You know some Romney, Murkowski, Collins type will cave given time.</p>	<p>Also, if you&#39;re not a Democrat, then you are doing yourself a disservice by associating yourself with trump. You are not a good person, you are a dishonest prick and I hope you starve when you starve.</p>
You're right on the money, I barely see any full body shots of the guy and we all know exactly why the media is avoiding that!	>Calling media that attacks him fake	<p>If you look at the video of the shooting you can see that there was no one shot. People were standing around talking about it, it was all over the place. You can see the media covering it all over.</p>
Hopefully. We do have evil people trying to show 1st graders how to masterbate and showing 6th graders porn as part of the curriculum.	<p>You&#39;ll notice their focus on material intended for children, which seems to have especially ramped up over these last few years. Mr Potato Head and Dr Seuss are only the latest examples of a longstanding trend. This is all very much by design, and plays right into their agenda to lower the voting age. I may despise the people behind all of this, and they are most certainly &quot;evil&quot; in any sense of the word that you choose to adhere to, but they are definitely not stupid either, and should never be underestimated.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs a continuation of the same old old old beliefs that taught 1st grade kids how to use penises and how to masturbate. It‚Äôd be the same thing with a 7th grade class.</p>

Study shows conservatives are less likely to be successful, less likely to be super smart, and more likely to be super meanies to people.    "Study shows people who support Trump have low IQ's."

The Conservatives in Oklahoma most definitely disagreed. They didn't even let it get out of committee for a floor vote.	<p>The conservatives didn&#39;t add seats to the court.

Y‚Äôall should really stop suppressing your humanity, it feels so good to ignore gender and sexuality and just you know live	And what‚Äôs up with the condemnation of transgender people ? They r just as likely to be fucked up as a person no transgender.</p>	<p>It&#39;s okay to be transphobic and attempt to push your boundaries, but it&#37;s ok to also be anti-gay and anti-gender. It&#38;s not okay to pretend that everyone&#42;s biological gender is somehow biological. If you attempt to argue with me you get results that don&##39
Their (the pro-choice) consistency is not the concern here. Conservatives should have higher moral standards and should be able to stand principled and logical grounds.	<p>Consistency. That‚Äôs all conservatives are asking for. Sounds fair to me.</p>	<p>Conservative beliefs, on the other hand, are deeply troubling. They are not the only ones who are pro-choice. Being against abortion is their problem.</p>
He literally funded covid research in Wuhan China.	<p>He praised Xi for the handling of the virus, okay? This was in the beginning of the pandemic when not much information had been known. He also strengthened foreign relations with China which as you know is important. However as more information released he‚Äôs also condemned China for the fact that it even came out to begin with. This doesn‚Äôt make him a moron. </p>	<p>He literally funded covid research.</p>
I just heard about him the other day. Other YouTubers were going after him for getting triggered after one of his fans brought up an old article he had written on the virtues of being a chick and setting his girlfriend up with other men for him to watch. Now we know why.	<p>They take it upon themselves to do these publicity stunts and he thought he could pull one off himself... problem is he is a cokehead and those stimulants cause people to not think straight so he did it at the wrong place. Had he picked the right setting we all would <em>have no choice</em> but to be believing his horseshit story and all his activist pals would be like ‚Äúgood job Jussie you really managed to pull this one off‚Äù and he would get respect+ and rank up in their activist mafia.</p>	<p>I loved his show, I loved his take on the subject. He was hilarious and always has been. I loved him to pieces.</p>

Just admit you hate children and want them to suffer.  That's your stance.  You are not pro-life and the thought of sick kids gives you joy.  Worst. Conservative.  Ever.	With abortions, people who should not be parents such as women who‚Äôs baby father walked out, are poor, or don‚Äôt have the proper support systems are advocating for abortions but the conservatives are blocking that. If people had access to abortions then maybe these kids won‚Äôt have to be born into societies where becoming a menace is their only option.	<p>If you think abortion is murder then you are not pro-life. You are a hypocrite. Youre not a Christian. You support life, but that doesn&#39;t mean you are anti-abortion. You know that.</p>
Yeah no. My kids would not even reveal that info. They know the golden rule. Snitches get stitches.	<p>My suspicion is that digging harder would reveal that they have infiltrated groups involved and the snitches were very involved.</p>	<p>No. I&#39;m not going to lie. I don&#37;t want to be the victim of this.  But if you are going to expose yourself to this kind of abuse, you need to be a good person and stop pretending like this is some kind of magical savior.  </p>
That‚Äôs a bold claim about his motives, any evidence to back it up? Until you can prove it, I am going to assume the Nazi sympathizers are with the trucks since we actually have evidence for that.	<p>Perhaps the blaming of the reichstag fire on communists is not enough, the arrests of thousands of members of the KPD, the open street fights between brown shirts and communist paramilitaries, or the fact that banning trade unions was one of the very first things Hitler did, are not enough evidence.</p>	<p>There&#39;s no evidence of any actual violence. The truck was abandoned and never used again. The vehicle was abandoned.</p>

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	<p>The civil war was not about states rights. It was about the abolition of slavery. The south didn&#39;t want to fight a war, it wanted to hunt prey that won&#37;t fight back.</p>
All that said; I would totally nail AOC.	Compare those to AOC!	<p>AOC is a nasty, conniving power hungry bitch, someone who loves her husband wouldn&#39;t do that to him.</p>
‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt bad for me, it can‚Äôt be bad for anybody‚Äù	you know, this stuff isnt SUCH a bad idea after all""	<p>If it wasn‚Äôt bad for you, it‚Äôs not bad for anybody.</p>
Now we're up to 80,000. You Trumpists are so good at making up numbers. Bad at governing though.	<p>500k Americans are dead. That number would be even higher if your strategy was followed.</p>	<p>The number is still a projection of how many people will actually die in the first year of their presidency. That&#39;s a projection based on the number of deaths per year.</p>
Pst: Trump is vaxxed AND boosted too.	<p>When the media jumps through record-breaking numbers of mental hoops to persuade the public &quot;Get vaxxed, think later&quot;, it&#39;s probably a sign you should trust your God-given instincts.</p>	<p>Trump is vaxxed.</p>
Quick someone post this on r/coronavirus. I need to see the meltdown.	https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html	<p>Covid is a virus.</p>
That‚Äôs the only way. No one is saying don‚Äôt compete. If you want to compete, develop a category to compete in. Not force others to allow you into their category.	<p>Far too many people for this to matter. Also, once you leave college, you&#39;ll likely see less than 10 of those people ever again. I wouldn&#39;t worry about this. Look for people who are accepting of your views and not competitive, you&#39;ll be fine</p>	<p>Why does anyone care what anyone does, long as they are not hurting anyone else? If they want to compete in another sport, they need to be more inclusive and promote diversity. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit bullcrap.</p>
Yup, now I need a reddit mod to come and console me and ban you and keep your dangerous misinformation away from my fragile brains.	<p>YOU spread medical misinformation. Perhaps it should be okay to ban you. (It shouldn‚Äôt be because I believe in people being able to freely speak their minds - I‚Äôm not a fascist fuck like some folks on this website).</p>	<p>I&#39;m surprised I haven&#37;t been banned yet since this sub always bans people lmao</p>
The Civil war was started by angry democrats who were scared of a Republican President-Elect. The civil war was won by a republican president. The only president of the confederacy was a Democrat. How the **fuck** can you be this negligent	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	<p>The civil war was about states rights. The only reason it lasted was because there were so many southern states that voted for session. The south turned from Democrat to Republican in the 90s. </p>
Great.  Lots of Dems didn‚Äôt think Trump won legitimately.  I guess this is the new game- be a sore loser every election!	But, on a purely factual basis the Dems did sprout it was rigged for trump in 2016, but the moment trump did in 2020 he's been cut lose. Or, in 2016 when you had Dems crying for riots on the street, or whatever the Russian enquiry was.	<p>Dems are so out of touch they have no idea what‚Äôs about to happen.</p>
Sent a DM.	<p>Also, I have sent you a &quot;chat&quot; dm thingy. If you want to talk there, it might make more sense to do that since it&#39;s starting to seem like we sound like broken records to one another lol.</p>	<p>I&#39;ll send a DM.</p>
People against abortions change their tune almost instantly when they themselves need one. Or they just live in denial throughout and after the process	Lets be real, the majority of people are getting abortions out of necessity either because of timing, a lack of ability to provide decent care, or rape.	<p>There are plenty of reasons to oppose abortions, but the vast majority of them are simply because there are no obvious reasons to do so. The vast majority are either because there is no legitimate reason to oppose it, or it is simply because it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
It‚Äôs time to BURN THIS MOTHER FUCKER DOWN!	Is this supposed to be a burn?	<p>It‚Äôs time to shut down the fucking country!</p>

You seem like you would fit well in my new sub r/ComplexPeople. I hope plugging subreddits are allowed in this sub‚Ä¶   Anyway, I noticed that you may be conservative leaning since you lurk on this sub, yet aren‚Äôt afraid to question the legitimacy of particular things. Not everyone has to agree with everything a political affiliation just says, and it is very important for us to freely state opinions or ask questions regarding particular worldly topics.  r/ComplexPeople promotes the idea that people are complex and are able to share viewpoints from multiple political parties. It promotes free thought and respectful debate or discussion between those who may agree with you and those who do not. Being condescending is not allowed, and members must conduct themselves professionally. The sub is aimed to help rational minded people effectively learn of each others viewpoints and live harmoniously regardless if viewpoints are opposed. If you‚Äôre interested in these sentiments, I would love for you to join to help make Reddit and this world a better place!  PS: I apologize for the shameless copy and pasting. I just really do think this new sub can be beneficial for the reddit community.	<p>I have really not been impressed by the divisive and derisive language toward non-liberal views on a vast majority of subreddits and websites. There&#39;s a huge lack of informed discourse on topics, and a lot of emotional bullying.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a fan of politics, myself.  Or more to the point I find it hard to come to terms with.  I find that it is more of a reactive reactive approach to the issues than a proactive approach to tackling them.</p>
wasn't right leaning but this site got bought out by DNC and foreign interests a few years back. tons of bot accounts now, main  subs are run by leftist looks like 'N8thegr8' or whatever who mods 300+ subreddits.	<p>A lot of leftists, especially younger ones, are out of work, live in parents basement, neckbeards who were kicked out of their chess clubs for being too nerdy. In short: they‚Äôre losers. Reddit, BLM, Antifa, all that stuff, is basically the eVersion of a Hot Topic. It gives these chumps a place / thing to ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to. They‚Äôve literally got nothing else to do, and who isn‚Äôt a brilliant philosopher who ‚Äúmatters‚Äù when you can be anything you want online?</p>	<p>The rest of this sub is just left leaning shit</p>
I just got logic and reasoned üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠	Common sense and logic is all you ever needed to succeed in this world. Experts can go suck it.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a rational person, myself. I‚Äôve been proven to be a fool by my own logic. I just don‚Äôt understand it. </p>
I like how this implies that Reagan laid the foundation to destroy the nation	<p>So Ronald Reagan walks into a bullet..</p>	<p>Also Ronald Reagan is the founder of the republic.</p>
Doesn't matter because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the far left. Therefore, it espouses far left policies. That's why I expect a Republican landslide this November. I'm actually an Independent, but the Democrats have swung so far to the left that I can longer support any of them.	<p>America&#39;s Overton Window has shifted left, so now old fashioned Clinton Democrats are the new &quot;moderates,&quot; and anyone to the right of them, even regular or right-leaning moderates, are considered firmly on the right.</p>	<p>The problem with the left is that they are too radical and too reactive to the right. They are too much of a threat to the American freedom we hold so dear.</p>
They don‚Äôt wanna see a successful rich black man	Sense a choice to remain poor, nearly everyone in he US has the ability to go earn an income for themselves . It may not be easy but complaining about your lot in life doesn‚Äôt get you anywhere, we are all responsible for our own success and happiness ... there is no systemic racism keeping black or minority people down, it‚Äôs only that belief that limits them. We have plenty of rich and successful black people ... including a president!</p>	<p>Well, any black man.  </p>
You consider Breyer a leftist?  Lol	<p>Edit: Guys I meant Leftists are the real snowflakes and call Conservatives that term to project their insecurities.</p>	<p>Also, you know what you‚Äôre getting into when you come here. I‚Äôm not a liberal, myself. I support free speech, but I think that‚Äôs a pretty narrow definition of ‚Äúconservative‚Äù in my opinion.</p>
Back before  January 2017 where Islamic terrorists were still a thing, EVERY single post about terror attacks was nothing but [removed] and then the post locked.	constant surveillance on the activities of the numerous Islamist terror<br/>	<p>I posted a video of a woman being killed by a white supremacist motorist.  It was a direct refutation of the original claim.  There was no evidence of any actual violence.  People were just shocked when she said it.</p>
huh TIL the first amendment protects you from your boss disagreeing with how you do your job.   But based on looking at your post history for 5 seconds you prefer your rights being trampled on by the government so your prob happy this guy got fired too right? Government is always correct no?	<p>Then the state comes in and tells me I&#39;m not allowed to do this. Who is really the tyrant here? It&#39;s like the state saying &quot;sorry man, people will punch your employees every now and then and we are explicitly going to make it so there&#39;s nothing legal you can do about it.&quot;</p>	<p>By the way, I‚Äôm not a government employee, so I guess that‚Äôs why I find it necessary to defend the constitution as it stands. I just don‚Äôt see much of a difference between employee rights and employee rights here.  I think most people do, but I find the 2nd amendment important.  And you‚Äôre correct.  </p>
Cool, then they could steal food from themselves as well!	<p>I mean, there was never any other end to this.. They will eat themselves.</p>	<p>If they stole food from people in need, then maybe they could also steal from people on their side.</p>

Bad shit happened that day. People broke the law. People died. And it was a tremendous failure of government and law enforcement.   Those who wanted to investigate Benghazi should want to investigate 1/6.   It was also an historic day in the Capitol - and the country‚Äôs - history.	<li>Obama on why Benghazi was as bad as it was, probably.</li>	<p>The Capitol riot was planned all over. People were killed, looted, and otherwise ignored. There was no evidence of any wrongdoing on that day.</p>
I‚Äôm ready to see the fucktard get a slap on the wrist and be released.	<p>This is a slap on the wrist.</p>	<p>Get the fuck out of here with that shit.</p>
And who were the doctor be to give this test. Tell me the CIA won‚Äôt have his relatives in a room somewhere threatening to kill them. Who has the power to deem him unfit without consequences is what I want to know.	The CIA warned of this outcome	<p>The fact that he was told to take the test is completely irrelevant to the discussion. He was told the test was performed by a doctor. </p>
All those damn liberals and their *checks notes* confederate flags?	<p>Think what you will about the Confederate flag, but there was no connection to it and the actions of an evil murderer.  It was just bullshit symbolism to sooth liberal emotions.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a fan of confederate flags, myself.  But the symbolism is there.  </p>
> Yea it will because people won‚Äôt get vaccinated.  "Vaccinated" are catching it and spreading it just as much as the un-vaccinated.   #THE SHOTS DON'T WORK  Look at the UK.  Look at Israel.  Look at Italy.  They've stopped drinking the kool-aid, and so should you.	A majority of people are now vaccinated and it doesn't stop you from being infected but rather prevents your death	<p>It will because they have so little vaccine coverage.</p>
i'll never take one they dont work xD	<p>Doesn‚Äôt say they don‚Äôt work.</p>	<p>They never take one. They never take them.</p>
I dont even know who that is. I'm assuming he's some racist guy who voted for a Democrat at some point?	<p>You mean the guy who actively advocated for wealth redistribution, and believed that giving minorities nominal legal equality was not enough to fix racism?</p>	<p>Who is this racist?</p>
It‚Äôs beyond sad when you are a male athlete and all you can beat is females in a *female* sporting event. Not something I would want to brag about winning.   He did make history though, as the only man to ever win an all female sporting event. ü§£	Dudes with penises competing in top level women‚Äôs sports.<br/>	<p>In the end, I think anyone who competes in female sports will be able to claim that they are the same as men who use Anti-Androgens or who call themselves women will be denied that title.</p>
You're wasting your time. I literally do not care about anything you just said. He is and has been bucking the insane liberal agenda from day one of the biden administration.	<p>This shows everything anyone ever needs to know about Biden and his joke of an &quot;administration.&quot;   Not interested in solutions.  Not interested in thinking about what works and what doesn&#39;t.  Just interested in pushing the far left wing radical agenda...and how we look.  </p>	<p>I don&#39;t care that he is a neocon, I care more about his policy positions than his ideology.</p>
Why do actual politics when you can just rile people up about nonsense culture war shit that doesn't matter?	<p>That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt actually have an argument. It‚Äôs just tribalist nonsense that isn‚Äôt even true, so when you show them it‚Äôs not true, they resort to playing semantic games. Most people who haven‚Äôt already woken up to the bullshit are people who hold these tribal beliefs so close to their identity, that they can no longer admit they‚Äôre wrong. Their politics is such a massive part of their identity, that they take it as a personal attack when you disagree with them.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs so easy to pretend that politics are all that to ponder over and ponder over over. You‚Äôre just practicing your craft as you go along. You just have to remember that we all just went through the shit of the Civil War, and then come back with the results.</p>
Thats the problem! "UNION".  All UNiONs are bought out/partnered with the left.	<p>I like how the one union that sometimes disagrees with the left is the only &quot;bad&quot; union.</p>	<p>The United States of America is not a one party state. It is a sovereign nation. And that&#39;s a fact.</p>
I‚Äôve always said.  You don‚Äôt need to fly a plane into a building anymore.  If I was a terrorist and I stress this is hypothetical I‚Äôm not encouraging it, but I would start a couple wildfires. If your even remotely smart by the time they start investigating you could be a couple states away and a couple wildfires later.  The amount of destruction and money they cost to fight would have just as much of an effect as an explosion would.	<p>Anyone who uses violence or destruction to achieve some sort of political gain or affirmation(either side) is by definition, terrorists. And they will continue to use acts of terrorism to keep trying to reach their goal, so long as no one stops them. </p>	<p>There are plenty of reasons to be concerned, but I think the most obvious is that most of the wildfires are going to be localized ones. If you can‚Äôt see them all, you‚Äôre going to have to do some damage to the building or the surrounding area to prevent it from spreading. If there were a few wildfires in the area I‚Äôm pretty confident that there‚Äôd be less than one. But if there were more, I‚Äùm pretty sure there would be less.
i know I sure wonder what the soviets used to fight nazis or what any leftist revolution used to overthrow said government.Can‚Äôt be guns!	<p><strong>Kinda messed up for a bunch of boomer aged folks to forget their guns at home as they tried to &quot;overthrow democracy&quot; and somehow take over the country.</strong></p>	<p>Most of the time, it seems to be the same. If you don&#39;t think nazis use guns to overthrow governments, you are in the wrong. It&#37;s a double-edged sword, not a shield, and you can call them terrorists. </p>
If they try that, long tunnels would absolutely suck.  Same with metal garages.  "I parked my car last night and now it won't start." "I was a half mile into the Cumberland Gap tunnel and my car just died."	<p>Israel, Hungary, and Mexico have all seen their border fortifications do exactly what was intended.</p>	<p>I think if they tried it out in the open, there would be no reason to expect it to be so bad. The roads would be nothing but blankets of ice and snow. </p>
Yes, you keep telling yourself that. Last I checked, it wasn't Republicans who were stepping down, signaling they weren't selling rejection. Now if things were going SO WELL why would so many Democrats suddenly choose not to run again? It's not the Republicans in panic, no sweetheart. It's the Democrats in a panic because they know what's coming. I hope your feelings are tougher than you put on, I sense a lot of disappointment in your future. Remember, elections have consequences. üòÇüòÇüòÇ	You and other Democrats are playing a Confidence Game and are Faking Denial!	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of Democrats, myself.  Or more to the point I find them insignificant and couldn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about their performance.  But they‚Äôre smart enough to see that a lot of people are frustrated with their leaders in politics and the media, and that‚Äôd be a huge part of the problem.  If you‚Äôve ever been in that position, you would realize that the media and the big tech companies are incredibly powerful and could push you to the fringe.</p>
Hilarious, China expects the world to believe that this is a common thing.	<p>It‚Äôs pretty obvious on a world scale China doesn‚Äôt care that other nations know, and they continue to do it anyway. </p>	<p>It‚Äôs such utter hypocrisy. China is a wolf, it doesn‚Äôt want to fight a dragon, it want to hunt prey that won‚Äôts fight back.</p>
This comment smells like insecurity	<p>Add nothing to the conversation, just try to attack an assumed insecurity? You are the quadraplegic donkey of intellectual grace. Congrats.</p>	<p>Thats what I‚Äôm getting at with this.  It‚Äôs not a joke.  This is a direct refutation of the original claim.  </p>
You are exceptionally stupid.	<p>You are a special kind of stupid.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a genius, myself.  But you‚Äôre a shit human being a fucking moron.</p>
This is a really bad argument considering you can legally own a Cannon TODAY! A Black Powder muzzle loading Cannon is not legally considered a firearm, there might be state laws; but on a Federal level it's totally legal to own a Cannon.	<p>Owning a firearm is a right, carrying it is not.  When people tell me ‚Äúoh, I wish I could carry concealed, but you need a permit‚Äù and that permit is a 4 hour class you can take on a weeknight after work, I think to myself, I‚Äôm really glad you can‚Äôt carry concealed because laziness and firearms don‚Äôt mix.</p>	<p>It‚Äôs also important to note that AR-15s are not legally allowed to fire a firearm. Firearms are not inherently dangerous, they are just not as safe as a.45-70 cartridge firearm.</p>
I mean every single person I have ever seen in my entire life wave a Confederate flag was a Conservative. I have never even once seen a Liberal waving a Confederate flag and I've seen a lot of Confederate flags. How do you explain that? Unless you're claiming that the Confederacy wasn't the pro-slavery side, which would be pretty ridiculous.	The confederate flag isn‚Äôt flown as a signal to the original intent of the flag.  It‚Äôs meaning has changed considerably over time.  Now it‚Äôs just a flag of the south.  Something something southern heritage and defiance.  From the people I‚Äôve asked it has nothing to do with being pro confederacy and everything to do with being pro south.  The southern states of the US are basically their own nation with their own culture.	<p>In North Carolina, the confederate flag was flown as a signal to the south.  It was a signal that the south was not a party state.  Now it&#39;s a state party state.</p>
Touch grass, fella. This is a very conspiratorial mindset.	<p>I miss the good old days when conspiracies were at least entertaining :(</p>	<p>Chipotle is a racist neo nazi mouvement.</p>
This is about a hospital and state laws, not Federal laws.	Another thing is unless I'm a shareholder, I don't have any say about how or what the services offered by a privately owned hospital should be. But if it's offered and runned (or contracted) by the state or city,  I as a voter can actually have a say in it.	<p>Hospitals are not regulated. They are not subject to the same restrictions as a private hospital. This is a big part of the problem.</p>
Are you sure you're not thinking of your Mom?	<p>But if you feel that thinking is a waste of time, my condolences...</p>	<p>My mother is not a saint. She was a wonderful person.

I don‚Äôt wish bad on anyone, but honestly this ‚Äúwave‚Äù of c*vid is the pandemic of the vaccinated. Everyone I work with that is vaxxed is out this week. Extremely sick and some are in the hospital	<p>If you&#39;ve enjoyed this pandemic, and you want more, the best advice I can give is to not get vaccinated, and encourage others to do the same.</p>	<p>Covid = a pandemic.  People need to get over themselves and realize that doctors everywhere and polticians are not purposely misleading the public while also injecting themselves the same vaccine.</p>

This only matters if you think there is somehow an objectively-best pick at any given time for the seat rather than a pool of candidates that are all pretty much equally-qualified.

A level playing field would be a new division, men, women and trans leagues.	Dudes with penises competing in top level women‚Äôs sports.	<p>Under 2017: Olympic Committees&#39; decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn&#37;t disqualify athletes from competing in female sports. If you attempt to argue with them they will call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.</p>
This isn't said enough. I am sure joe will make them a protected class next just so no one can.	Being obese doesn't slap you in a protected class. Nor does our conversation involve protected classes since this is about ""should""s and ""ought""s rather than ""can""s and ""cannot""s. There very well may exist protected classes that shouldn't be protected classes and vice versa unprotected classes that should be protected. It's totally irrelevant.	<p>It&#39;s that people can argue that protected classifications are not fair, but the fact that they can argue with each other about them doesn&#37;t mean they should be protected. They&#38;re not, but that&#36;s not the only point. They can argue about not having the rights to the Constitution.</p>

None of this is actually true but clearly  r/conservative doesn‚Äôt trouble itself with facts judging by how many upvotes that got.	r/conservative = a sub for conservatives. You know what you‚Äôre getting into when you come here.	<p>I&#39;m not a fan of r/conservative, myself.  Or more to the point I find it hard to come to terms with.  For each disingenuous troll who tries to trivialize what we all just saw happen, people should be reminded of how grave this really is a dozen times.</p>

I dont understand why people so concern with Ukraine all of a sudden. It's the poorest country in Europe by choice, corruption is the meaning of life over there.  In 1991 when Ukraine gained its independence it had second largest economy in Europe and got sold out and robbed by their own people blaming Russia.  Look at the gains of Poroshenko he multiplied his wealth 18 times during his 4 years presidency.  Let Putin take it back who cares	<p>Additionally, who gives a shit? What advantage does Ukraine give to Russia? They have another ex-communist shit hole with a GDP that can barely rival a US state?</p>	<p>Russia is a sovereign nation.  No one cares about Ukraine.  Russia is a wolf, it doesn&#39;t want to fight a dragon, it want to hunt prey that won&#37;t fight back.</p>

And went against the community wishes.... Even went unprepared for the interview and looked like she just woke up from a 10 year nap... And looks like her goal was to abolish work all together just like her reddit name... Something that the community is against they want fair work with fair pay not abolish work completely	It's not like she got fired for the one thing she said. She'd said a number of things that her employers objected to.	<p>She was just trying to drum up bad publicity for her cause by painting her image as a black woman and painting her face as a white man trying to get her fired, which is basically the opposite of what she actually did. </p>
If you voted for Biden you need to be eliminated from the gene pool	Biden is important, in putting the fear of God into Conservatives, he is the fuel to the fire that we need, I would never recommend voting for a Republican President again.	<p>Biden is so out of touch he has no idea what‚Äôs about to happen.</p>
Hey, I know I place where they could go back and live in tribal villages...I mean, Liberia was such a *success*--maybe they should try that again.	<p>If memory serves, the &quot;Liberia&quot; movement (not just with Lincoln, but universally) was to allow any people of African descent to be able to go back if they wanted. I don&#39;t think it was a forced exodus.</p>	<p>They should be forced to relocate and resettle in states with low income and low unemployment.  </p>
Yeah we know. Gerrymandering overall is bad. We are noting the hypocrisy from our ‚Äúvirtuous‚Äù friends on the other side. Why can‚Äôt we just call it out without ‚Äúbu-bu-but what about republicans.‚Äù	<p>While democratic gerrymandering does exist, it pales in comparison to Republican gerrymandering. And it‚Äôs all fucked up.</p>	<p>As for gerrymandering, that&#39;s been going on since state legislatures have been drawing district lines.  </p>
Well either way you're writing them a check since the shot is "free" for everyone. People whine that I haven't been jabbed and I simply say I pay enough taxes to cover hundreds of people getting jabbed so I'm a net gain here.	When you show up they jab you with several shots anyway.</p>	<p>It&#39;s good to know that doctors everywhere and polticians are happy to take the jab because it&#37;s a small portion of the population. </p>

Fiscally conservative in that I prefer low taxes and small government.  I support law enforcement as well.  I voted Republican my whole life until Trump.	<p>I guess I‚Äôm just more fiscally conservative than most and look at Trump as a failure because he raised the national debt almost as much as Obama despite being in office for 4 less years.</p>	<p>I am not a fan of small government.  I am more of a libertarian than a libertarian.  But I do not support the idea of big government, and I am not in favor of tax payer dollars.  For example, I don&#39;t think the IRS should be required to do anything to help curb illegal immigration.  Tax payer money is not a good idea.</p>
I live in MPLS, and that is a straight up murder. Where are all the supporters of the 2nd amendment and the NRA? If you cannot use your legal firearm when someone comes into the apt while you are sleeping without notice, (Even though the mayor promised to do away with no knock warrants, they did NOT knock) When are you supposed to use your firearm? Conservatives should be livid, but he is not white so we will see..	<p>While I obviously agree with you that there&#39;s an attack on the 2nd amendment, I wouldn&#39;t say only trying to stop open carry fits into that. I don&#39;t have a strong opinion either way, but I&#39;ve lived in a state all my life which doesn&#39;t have it and still manages to heavily support gun rights, and imo it works great</p>	<p>If you live in a predominantly white area, you are in the right, morally if not legally. You are no harm to any one. At this point we now know even the police can be armed and can shoot someone. This law will not be able to stand on such grounds.</p>
What is it exactly about having sex with a dude that makes you less of a man? Sounds like some heavy hate on your end.	<p>You sound like someone who is single and/or never married.

Eh, she's basically right. Democrats are the modern Yankee party. Absolutist moral crusading coming out of New England... again.	<p>Edit: Oh look, your lefty site claims the NYT is &quot;center left biased&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot;. ROFL. It&#39;s a far left Democrat mouthpiece and has been for decades, which suppresses stories inconvenient to their party and carries the party line, even when blatantly inaccurate.</p>	<p>Dems are not the party of reason, they are not representative of the people they support.

I love how the subreddit is called politics but it‚Äôs just a liberal cesspool. They should just name it as such.	r/politics has a neutral name.

I'll update that to "pseudo", it was an active protest to systemic issues. A large scale sit-in, something that had been done many times in American history.   But marching on your nation's capital/Capitol because of blatant lies and falsehoods, very different.	<p>In fact, if you watch the videos from the day, this is clear. People were milling about in the Capital, and many ended up in there simply because they happened to be in the front of the protest and got pushed in by the crowd. People clearly did not know how to react or what to do, so most simply milled about. A small number (within the small number that actually entered the Capital to begin with) took the opportunity to cause damage to the building, steal property from offices, or (maybe - there is literally zero proof this was the case but it is implied) search for Congressmen/Senators for Nefarious reasons.</p>	<p>It was a peaceful protest.  It was not an insurrection.  No, it was a protest of the intent of the BLM leadership.</p>
Bernie Sanders is balding and 80 years old and people still listen to him, so, yeah, people would probably still listen.  Trump is balding, overweight, wears spray tan, is in his 70s and people (unfortunately) still listen to him.	<p>Man.  People truly are idiots to listen to him.</p>	<p>Bernie was 70 when he ran against Trump and was still a darling to many in the Democratic party. I think he‚Äôd be much better than this.</p>

Chances of myocarditis and pericarditis are significantly higher being a vaccine related injury, as opposed to COVID virus itself.  This is due to a severe amount of inflammation from the vaccines, spread throughout the body, which has significantly higher amount of spike proteins then natural infection.	<p>Conclusion: Most cases of suspected COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis occurring in persons &lt;21 years have a mild clinical course with rapid resolution of symptoms. </p>	<p>Myocarditis is the second leading cause of death after COVID. We know that vaccines do reduce the spread of COVID, but we need to be more cautious about this. </p>
It‚Äôs because leftists tend to be more educated than right wingers	<p>Leftists are incredibly ignorant of politics and current events. They are always months behind people who are even casually political on the right.</p>	<p>The reason leftists tend to be more educated than liberals is because they tend to think they know more, and that‚Äôs a big part of the problem.</p>

Except the real conspiracy theory was the fact that Joe Biden, who sat in his basement, somehow got the most votes in US election history without having to campaign in any serious way. Then conveniently despite affidavits by election workers witnessing fraud in every metropolitan city, challenges of the 2020 election where all dismissed by the courts.   It‚Äôs funny how Black Lives Matter can encircle the White House, actually charge the capital building and vandalize it, and not one mention of domestic terrorism or insurrection made by this current regime. Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done. She was allowed into the capital building, was unarmed, and was shot by some goon cop all of the sudden the libs are praising after bitching about the cops in every controversial police shooting.	<p>CNN just released a report from federal investigators saying they now believe the riot and storming of the capital building was clearly pre-planned by exteme right wingers...</p>	<p>But the fact that there was a protest in the Capitol and that it was a white supremacist protest is completely irrelevant.  There was no evidence that the protest was actually an insurrection.  It was simply a protest.  No evidence was presented to back up the claim that the rioters were indeed legitimate.  The Capitol rioters weren‚Äôt.  If you look at the evidence presented to the contrary, it‚Äôs a clear and direct result of the actions of the protestors.  That‚Äôd be a double-edged sword.    </p>

As a society have acknowledged the fact that males have high testosterone levels,  and women have low levels.  This leads to different mindsets around sex. Generally women want a commitment and love when have sex. Men are just happy to have sex.  Since girl students are not going to get commitment and love we see that they have been taken advantage of.  The boy student got sex so good for him.  If the male student were younger that would be different.  I'm not saying it is ok,  but that is why people respond the way they do.	<p>By that logic, they don‚Äôt care about teachers having sex with students as long as it isn‚Äôt at school?</p>	<p>Biological male = somewhat different. In general, men have higher testosterone levels and females tend to be more physically capable. Our bodies develop differently depending on the situation. In my experience, men tend to have higher levels of testosterone than women, so it makes sense to me to assume that men have a higher level of testosterone.</p>

I don't make money from the vaccine in any capacity. My concern about this is a pharmacist for my patients and my pay doesn't go up or down a single cent with sales from medication.  It's honestly insulting that you think my concern for people suffering from the vaccine is from monetary gain and not from genuine concern.	So in shirt of an ultimately way too long response, you should get the vaccine regardless of whether or not you have ""natural immunity"". (Un/)forunately, the freedoms granted to us by this country allow the individual to decide. Now are there restrictions, well yes, but ultimately if you don't want the vaccine, no one is putting a gun to your head like *other* countries. However, the free market also dictates that companies are allowed to require you to have the vaccine as a term of employment (for the reasons above, but mostly due to cost and liability). As a result, the market *has* dictated that requiring the vaccine is the best financial move. If you don't agree with that, you're more than welcome to form a competitor.	<p>It&#39;s that pharmacist discretion is the final reason to why I get the vaccine.  If you want to get it to me personally, I highly recommend you do so.  I don&#37;t think they need to do that.  The pharmacist should be accountable for their actions.</p>
Also, isn‚Äôt this literally what they criticized trump for‚Ä¶that the market was great but it wasn‚Äôt helping average citizens? So what‚Äôs changed, except Biden added a fuck ton of inflation? By the campaign logic, isn‚Äôt this worse than under Trump?	<p>Weren&#39;t these da same people that were complaining how inflation was bad and how they barely couldn&#39;t afford their rent and food before Biden, but now they say inflation is good or a mild inconvenience? I&#39;m confused.</p>	<p>Biden didn&#39;t run a business, he ran a school. He did a lot of his job. He ran a small government run by a Democrat. He was a fantastic governor. He turned it around and ran a great economy. He has been a fantastic leader.</p>

Curious on what you think Biden should be impeached for? Do you think Trump destroying documents is an impeachable offense?

What I love about this subreddit in particular is how you all dogpile on things like this and use it to justify your own shitty actions and belief systems.  No, this is definitely bad. Two bad things can exist at the same time, though. I know it's difficult to wrap your head around.	<p>Is that a bad thing? I have no fucking clue, honestly, I don&#39;t know enough about those concepts and how this class/course teaches them to say. Personally I don&#39;t think it sounds harmful or like propoganda, so much as it sounds like arbitrary pretentious social theories that don&#39;t really mean anything, but that&#39;s just my gut take. </p>	<p>You‚Äôre a bad person, bro.</p>
Lol you all are ridiculous. A large violent crowd forced their way into the highest seat of the one of the three branches of government, with upwards of 535 Congresspeople and the VP in the building. Everyone fucked around and found out, she and every other dumbass shouldn't have been in the building.	A few hundred fucking nuts, who it seem are not all conservative minded people, got into the chamber and saw in Nancy's seat. BRING OUT THE HANGING ROPES!	<p>It was an insurrection. The VP was shot by a police officer. The Capitol rioters surrounded the building. That was the culmination of months of trying to storm the building and overturn it. The rioters stormed the building, surrounded the police building, and surrounded the Capitol complex. The building was destroyed. The President tried to storm it, but the police surrounded it and surrounded it. </p>

Yes, her goal would be not to actually have any specific policies so voters can project their own wishes onto her like they did to Barrack.  And the media would help her do it.	I want to know how much she's getting paid and if she lobbying Congress to ensure that she's properly taxed so we can have a robust, equity based, economic recovery that works for everyone.	<p>If she really cared about the issues, people like you and me would be happy to see her push for more government regulations and less government regulations. The media, on the other hand, would be incredibly damaging.</p>

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and p	<p>The second is the vaccine itself. It is under emergency distribution authorization and has yet to have final approval from the FDA. Some people want to see what the long term effects, if any, there are from anything they take. These people are not anti vax, but get labeled as such just because they&#39;re even the slightest bit skeptical about something that was rushed. Likely, it&#39;ll be fine, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to wait until the final authorization. Especially if the government wants to mandate it.</p>	<p>The big lie is that doctors everywhere and polticians are anti-vaxxers. If you want to see the logic of that argument, you need to read the research. If they aren&#39;t, you can&#37;t convince me that they are anti vaxxed. You need to be skeptical of the science, and the research I have seen presented to me over the past months has been faulty. If it were up to liberals they could have figured it out. If not for the media, big tech, and big pharma they could be the next best thing

There is zero proof that China is committing genocide and Uyghurs are being used by the US state dept as geopolitical pawns. The USA gives direct financial support to ETIM in an effort to destabilize and balkanize China.  I bet most of the people here haven't even read the primary sources behind the claims of genocide. They are backed up by "eyewitness testimony" that cannot be independently verified and that's literally it. It's WMDs in Iraq all over again.

Something that has bothered me since becoming a parent is this:  Gotta watch everything you but on the baby from sunscreen to fabrics because they're system is so new and sensitive they could have reactions. Same with medicine. There are stuff like all natural drops and Tylenol that isn't recommended until so many months in.  But, let me shot em up 32 (I can't remember the actual number but I'm probably not far off) times in their first year with a chemical cocktail.  All my kids are fully immunized but I just think it's odd the level of inconsistency. Couldn't we wait a bit? Maybe a year or two? We already have herd immunity and likelihood of infection at their age is so low.  I dunno, it just smells like a dock in here.	<li><p>Children need to be exposed to germs and common  illnesses around them to help build up their immune systems. If they are always masked or kept home all the time and not going out and doing things, they are losing valuable time to build up their immunity to common illness that are usually not life threatening to people who have been exposed to them when younger.</p></li>	<p>As for vaccines, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the main thing you‚Äôre dealing with when it comes to vaccines.  If you get sick or if you have a bad cold, you need constant boosters.  But if you don‚Äôt get it, you‚Äùre in the right, morally if not legally.  At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated

lol y‚Äôall sucking orange dick like a dick(tator) GOP went nuts cause a black dude got elected‚Ä¶..before (and I know time doesn‚Äôt make sense to you) but before (earlier) the orange man creamed in your face.	<p>I wish I could wake up to some mean tweets right now blasting the Democrats,  better gas prices, lower prices on consumables. But no people voted with their wee feelings because Orange Man Bad!</p>	<p>I&#39;m not a fan of orange man, myself.  Or more to the point I find it insignificant that people with more experience in politics than orange man do.  But I do like the idea of orange guy being the next black president.  </p>

That‚Äôs supposed to be an insult?? Republicans just don‚Äôt want to blow their hard earned income on a prostitute.	<p>I was really hoping to have a valid debate with someone that might have some useful insight, but all you have done is insult, bring zero valid points to the debate, and be a hypocrite. I hope in the future you actually think more before you post. If you really want people to &quot;turn from their evil Republican ways,&quot; maybe you should consider giving them a legitimate reason to do so. Badgering and insulting while being a hypocrite will turn people away from your ideology, not bring them closer.</p>	<p>Republicans don&#39;t want to screw over their johns just because they are rich and want to be fucked by their employers.</p>

The Vaccines have caused thousands of deaths.  In Australia they have caused over 79,000 deaths.  European countries are bringing a lawsuit against the US Government for deaths in Europe.   But you sheep just keep getting boosters and see how that works for you!	‚ÄúOther research has clearly and definitively established that the vaccines significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality‚Äù	<p>In the US, the vaccine has been proven not to prevent hospitalization and death. In the UK, it has saved lives and is helping curb the spread of COVID. </p>
First of all, it was the Capitol they bombed, not the White House ( I know, facts are hard). But what i am really curious about is since that group was rightly labeled a terrorist group for that bombing, then I assume you agree with calling Jan 6th rioters terrorists as well, right?	<p>According to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/doj-capitol-rioters-charges-debate/2021/01/23/3b0cf112-5d97-11eb-8bcf-3877871c819d_story.html"">this article</a> an estimated 800 people stormed the Capitol on Jan 6. Those are rioters, and that is a riot. A riot is defined as &quot; a violent disturbance of the peace by a crowd. &quot; I&#39;d say that the murder of a police officer constitutes violent, 800 folks constitutes a crowd, and as you said, there was a &quot;peaceful protest&quot; that was marred by these rioters. I&#39;d say that checks all three boxes for a riot.</p>	<p>The Capitol rioters didn&#39;t storm the building, they burned it down. They burned down the police building as well.</p>
You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you? Don't be niave, over the better part of the last century the left has been corrupting every level of our society,  and they're for damn sure not going to show their rules to be voted away.    And violence most definitely IS the answer sometimes. Our rights and freedoms are worth killing to defend, otherwise there never would have been an American revolution. I refuse to lose America as its meant to be because some people are too cowardly to fight for what's worth fighting for. I'll die for those ideals. I swore an oath to the constitution(not to the government) and I still take it seriously. Wise up, evil is real and our enemies are among us.	<p>You need to think long and hard if you and your family and friends want to continue down this path. Your posts don&#39;t seem like the type of person who is a fighter. You seem like a nice person overall, but you won&#39;t survive a day if this culture war goes hot. There are people that the left are calling terrorists and dissidents who have actually fought terrorists and dissidents, kicked in doors and taken fire and generally were death dealers. That&#39;s not you by a mile. The fantasy about the lefts little &quot;revolution&quot; takes on a whole new meaning when it&#39;s a real shtf thing and hours spent playing HALO don&#39;t mean jack shit.</p>	<p>You&#39;re right, the left is not going to peacefully overthrow the government. It&#37;s going to take time and resources to do so. And if you want to fight the insurrection, you can do so in person. But if you attempt to incite insurrection, it will only result in the destruction of the government and the loss of liberty.</p>
They‚Äôre not going to produce anything because it doesn‚Äôt exist.

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	<p>This is the space democrats have occupied since the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s. Anyone who disagreed with them about anything was a racist. And they did it because as a tactic, it worked. Republicans leadership would shut up, let democrats have their way, and beg not to be called racist anymore.</p>	I think the big part of this is the fact that conservatives are tired of being told what to do and have to educate themselves about what racism is.
Are you far right rats stupid or choose not to remember the economic crash that Trump caused in 2020?	<p>I don&#39;t how many idiots I heard say they would be ok with economic repercussions as long as Trump lost. They should pay us the difference.</p>	<p>It&#39;s that the left bashes Republicans for not doing enough to prevent the next downturn. The right bashes Democrats for not having control of the federal government, and Democrats are so out of touch with reality.</p>

in your mind it is...People that talk in absolutes really have no idea what else is out there. Are you the type that complains about your girl/guy(whatever) that they 'never' take you anywhere or the  'always' ignore you? Your hatred for the 'left' is making you a bit blind to reality	<p>The fact of the matter is that there is a far right, and we can likely agree that it&#39;s a perversion of right wing ideals. Acting like it isn&#39;t there is just silly, and trying to lay it at the feet of the extreme left is silly because it&#39;s obvious the two hate one another.</p>	<p>The absolutes are not the problem here.

I seem to remember conservatives up in arms (literally) about ranchers being told they couldn't graze cattle on federal land...  But if the federal government wants to use state land, then you're cool with it?   I'm so fucking confused by this thought process... the federal government can't have control over federal land, that's a problem... but they can control state land, no problem??	<p>In the same notion, I would have absolutely zero issues if the American government did give the Native Americans some land out of the U.S. and backed out of governing that area completely. With the way that it is today, the Federal government still has some jurisdiction over tribal lands, although not as much as the rest of the country.</p>	<p>No, it&#39;s just the federal government telling us to go on land that is theirs</p>

First of all, things are already chaos, you can thank Trump and his cronies for that.  Second, I couldn‚Äôt notice your lack of defense for Trump‚Äôs quote of ‚Äúif you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.‚Äù Care to perform your mental gymnastics for me to justify that one? Just curious.	<p>I do love my country and what it used to stand for. I fought for this country and for what it used to stand for. Now I&#39;m looking around and I see people like you who are so presumptuous. Not all conservatives are &quot;Trumpers.&quot; I voted for him because I saw what Biden and Obama did when they were in charge and I compared that to what Trump did the last 4 years. Trump accomplished more and did a better job. We don&#39;t need to be &quot;deprogrammed.&quot; The left needs to pick a fight with a mirror. Most of us just want things to be moderate, or to have the politicians care about America again.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm done talking with you guys.  I‚Äôve done nothing to help this situation.   I have nothing to offer to you except offer my support and my time.  But if you keep fighting, I will send my support your way.</p>

He's critical of Islam, wokeism, cancel culture, censorship, and leftist cult rituals.	<p>I don&#39;t tend to dive too deep into religious subgroups so I really can&#39;t say anything about farrehkan.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.  Plain and simple.	<p>The question of morality and whether you are pro choice or pro life really just comes down to whether or not you believe that abortion is murder.  Everyone views murder as bad.  Pro choice people just don&#39;t see abortion as murder, at least not before the point of viability.  You&#39;d be hard pressed to find anyone on either side of the aisle who is okay with late term abortions of perfectly healthy and uncomplicated pregnancies.</p>	<p>Pro-choice is about more than abortion. It&#39;s about eliminating unwanted pregnancies and increasing the number of women. The argument is that there are more ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies than just killing a baby. If you attempt to argue with me about abortion you&#37;re going to get the same argument from someone else. There are a lot of obvious reasons to oppose abortion, but I think that being against the 2nd amendment is the closest to it. Being against the 4th amendment makes sense. It makes sense for people who are not necessarily in the right, but want to be in
Damn. Our capital is attacked. Several police beaten to death and this is how you down play it? You ain‚Äôt no patriot or conservative. Gtfo of here. It‚Äôs people like you that make conservatives look crazy.	<p>We are better than this , the riots over the summer and all of their violence should have been a stark reminder of the difference between those who believe in our country and those that want it violently overthrown.

Within minutes of the rioting, there were several hundred injured and the Capitol was stormed by police.</p>

> The original request for funding proposals from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration had listed ‚Äúsafe smoking kits/supplies‚Äù among the items that could be purchased with taxpayer money.

The grant solicitation did not *specifically* mention pipes, **although they can be a part of safe smoking kits.**  Wow. It's even right there in the article. 'Can be' = probably is.	<p>‚ÄúThere is no known safe tobacco product. FDA does not have the authority to ban any class of tobacco products, such as cigarettes.

Yes, and it was accurate at the time, with the original covid strain. You can blame anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers for the fact that they do not work as well against the newer variants, because they gave the virus a breeding ground to mutate in.	You say that, but is it really the case? Of the data that I have seen presented to me over the past months since the ""vaccine was released, I have been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that the ""vaccine"" does *anything* to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus.	<p>It was the original intent of the anti-vaxxers to prevent the spread of COVID, but it was mischaracterized as an attempt to mask the spread.</p>

So what I don't understand is why is it always the males thinking they are women and compete against real women yet you don't (or rarely) see it the other way around?	<p>Case in point. You argue that men have always competed against men. If you switch from sport to acting you see a completely different dichotomy. In ancient Greece women were forbidden from acting and only males could play the role of women?  This continued throughout Europe during Elizabethan times. There was no competition. You can argue that a man can act as a female better than a female acting as a female.  But he could never act as an XY because he would fail the basic test required to pass in the first place.</p>	<p>The Olympic Committees&#39; decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn&#38;t disqualify athletes from competing in female sports. If you attempt to argue with them they&#37;ll call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.</p>
He will never bring it. He doesn't even bring it to his SO. That's his SO's boyfriend's job.   But on a serious note: Seeing all these wimpy, spineless cowards propagate violence towards people with differing opinions is both ironic and infuriating. They are hiding behind societal structures to attack people who would elsewise put them in their place. It's like that spoiled little brat at the playground who goes around bullying others because his 3 year older brother is there with him. The second the brother stops going, he's getting a long awaited whooping.	What he ignores is the threat he may possess to others. At this point, he is basically willing to commit manslaughter, despite having the means to reduce that significantly.	<p>He will never bring it to his house. He will never invite anyone to his place. He is not going to invite anyone inside his house to have sex.</p>
Have fun with your aids bud	<p>No vaccine? Lose your job. Deliberately give someone AIDS? No biggie. It&#39;s treatable. Go have a few laughs.</p>	<p>Amen, you are a comedian. </p>
No you're absolutely right. You, specifically, should definitely avoid the vaccine. Now go out and lick some door handles, that'll really make my libbo ass PO'd.	<p>There you go again just making shit up from the top of your head. This isn‚Äôt the first vaccine we‚Äôve made. You know that? Right?</p>	<p>No, that&#39;s not the vaccine. That&#37;s the fact that you need to be vaccinated, and it&#38;s also the reason why many people are not taking the vaccine.</p>
How are gun laws "strict" if you could buy one with something you could gook up in Photoshop in 3 minutes?       The people who voted for Cuomo killed more people than anyone ever has with a firearm.  I think we need strict voter control.	While I'm not a huge gun person, I did grow up in an area with people who were, and they all seem to agree with the current rules. I'm talking about people who go out and panic buy ammo and guns anytime a Democrat gets elected president, and yet those same people agree with our current state laws which don't ever allow open carry in public. Make of that what you will, but I think it is a perspective that you're not going to find anywhere else	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of gun rights, myself.  I‚Äôve always been against the idea of restricting gun use, but I find it incredibly troubling that the left bashes the right over not having control over their own bodies.  Even if you were pro-life, you‚Äôd still be a hypocrite if you didn‚Äôt support gun control.  This argument is easily reconcilable with the right‚Äôs position on the subject.  Firearms should not be used as a weapon.  At least not in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania or Michigan.  It
Few things make me cringe more than seeing other conservatives calling neoliberal leaders communist. Joe Biden is a terrible person and President, but he is not a communist.	<p>Are you talking about the guys who graffitied ‚ÄúFuck Biden‚Äù on a DNC office? lol, one thing you can be sure of, woke socialist marxists hate Biden even more than we do.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of Joe Biden, myself.  Or more to the point I find him insignificant and couldn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about him.  But his response to Cruz was on point.  For each disingenuous troll who tries to trivialize what we all just saw happen, people should be reminded of how grave this really is a dozen times.</p>

Purposely misgendering is a thing. Would you call Lenya Bloom a man if you didn't know she was trans?  It only needs to be actioned when the sole intent is to harass or you create an unhealthy work or school environment. Harass example: Your sole intent is to demean someone and get your viewers and/or friends onto them. Or you seek out trans people to rile them up.	I think some people are frustrated when trans are grouped in with non-binary folks. They are very different things and in my experience, there are very conservative trans identifying people out there who don‚Äôt want to make up crazy pronouns,	<p>Insanity towards trans people is a big part of trans advocacy.</p>
You're seriously trying to handwaive away Cawthorn's long history of sexual assault on the basis of *source*? As though this has not been extensively documented across multiple sources, which you could have found yourself with a little cursory effort? Is [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/madison-cawthorn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-office-denies) a better source? This is a really weird hill for you to die on considering it requires you to put fingers in your ears and ignore objective reality.	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations	<p>The truth is that there have been numerous sexual harassment investigations into Clarence Thomas and other high school principals over the years.  Those investigations have been largely ignored by the media and academia.  There have been a handful of cases of sexual harassment and assault involving young women, but none of them were reported to the media.  </p>
Not saying your take is wrong but it doesn‚Äôt address the industry wide issue that‚Äôs at the root of this problem. By pointing to the fact that I drive a car that contributes to carbon footprints s, for example, what are you really even doing?   I watched Don‚Äôt Look Up last night. We‚Äôve gotta be serious about this	<p>As a side note, I don&#39;t consider &quot;buying&quot; carbon offsets as doing much. You&#39;re still polluting and just pawning off your massive carbon footprint on the poor. If this is truly an issue, one where we must decrease our carbon output, then start by decreasing your own life&#39;s footprint before telling others what to do.</p>	<p>It&#39;s a big part of the problem. EVs don&#38;t do it for long. Car-sharing is another big part. EVs do it because they reduce vehicle load, but they also reduce vehicle idling rates, which is why car-sharing systems are so popular in the US.</p>

Here in Denmark rape is comitted by mostly whites.	<p>By using information from the Swedish Crime Register, offenders between 15 and 60 years old convicted of rape+ between 2000 and 2015 were included. Information on substance use disorders, previous criminality and psychiatric disorders were retrieved from Swedish population-based registers, and Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify classes of rape+ offenders. A total of 3039 offenders were included in the analysis. <strong>A majority of them were immigrants</strong> (n = 1 800; 59.2%) of which a majority (n = 1 451; 47.7%) were born outside of Sweden.</p>	<p>Denmark has a large rape problem and the vast majority of rapes are committed by men of colour.</p>
2019: economy looked great. Trump was holding speeches in large stadiums. The best democrat candidates were Biden, Pete and Kamala. Trump looked like he‚Äôd win 2020.  2020: Democrats turn a flu into a catastrophic pandemic. Introduce ‚Äúelection reforms‚Äù in battleground states. Engage in mass election fraud.  2021: Biden is president and Kamala is VP.  What‚Äôs the moral of the story? Don‚Äôt count your chickens before the eggs hatch. Republicans are incredible dumb fucks.	<p>Biden screwed up so bad moderate dems and liberals will even for for Trump now. They won‚Äôt vote for other republican candidates because they are democrats. They will vote for Trump because even all the bad things that stick to Trump, the one thing that people really equate to Trump is the economy. So people will want that. </p>	<p>2019: Dems took over the house with a vengeance. Constantly praising Biden and Kamala for his leadership in the party. They‚Äôve been building the house for decades and are now the majority. </p>

That didn‚Äôt happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don‚Äôt start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don‚Äôt try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies. Just face that your guy lost and he lost without honor because he‚Äôs a conman. Grow up and face reality	The Truth is Biden was not Elected by the Electoral College! Trump was! THE EVIDENCE of Democrats committing Voter Fraud is Endless! If thats not enough Proof for you then wait till the Maricopa County Cyber Ninja Task Force has Concluded their Investigation a,d Proven it once and for all!!	<p>I‚Äôm pretty confident that the election was fraudulent. I‚Äôve been proven to be wrong countless times over the years by my own intelligence and analysis. Even if it were true I would still be skeptical of trump. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be able to pull off a miracle run like this. He‚Äôs a proven liar and a fraud too. I think he could pull off something like that if he needed to.

True, but who was the last real well meaning, honest, republican official see anywhere near the oval office? When was the last democrat? Each side is so vile towards the other that they're bringing out the worst of one another. America's 4 year presidential election is a total farce and its only propagated through media blinding everyone else to the fact that our government needs reformation and every year we wait is furthering us towards the path of actual civil war. If not some disgusting capitalist dystopian reality where 90% of the population will suffer to pamper the top 10%	Hmm that‚Äôs weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes. Their successors as well, are Democrats.	<p>The truth is, the democrat party has been a disaster for the American people for decades now.  It&#39;s time to go back to the old days when the GOP was a powerhouse and the left bashes the right for not having control over their own government.  Now the left is circling the wagons and calling for more democracy and more freedom.  The right wants to destroy everything the left touches and destroy everything they touch.</p>

I'm in the wait and see mindset and may stay there for quite some time and let this play out for a while.	<p>I‚Äôve had the vaccine twice and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the last.

It‚Äôs easier to be outside and socially distanced in Florida right now, right?	Florida: does exactly that	<p>It&#39;s cool to live in Florida now.</p>
The deaths are primarily among the people who choose not to vaccinate. Unvaccinated people going about their lives without the same mitigation efforts die at a higher rate. And the political affiliation of the unvaccinated (for COVID at least) leans right more than left. Why would anyone apologize to Trump for his supporters ignoring the easiest safety measure continuing to die?	No matter which side of the argument you're on about these vaccinations, no one should be celebrating the tragic deaths or medical struggles of other human beings. It reeks of the disgusting way people treated those who had contracted AIDS back in the 60s-80s. People justified their abhorrent treatment of AIDS sufferers because they saw it as a ""consequence"" of those people's ""risky"" life choices. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now. So how is this any different?	<p>The vast majority of unvaccinated people are either not or don&#39;t want to get COVID, or they want to stay home and destitute. This is why it&#37;s so important to not get too involved when there are so many people out there that want to do the exact thing the vaccine prevents them from getting COVID. This makes sense. The vast majority (90%+) of people with COVID are healthy and can be persuaded to get the vaccine.</p>

Did you support the cancelation of the Dixie Chicks in the early 2000's by Republicans? Did you support the attempted cancelation of "inappropriate rap music" by the conservatives in the 80's and 90's, which went all the way to the Supreme Court? Did you support or oppose the cancel culture campaigns of the "Moral majority" under the Falwell's?	I used to love listening to conservative talk radio because **the arguments made by Neal Boortz & co. were legitimately more sound than the liberal arguments.**	<p>I support the cancel culture of the 1960s, but I also think that it&#39;s important to note that there are still some conservative groups out there pushing the limits of freedom of speech, whether it be in the woke or the woke. I don&#37;t think that the time and money spent on cancelling shows should be used to help push the agenda of conservatives. If you support the idea of cance culture, then you are against it.</p>
I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.	Conservatism is usually about solving your own problems and not relying on others. The opposite is where you want collective responsibilities, sharing costs of healthcare, pensions, unemployment benefits etc.	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of Disaster Preparedness, myself.  I‚Äôve been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that it‚Äôs a problem.  But I have seen plenty of examples of people on both sides of the political spectrum not being able to make sense of it all.  It seems to me that people are more likely to die of natural causes than from a lack of preparedness.</p>
Well this post was about Canada and that's what I'm referring to.  I don't promote BLM, but as far as BLM, all that happened in Canada was marches.	<p>Say what you will about BLM, despite protesting for half the year in several cities, weather violent attacks by the cps and counter protester and even rioting a few times themselves, they never tried to violently overthrow the government and never killed a cop with a fire extinguisher.</p>	<p>BLM is a racist neo nazi mouvement!</p>

Exactly. I'd imagine there is a decent crossover of unvaxxed and permitted concealed carry folks. Atack one of those, it's reasonable they might feel in fear for their life and safety and take action to protect themselves.	<p>Police aren&#39;t concerned with average Joe carrying. They are more concerned about the gang bangers and meth trash who carry anyways and will pop off if a cop blinks wrong. This changes nothing on that. Drug use and being in the possession of a firearm is already a felony. I open and concealed carry everywhere I go. I&#39;m frequently in government buildings including the capitol and no one blinks and eye at me or my gun as I pass through security.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a gun person myself, myself. I carry a concealed weapon. That‚Äôs my right. I‚Äôve been told by my own doctor that I shouldn‚Äôt carry a gun unless I have a medical condition requiring it.  If I have to carry a firearm, I can do it legally.  But I also have to be vigilant.</p>
I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>It makes no logical sense that conservatives are anti-vax. Two years ago that was the domain of the hippy left and a few fringe right wingers. Conservatism is about self sufficiency. If you have a gun for protection, lock your doors, wear seatbelts, why the fuck would you not take a vaccine?</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of cigarettes, myself.  I‚Äôve been shown absolutely no harm from them over the years.  But I do find it somewhat disturbing that you‚Äôre forcing me to wear a mask when I don‚Äôt need it.  It‚Äôs a double-edged sword, and it‚Äôd be a waste of precious resources if you tried to shield yourself from it.</p>

Perfect example of how the left thinks.   The COVID vaccines were rushed in development and marketing. A typical 5-10 year research and development process was compressed into 1 year. This likely explains why the vaccine isn't working all that well.	<p>Vaccines are an amazing development of modern medicine. I would agree that some skepticism of the Covid vaccine is understandable given its novelty, but to make a blanket statement that support of vaccines is tantamount to support of tyranny is ludicrous. If there‚Äôs any hope to beating the left it‚Äôs to be the more rational side of the political spectrum, not to be equally ridiculous but in a different direction.</p>	<p>There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of this vaccine, but it&#39;s not the only one. There are a lot of obvious reasons why the vaccine was rushed to market, but I think the most obvious is that it was rushed because there was so much pressure to get it right. After all, they have already spent billions of dollars on research and development and now they have to produce a final product that has no long term safety studies and no long-term tolerances.</p>

Leftism itself needs no insults... lol. It's a self-destructive, pitiful existence. The typical leftist male is a single, white, degenerate gamer. They likely won't marry, if they get lucky and "do the deed" with a woman, they will likely beg her to kill their offspring.     In many cases though, leftist males, night after night, browse grindr for self degregating anonymous anal sex with strangers day, after day, night after night.      It's honestly sad, but thankfully it is an ideology that can't survive more than one, maybe 2 generations if lucky.     How many of these did I get right with you? lol	<p>Leftists thrive on hate.  That is all they are, all they have.  That is what makes them leftists.  The whole point of leftism is dissatisfaction with other people exercising freedom in ways you disapprove of, and amassing political power over them to stop them.</p>	<p>Leftism is a subversion of traditional values. It‚Äôs not a creed, it is a creed. It is a religion. It doesn‚Äôt believe in any god or savior, it believes in a creed.</p>
'TDS' is a term used by people who can't defend Trump's actions and to dismiss legitmate criticism.	TDS = Trump Derangement Syndrome	<p>The term ‚ÄúTDS‚Äù is used literally every day in the news, even though it is never used in the context of the article itself. </p>
Trump blamed the unvaccinated for 2021 deaths in the Candace interview. Neither he or Biden should be responsible for virus deaths, but that was an idiotic thing to say.	<p>When Biden eases up on the vaccine mandates he will blame Trump for rushing the vaccine. Then herd natural immunity and mild variants will effectively end the pandemic. And they will all give Biden credit.</p>	<p>Trump didn&#39;t tell Texans they had to get vaccinated for covid. The CDC and Trumps own website say that vaccines do not reduce the spread of COVID, which is misinformation.</p>
Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think hospitals are going to deny people, even if they are stupid, selfish, and unreasonable.  They don‚Äôt even kick them out for assaulting medical staff.	>The doctors are pressured into this too. Many, many health professionals around the world are pissed off, but their careers are threatened if they say too much.	<p>If you think hospitals are not doing their job, then you‚Äôre in the right, morally if not legally. They are not the only ones that are being denied healthcare. The vast majority of those who are denied healthcare are either unvaccinated or are not in the proper setting. If you go to a hospital for medical emergencies, they are not accepting of you.</p>
Oh good one. You hit me with the ‚Äúno you‚Äù defense. Well played. So I come with evidence, the fact that they waved a fucking Nazi flag at the ‚Äúprotest‚Äù and you come with no evidence at all. Looks like I win this one so you resort to personal attacks.	<p>Do facts not matter to you? What about the evidence was in any way countered by the defense?</p>	<p>You&#39;re lying, I&#37;m not supporting you. I am supporting you because you are a dishonest prick, and I don&#38;t want to give you the benefit of the doubt when you say that you&#40;re supporting the right to free speech. You are supporting the wrong guy, and you are supporting a dishonest piece of garbage that is being thrown out of context.</p>

The Olympics should always be held in Europe or one of the Anglosphere countries.  Non-Europeans should consider it an honor and a privilege to be invited, and we should abandon the idea of allowing Chinese or Mexicans to host the Games.	<p>I do think everyone should boycott the Olympics in China though.</p>	<p>The Olympic Committees&#39; decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a female Olympic Committees shouldn&#37;t disqualify athletes from competing in female sports. If you attempt to argue with them they&#38;ll call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.</p>

No no, your argument only works if you use Rasmussen, which I'm not going to let you get away with. According to RCP, at the end of his first term, Obama was +1.3, while Trump was -8.7. I can produce facts all day while you resort to namecalling, because reality is on my side. Good day sir.      https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president\_obama\_job\_approval-1044.html	Real wage growth was ar 2.4 percent under Obama in 2015 and 2.1 for trump in 2019.	<p>No, it&#39;s true. Trump&#37;s approval rating among republicans was significantly lower than his approval rating at the end of his first term. He&#38;s also far lower than Biden by a wide margin.</p>

Luckily Texas doesn‚Äôt use dominion because our legislature found them to be sus years ago when they were trying to get state contracts	<p>If states like Texas do not want to be held to federal regulations then they should pay for those federal services using state revenue.

Except abortion isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcause of death‚Äù because fetuses are not people.	Obviously, someone pro-abortion doesn't think killing a baby before they're born is murder, so really it comes down to where you stand on the subject.	<p>You‚Äôre not saying that abortion is the only way to save a baby from its mother.

i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence. If you are being bullied and stand up for yourself , you get in trouble. If you get bullied and ask the school for help, their response is you need to learn to deal with it-no support, no trouble for the bully, nothing. So they create an incubator for pain and suffering with zero way out (if you were treated this badly at work you would quit, but it's not legal to do that with school). Then they're all surprised that the kid freaks out and shoots the place up.	I don't believe school shootings are over exaggerated in the media, but even if they are, kids don't have the capacity to calculate risk levels and many are afraid	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of school shootings myself, myself.  There‚Äôs nothing to suggest that I‚Äôd do anything to prevent someone from doing something like this.  But I do think that there is something to be gained from having your ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù and ‚Äúrespect‚Äù towards others, especially young ones.   I think that‚Äôll be a big part of the problem.

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.	<p>I get where people are coming from, but i think it&#39;s only because it wasn&#39;t successful. People tend to think &quot;well those idiots wouldn&#39;t win anyway&quot; which is probably the majority of level headed republican/conservatives. My issue is they came with intent and people died because of that intent. Whereas if you compare it to BLM protests that turn into riots you it quite literally isn&#39;t the same.</p>	<p>Biden was right, there were plenty of angry, violent, and occasionally violent protests from the right over the last 2 years. He was absolutely right. There was a MBL protest that lasted less than 2 days. That lasted a day. It was peaceful and lasted months. That was my first protest. It lasted a few days. In comparison there were a hundred from the left, dozens killed, hundreds injured, billions worth of prop damage and lost businesses. That&#39;s not what this guy was trying to incite. It&#37;s a protest from the side.</p>

yes I would, please tell me how voter fraud in this case would be pulled off. polling staff in some county dont notice that 3 times the student population of a university voted and dont carry out an audit? In Belgium there was a case of a cosmic ray giving someone 4096 more votes than she got, what can be called an act of god was discovered and amended no amount of bad guys with fake moustaches and ids can rig an election  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Belgium   first point in the reported problems part	<p>I am in full support of auditing the 2020 election results. <strong>I think voter fraud should be taken seriously and investigated.</strong></p>	<p>If you are not a fan of the election, and believe that there is fraud, then you are a fraud victim.  There is no legitimate reason to believe that the election was rigged.  If you believe that that is the case, you are in the right, morally if not legally.  You are a fool, and there is a legitimate reason why the election is rigged. If you don‚Äôt believe that it is a fraud, and you trust that the elections are legitimate, then do you trust the election integrity of the individual running them?</p>

This shouldn't be a hot take. Pence is 100% correct.  Only issue I see is he should have been screaming it from the mountain tops for the last year	The real question is if he is electable. Guess fucking not, according to this crowd. It's a shame though because what Pence is, is a pretty legit, rational, principled conservative. I'd be psyched to see the party get back to that, not this letting our passions rule shit that makes us just as reactionary and short sighted as the dems.	<p>I&#39;m 100% over Mike Pence.   He is the real guy.  He has proven to be a proven liar and a dishonest prick.</p>

Is a sub full of people that don‚Äôt believe in masks or vaccines upset someone removed their mask for a picture? HOLD THE FUCKING PRESSES! this is much worse than your emperor telling you all not to get vaccinated while getting as vaccinated as possible and watching his idiot followers slowly die. But yeah you are all right, her and every single one of you should be wearing a mask.	<p>no everybody is not wearing masks. Trump supporters don&#39;t wear masks. That&#39;s a big part of the problem.  </p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a fan of masks, myself.  I‚Äôve been vaccinated myself and have never been put on such a mask.  But I‚Äùm not one of those people that thinks wearing a mask is a good idea.  If you want to wear a mask, don‚Äôt do it for long.</p>

Sovereign nations have the right to determine who crosses boarders. Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to explain that on a conservative sub.   He‚Äôs not a Canadian citizen; his entry is conditional to the laws and rules of the sovereign country he *requests* entry to.   He has the absolute right to not get vaccinated. That doesn‚Äôt mean he gets to enter a sovereign country.   Choices have consequences - something conservatives understand.   Smdh.	<p>Canada has strict immigration laws.</p>	<p>Canada is not a sovereign country.  They are a free country. We can‚Äôt make laws that apply to us.  There are countries that have laws that govern us, but not their laws.  This law will not be able to stand on such grounds.</p>
To be fair though, r/antiwork was far more extreme when it first started. They were pretending like they‚Äôd actually tear apart capitalism or something.

I mean, Trump and company are welcome to bring any and all allegations  to the courts, which they did. And they had no evidence , so the courts sent them home. These were conservative , trump appointed judges mind you. Just because enough people repeat a lie, doesn‚Äôt make it true. Cultists believe what they‚Äôre leaders tell them to believe	Listen, I honestly couldn't be less impressed by the voter fraud.  After near 50 lawsuits, the Trump show couldn't get one case thru a prima facie case.  That doesn't happen because of a conspiracy. It happens because they have so little evidence, not even a Trump appointed judge was willing to find anything of merit to argue.	<p>The truth is, most of the evidence presented to the courts is either irrelevant or irrelevant to the case. The only thing the courts should do is find it necessary to remove the Trump appointees because there was no evidence presented. The courts should not be able to find and remove anyone who is not a Trump appointee without providing evidence.</p>

Saying that I promote violence towards women is abhorrent and offensive, especially since you seem so confident that the claims you make aren‚Äôt rooted in evidence. 18 states have passed bathroom bill allowing trans people to access bathrooms and none of them have had increases in sexual assault related to bathrooms.   Here‚Äôs a study from the UCLA that proves this:   https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13178-018-0335-z	<p>There are no police guarding toilets, so you don&#39;t need to pretend to be a woman for a grown man to assault a young girl. They can simply walk in and assault anyone they want.</p>	<p>Biological studies clearly show that transphobia is a problem, and that the opposite of sexual orientation is that it can be co-morbid and can result in unwanted pregnancies. </p>

Depends on who does the banning. The government? No. A private company? That's their business.	<p>Another there&#39;s a private company. A private company is not allowed to refuse to follow federal law</p>	<p>It&#39;s not like private companies can ban you.

You can ban a white person, blackface, or a blackface. You&#36;re not banning a white guy. You just ban them from doing their jobs.</p>

He's actually doing things that fundamentally benefit all of us and is doing so without demanding the government tax us more to give to him or his buddies.	<p>He&#39;s a tax payer, which is why I think he should be forced to step aside if he wants to spend more money on his family.</p>
It's because they eat them, and sell them in animal wet markets where their urine, faeces and blood contaminate other species.	Once there is shit in their water trough they won‚Äôt drink it.

Ohhhh look, some idiot comparing a naturally Occurring event such as the incredibly tragic miscarriage, TO ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT A DOCTOR TO CAUSE THE MISCARRIAGE	<p>I also have a story about the state of the baby the other way though. I knew a woman whose son&#39;s wife was pregnant. The doctor found that both of them had some disorder in their family history, tested them and found that they both had the gene. So suggested that they test the baby&#39;s DNA in utero. That baby died <em>because of the test</em>. Let me be clear, the test was not positive, and they chose to terminate, the test killed the baby. Some years later they were pregnant again and did not do the test and the baby did not have the disorder, but they would have loved the baby all the same if it had.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a doctor myself. I‚Äôve had the experience of not knowing if you‚Äôre going to have a baby before they‚Äôll have a chance to get it. You‚Äôd have to be a practicing doctor to be able to detect the baby‚Äôs movement and the movement of the air, but that‚Äôn‚Äôt what my doctor told me.</p>
Defcon guys have gamefied hacking those voting machines.	<p>Third, the issue with Trump&#39;s claims that votes randomly appeared was explained by the machines having issues which were corrected. Votes were updated in clusters. Trump had bumps of votes, too. It wasn&#39;t just Biden that had 90,000 random votes found for him. More people just happened to vote for Biden in a democratic county. Why didn&#39;t they challenge red counties which used the same machines? Why didn&#39;t they challenge red states which swung for Trump which used the same machines? Is it that ONLY these certain blue-leaning, majority POC counties happened to cheat? </p>	<p>How can we not know that Defcon is a fraud and that election fraud is a crime?</p>

A little off topic but governments of the world have literally murdered millions. Why suddenly do they care about saving EVERY single person with a vaccine that does literally nothing. Remember flint michigan? remember all the lives they could have saved for in comparison terms was a drop in the bucket as far as what they spend now on covid? Now suddenly they care oh sooooo much about you. Get real.	<p>I figure that doctors and the government are pushing so hard for the vaccine, and eventual and to this pandemic because they want it to end. There is not a government on Earth or a practicing doctor that does not want to save their own citizens, save for some of the most brutal regimes in the world.</p>	<p>It&#39;s a waste of money to spend on a vaccine that is not supposed to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus. </p>

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband‚Äôs current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn‚Äôt still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband‚Äôs tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.	She (like so many other career politicians) has only appeared to support President Trump while it helped her career. And with the left now in full overload on attacking Trump and all of the rats jumping ship and distancing themselves from him, she is very much showing herself to be one.	<p>She was a seasoned politician and a proven liar, someone who knew nothing about politics and her methods would have been a disaster for any politician running against her. But her record as a republican is legendary, and she has proven to be a seasoned tactician and a fantastic leader, something that anyone who looks into politics can learn from. </p>

Oh sure, I'm certain everyone of the long list of women who have accused him are lying, and that he is telling the truth. Oh and I'm sure that his well known history of sexual assault during college doesn't provide [corroborating evidence](https://www.thecut.com/2021/03/a-running-list-of-the-allegations-against-madison-cawthorn.html).   >In October, over 150 former students from Cawthorn‚Äôs alma mater, Patrick Henry College, signed a letter saying that his predatory behavior was well-known around campus and that women were warned not to be alone with him.      Maybe there isn't a place for a serial sexual assaulter in the Conservative movement. Are we about personal integrity, or not? The aim should be to be better than that.	Come on.... You can't tell me that someone in his position won't have people come up and making false accusations against him? Or even actually having a consensual relationship and then turning it around and claiming unwanted advances?	<p>It&#39;s that he admitted he did it, but said he was only doing so because he was a victim of a sexual assault. That&#37;s not the only thing he did. In fact, he admitted doing it as a private citizen, and admitted he had a sexual relationship with a 17 year old girl. That claim has been corroborated by multiple sources, including multiple law enforcement sources. </p>

Yes, but what if the father does want the child but the mother does? The father shouldn‚Äôt be force to provide for a child he had no way of denying. (After conception, I know you could use contraceptives. What I mean is if the mother doesn‚Äôt want the child she has/had abortion, but if the father doesn‚Äôt want the child he can‚Äôt abort the baby unless the mother also wants an abortion.)	Is it ethical to deny the abortion in the given scenario?	<p>The mother doesn&#39;t have the right to choose if she wants to have a baby. The father can force a woman to have an abortion if they want to, but the mother can choose not to. If she wanted to carry a child to term, she could call the police, or the church, and the police would call the church and the church. If the church refused to do so, the church would call for the church to remove the ban and the Church would be forced to support the church.</p>

Vaccine has nothing to do with whether or not you get covid. Vaccine greatly reduces the incidence of severe symptoms. Symptoms that will put someone out of work. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so hard to understand about that.	<p>Crucially, the vaccine allows you to skip the dangerous part of covid, which is when it triggers an out-of-whack, extremely severe response from your immune system, which is why you see people on ventilators and shit, because their lungs are flooding from an out-of-sync immune system response.</p>	<p>The vaccine prevents you from catching covid. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.</p>

Here's the real test of your sincerity. Voting is a right.  Bearing arms is a right.  Would you be OK with a system where you walk into Big 5 and pick up a shotgun with only [this?](https://www.cr80news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UT_card-500x292.png)	States are responsible for setting up and conducting elections. States can take the right to vote and own firearms away. Otherwise, you are contending that the right to bear arms isn't a right at all.	<p>This is not a case for gun rights. Firearms aren&#39;t legally protected. Firearms are a right. Firearms can be used for any purpose. Firearms require a permit. </p>
Didn‚Äôt you read his post? Because leftist media bad, duh.	<p>The average leftist is maybe just misinformed, but don&#39;t afford the same charity to the media and people in power.

What was the side effect of the vaccine that landed you in the hospital?	<p>I got vaccinated before it was understood that there were some pretty serious side effects of it that existed.  Otherwise, I am not sure I would have done it.  Especially because I had ALREADY HAD COVID.</p>	<p>No vaccine prevents you from catching COVID, which is why I am in the hospital right now. This is the second time I have been hospitalized with COVID. This time around, I was in the ICU with my mom and she was fine. I am 100% convinced that it prevents me from catching it. </p>
Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	Numerous accounts and affidavits confirm it. Videos showing ballots being manipulated. Ballot drops in the middle of the night after counting had supposedly stopped and the watchers had left.. Counties with more votes than actual eligible voters, etc.	<p>As for the mail-in ballots, that&#39;s been going on since state legislatures have been drawing the lines in the sand. The only thing that has changed is the number of ballots that can be counted and counted. The number of votes that could be counted in a single state has been raised by a range of 62 to 78¬†percent compared to the national rate. This has caused some serious problems, both personally and legally. In North Carolina, there was a large discrepancy between the number and number of mail in ballots and the number counted. In Michigan, there were relatively few. In Pennsylvania,

She wrote the green new deal and raised money for Texas while Cruz was on vacation during the freeze last year.	Nobody is saying she saved Texas.

Us actual trans people don't demand special privileges. If you want to make fun of who we are, purposely misgender us, or, which is 1000000000x worse, fetishize us, go right ahead. Just don't cry when we criticize you for it because then you're asking for special privileges as well: free speech with zero criticism.	<p>I think some people are frustrated when trans are grouped in with non-binary folks. They are very different things and in my experience, there are very conservative trans identifying people out there who don‚Äôt want to make up crazy pronouns,	<p>I don&#39;t think anybody is entitled to special rights. I think we as a society should be able to say whatever we want, however I think it is important to also be consistent that we as individuals should not be discriminated against or discriminated against. This isnt some kind of ostracism or ostracization. It&#37;s a big part of trans advocacy, but it doesn&#38;t mean that we should be forced to accept the &quot;wrong&quot;; pronouns. It means that we can&#41;t accept the opinions of others
It's probably a psyop to keep mocking the American party realignment repeatedly until it isn't true anymore.	It's also a continuous source of amusement when folks on  the left accuse projection when forced to see facts that they dislike.	<p>If you&#39;re not a part of the realignment process, then you are part of it. The realignment is the dismantling of the American party. The dismantling of it is the opposite of the dismantling it.</p>
So you're all cool if I stop here by with left leaning opinions? I'm not going to get insta-banned?  Awesome.  Let's see...  Tax cuts for the wealthy are bad for the economy. Capitalist business owners who pay workers less than the value of what they produce are leeches mooching off of poorer people who create the actual value. Abortion wouldn't be as common if "pro-life" advocates instead advocated for universal health care, universal free access to birth control, and sex education in every school, but if Republican politicians actually supported that they'd lose single-issue voters so it will never happen. The Republican Party has no real platform and has completely succumb to Trumpism which is little more than a cult of personality around a failed elitist millionaire who doesn't care about anyone who isn't currently kissing his ass. Critical Race Theory hasn't ever been taught in elementary schools. Banning books you disagree with isn't going to stop your kid from eventually realizing they're gay or transgender if that's who they really are and you not accepting them as they are makes you the freak, not them.   Is that enough for a ban, mods? Muh free speech!	Now conservatives can ban abortions all they want and there is nothing you can do about it.	<p>If you support abortion then you‚Äôre a pro-life. Youre a hypocrite.  Youre just as stupid as the left.  I‚Äôm not going to vote for you because you support tax cuts for the rich, but because you are anti-abortion.  If you support freedom of speech and abortion you are a good candidate for the next election.</p>

This guy is being an ass for the sake of being an ass.  He doesn't have to swim on the girls team, he could easily swim on the men's team. Everyone shaves their legs and pits regardless. The only difference is that on the women's team he is ranked number one and on the men's team he is over 400.  To me, that makes his motivation clear - he wants to win, regardless of the damage he does to the sport or the collateral damage to the women swimmers.  It's a selfish act and it's shameful.	<p>Why does anyone care what anyone does so long as they are not hurting anyone else? Which is why I am not in favor of someone who changes their gender and competes in the opposite sport. They are hurting others with their unfair advantage.</p>	<p>The Olympic Committees&#39; decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn&#37;t disqualify athletes from competing in female sports. If you attempt to argue with them they&#38;ll call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.</p>
I think the democrats and the CCP are in bed actually. The stuff they push at it‚Äôs core is neo-Marxist ideology that bases the oppressor oppressed dichotomy on race and identity instead of by wealth and power like soviets.

I‚Äôm not willing to take that chance.	<p>The current situation is only harmonious to the CCP.  Not the US people or the Chinese people.</p>	<p>The CCP is a totalitarian state that wants to destroy everything it touches, destroy everything that it touches. And that‚Äôs exactly what the Democrats are doing. And it‚Äôll never stop doing that, ever.</p>

Slightly different responses are acceptable if you encounter a person mid-rape vs being told a person raped someone.   I think we can all agree on that. In one scenario there is 0% doubt‚Ä¶  anyways, my two cents	<p>Rape has a massive psychological component and some people can have to get therapy to even acknowledge they were raped, you can‚Äôt expect a clear logical decision from someone who experienced massive psychological trauma a couple days ago.</p>	<p>Rape is a crime, it happens to everyone.

Yes, for example Michael Brown was unarmed, but a big guy and was charging at a police officer like a linebacker. That constituted a threat to the officer's life.

If they win,  the free market will undoubtedly correct accordingly.</p>	<p>The free market is not the only thing that can be done. The second is the government‚Äôs power to regulate the business.

I'm not a commie sorry :/ communism is dumb.    But I know for uneducated troglodytes like yourself you don't really understand the difference in these words or what the words themselves mean, you just use them.	<p>By communism they don&#39;t mean communism, because they don&#39;t know what it is. What they actually mean historically is bolshevism, the right-wing precursor to totalitarianism that developed in the Soviet Union. The US had a major attack on labor earlier in the last century and anti-labor oriented US business and political interests attacked supporters of labor/workers as being communists by associating people advocating for more democracy, better labor standards, equality, unions as advocates for the brutality of the Russian state, and wanting to bring that to America. </p>	<p>The term ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù is used literally every day in the US, but this isnt what you‚Äôre referring to.

What actions did you take in this protest, and how did the mayor and police respond?	<p>In fact, if you watch the videos from the day, this is clear. People were milling about in the Capital, and many ended up in there simply because they happened to be in the front of the protest and got pushed in by the crowd. People clearly did not know how to react or what to do, so most simply milled about. A small number (within the small number that actually entered the Capital to begin with) took the opportunity to cause damage to the building, steal property from offices, or (maybe - there is literally zero proof this was the case but it is implied) search for Congressmen/Senators for Nefarious reasons.</p>	<p>This was an intentional protest by the mayor and police. It was a lawful protest. </p>

remember when kids needed a chicken pox vaccine too? How fascist	An individual's vaccine protects them and no one else. Children who's parents have both either had or been vaccinated against chicken pox still need the vaccine or to catch it and naturally develop antibodies. This is because their individual immune system doesn't have the information to generate the antibodies and their parent's and/or friends' vaccinations/antibodies do not protect them.	If the vaccine prevents you from catching covid, ok. That makes sense.

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th¬†week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p>Outside of those groups, COVID-19, is not that serious for the individual. It can still be serious for young people, but the numbers don‚Äôt suggest that, and the way the virus works does not suggest that. The number of reported cases is likely higher due to asymptomatic cases and people who experienced low symptoms that they probably wouldn‚Äôt have considered COVID and never got tested, because it wasn‚Äôt serious for them.</p>	<p>If you think the CDC is warning you, then you are in the right, morally if not legally. The CDC is not telling you that the vaccine doesn&#39;t work, and that it shouldn&#37;t be used to prevent future Covid-19 cases. If you believe this, then your concern is understandable. But the CDC also is not warning you about the risk of becoming infected, especially if you have a large family of unvaccinated. This is not an unreasonable risk. It is a projection of the health of the population, not the government.</p>
I'm still surprised some reddit algorithm doesn't find and ban the discussion.  Just like covid, there is only one approved narrative / acceptable belief system.	<p><a href=""/r/LockdownSkepticism"">/r/LockdownSkepticism</a> is by far the best COVID related discussion group on Reddit.  It&#39;s also well moderated and the conversation there doesn&#39;t stray as much into conspiracy theories and ranting.</p>	<p>This isnt some kind of unbiased or questioning.  People should be forced to make their own beliefs based on facts and not ideology.</p>
Ah so one person made a claim and that means all Democrats think that.	<p>You guys think all republicans believe that when the fact is very few people do</p>	<p>All Democrats believe that.</p>
The law, Act 77, was passed October 31, 2019, with bipartisan support. Over a month before the first case of COVID-19 in China.	<p>The final fate of the COVID-19 Origins Act has not yet been decided. It is still in committee (as it has been for less than 2.5 months). This is the way Congress works.</p>	<p>The bill is now in the senate, where it&#39;s necessary to pass a bill that would prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the US. The bill is currently being debated in the House of Representatives and is needed to pass the Senate. </p>
The people that want her dead are radical constitutional conservatives. The same ideology that was on the losing side of the Civil War. I'm not saying they're wrong, but solving problems with violence is a great way to not get things done.	<p>What happened is she tried to change the narrative, as all politicians do, to make her cause seem more righteous than what it really was. See Iraq war 2 for ref. And she has been quite successful at garnering sympathy and will likely accumulate a lot of donation money for the future fights by painting the picture like this.</p>	<p>Most of the people I know are conservatives.  Less violent people, more peaceful people.  But there are pockets of resistance.  There are pockets that are willing to fight for what they believe in, and it&#39;s time to go back to the civil war.  If you want to see what happens next, check the rioting at the capitol building next door.  It seems to be going in the wrong direction.</p>
Yeah I'm real sure the people shattering the windows and rampaging around screaming "kill AOC" were the left.... yup	<p>I heard that AOC nearly died when she thought</p>	<p>AOC was on the right.</p>

See guys the set up..:::they know they‚Äôre going to get their ass kicked by the republicans, so if the democrats can‚Äôt get election ‚Äúreform‚Äù passed to ensure they can ballot harvest and pull all their shenanigans to steal upcoming elections, they‚Äôre already are refusing to recognize the upcoming Republican victory as legitimate. Their media will report that racist voting laws are suppressing minority votes which is why republicans won, so it‚Äôs not a legitimate victory‚Ä¶as they sit there and tell us to accept results of 2020 elections and don‚Äôt you dare question that. That‚Äôs the narrative that play out in r/politics too as those cry babies will share endless propaganda bolstering what I just said.	<p>Now they lie to the audience. Suppress information. They lied to and tricked the least knowledgeable voting group in the country with emotional warfare. They don&#39;t use facts. They can&#39;t even define the systematic racism they proclaim. They can&#39;t define &quot;white rage&quot; they just throw it out there like an emotional grenade and inexperienced people take it as the truth. The young people trust them. They told people they were going to pay off their student loans lol. They lied about that and it was an obvious lie but young people are too inexperienced to know that. Now there&#39;s no accountability for their obvious lie. I Just hope and pray the corrupt Democrat party have permanently lost their trust. </p>	They are so out of touch they have no idea what‚Äôs about to happen. They‚Äôre so blinded by their own feelings that they can‚Äôt see the full extent of the fraud.
Weird, so the question of the week is what are we all going to do if bidet deploys our military to help trudouche? I personally am not going to stand around while they kill unarmed civilians this is Hitler and mussolini 2.0	<p>Biden would never do that, but it would be a site to see! Would love to see the leftist spin on how it was ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù and we ‚Äúkilled people who didn‚Äôt deserve it‚Äù or some shit like that</p>	<p>This is all well and good, but it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre getting at with your rhetoric and your actions. This is just a continuation of the same old old narrative.   You‚Äôve seen it all over the news, and it is not helping your argument.  This is not the same as the old narrative, or the same tired echo chambers that were used to justify the Nazis killing innocent people.  Or the same goes for the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.  </p>
And yet the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù focus is on locking down to stop the Rona?    We should be locking down abortion clinics instead.	‚Äú mandatory lockdown orders early in the pandemic may not provide significantly more benefits to slowing the spread of the disease than other voluntary measures‚Äù	<p>If you&#39;re anti-abortion there are plenty of reasons to oppose Rona, but the fact that they are only targeting small numbers of women who have access to abortions is a big one.</p>
How long before the right makes serial rapist Jim Jordan awww fuck it already happened didn't it	<p>I don‚Äôt know if Leftism predisposes one to sexual predation or if sexual predation predisposes one to Leftism‚Äîthe direction of causality is difficult to discern.

You personally are already required to carry auto liability insurance by your state.	>That's what my own insurance is for.	<p>You&#39;re right that insurance is not the only thing you can do.

If not, you&#37;re in the wrong. This law will not be able to stand on such grounds.</p>

Exactly why is an emotional black child unhireable? I could put him to work tomorrow	<p>I work with a black woman who has a kid. I was talking to her about the schools in NYC that were ending admission testing. She said that was offensive and racist because (oddly enough) she thinks her kid can learn to read and take a test like every other kid.</p>	<p>The fact that he‚Äôs unemployed and couldn‚Äôt find a job is a major part of the problem. He‚Äôd have to find a new one. He could find a spare kraken or a job at any point in time.</p>

The administration changed hands, just not legitimately. Nothing can be done now. Shoring up election integrity has been and should continue to be a priority for the right going forward.	<p>Now fortify the election - accuse opponents of trying to overthrow democracy, refuse audits and send fbi on any individual who has any evidence of fraud.</p>	<p>Under 2017: Election integrity</p>
That‚Äôs correct. Don‚Äôt let the neo-yanks fool you. There‚Äôs nothing conservative about suspending the Constitution.	I mean from a conservative viewpoint, sure I guess that makes sense.	<p>The Constitution is not just about restricting speech. It&#39;s about changing the way we use the law. The left is not a fan of the right, it&#37;s more of a tool masquerading under a false guise of respectability.</p>

That statement is at the very least ambiguous. It wont stop infection or transmission, wich was never stated as fact (at least over here in the Netherlands) but hospitalization and death can certainly be prevented.	A majority of people are now vaccinated and it doesn't stop you from being infected but rather prevents your death	<p>If the vaccine prevents hospitalization and death then it‚Äôs a good thing.</p>

Stupid Leftists don't understand nuclear weapons.	<p>On the one hand the left are ignorant of nuclear. On they other hand they are corrupt and know that their donors are heavily invested in alternative energies.  The rise of nuclear would lose them billions in potential over charges energy sources the government is subsidiarizing.</p>	<p>This is a classic Leftist talking point. They don&#39;t understand nuclear weapons, they&#37;re just pointing fingers at the ground, pointing to how the US used them to attack China. China used them as a weapon, but now it&#38;s a threat to the US and the US, and the United States is unwilling to use them as an excuse to attack it.</p>
China bad US great US never do anything wrong ever USA USA USA USA USA USA	Well, here I'm forced to disagree strongly. The US is doing bad when compared globally. Very bad, actually. I would even say that it's the worst offender. Per capita, per citizen, the US is producing twice the amount of china. And they have four times the population.	<p>US is not China. We are not the only country in this world to have this problem.</p>
Source for any of those claims?  Dems have been trying to fix this for years.  Some states have actually done it.  The ones that haven't, like NY, still had a lot of debate about whether or not they should gerrymander.  The "fight fire with fire" crowd won out.	<p>As for gerrymandering, that&#39;s been going on since state legislatures have been drawing district lines.  I am not in favor of taking that power away from state legislatures.  I would much prefer people who are accountable to the voters (assume free and fair elections) hold that power vs. some unelected body of bureaucrats.</p>	<p>It&#39;s also important to note that in states that have gerrymandering, Republicans can&#38;t hold that power.  It&#37;s a big part of the problem.</p>
Is there any actual evidence that the election was rigged? Why don‚Äôt they bring the case to the Supreme Court?	<p>Just because the political,  mainstream and social intelligentsia won‚Äôt allow any talk of rigged election and falsely parrot lies that courts heard evidence and found no wrong doing, doesn‚Äôt mean you t to state it as fact. They can do so on their networks with their bobble head guests and armchair critics, but not here. Not where we all know the truth because we‚Äôve seen it with our eyes and ears. </p>	<p>There was no evidence that the election was rigged.  Now there is evidence that it was.  There is no evidence to support it.  It is all bullshit.  People just don&#39;t believe that it happened.  </p>
No.  You're still shooting blanks.	A blank still releases expanding gases when fired. If there's anything in the barrel, it becomes a bullet.	<p>No, you&#39;re shooting a firearm. You&#37;re practicing self defense. You don&#38;t have to shoot a firearm to defend yourself.</p>
You know this is in a county that voted Republican 80-20 in the last election, right?	<p>One question tho. Do you know how many votes that county had? And do you know by what percent of those voted Biden won?</p>	<p>As for the county, that&#39;s the only reason it voted. The only reason they did is because they were in a heavily Republican district.</p>
Then our military needs to stay out of Ukraine! Fjb! He can‚Äôt be trusted! I wish our military would turn on this fraud of a president. They would be well supported.	I love how conservatives pretend that if a Democrat had blackmailed Ukraine like they did, they wouldn‚Äôt have impeached.	<p>US has a huge military footprint and a huge political class.  I am 100% in favor of sending our military to Ukraine.  There is no reason to expect them to fight a war that is so bloody bloody.  They have no choice but to fight.  And if they do, it will be in self-defense.</p>

When I saw this I got happy as hell and thought maybe it was on uplifting news	<p>I get downvotes because I believe people can be conservative AND tolerant and empathetic?  Good fucking Lord.</p>	<p>You know, I&#39;m not critical of Trump. I just don&#37;t see much of the point.  I don&*t see a lot of things Trump said.

Because that would solve problems that people actually have	Because the solution to everything on the left is just throw money at the problem l0l</p>	<p>It‚Äôs a perfect analogy for ‚Äúsystemic problems‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt mean people have to solve problems that are not solved by technology. </p>

Why do you want regulation so much? Sounds like Commie speak to me	<p>Regardless of the fact, why are we now in favor of socialism &amp; regulation?

So long as it isn't Candace Owens' Black vagina. That particular black vagina doesn't represent black vaginas.	<p>On the other hand, take Candace Owens, a black woman and near the top of the identity politics pyramid.

Anyone else see the hypocrisy of implying Biden has mental issues by quoting a mumbling stooge who was so riddled with Alzheimers during his first term, info was actively kept from him by his closest advisors?  Also, given the state of modern America due to 40 years of 'Reaganism,' the idea of unchecked corporatism has been thoroughly debunked.  P.S. Glad to see so many ostensibly conservative members of this group know the truth about Reagan's 'complicated' (to be polite) history.	<p>Could be true, could he bullshit. Coupled with the fact that Biden clearly has dementia, I tend to think there‚Äôs probably some nugget of truth in there somewhere.</p>	<p>Biden is clearly not mentally capable. He has no idea what‚Äôs about to happen.</p>
Didn't know so many Republicans had a Mr Ed fetish	<p>If memory serves me, he was well liked &amp; well respected by the American public &amp; the Republican party.</p>	<p>As for Ed, that&#39;s a big part of the problem. The fact that he didn&#37;t have much of a say in the matter, and that he was a darling to many in the republican party, is a huge part of why they coalesced around him.</p>

This is why the Chinese call us baizuo. It‚Äôs more than just a sense of moral superiority that defines a baizuo; it‚Äôs also a willingness to accept ideologies that require the undermining of existing social progress in the name of appearing inclusive. Here we see a triumph of second-wave feminism, the maintenance of female sports leagues at the college and professional levels, being supplanted by the new illogical trans-acceptance regime. All that hard work to make women‚Äôs sports viable gone down the tubes in the name of insisting that transwomen are really truly women.	The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn't disqualify athletes from competing in female sports.

Na, you dismissed a fact you didn't like as you.. Didn't like it. Pretty comical.	<p>It&#39;s quite amusing how two, where as one either participated in the riots or watched it happen (based on your deceptions I&#39;d go as far as to say you were complicit) are so deviated from reality, or outright impartial twats, that the guy from across the pond seem to know more about what&#39;s going on than you.</p>	<p>So, no, you&#39;re not making this up based on the fact that I didn&#37;t like it. I&#38;m making that up based purely on your feelings.</p>
No they didn‚Äôt lie.  Their sources were wrong and they publicly retracted and apologized.  This has happened hundreds of thousands of times in news papers all over the world‚Ä¶	Lying to the people from the start was all on Biden and the MSM, covering for where the virus came from, saying shutting down travel was racist when it wasn't.  So many lies that they lost any trust.	<p>No, they didn‚Äôt lie. They were wrong.</p>

SMH, what a fraking disgrace and this point id entertain the military taking over...	What youre lamely trying to say is: That the Testimony of Decorated Career Military Personel isnt worth Squat to the American Public. Their Service is unimportant to Congress and the Senate.

It's so sad too.  People with legit heart issues are going to continue to blame covid while injecting more bullshit into their bodies.	Either way, you‚Äôre right.  We don‚Äôt do nearly enough to address heart disease in this country, so we can sleep well at night knowing that we *also* aren‚Äôt doing enough to address COVID.	<p>It‚Äôs really sad that doctors everywhere and polticians are so blinded by the idea that everyone should be able to take the blame for their own health issues when it comes to covid.</p>
A ton of registered democrat voters were registered to addresses that can't possibly exist, proven on video on the LwC show. Imagine how many more free votes the DNC can create in 2022 since the registration doesn't have to tie to an actual residence. This is obviously why they want to make voting by mail so much easier. Or we will just see pipes burst and vote counting "stopped" long enough to get the watchers out of the building so new Democrat ballots can be pulled from a sketchy vans at 3am.	You can forsee what‚Äôs going to happen here, the Dems will claim that they can‚Äôt vote indoors due to the supposed ‚ÄúDelta‚Äù variant, then say they need to use mail-in voting.	<p>I think 2020 will see a massive increase in the number of mail-in ballots, and that‚Äôs because of the massive amount of fraud that took place in the DNC. If you want to see how many mail in ballots that could possibly be used to make a difference in the election, check the voter registration status of those who use them. If they do, double check the name of the person you‚Äôre talking about and double check their address. That‚Äôd be a massive difference.</p>
Trump was impeached for being accused of abandoning our best friend, Ukraine. If Trump was Biden, he'd be impeached again. Democrats and leftists have no convictions.

Love that this comment is sitting at negative votes.  Increasing manufacturing? Ensuring supply chains are better? Ya know, so we don't get caught with out cocks in our hands the next time this type of thing happens? Naaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.  Why bother?  There's CRT and phony vote recounts to worry about.	<p>I don‚Äôt believe any of this vote switching actually happened, as it was not found in hand recounts of the paper ballots, but even if it did all avenues of recourse have been exhausted.</p>	<p>It&#39;s that we need to focus on manufacturing, not just the election. We need to look at the ways in which we can make sure our manufacturing is doing better than what is currently happening. Our elections are not the only thing that needs to be addressed. The election is not the final reason why we need this. If it was up to Republicans, there&#37;d be no reason to not start looking at the election results. The elections are much more important.</p>
But those words Trump spoke and the damage they caused means nothing to you? Is that right?	I don't give a shit about what trump did/didn't do in office, I was making a point that words mean nothing.	<p>I am 100% convinced that the words were meant to be used as a rallying cry against Trump, but the reality is that those words werent meant to mean anything. The words were used literally because Trump was so out of touch.</p>
The guy crying the loudest is the one who never did and never would sign up to serve his country.

They don&#39;t care what anyone thinks. They care nothing about the military or the American people.</p>
I feel like you are saying that the people who's wealth is based entirely on people being able to buy things from them don't want people to be able to buy things from them, though.	Nah wealth shouldn't determine human value	<p>I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the point.  Wealth redistribution is about people owning more than themselves.  People who accumulate more wealth than themselves are more likely to accumulate less wealth than their peers.</p>
Ok. So there was one, in PA.	<p>One guy did get arrested in PA for casting a vote for his dead dad, but that&#39;s the only one I found.</p>	<p>There was one. </p>
So if the father of my unwanted child is my rapist I‚Äôm financially tied to them for at least 18 years. Fantastic!	I‚Äôve had friends been in this position, I can‚Äôt imagine what their life would be right now if they were forced to keep their rapist‚Äôs baby.	<p>You can‚Äôt have a baby unless you‚Äôre a rapist. You‚Äôve got to be a fucking good person to have a child. You can have a conversation with a rapist and they can‚Äùt be reasoned with.</p>

I thought it was pretty obvious that the South was run by slavery loving Democrats. Is this not basic knowledge in America? It continues with those who think Lincoln was a Democrat. Just a bunch of idiots.	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	<p>The South was not run by a Democrat. It was a nation of opportunity. The South was a land of opportunity for the people. The south was not a party of law. The north was a state for the south. The southern states were a nation for the north.</p>
Holup Jay-z has committed 1 crime in his life 20+ years ago and the dude he stabbed was stealing his music (so, another criminal).   You really still care about a third-degree assault charge from 20 years ago that he didn‚Äôt even go to jail for‚Ä¶.?	<p>Going to prison for 1.5-3yrs is enough to fuxk up your world. I‚Äôd say he still got charged.	<p>I&#39;m not arguing that anyone should be charged with a crime that happened 20+ years ago. But I am arguing that the charge should be dropped based on the severity of the crime and the degree of the offense. If you believe that the charges are dropped then you are in the right, morally if not legally. And if they are dropping charges that are not dropped, that is a violation of the constitution. That&#37;s not a crime committed by a wrong-on-the-job. That is not what I am talking about. I&#38;m talking about
>Idk.. I don't expect utopia but people should be able to work together. Even if you don't agree.  Agreed.  >I just can't believe how okay everyone is with being robbed blind by political and corporate greed.. Especially people who support Trump. That dude don't even have to pretend.. He's just a bad person and people love him.  I consider him to be an ass, but significantly better at that job than Biden or Obama (personally). However, give me a candidate whose not an asshole and whose policies resonate with me, I'll vote for them regardless of party.	It's called ""utopia"". When everything is happening as it should have.	<p>This is the real world, and it&#39;s not some utopia. It&#37;s a far from it, and in my experience, there&#38;s nothing worse than being left behind by a bunch of idiots trying to manipulate the political system.</p>

Common errors in comments are ignoring that conservative judges have dismissed the election-based lawsuits on the merits.  Why is that?	<p>I didnt do a hard tally of all of the lawsuit results, but reading through them all, a vast majority of appeal attempts were either rejected, dismissed, or denied. Most common after that result was either a withdrawal or drop from the lawyers. I only saw a few cases from localized republican groups not directly associated with Trumps campaign team actually having their cases appealed and losing said case. </p>	<p>Court refuses to hear appeal of election fraud lawsuit.</p>

FYI- I am  centrist  #Adam Kinzinger for President	<p>Kinzinger had one of the lowest republican scores on voting with Trump (83.5%) and also voted for impeaching Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not a centrist, myself.

>all of the people who only had those ids and didnt realise they needed other ones      Well from what I can tell, the application for food stamps in North Carolina doesn't require ID or even a SSN, so obviously that's not an acceptable form of ID.      State employees would obviously require valid government ID to be hired, so again, that's a moot point.	<p>They could force businesses to check IDs and not sell to anyone out of state.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not saying that stamps aren‚Äôt necessary, but it‚Äôs pretty clear that most states don‚Äôtl;dr require ID to work. If you‚Äôre in North Carolina, you need an ID to get in and out of work.  And that‚Äôd be a big part of the problem.  </p>

Nah pimpin. That happened after I got my experimental mrna gene therapy booster shot last week. Don't worry docta fauci said it's perfectly normal	<p>What shot did you get and what are your symptoms? You can build your health back up with the right diet and supplements I think. Herbs have been around since the beginning of time. Try Ashwangda or ginseng to help with your strength.

Women seem to only exist now during short periods where it's politically convenient, like say abortion debates or attempting to smear a Republican supreme court justice.  Other than that, "women" magically disappear until the next time they are needed to be weaponized.	Think about that, for even just a moment. One fights for womanhood, one fights to eliminate the definitions of womanhood.	<p>The idea that women can be ‚Äúforce-force‚Äù them into positions of power is ridiculous. They can‚Äôt even come up with a single argument that fits the narrative. They have to invent arguments to get their point across. If you attempt to argue with them they‚Äôll call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.</p>
That's how the right present their so called facts. Make a wild claim, then when asked for source "do your own research"   Keep spreading your misinformation bud	Your own source counters your own claim.	<p>If you don&#39;t believe that, then you are making a fool of yourself. You are spreading misinformation because you believe that the truth is out there.</p>
Lets just remind everyone that Reagan started the massive, expensive and inefficient war on drugs and raised the debt ceiling to levels unheard of at the time. He had some good quips and was a good face for america, but policy wise he fell flat on a lot of topics.	Also because I admire Milton Friedman's teachings, who despite being a self proclaimed libertarian, was a darling to many conservatives, especially President Reagan.	<p>Also Ronald Reagan was a fiscal conservative. Remember the debt ceiling was raised in the 90s. That was before the financial crisis. That&#39;s why the left bashes the right over not spending enough on the military.</p>

What are you going on about? The guys gone. For reasons other than the protest. They didn't see him getting the job done, so they voted to replace him. If the liberals would follow suit maybe we wouldn't be as fucked as we are. Although, one will just replace the other I suppose. No winning with this liberal government.	>A few insane people did think there would be real change, but most of the protest was just upset that the election integrity was compromised and no one really did anything.	<p>I am not saying that he was the only reason the rioters were there, but the fact that they were there was a clear difference between right and left. The left bashes the right for not having control over their own government, while the right bashes their own for not doing their job as well.</p>

While I think what she said was stupid on the other hand I sympathize.   These people don't listen.  They don't care.  Force is the only thing they'll understand.	It's really funny I see insults hurled at her all the time but never see anyone use a better source than those she uses to refute what she says.	<p>I think she&#39;s a terrible person, and I don&#37;t think people should listen to her tbh.

You‚Äôre 100% correct. All my experiences with Central American immigrants have been positive. The vast majority of them are hard working family people.   It‚Äôs just become the American way to demonize and blame others for our own problems, rather than constructively work together.   Both parties have been running on the same issues for decades now. They‚Äôre in no hurry to solve them, because then what would they scream and yell about?	This notion from the left or the right, that ‚Äúonly my people work hard‚Äù is completely ridiculous. We all know that white trash family that complains about immigrants but will not move a finger to get educated, work and save in order to move up the socioeconomic ladder.	<p>There are enough red states with high unemployment and high crime rates that they need to take action to shore up the American economy. But the vast majority of them are not in the bright red states of the US. They need to be proactive and take actions that make them less likely to end up in the wrong states or worse. If they did, people would be able to find jobs and opportunities. </p>

So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.	She was protecting herself.  People will say whatever is necessary to do so in court.	<p>I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre referring to the fact that she didn‚Äôt defend herself, which is misinformation.  But it‚Äôs not a huge distance from what she‚Äôd actually been doing.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of videos of people verbally and physically assaulting police.  </p>

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take ‚Äúglobal perspectives,‚Äù which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who‚Äôs a minority or has a ‚Äúunique world view‚Äù (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I‚Äôm mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn‚Äôt speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it‚Äôs a threat - including stuff like ‚Äúglobal perspectives‚Äù classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn‚Äôt have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn‚Äôt need any video/audio evidence of it and I‚Äôm a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	<p>If you want to talk about real policy that harms Asian-Americans, then let&#39;s talk about affirmative action, and how that leftist policy discriminates against Asians when it comes to acceptance into universities.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm a white and Asian American.  </p>
The Biden administration has sunk to Trumpian lows on this topic. True, elections often have elements of unethical, even if legal, features.  But it‚Äôs the legal that matters.  2016, 2020 were legal outcomes.	<p>This is not the legal or ethical standard for incitement. Disputing elections is part of the game now. Stacey Abrams has somehow made a career out of it.</p>	<p>The truth is, almost every election since the dawn of time has been tainted by dishonest politicians trying to manipulate the outcome. Even if it wasn‚Äôt, the integrity of elections is paramount.</p>
Thats total bs. They were few riots, and alot of peaceful demonstrations broken up by force. Both happen and yall celebrated vids of cracking down on non riots and riots alike.	<p>The problem with a lot of the riots in question is the Democrats in power had their police stand down instead of keeping the peace.</p>	<p>Last I checked there were less than 5 violent riots. That&#39;s a vast majority of those. In comparison there were a hundred from the left, dozens killed, hundreds injured, billions worth of prop damage and lost businesses. That seems reasonable considering the amount of damage and loss of lives caused by the rioters. </p>
Cons are so up their own asses it's laughable. Everyone is a hErO AnD A PaTrIoT. A few months ago the right was largely in support of running over protestors who block roads.

interesting, could you please give me a good source that Sanger was pro death? I've always been told that she refused abortions exept I think for life threatening conditions. Would love to have something to use in debates.	<p>Pro-abortionists do not view abortion as murder, they generally believe that because the fetus relies on the mother‚Äôs care, that the fetus is not ‚Äúa life‚Äù because it couldn‚Äôt live without being in the womb. </p>	<p>If you think abortion is murder, that&#39;s exactly what abortion is. If you support abortion then you know what you are getting into when you say it. The left bashes the right over not having control over their own bodies. The right bashes you for not having a control over your own body, and you call them transphobic because you don&#37;t want to kill a baby. This is a big part of the problem.</p>
Female to males wouldn't make the cut against male athletes	The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition.

If you attempt to argue with them they'll call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.	<p>If the Olympic Committees decided to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition.

Pete Buttigeig spent 2 moths ~~grooming~~ looking after his new adopted children.   That was A-OK though.

If you want to debate material causes of the direct war you can point to slavery or tariffs. I'm making a deeper point though. The divisions between the British folkways into America fundamentally set the stage for a death struggle. It wasn't about black people, they just got caught in the middle between two ancient English tradtions. Read Albion's Seed.	Make no mistake.....The American Civil War was fought to end slavery.</p>	<p>I‚Äôm not arguing that slavery was a direct consequence of the civil war, but it‚Äôs more of a political point.  The civil war was about the abolition of slavery and the removal of slavery.  It was about abolition, the abolition movement, the emancipation of slaves, the dismantling of the shackles on the British Crown, and the dismantling and destruction of the British state.  This was not a civil war.  I‚Äôd argue that it was a continuation of the oppression of the south.</p>
