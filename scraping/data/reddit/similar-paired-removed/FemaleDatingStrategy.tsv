I like how he confirms that men lack common sense and social skills by telling them how to do the absolute obvious when you are meeting someone via social media.  Male IQ is in hell LMAO.	Absolutely agree with your observations!  Everyone who encourages sex work likes to pretend the men are neutral consumers with no risk profile, but in fact, these men are bottom of the barrel, defective, abusive creeps.	0.815

You’re so right about the hot and cold behaviour, and this is quote apparent in texting conversations with these kinds of men.  I feel like there’s a lot of cross over with narcissistic tendencies and avoidants. They’ll love bomb you and chase you in the beginning, and then pull away and start with the hot and cold behaviour. They’ll be unresponsive to your texts but weeks later, they’ll pop out of nowhere and text you like nothing ever happened.   Avoidants have a hard time maintaining friendships as well, so watch out for men who cycle through friendships quickly and try to escape any mess they’ve made by moving away.   If someone is not giving you the attention you deserve and is not consistent with it, leave.	0.814
I like how he confirms that men lack common sense and social skills by telling them how to do the absolute obvious when you are meeting someone via social media.  Male IQ is in hell LMAO.	Exactly. This sounds like a quality man here and yet there are so many comments speculating on his motives and saying no way in hell they'd date men who do this. Shit like this a big reason why this sub is compared to mgtow and called a hate sub.	0.813

Apparently they think that if you post on FDS you agree with EVERY single post here, and that an HVM is a 6-6-6 guy who needs their rights infringed on by installing spy cams and apps that monitor them 24/7.     Get mad. Sometimes I want them to just strike me up for a conversation instead of banning me or judging me for FDS, but then I remember they're all brainwashed by the idea that we've 'achieved equality'.	0.812

And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	Yeah, I think she has mislead intentions. All the tiktok girls make it seem like it’s so easy to find wealthy men who will give you money platonically, but they don’t mention that 100% of them want sex and are essentially pedos/abusers (whether sexually, physically, or through power). They’re not some type of feminist altruists who only want to help young women through the goodness of their hearts.   Her an her friend have definitely seen some shit, so they have to put up that dead eyed front to pretend everything is okay. But deep down I think they know it’s wrong.	0.822
And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	Even when men worry about women’s, it’s always from their (men) perspective because they think they are the sole source of the woman’s pleasure (meanwhile she’s probably mentally visually some Hollywood hunk to get there but never mind 🙄).	0.82
And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	It's sad how so many men look down on women like this. They see women as less rational and intelligent as them and hate it when a woman is smarter than them. A lot of men also look down on women they see as unattractive. It doesn't matter how talented or HV that woman is. She gets dissed by men who find her unattractive as "ugly".	0.818
And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	I didn’t like the video for women - since all of the traits were related to men somehow, as if everything is about how it will make your boyfriends feel.  And it felt less like a list to help women understand their flaws and become better, than it felt like a list a man made for women to do what he likes.  Things like “don’t be a drama queen” and “don’t try to take control” feels like a man saying “don’t talk too much and always smile”   And it wanted women to not care about their appearance but at the same time always look presentable for their man. That reeks of “I like women with no make up, you know, like Kendall Jenner”	0.813
And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	I'm WLW, as are many of my friends, and I still see a similar pattern emerge. It seems to me the more emotionally unavailable person takes on the 'male archetype': low-effort, avoiding commitment and real intimacy. While the other either starts showing PickMe behaviour in an effort to 'earn' love and attention, or lowers their standards and convinces herself she's a Cool Girl to accommodate the low-effort partner.  The end result is always: situationship limbo with the female archetype (secretly) hoping for romance and commitment, while the male archetype keeps feeding crumbs of effort and/or future faking to receive sex.	0.808

A walk is not a date, I agree. But I'm not taking a girl on a date before I've seen her in real life. The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	Don't say walks aren't dates, they'll waste your time and start explaining why it's such a great idea. Just say, I don't do walk dates. If they start probing and asking why, just block. Any man who thinks a walk date is a good first date is not worth dating, you'll always have to nudge them in the right direction.	0.851

Perhaps these types of men should learn to be patient, and get to know a woman a bit more before booking her time for a date?  You go on walks with friends. You go on walks to commute. A walk is not a valid date for a man courting a woman.	0.849

I'm actually a bit peeved at the moment because going by votes, apparently people think I agree with the idea that a woman owes a man sex for paying for her meal?  But let's be honest, guys who suggest walk dates have no interest in "getting to know" the woman they're with. I stand by my comment that it's a shit test.	0.843

They might not be cheaper than dinner but there’s more of a guarantee of getting laid for men since drinking lowers your inhibitions.

Yeah I suspect she married him as she wanted to get married and think it'll be pretty much impossible to find another guy with a disfigured face so saw him as "the best choice available". There's a reason why she tried to break up with him but got back together with him after being disfigured. Yes, some women cannot stand the thought of never finding love, but seriously, given how this guy (and other men) are extremely dangerous, it's much better to stay single.   I highly suspect the guy is now pursuing her in the hopes of persuading her to stop filing police complaints against him so that he can escape from being jailed. Unfortunately he did succeed. Now this monster is running loose in Turkey.	0.827
This is literally everything we hate at FDS.  I just looooove the menz!  I’m not like those other girlzzzzz!  Tee hee!  Have you thought maybe those men are nice mainly because they want to fuck you?	Men are so gross! His hobby is... having sex? Why? I would throw up at his questions and just hate the way he uses IG. But I understand that women just think "man is giving me attention, must give attention back". It's just sad when you see the process behind it. He's completely vapid, completely devoid of substance. We want to assume the best in people and think there must be something inside their head, but there's just nothing.	0.914

I've been reluctant to share my story about two of my ex-friends who were ultra pickmes. They have been the reason I'm terrified of making friends or getting super close to other women in real life.   These two people literally went to extreme measures to ruin my reputation and tore me down to everyone they could because I ended the "friendship". One of them even began dressing like me, talking like me, got the same haircut and dye.. and even went out and got similar tattoos as me.. and went for guys who she thought I would be 'into'...   It's a really long story, but it's creepy and I still sometimes worry that they have their flying monkeys watching me, so I've now developed agoraphobia from it.. so that's fun. 😑	0.868

Some scrote whining about:  >”the way you women are currently acting is red flags for all men. look how hysterical you are”  >“that why divorce rates are so high and when the man is asked, he thought the relationship was fine. women file for divorce far more to boot?”  So women are “hysterical” and emotional, but also secretive and impossible to read to the point where we hide our marital issues from our spouse until the moment of divorce? You’d think hubby would get the hint once his wife started getting “hysterical” ? Lmao, make it make sense 🤡	0.867

Men who claim feminism should be for them because they get offended when they are called girly/effeminate honestly don't get any empathy from me anymore. Grow the fuck up. Women actually fought and are still fighting to get the actual right of wearing what they want. Someone called you effeminate and that you act like a girl? Ohhh boooo, if only that was true.  Women aren't bad, get over it.   And yes, the person who answered you is an MRA scrote. They're like viruses, as soon as women wise up they mutate and find new ways to keep us down. Fuck him.	0.863
I've been reading it too and it's amazing! Especially that you can find out many celebrities and people in your life who use those laws.   One of my favourite laws is conceal your intentions and I think you can apply it to FDS. It's better to not be open and direct about your FDS ideology and feminist beliefs. Sharing them and showing off how you don't need any men can be dangerous. People don't like being called out on their misogyny and LVM and pickmes will try to show you "your place".	It sucks, but it happens. An alt really is the only solution. As the other ladies have said, a lot of subs **require** a very watered down version of feminism because they are ran by men who obviously do not like getting their feelings hurt at the truth 😔 and with FDS in your history it's just an easy target to hopefully dismiss you before other women look too hard at it.   I've actually had success saying the exact same things I feel on my main, but ultimately I'm not sure it makes a difference. I think a lot of women are waking up to the collective gaslighting we get on here and are pushing back because I've seen it a lot more frequently, but with men in charge they just do their best to bury it.	0.871

I’m sure he felt the exact same way for his girlfriend at some point, but he was **grooming you by making you feel special**. I’m not saying you’re not special, I’m saying that the way a man feels about a woman is often way more about the type of man he is than about the type of woman she is. Any woman who’s fresh pussy pining for him outside of his relationship would be “special”,  because it makes him feel desired. It’s not about you, it’s about his ego. I’m sorry this is harsh, but it’s the truth. It doesn’t take much to get along with a man, especially if he’s using you.  As long as you believe you are somehow much more special than other women (or you desperately want to believe you are better or desperately want to be better), you will fall prey to grooming and lovebombing.  To reiterate: you are special and deserving of love, but no more than his girlfriend (unless she is somehow a really LVW and a total pickme, but she’s not the one getting involved with a committed man and hoping he leaves his girlfriend…).  You are a victim of a misogynistic culture, raised to believe that a man saying you’re special is some kind of prize. Everything from music to movies to proverbs grooms women to this type of behaviour.  Who needs to be special is him, sis. You already are, and so is his girlfriend most likely. He’s proven to be the opposite of special. He’s ordinary, a LVM.  This is a simple case of… you don’t need to be picked by a man and told you’re special. You need to pick a special man (not a committed cheater, for starters).  Don’t ask him to pick you over his girlfriend. You know what that makes you.  You will get over this, and hopefully spread the gospel of With An HVM, You Don’t Need To Compete With Another Woman.  HVM do not put you in a position to root and count the days until another woman’s life gets uprooted, her heart broken being left in shambles, betrayed and abused, facing possibly losing her house.	0.85

I found FDS on posts like you have mentioned OP and I’m so thankful for that 😂  People on here can tolerate r*pe subs, borderline pedo subs and zoophilia but draw the line at a subreddit that promotes women wanting better themselves. They only see women as f*ckholes that they can abuse and use. Redditors hate female people except when we’re being sufficiently abused, humiliated and exploited by men.  And this is why men (and sadly many women) feel so threatened - because we talk about it. We motivate and help each other. We criticize the patrichary and how liberal feminism only benefits men.  Be strong girls, we’re doing everything right 🥰	0.843

As a gen Xer, I feel almost obligated to give this show a try. While there are moments of SATC-like satire, it's pretty cringey. Charlotte and Carrie are sooooo uptight and conservative. I couldn't stand Carrie's behavior following the sex scene. In general, she seems very needy which I get after losing her partner unexpectedly, but it's almost pathological her need not to be alone. Her friends just seem able to drop their lives for her and then she starts screeching at Miranda cuz of HER insecurities.   I digress. Personally, I found this sex scene hot. The chemistry was excellent and Sara/Che was and is 🔥. (I ignored Miranda and inserted myself.) I swerve hetero but good lawd. The light sheen of sweat on Che's forehead after their afternoon delite made me warm. I could not care less what any man might think of that scene. I give it four out four paws up.	0.843

I've looked through your post history. I mean this in the kindest possible way, but I strongly suggest that you take a break from dating/trying to meet men. This sub deals in tough love - we don't sugarcoat, we don't coddle and we don't enable self-destructive behaviors, but we DO strongly support women who take accountability and are actively working on overcoming negative patterns of behavior.   I felt defensive and called out when I first started reading this sub - but it was the kickstart I needed to stop making excuses for the crap men I let into my life and start making real positive changes. I'm sorry to hear that you left FDS before: it sounds as though you're not yet ready for the self-work that we recommend here. But if and when you do choose to come back, you will be very welcome.	0.841

You forgot something important, though: She needs to add her chores - cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping and so on and so forth and give them a value, too.

You sweet summer child, didn’t your mom ever teach you that there is a special room in your home where you can MAKE YOUR OWN FOOD?… The money that you pi$$ away eating out, I invest.	A guy I had been dating for maybe 3 months said if we were still together after a year I could move in with him. He talked about how his rent was fixed at about half of what I was paying for my rent, and I’d save so much money splitting with him. He eventually planned to buy the house he was renting. I said nope, I’ll never move into a man’s house and pay into his mortgage. Why put equity into his house especially if we break up, he keeps all that and I get nothing? Plus his house was shittier than my nice apartment and it was in an area of the city I was not interested in moving to. It would’ve been a total downgrade. If I’m gonna move anywhere with a man, it’s gonna be a place we both decided on, after dating for multiple years (I don’t want marriage) and an upgrade from my current living space.	0.728

Additionally, he’s helping the kids prepare something special for their mother, who wouldn’t have been able to do so without his help. Most children don’t have resources to celebrate the holidays for their single parent on their own, such as money or going to the store to shop for the gift or event, and this father realizes that and enables the children to do something special for their mother.	0.726

I've been waiting to talk about this season finale with someone who shares the same opinion. I am so shocked by everyone is happy that Lawrence and Issa are back together. They've been toxic from the beginning. I agree with all your sentiments. I really would've loved to see how Issa could have found love within herself and kept scaling her business. You don't always NEED a man. It's okay just being a woman in the world. That is enough.   I went back and forth with someone over how Lawrence is trash and it just appalls me how no one is seeing the signs. He's done nothing to even earn Issa's love all season. All they have done is play phone tag and at the end settle for one another saying "If you believe it will work, it will work". I'm tired. I'm tired of these messages being shown to black women about trusting in struggle love. Love isn't that hard.   Hell, Nate isn't all that either but at least he is self aware, supported Issa in her business ventures, and tried to open up to the possibility of healthy relationship but could see she was still stuck over Lawrence. I'm glad he got away from Issa and her toxic web.   Kelli is the star of the show. She really does need her own spinoff. I'd be hilarious and she'd be giving us that REALNESS.	0.764

She dodged a bullet 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into 😭 I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	gee OP - it's not worth the hassle on reddit. of course you didn't do anything wrong but it's a witch hunt. they want to silence women down because they know we are right.	0.747
Omg this is giving me flashbacks to age 22. Good for this girl! I wish I’d had the guts to stick up for myself at her age.   Back then I was with my ex that would rest his head on my stomach while fingering me, acting like he was bored so I’d say forget it. 4+ years together and he made me cum less than 10 times lol. The same guy also couldn’t understand how not all women cum from penetrative sex… he said to me “it worked for all my ex’s, so I’m not the problem” 😭😩😤	Yeah it’s more like monkey branching, I knew of a guy who was separated from his wife for 15(!) years - don’t know how many girls he got with that ‘separation’ clause, he got his divorce finalized after meeting me- but I kind of lost my respect for him with the idea of only finalizing divorce when you get another person to hop on right away. A good example I saw ( but in a series, Good Girls Revolt), that the HVM hubby gets attracted to another girl, also the lifestyle he was leading was frustrating his wife, he does not say anything to that girl he is attracted to, but he goes to his wife and mentions he would like to get a divorce , it clearly shows he identified their marriage was not working for them anymore, he would like to close this chapter and only then bring forward a new commitment. It clearly showed how respectful he was to himself, his choices and also to the people who are and will be in his life.	0.874

Don’t think that avoidants live the hermit lifestyle and have no friends as some of the comments here are saying - I met and even unfortunately dated many avoidants who had flourishing careers, had a solid group of male friends, and were close with their family.   In my opinion, the defining attribute of avoidants is love bombing you at the beginning and then pulling away once they have you/realize that you have fallen for them. Sometimes you don’t need to even fall for them, they naturally pull away after dating for a month because going on more than 5 dates is too serious for them and they feel trapped 🙄  My advice would be to keep your guard up and don’t get too attached too quickly. You’ll see their mask fall off within a month.	0.863

My ex had herpes and when talking about a 4some was talking about a lack of condom use because "i already have the worst one" and would shrug. (Yes I ran)  Then we end up needing biopsies, getting cervical cancer, dying, needing LEEPs and operations. We pay the price.

He was overweight, short, balding, and he was nice at first but then got super douchey.  And good lord was I a pickme.  I had to avert my eyes when we had sex because I just didn’t want to see his giant belly.  And guess what!? He cheated on me with another queen of the pickmes!!!!!  They are married now but he wanted a girl to stay home and be barefoot in the kitchen and that ain’t me sister.  I’ve seen a few pictures of him now and thank god I dodged that bullet.  Wanna know one of the reasons he said it wasn’t working out? I am 5’10” and my height made him self conscious.	0.857

We weren't friends with her, just acquaintances. But we still knew about him from past interactions. When multiple women confide that your boyfriend (of 2 months) has been inappropriate, you believe them!  Since all of us were single, and she was only friends with coupled women, she was probably mateguarding.	0.848
As an Israeli-American woman, I'm torn tbh. If he owes the money, he should pay up. As would the woman were she the higher earner. But to bar him from ever leaving the country? Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	Oh yeah, 100%! We should have higher standards than the bare minimum I outlined, it’s just that they can’t even meet the bare minimum hence why we need to employ so many vetting strategies. It’s absolute BS. If they just stopped being so selfish, they would even have nice lives and relationships. Instead, they would rather use and abuse women, suffer shallow lives and then blame women for it. It’s insane. And so sad.	0.787

Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	Being a man of "simple pleasures" sounds like his way of saying that she shouldn't complicate his mooching with talks of rent or other financial contributions.   Sounds like the type of dude to claim that her asking for rent is going to "complicate things". As in, he'll actually have to pay his way, and he doesn't like that.	0.781

Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	Dating will definetly jeopardize my life in more ways than one. Getting married to a NVM (and divorced) ruined any potential career I could have had. I have my own small business and I'll be able to live off of other streams of income, but it's still a bummer. Even if I found a man who wanted to pay for everything, they often pressure you to not work and not have your own finances, or just interrupt your work life constantly with their emotional bs.  I can't stress this enough: build up your own world so fully that you notice immediately when a date wouldn't fit into it.	0.778

I'm actually a bit peeved at the moment because going by votes, apparently people think I agree with the idea that a woman owes a man sex for paying for her meal?  But let's be honest, guys who suggest walk dates have no interest in "getting to know" the woman they're with. I stand by my comment that it's a shit test.	0.775

Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	I agree strongly with all of this!! OP, I think you’ve spent enough time being financially abused that your conceptual norms have been screwed with. At least in the US, which I’m guessing you are, it would be SO bizarre for someone you were just getting to know to pry into really anything about your finances. “I own my home” can mean anything from living paycheck to paycheck with the mortgage, to having it completely paid off. Being financially stable is a badass accomplishment… but also not anyone’s business but yours.  Anyone you might date has absolutely no business knowing about your savings or financial setup overall until you were perhaps discussing getting engaged, I’d say. There’s so much vetting you would do along the way, and if someone starts to try to pry into your private information, that’s a flag.  Even if I’m bragging a little with close long-term friends, I’m only going to say things like “yeah, my retirement savings are on track, that’s pretty cool” or “I’m paying some extra principal on my mortgage, happy about that”.	0.773
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	Why should women have sex with men if said men don't know how to have sex is the basic question i keep asking	0.779
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	It's such a weird argument, too. If we all are, then why would women ever have sex with men? And if they say this, they can't ever complain that women don't fuck them either. It's just a lost argument from the start	0.761
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	It is not love if you don't get to know the other person on a deep level. It is just lust and maybe familiarity. But why would a person who is married allow themselves to become familiar with someone who isn't their spouse? If the other person is a friend, you basically have shifted your mindset to see them as a friend, like the way a sibling is a "friend". If they see you as a potential date, they are already looking outside their marriage to fulfill something that they think their marriage is lacking, and because they don't know you that well, they are just chasing figments. In the end, if they get together with you after having made you the cause of their marriage breaking down (by saying that they fell in love with you) it is likely that they will become equally as dissatisfied with you and look elsewhere. Usually the issue is not the person they are with, the issue is they are deeply dissatisfied with themselves and are looking for external validation.  There are very rare cases, I am sure, where a marriage breaks down without animosity and the man leaves the wife for a woman that he spends the rest of his life with and the second marriage is happy. But this depends on circumstances. Some people marry very young and have children but are unable to grow together, instead they grow apart and stay together for the children... and then while they are doing this (with the best intentions) they meet someone else. It's possible.  Being married is a state of being. When you uncouple, it takes a year or two for your mindset to change. You take time to rediscover yourself outside of the marriage. So anyone that is still in a marriage or fresh out of a marriage comes with the baggage of the ex or soon-to-be ex. If you get into a relationship with someone like this, you are also getting into a relationship with the ex.  That's my opinion anyway. Feel free to add.	0.746
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	I’m sure he felt the exact same way for his girlfriend at some point, but he was **grooming you by making you feel special**. I’m not saying you’re not special, I’m saying that the way a man feels about a woman is often way more about the type of man he is than about the type of woman she is. Any woman who’s fresh pussy pining for him outside of his relationship would be “special”,  because it makes him feel desired. It’s not about you, it’s about his ego. I’m sorry this is harsh, but it’s the truth. It doesn’t take much to get along with a man, especially if he’s using you.  As long as you believe you are somehow much more special than other women (or you desperately want to believe you are better or desperately want to be better), you will fall prey to grooming and lovebombing.  To reiterate: you are special and deserving of love, but no more than his girlfriend (unless she is somehow a really LVW and a total pickme, but she’s not the one getting involved with a committed man and hoping he leaves his girlfriend…).  You are a victim of a misogynistic culture, raised to believe that a man saying you’re special is some kind of prize. Everything from music to movies to proverbs grooms women to this type of behaviour.  Who needs to be special is him, sis. You already are, and so is his girlfriend most likely. He’s proven to be the opposite of special. He’s ordinary, a LVM.  This is a simple case of… you don’t need to be picked by a man and told you’re special. You need to pick a special man (not a committed cheater, for starters).  Don’t ask him to pick you over his girlfriend. You know what that makes you.  You will get over this, and hopefully spread the gospel of With An HVM, You Don’t Need To Compete With Another Woman.  HVM do not put you in a position to root and count the days until another woman’s life gets uprooted, her heart broken being left in shambles, betrayed and abused, facing possibly losing her house.	0.744
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it?

I would tell her to run far away!	0.732
Wow you definitely did the right thing. Any man who can't understand a lone woman locking their door in this situation isn't living fully in reality. His immediate aggression is an obvious sign he was up to no good. I've been the man in situations like that and my immediate response was to communicate the situation without aggression if it was important enough and to make sure i was being as nonthreatening as possible. Cuz I'm 200+ pounds and bearded i already look crazy 😆 in any case just to add to the tip about the window. Don't roll it down even a crack. Once closed it creates a sort of seal that strengthens the integrity of the glass. Cracking the window weakens that some in case he tried to strike the window.            edit: That sounds like something I've read about as a tactic for human traffickers.	Unfortunately too another point I’d like to add (unless I missed it) but never stay in your car for extended periods especially to text or to finish up a song. Men prey on this and watch for this because you become more vulnerable as you’re distracted and sitting in one place. It’s best to be in and out as fast and alert as possible.   I would have been too scared to get the food but good instinct to not go and roll down your windows. I would have ran the man over tbh	0.826

This is the thing I can’t stand on this sub. There’s vetting men and being careful, and then there’s assuming every man is lying about everything, and that every woman is an idiot for believing a word they say. That’s not a healthy way to live and you’ll never find a healthy relationship that way. I don’t need to justify my description of someone else’s relationship to anyone. He did not describe it as abuse, I did.	0.824

She's sending the message that even if a guy is extremely violent and dangerous towards women, women may still forgive them. This isn't a good thing.   I think she decided to married him as she thinks it'll be impossible for her to find love with a disfigured face and saw him as "the best option available". Yes, I know a lot of women cannot stand the thought of never finding love, but how can you trust men (especially the one who attacked you) after such a violent acid attack?	0.819

I will repeat myself- we should not look at each other as competition, that does not benefit us. Tearing a woman down does not add value to you. Have each other’s back. I had a friend who would tell my most personal problems to her boyfriend (whom I didn’t like at all). I cut her off and never looked back. What’s the circle of this? She tells him, he tells his bros, his bros spread it to their bros, and everyone ends up knowing. Suddenly, you’re vulnerable to strangers who can be real predators.	0.816

I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	>I’ve actually been thinking of making a similar post, but from a different angle, so I’ll add to your post  Please make this post! Although you might need to make another subreddit for childless women in order to get an actually civil and nuanced conversation. I am so disappointed by the commenters....	0.737
I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	Yup. When I “criticized” my exes, they either 1) gaslight me, by repeating “I doN’T undErsTaNd” when I was being clear or 2) pretend they “got it” only to make a hurtful comment about me (personal attacks that had nothing to do with our relationship) to get back at me/punish me for calling them out on their behaviour. 3) give the silent treatment	0.732

Eww he probably does. I know a couple like that actually. The dude pays attention to everything she eats, how fast or slow she eats, and if she finishes her plate or not. He is obsessed with her losing weight.. and yea maybe she could, but he goes about it all wrong and isn't supportive.  Anyway.... the couple in the post just sound so bizarre..	In the time he took to type all that he could literally have looked up a restaurant and called to make dinner reservations.  They're doubling down on this nonsense out of pure stubbornness because it's actually taking *more* effort for him to be a cheap scrote than to just... plan a date.   Imagine taking all that time to match with a woman then spend all your energy arguing with her why she's not worth a proper date. Way to cockblock yourself, my dude, but you do you, I guess.	0.83

Imagine the frothing rage this post has incited in lurking scrotes. And yet they know it's absolutely true for 'The One'. Meanwhile, they think they're entitled to a mommy bang maid until they find her. And "She Better by God bring something to the table!" When a man asks you what you bring to the table, he already has contempt for you.	0.801

This read as icky to me too. Divorced coparents  usually get gifts for the child to give, but the breakfast making is excessive. It feels like a boundary cross. Like as a single mama, it would be weird for him to be in my home making me breakfast(even if it’s for the kid)  Also: would you really date a man that goes to his ex’s to cook for them?  From both sides, id never let my ex do that, and would dump a man if he was that excessive with his ex.	0.799

I just think there’s so many flakes out there that the bar is so low for men, so even just normal communication is seen as amazing by some women because they aren’t used to it. And he’s exploiting that. It’s just gross.	0.79

At this point i am asking more than that tho and you should be too. Men want you to make them feel good, treat them well, do their dishes after you cooked them dinner, ruin your body with their offspring AND give them a blowjob at the end of the day. The least they can do is not enough.	0.789
That takes the cake! NYE first time date?GTFOH that only happens in cheesy rom com movies lol. These new OLD dudes be getting lamer and lamer, trying to mack hard without running coins (because we all know there are hella "free" events to do on NYE).	We don't even have time to let them exploit our vulnerabilities! Because we laugh at their face at the idea of drink dates so fast haha  May FDS continue to bless more women and cast the light on pickmeishas for forever to come. I used to be pickme too, and I'm so grateful to be here.	0.804

These new OLD dudes be getting lamer and lamer, trying to mack hard without running coins (because we all know there are hella "free" events to do on NYE).	I let the men worry about timelines and how to lock me down. My only goal is to show up with queen energy and enjoy myself on dates with men who meet my vetting standards. When I'm exuding hedonistic, take-it-or-leave-it energy, and the men are investing time/resources/effort into me without sex, they naturally ask for commitment within 1.5-2 months or they filter themselves out of the running. The combo of being a ruthless vetter and strategic hedonist makes dating fun and carefree because it sets up a natural dynamic of the man being the 'planner'.   > I know people who 'date' the same commitmophobe for months, without any perspective of getting a relationship. I know people who date expats who'll certainly move back abroad within two years.  This guys wouldn't get through a basic fds filter. Men are either planning with you or playing with you, and their actions will reflect that.	0.775

I feel like, after the latest maybe 25ish (but realistically younger than that), the sex with as many people as possible should get kind of old… I just don’t understand this new “thrill” that even cheaters talk of. Want some excitement in your life? Try something new! Go travelling to a new place, study for a new career, open a business, sky dive, become a sky dive teacher, learn to scuba dive, go trekking somewhere, go to a theme park, paragliding, swim with sharks, ANYTHING! But their obsession with conning as many women into sex to dominate and prove their manliness, is kind of psychopathic imo.	0.774

I check my phone while watching movies (not in the theater though), that’s just how I always watch tv. It annoyed my ex who would constantly scream “watch the movie!” or “what just happened?! Did you see it?!” I never had trouble following the plot and it was so annoying having him quiz me to prove I can’t multitask. I knew better than him what was going on. Idiot.	0.77

I agree that there is an attack on HVM and HVW by the media, and I don't care about your love for the 2002 Spiderman either.   All I'm trying to show you is that the majority who read your post aren't taking you seriously because you presented a poor argument since you haven't even watched the movies and you're basing everything you're writing on superficial first impressions of compilation clips on YouTube.  I honestly wish you wrote up an analysis of movies or TV shows you have actually watched. We would have all enjoyed the critique.  For example, I would have compared the early 2000s Spidermans to other popular LVM TV shows that came about in the late 2000s like Mad Men, Californication, Shameless, Sons of Anarchy. Shows that appeal to LVM and implant in their minds images that successful rich men are cheaters and that women should put up with LV broke scrotes.  The recent Spiderman movies are TAME compared to the filth being promoted to men on TV in the late 2000s.   Tbh, Peter and MJ in the 2020s Spiderman are really awkward and cute (as they should be, they're kids in the middle of highschool) and I think Tom Holland is a positive example to young boys of how to be a HVM when you're just 15-16. He respects and treats MJ really well, he is attentive, a good listener, cares about her interests, respectful of her boundaries and looked for a good moment to get to know her better, and made a huge effort to make sure that he can confess that he likes her properly. It's all very age appropriate, and their relationship is only *just* beginning at the end of the second film.	0.769
