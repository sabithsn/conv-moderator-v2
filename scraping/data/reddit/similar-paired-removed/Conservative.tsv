No he conned them alright - he said he’s not mentally impaired or too old. He has done nothing and botched every single issue. He’s been unable to talk to any media and his handlers manage him. People assumes he’s Do the bare minimum and he’s proven he couldn’t even do that,	<p>His gameplan was to do nothing and then blame everyone else who acted, but he is supposed to be a leader. He never led. And he is not a conservative.</p>	0.851

Covid deaths for that same age group is 11,677.  660,000&gt;11,677.  I imagine if 60+ year olds fought all of our wars the death rate for those would be much higher as well.  And to preempt the inevetable &quot;YoU dOn&#39;T cArE aBoUt GrAnDmA&quot;, yes I do, I am just smart enough to know that there is not really a comparison between a healthy and fit 25 year old being killed in combat to an 80 year old grandma at the end of her life being pushed over the edge by covid.</p>	0.802

Guys I can't keep up. We knew the virus wasn't real last year but now it's very real and deadly. Help please go Trumbo Brandon bad!	Your argument about the mutation of the virus etc is faulty because as of right now the information put out is far too politicized and is highly in question. Look at the total death count of the globe year after year and look at it now. It's on par.	0.859
Guys I can't keep up. We knew the virus wasn't real last year but now it's very real and deadly. Help please go Trumbo Brandon bad!	<p>You can say what you want, but this last election was extremely suspect, and nearly half the country believe it was affected by fraud in one way or another (including something like 20% of Democrats if I remember correctly). We can&#39;t have this happen again. All the new procedures that were put in place we&#39;re to address a once in a lifetime pandemic and in no way should be &quot;the new normal&quot; going forward. That makes no sense.</p>	0.85
Guys I can't keep up. We knew the virus wasn't real last year but now it's very real and deadly. Help please go Trumbo Brandon bad!	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.849

When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.88

Let me phrase it this way: Why aren’t you constantly scared of getting struck by lightning when you go outside? Because it’s *statistically unlikely*. That’s the exact reason why children shouldn’t be afraid of Covid. The average American child has a 0.0000048% chance of dying of Covid. Do you *really* think it’s reasonable to be scared of that?	0.872

To use myself as an example again, I have no say in my local school board despite having two children in the system.

I would agree that some skepticism of the Covid vaccine is understandable given its novelty, but to make a blanket statement that support of vaccines is tantamount to support of tyranny is ludicrous.

Listen she’s a gigantic piece of shit, but she was never charged with assaulting a police officer.	I got this far, and could tell you are not understanding me here at all.  A large STACK of MANY ballots all *exactly* the same, same markings, same choices made, not the normal paper, no folds,  no wear of any kind.  Like someone marked a ballot, and then proceeded to photocopy the ballot many times.  THIS is what supposedly happened.  I've no reason to think this woman lied in this sworn affidavit that has so far been ignored by these corrupt fucking judges.  She has been doing this for many years.  It's her career.  Why would she risk her job over this situation, just to make up some really odd claim about the ballots being ""unlike any she had ever seen before (in this long career), and exactly the same in every way?""	0.782

You're right, it's not political. Why are we putting those struggling with a mental disorder on pedestals while shooting down those that speak the truth?  Enabling those with such disorders instead of correcting them is doing them a disservice. They'll never know reality if everyone continues to cater to their fantasy.	<p>I was really hoping to have a valid debate with someone that might have some useful insight, but all you have done is insult, bring zero valid points to the debate, and be a hypocrite. I hope in the future you actually think more before you post. If you really want people to &quot;turn from their evil Republican ways,&quot; maybe you should consider giving them a legitimate reason to do so. Badgering and insulting while being a hypocrite will turn people away from your ideology, not bring them closer.</p>	0.865

Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p><em>The United States government shipped an average of approximately 100,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies per week across July and August. The Administration will increase the average weekly pace of shipments of free monoclonal antibody treatment to states by a further 50% in September, continuing to accelerate the federal government’s efforts to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 treatment. Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. As hospital systems experience increased COVID-19 cases, many have identified monoclonal antibody treatment as a key tool to improve health outcomes, prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on overburdened hospitals.</em></p>	0.876

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn’t tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous. Interested to hear your thoughts assuming anyone actually replies.</p>	0.871
I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.

I support contraceptives, but I don’t think I should have to pay for other people’s contraceptives. As an example, I like to go shooting and use guns recreationally. This activity has certain risks; you can seriously injure or kill yourself or others, permanently affecting their life. Because of this, it’s best for all people who want to go shooting for fun to take firearm safety courses and perform safe gun practices such as locking their guns and ammo away. However, I believe that it is MY responsibility to do these things. No one else is obligated to buy (or subsidize) ammunition or a gun safe or gun locks for my guns. I don’t think others should have to pay for a gun safety course for me, either. I am responsible for safety, and others shouldn’t have to fund these safety measures for me. Public funds shouldn’t be used for my individual firearm hobby. In the same vein, public funds shouldn’t be used for people’s sexual shenanigans. It’s each individual’s responsibility to stay safe. If you can’t afford to buy a gun lock, you shouldn’t be using a gun for fun. In the same way, if you can’t afford to buy contraception, you shouldn’t be having sex for fun.	0.848

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	0.895

From what I’m getting, it seems like you’re implying that kids who grow up without a father are more likely to be violent, which is just patently untrue.</p>	0.846

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	<p>Israeli breakthrough has also substantially changed especially when they actually study the population as a hole and not just healthcare workers.  Jerusalems hospital had a caseload of 72 patients - not a lot, but 72 hospitalization 85% of them were vaccinated and they have continued to see this trend.  4 days ago - of all the severe cases in Israel 324 total, 209 were fully vaccinated. So you are telling me they are not the ones spreading it - but are the cohort that is getting the worst symptoms at this time. The situation is fluid, just like this virus - which is why the statistics, Israel&#39;s game plan, and CDC changes its mind with the wind. Months ago they said Pfizer dropped transmission rate by 90% last week the CDC said it&#39;s as likely to spread and is showing the same viral load. The data is incomplete, its fluid,  and it&#39;s that simple. Cognitive dissonance is a thing whether you consider what I said to be a concise zinger or not.</p>	0.863

Literally every other respiratory prodome. We have upper respiratory virus panels available at every hospital. Take a guess how often they get used? Almost never because knowing what virus it is doesn&#39;t change the treatment, which is mostly supportive. Those panels are most helpful in determining if there is a upper respiratory infection, which they also have an absolute terrible time doing. So in essence, short of being on a ventilator with ground glass lungs, you cant really know that you even had covid. Sure, theres a tremendous spike in cases of severe respiratory failure due to covid, that we know. However determining if this specific patient has covid or not is a lot more vague, because as I said, issues with testing and all. Even if we say that 95% of people sick had covid, there&#39;s 5% that didnt (which is probably underestimating how many didn&#39;t). So as a result, we are left guessing. Yes heard immunity kicks in at ~70 percent, but we&#39;re not there yet. There&#39;s a lot of evidence showing that antibodies fade quickly to covid for whatever reason. Being sick with it gives better protection than the vaccines, but both have their challenges.</p>	0.832

If a woman receives an abortion, it’s only counted as 1 instance, but women often receive multiple of the other items in one visit. Multiple services shouldn’t be weighted heavier when done in the same visit. If I am a doctor at planned parenthood and I’m seeing 2 patients today: Patient 1 received a pregnancy test, an abortion, and prescribed medicine. Patient 2 received a Pap smear and an hpv vaccine.  This is considered 5 total services. By the 3% logic. Your clinic only performs 20% abortions. Even though half the women visiting today received an abortion, we’re going to report it as 1/5 total services.	0.828

How is Biden going home on the weekend worse than Trump's 100+ trips to Mar-a-Lago and other resorts he owns where visitor logs are not maintained? Which one sounds more corrupt?	<p>Trump apparently wrote off $2.2 million in property taxes for his family compound, “Seven Springs,” in Westchester County, N.Y., as a business expense. But the property has been a family home since Trump bought it in the mid 1990s. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have talked about spending their summers there, doing whatever Trump kids do. Even the Trump organization’s website lists Seven Springs as “a retreat for the Trump family.” Calling a home a “business” solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people “working from home” during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.</p>	0.799

How is Biden going home on the weekend worse than Trump's 100+ trips to Mar-a-Lago and other resorts he owns where visitor logs are not maintained? Which one sounds more corrupt?	<p>The main thing Mitch and other Republican Senators want is Trump out and unable to ever hold office again. By voting to &quot;remove&quot; him from office either during or after he is in office, they can say he isn&#39;t able to hold office again and so he&#39;d essentially be out of Politics and out of the GOP more importantly. This will also revoke his lifetime checks of 200k per year, his $1million a year travel stipend, and and Secret Service detail.</p>	0.797
How is Biden going home on the weekend worse than Trump's 100+ trips to Mar-a-Lago and other resorts he owns where visitor logs are not maintained? Which one sounds more corrupt?	<p>It&#39;s all semantics, anyway. Working-class Joe Normal paying his mortgage, bringing the family to visit Mickey down in Orlando or buying a set of bargain-basement tires for his SUV would spend more than the target amount in one transaction. As it has been said numerous times in this message thread; this is probably a bait-and-switch by the federal government to lowball the American taxpayers so that when they finally &quot;settle&quot; on a value of $5,000 or $10,000 in annual transactions it won&#39;t seem terribly oppressive by comparison.</p>	0.797
How is Biden going home on the weekend worse than Trump's 100+ trips to Mar-a-Lago and other resorts he owns where visitor logs are not maintained? Which one sounds more corrupt?	> Trump apparently wrote off $2.2 million in property taxes for his family compound, “Seven Springs,” in Westchester County, N.Y., as a business expense. But the property has been a family home since Trump bought it in the mid 1990s. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have talked about spending their summers there, doing whatever Trump kids do. Even the Trump organization’s website lists Seven Springs as “a retreat for the Trump family.” Calling a home a “business” solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people “working from home” during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.	0.795

However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous.

Common errors in comments are ignoring that conservative judges have dismissed the election-based lawsuits on the merits.  Why is that?	<p>Just answer me this, do you think the election was stolen? If so, where is your evidence? If you don&#39;t have any, why do you think that in the first place? I form my own opinions, I don&#39;t just repeat Republican/Democrat talking points. Gina Carano wasnt fired because she believed in small government, she was fired because she spewed anti-mask, anti-vax garbage, and then got mad when she was criticized for it.</p>	0.843
Common errors in comments are ignoring that conservative judges have dismissed the election-based lawsuits on the merits.  Why is that?	On the topic of Dominion, a lot of people are claiming Dominion cheated the election and their software helped Biden win the election. Two problems with this theory. (1) If Dominion actually cheated, they 1,000,000% wouldn't have sued Sidney Powell et al. because now discovery will force them to provide evidence of guilt. Guilty parties don't sue for defamation because truth is an absolute defense. (2) They are entirely ignoring another voting machine company, ES&S, which was used in the states where Mitch Mcconnell and Lindsay Graham won. [These races were incredibly suspect.](https://www.dcreport.org/2020/12/19/mitch-mcconnells-re-election-the-numbers-dont-add-up/) Read that article because it's a great piece of *actual* reporting with legitimate facts, not the garbage spewed out by the MSM. [In fact, ES&S has a history of shady dealings and they're used almost entirely in red states.](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-market-for-voting-machines-is-broken-this-company-has-thrived-in-it) This has been the issue since (I believe) at least 2012. But there wasn't a single peep about these machines throughout all of these lawsuits.	0.838

I tried to think of some smart ass post to get upvotes. After that, I just stared at my phone for 5 minutes. This isn't even funny anymore; it's dangerous. Who would have thought that massive advances in technology and accessibility would lead us towards a new dark age of ignorance? It's hard to be optimistic in a world shared with people like this, to whom words like fact, proof and evidence no longer mean anything other than what they want them to.	<p>I forgot that in the days where $3.5 Trillion costs nothing, we might as well test someone for everything it could possibly be (never mind the cost! Remember it costs nothing if it&#39;s paid by taxpayers). Rather than narrow down the problem by potentially offending them by asking if they were born with one set of organs or another.</p>	0.809

So, I see the comedy, but this is an instance where I think pointing out this woman as trans is mean.   She isn't fucking up women's sports.

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	<p>Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us. I’m also wondering if they’ll turn it into a yearly thing.</p>	0.845

But if it’s trump , trump jr or anyone who appears extreme, people are going to play it safe and stick with Biden	As far as DeSantis, I hope conservatives wake up and choose him over Trump, if Trump does run.

His old personal lawyer is convicted of a crime, his new personal lawyer was just suspended from practicing law, and the political future of his old Vice President—who has solid conservative credentials—has effectively been pushed out of the Republican Party because he opted to not unilaterally void the electoral college results and instead followed the process that’s been in place and codified in law in this country for well over 100 years.	0.843

During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.

Because of that, the party affiliation of any judges who looked at cases (when they didn’t dismiss them on standing, as happened in the vast majority of cases) didn’t matter.	Liberals judge the book by it's cover. ""Undocumented immigrants that live in the city get to vote, too."" They don't open that book that shows all of the flaws of this logic. It's one of the main problems that liberals have to overcome to recognize that the Democratic party is full of two-faced pieces of shit. Don't get me wrong, politicians from all sides of the aisle are the same, but Democrats and other leftists generally do not think about the consequences of irresponsible fiscal, cultural and political choices. On the surface, all left-leaning policy is well-intentioned, but sadly most politicians use those ""feel good"" talking points to convince people to do things to achieve different goals, such as more control, ballot harvesting, more taxation (therefore more spending on contractors that give kickbacks to politicians).	0.87

Just give me some actual hard evidence. All I am seeing is people who were told the election was rigged, so they believed the election was rigged, and they will listen to anyone who says anything in defense of that, but they won’t listen to anyone who has anything to say against that. People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn’t change the outcome. For there to be some large scale conspiracy, they would have to get past the same people who have been volunteering their precious time for years just because they believe in the power of democracy.	<p>FACTS are most important right now, not bias.  This prosecution is drowning, they have nearly no facts that help prove their case.  The liberal media is intentionally trying to convince people that Kyle is losing, so when he gets not guilty they immediately claim RACISM and PATRIARCHY and FASCIST and all the other nonsense they like to say when they don&#39;t agree with something.  The prosecution has been a disaster, every single STATE witness helped the defense&#39;s case in one way or another.

On the topic of Dominion, a lot of people are claiming Dominion cheated the election and their software helped Biden win the election. Two problems with this theory. (1) If Dominion actually cheated, they 1,000,000% wouldn't have sued Sidney Powell et al. because now discovery will force them to provide evidence of guilt. Guilty parties don't sue for defamation because truth is an absolute defense. (2) They are entirely ignoring another voting machine company, ES&S, which was used in the states where Mitch Mcconnell and Lindsay Graham won.

If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents.

Just like the right wing media calls any democrat a socialist…. Dude the answer is not to double down on extremism, it’s to meet in the middle. Ever consider that the media doesn’t actually control people’s beliefs, but people just don’t like trumps politics and thought he did a poor job as president ? But yes, if the Republican nominee continues to push the big lie that the election was stolen , the swing voters and those in the middle will be turned off by that shit	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.91

We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies. Just face that your guy lost and he lost without honor because he’s a conman. Grow up and face reality	But when you have thousands if not tens of thousands of people crossing across from the border during a pandemic, I am very scrupulous on the situation just adding people when there is an issue at had (not so much at the moment in regards to COVID -- COVID cases are very high but as evolution kind of does its thing to viruses, their evolutionary trajectory tends towards higher transmissibility but dampened infectious effects on the hosts it infects -- I'm the only one in my house who didn't get it and I'm out a lot working 2 jobs, I got vaccinated and have a robust daily vitamin regiment while I have a health complication making me at risk) but this has been going on when COVID was doing a damaging number on people (infected and killed two family members of mine, one old (grandpa) one young (29 y/o cousin).	0.805

Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms. Turns out if you run a coordinated 4 year propaganda campaign to make someone into Hitler 2.0 and have all intelligence agencies feeding disinfo to fuel the flames the enthusiasm can be outsourced. Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes. Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government. Plus there was only a couple dozen of them vs tens of thousands of Trump rioters at the Capitol.	0.864

Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"	Look, the left had the motive (they equated trump to Hitler throughout his term, and when your opponent is Hitler, cheating is justified) and they had the opportunity via mail in voting. That combined with the 4 year media hatchet job, combined with the Russia investigation with more and more evidence that too was an unfounded hatchet job, combined with reports of overseers being ejected from polling stations, combined with the &#39;system glitches&#39; in Michigan and California that &#39;accidentally&#39; handed victories to Democrats that actually lost, combined with the suspect nature of Biden getting more votes than elvis and the Beatles combined, combined with the MSM dismissing any claims of irregularities just as fast as they dismissed literally every one of Trump&#39;s achievements, and even a reasonable fellow could see how some, im not saying myself, but some, could feel a little uneasy about the validity of the election. Not to mention in the time between the election and the, ahem, &#39;attempted insurrection&#39; (cue eye roll emoji), we had all the liberal talking heads talking about reprogramming and reeducating all of Trump&#39;s voters, labeling 70 plus million Americans as racist and ignorant, and prominent figures on the left talking about a Nixonesque &#39;enemies list&#39;, well, suffice to say while i dont condone the actions of the capital rioters, i could see where their misplaced rage was coming from. I dont think anyone is questioning your conservative bona fides for not agreeing with said rioters actions, but perhaps for summarily dismissing their concerns, because thats what the leftists have done and continue to do.

Too bad you guys abandoned your Oath when it really mattered.	I really think that inflation isn't just a negative side effect of left-wing politics, it's a feature. They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don't know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we're too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.	0.836

U know trumps team created it right?

I’m so confused do y’all think the vaccine was promoted to be a magical armor that stops u from getting covid? If you have the vaccine your more likely to survive it’s that simple y’all can’t be that clueless?	<p>Vaccines are an amazing development of modern medicine. I would agree that some skepticism of the Covid vaccine is understandable given its novelty, but to make a blanket statement that support of vaccines is tantamount to support of tyranny is ludicrous. If there’s any hope to beating the left it’s to be the more rational side of the political spectrum, not to be equally ridiculous but in a different direction.</p>	0.858

Side with caution *and* take the vaccine? You would rather take a brand new unproven vaccine with unknown possible long-term side effects *and* still have a chance to get Covid and still suffer side effects from that, although (supposedly) less than what you would get if you weren't vaccinated than to take your chances of never getting Covid at all and never having to deal with any side effects from either?	0.844

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%.

US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported.

I was curious and found a paper that looked at crime rates in Texas from 2012-2018 and it looks like illegals are much more likely to not commit crimes than legal and domestic individuals. That is across the board regardless of type of crime (violent crimes, arson, drugs, etc).

In fact I would say they were one of the most aggressive countries in Europe at that time.  I think if Germany hadn't gotten involved in this crisis it would have been better for everybody.	0.714

Many Germans to this day will obfuscate how much support the nazi party had in Germany with irrelevant tidbits like “Hitler was Austrian” (yes and he became German and Germany supported him) or “many Germans weren’t officially Nazis” (neither was Eva Braun, Germany still supported Hitler)	0.711

They&#39;ve already got you by the balls in every conceivable way. You think that because you have a gun they are afraid of you?

LOL, she should have fled the country like Cruz.   There is another headline that she was “dining maskless”. Yeah… nobody requires masks while you are eating not even NYC. LOL, their target audience isn’t smart enough to pick up on that though.	<p>But as a business, I think that just taking precautions to help people stay a little further apart and doing your best to prevent infection spread should be enough. I think alienating people on this basis is just unwise. I think that there’s been very few clusters (comparatively) proven to have originated in restaurants like this. If it originates in a restaurant, it’s because a massive party of people drinking and fucking in bathrooms spread while they danced and screamed in close proximity to each other. Applebee’s probably wouldn’t be responsible for a single cluster even if it operated as usual.</p>	0.831

Let that guy turn part of his parking lot into an outdoor seating so he can keep his business.  And with everything down, social activity stopped, and people got tired of not seeing friends.

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?  Since 2018 there has been 92 school shootings in the USA, that number would likely be higher too if a lot of learning wasn’t done remote due to covid.  We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok. Oddly 2020 had relatively few mass shootings, so gun control was mostly ignored in the news and debates.</p>	0.856

If less ppl die when they’re vaccinated as opposed to those that aren’t.

The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.894

Also Twitter-tards are authorized to override opinions of medical professionals that have more credentials than lord Fauci.	<p>Do you understand what the job of a vaccine is? It isn’t to ensure your 100% survival. That’s a fantasy. There is no such thing as 100%. Even the best medical procedures aren’t 100%. Even the best bullet proof vests don’t stop all bullets. Only fucking idiots like yourself think it’s all of nothing. It’s not- it’s a spectrum of protection. </p>	0.857

No it wasn’t who ever said that? It’s supposed to stop deaths and hospitalizations and guess what it’s done? Covid isn’t going away because we didn’t stop it quick enough. Y’all are so uninformed yet so confident it’s scary	It&#39;s their own decision to get it but the risk is essentially null, and the more that don&#39;t get it the longer this goes on. I&#39;m tired of masks and mandates and restrictions too and they would go away if so many people weren&#39;t getting hospitalized for Covid.

You still haven’t retracted your initial false statement that the variants are being caused by mutation inside vaccinated people; that might happen eventually but the big variants going around now have not been caused by that and are still more dangerous than getting the vaccine.

It is perhaps to the Coalition's credit that they never entertained changing procedures to be less humane and more effective, but we are seeing play out in real life the conundrum posed by George Martin in the character of Tywin Lannister: his immense cruelty in doing anything to win can actually lead to more humane outcomes than can be delivered by softer hearted characters.	0.862

BILLIONS of people have received the vaccine without widespread complications. The materials used in the vaccine are incredibly pure 1) because it risks killing us if it isn&#39;t and 2) the process to develop it in a lab requires it to be.

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.  The important point here though is that no elected official should tell registered American citizens that they can't vote -- a basic and fundamental American right -- just 'cause they came from this or that "blue" state. FFS that woman is an embarrassment.	<p>With how the current state of politics and how far seperated we&#39;ve become, there&#39;s just no way we&#39;re going to meet on some middle ground, for any issue. It&#39;s time to finally acknowledge it, I know you all see it, but you need to accept it. Neither side is wrong on certain issues, but at the same time, both sides are wrong on multiple levels.

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>When covid first entered the scene and many people said it didn&#39;t worry them because side-effects appeared mild, others chimed in to say that we have to be cautious because we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. Why doesn&#39;t this rationale also apply to the vaccines? You can&#39;t test for something that happens years down the road regardless of how quickly you give it emergency authorization.</p>	0.879

I mean good gracious, imagine if Fauci said natural immunity is just as good or better than vaccine immunity, according to studies, and so those with natural immunity don’t need to worry about getting vaccinated…and then it turned out new studies reveal that’s not the case. People would be going off on how Fauci “lied” because he changed his position, and now he has blood on his hands (according to them) for lying about this. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t, there’s nothing sinister about being overly cautious though.	0.877

But in cases like with my uncle, being fully vaccinated did nothing. He still died from it. So if you feel you need the help then that&#39;s good but we need to stop acting like this vaccine is this amazing thing.

Whether someone gets the vaccine or not, it makes no difference to another person since they have an equal chance of contracting it from anyone, vaccinated or not.  The efficacy in reducing hospitalizations and severe illness is still there, meaning on a personal level people should consider taking it, but once again that is based on a person's individual risk assessment.

Here's a conspiracy theory for you, vaccines were made political to slow down your democratic country's response to the virus, consequently making it look like a less effective system of governance and diluting the blame of the viruses origins	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.853

So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it’s not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it’s built into the car.	<p>It is something that shouldn’t be a problem. For those in public office, taking that risk is ( as I said ) a part of the job but, secret ballot keeps average people from being put under the pressure of that risk. You will never totally eradicate criminal behavior. Robbery, rape and, murder are all illegal but, they all happen. </p>	0.81

It is perhaps to the Coalition&#39;s credit that they never entertained changing procedures to be less humane and more effective, but we are seeing play out in real life the conundrum posed by George Martin in the character of Tywin Lannister: his immense cruelty in doing anything to win can actually lead to more humane outcomes than can be delivered by softer hearted characters.</p>	0.754

I do believe most teachers want their students to learn and will be happy to teach those that seek knowledge, but I also believe that most teachers don't understand this themselves. I personally know someone who is responsible for issuing teacher certification and you wouldn't believe the math scores for these teachers who are teaching math. Then you have the ones who do understand it but don't see it as worth their time to teach those who have no interest in trying - they'd rather pass them off to next year's teacher.	0.814

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic).

But there’s a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place.

VERY different from what the US has been claiming about the vaccine, but does generally support the idea of the vaccine being a deterrent (except for hospitalization cases). Since there has def not been adequate amount of testing for long term side effects (can&#39;t speed up time, yet the fda somehow did for covid <em>cough cough political approval cough</em>) I still don&#39;t see this as being necessary for everyone to get, especially younger people. It&#39;s a solid idea for the older at risk population and only if they want it. The percent increases in benefits are pretty small considering vaccines are supposed to give you near 100% inoculation. </p>	0.881

I agree for most of that, but I think there is a higher standard because he’s a teacher. But that’s just another belief, so I guess if you want your teachers to be openly discriminatory, that’s fine.	Education certainly needs some reform, but we shouldn't be limiting the potential of high achievers in order to keep under achievers from falling further behind. Segregated classes based on material comprehension and cognitive ability is the best overall solution.	0.82

Not a good thing, but also something apolitical, and it’s a bad look on conservatives that we’re so up in arms about it.	It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.	0.864

The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It’s not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had.

I'm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

That's why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this ""They're the *real* racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if *we* did that?

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	One, the virus mutates because there is what's known as ""Leak By"". This is why there is a new Flu vaccine developed every year. The Flu vaccine does not ""kill"" the Flu virus, so it mutates. This is the same for the COVID  virus. If there was no Leak By, then the vaccine would kill the virus in a couple ""jabs"", and that would be it.	0.871

I get the annoyance about this but from a medical standpoint this isn't a surprise.  We have seasonal flu shots, it only makes sense that the COVID Vaccine was going to become somewhat seasonal with these viruses having the tendency to mutate/T-Cell immunity having a ""shelf-life"".  I'll likely get the booster shot on a yearly basis (I'm in the medical field so it'll probably get mandated for me sooner rather than later anyway) and I'll encourage my family to do that same.  I've got small kids and will likely hesitate to give them the vaccine if it is ever approved for their age range (2 and 4) simply because they are at such low risk from severe illness from it in the first place and I'll like to see how it effects the younguns that do get it for a couple years before I give it to my kids.	0.832

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.)

The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.894

We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>However, enforcement was a tricky subject. Any time a politician said we need to prosecute unregistered firearms hard and start throwing the book at them you would get pushback because that would disproportionately affect the black community. Historically, the government has found various ways to try to discourage minorities from legally owning guns in a way that rural whites never fully experienced, so there is some grounding there.</p>	0.847

I’m not sure on the constitutionality of impeaching a private citizen though it happened once before in 1876 because the Secretary of War resigned to try and escape consequence. People disagree with it now, but it’d be a bad precedent to set since it would essentially say a president can do whatever they want then resign or leave office to escape consequences.</p>	0.845

In fact the left began to attack him, because he didn't go to a democrat fundraiser. When is the last time John Voight or James Woods was on the silver screen? When is the last time we saw Lil Wayne get attention from the media? Only the last time they tried to shame him for supporting republicans. When is the last time that Terry Crews got attention from the media, or a gig? Again, only after he spoke out about how BLM was harboring a burgeoning black supremacist movement. They attacked him until he had no choice but to capitulate. Yet line-toeing Lebron James can smear and threaten citizens, and get movie deals, even if they are commercial failures.	0.825

This is a big part of why violent crime is exploding. No officer wants to be the next guy that politicians and the MSM are calling to be charged with murder cause they see someone acting suspiciously, the suspect pulls a knife, and the cop shot them. Additionally, it has completely drowned out any conversation about reform efforts that are actually needed, such as increased training/education, or meaningfully eliminating behavior like cops looking the other way for cops+friends of cops who are caught in low level offenses.</p>	0.855

I agree with the sentence reduction. The guy should never drive a semi again but a life sentence was too much.	Like I said on another post, I still like the idea of “thou shall not kill”. I think this principle should also apply to the state. Sure this illegal is a heinous person, and did awful things, but I think it would be better to stick him in an isolated cell 24/7 365, and just let him suffer for the rest of his life. IMO It would be a far worse punishment than a quick death.	0.85

Lincoln did not oppose slavery. He said if he could win the war without freeing any slaves he would do so. He said if he could win the war freeing only half the slaves he would do so.  He only freed the slaves in the South.	<p>I’ve never met a republican who wants to get rid of that pesky black vote, and yet if you listen to democrats, you’d think every one of us is clamoring to disenfranchise anyone with dark skin.  No, we just want secure elections.

We should be generous but firm. If you want to come here and work, great - there&#39;s nothing more American than having a dream and working for it. But if you want to bring cartel crap or cause other trouble here, GTFO. (And, yes, I did know more than a couple people who were a little too close to the cartels for my liking.) But above all, let&#39;s do it right - legally, with proper vetting, and with proper support once people arrive.</p>	0.787

Conservatives: “We’re not obsessed with AOC”  Also conservatives: “Breaking news… AOC is eating food!”	<p>From the White House website. Doesn’t really go into too much there either. Doesn’t blame covid or call it peaceful protests. They explicitly mention the economic mismanagement as part of the reason why and had even earlier in this Q&amp;A talked about how the US has exported chicken to feed the starving population. They are not trying to brush this under the rug and specifically call for democracy. They even mention that the Cuban Americans are the best bet to enact change. They are taking a hands off approach I would surmise, which is lame, and needs more pressure to get them to do better by Cuba. Again, nothing supports the cherry picking statements here. So link me to something that supports your viewpoint please, otherwise my point still stands.</p>	0.763

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since. I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren't wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.	0.884

Just a few key heavily-Democratic areas to push their State results over the edge for the Electoral College votes. But that doesn&#39;t affect Texas or Oklahoma&#39;s Senators. And the Senators in the contested States were already Democrat to begin with, their rigging couldn&#39;t have changed that outcome except to keep the Democrat seated there rather than having it flip the other way. Who is going to bat an eye and look at the details of an election if the Democrats win by 90% in an area when they typically win by 85%? If they stuff a few more thousand ballots in the box for either illegitimate voters or those that are registered but didn&#39;t submit a ballot, who is going to check since they run the election boards there?</p>	0.872

Use the “climate crisis” as a means to garner more control. They hate nuclear because it can actually solve fossil fuel dependency. So they get rid of it because they need to keep the crisis going.

The very first result when googling a living wage was a MIT calculator that breaks it down by county. Most major corporations use similar calculators for salary determinations when relocating folks. It’s nothing new. You say $70k is good for a family of four where you live. That is awesome. We can probably reduce your wages there. However, in most major metropolitan areas, that $70k is not a living wage for a family of four. People who work in the service industry in these areas simply can’t afford a normal life.	0.85

Boy you must be fun.	<p>We followed the science, so in a month or two when most of the population is vaccinated, Biden and every other taxpayer funded goon will have to take the pandemic off the table as a form of fearmongering and crowd control.  </p>	0.802
Because the majority of the modern world is now vaccinated and the majority of vaccines occured nearly a year ago now. How is this hard to understand?  So you have a child I assume now, or close to it. You're ok with a neighbor storing high explosives in their bedroom? No matter the quantity? You know enough to level your house with your wife and child in it? I assume you're not ok with enforcement of drinking and driving laws either.   Boy you must be fun.	Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us. I’m also wondering if they’ll turn it into a yearly thing.	0.801
Yeah but unlike most conservatives, she's vaccinated so you could've stopped there	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	0.799

Yeah but unlike most conservatives, she's vaccinated so you could've stopped there	<p>EDIT: Forgot to add this, but I understand the argument about already having gotten COVID, but the CDC and doctors and other medical experts have all said that getting vaccinated is still recommended for those who have had COVID. Do you trust your gut instinct that you don’t need the vaccine more than the medical experts?</p>	0.782
Yeah but unlike most conservatives, she's vaccinated so you could've stopped there	Barrett has shown that she is ok with state governments mandating vaccines. That isn't surprising, because state governments (and local governments underneath them such as school boards) have had vaccine mandates for around a century now. The Biden mandate is coming from the federal government though. Legally speaking, that's a completely different animal. I do understand that from your point of view, you probably see state vaccine mandates and federal vaccine mandates as being the same morally and politically speaking. But legally they are very separate. I would not be surprised if Barrett thinks federal vaccine mandates are unconstitutional despite her being ok with state vaccine mandates. See the 10th amendment.	0.778
Yeah but unlike most conservatives, she's vaccinated so you could've stopped there	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane. Let me guess, you’d welcome treating the common flu like we currently treat COVID, right?</p>	0.776

It's the same as Romney calling himself a ""conservative"". You all seem to hate that, but you can't stop him. There's no official ""Conservative"" group that's trademarked the term. I could wake up tomorrow, change nothing about my beliefs and put on a big, bright shirt that says, ""I'm a conservative and I love big government"".

It&#39;s simply not up for debate that conservatives today care more about being outraged at the liberals than actually having principles. This isn&#39;t the same movement my parents were a part of.

I am arguing that you would never have to hear of some high School track girl losing because someone else decided to change gender. Then that girl loses a scholarship. That would never be a scenario. Rather conservatives are insisting that you can’t change sex. Which is not something you’re going to get agreement from anyone left of center. This further ruins the conservative chances of winning a single vote of anyone who is transsexual and those who support this group. Wouldn’t it make more sense to support an argument that doesn’t make conservatives look ignorant?	0.815

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.893

They’ve worked with well-known conservatives in the past, and it’s gone fine.

She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	<p>business closures only work if you literally close everything, everywhere and limit peoples movement. the entire point was to make it so people had no reason to leave their homes, which doesnt work is you half ass it and have a population that doesnt follow it.. worked great at lowering transmission numbers and gave time for hospitals to get back under control in europe and everywhere else thats done it, when they didnt have everyone literally just running to the next state over to do their shopping, or go on holiday to florida and then come back and have everyone they know over for a house party.</p>	0.835

That's why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this ""They're the *real* racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if *we* did that? Just kidding we would never actually do anything to legitimize ourselves as a political threat to them, gib donations and socialism bad pls.	0.868
The well was poisoned before Nixon. LBJ's "great society" reforms were a cancer that could never be removed.  >So Democrats started appealing to city dwellers and did a good job of it.  Bribed. Replaced the father with government money, made large swathes of the population dependent on taxpayer dollars. Your dumbass daughter votes for Democrat because she wants handouts. You vote Democrat because you don't want to have to pay for your dumbass daughter, and so on.  It was a democrat strategy change that could be summed up with a LBJ quote:  **"I'll have those [removed] voting Democrat for 200 years."**	<p>People will blame corporate Democrats for pretending to pass the “progressive” agenda but scuttling it at the last moment.  However, I blame White House incompetence.  Everything this particular administration attempts ends up like rotten meat that fell behind a freezer.  And they then blame Trump.  CNN and MSNBC try to help the administration out by calling everyone white supremacists even when race isn’t involved.  The only “win” the administration can point to is the infrastructure bill that a lot of Republican Senators actually wanted.</p>	0.863

But we were already bailing them out with spending, why also give them tax cuts? Anyways, we will suffer the economic consequences of that decision in the coming years and I guarantee republicans are going to blame the biden administration when it was something he inherited.

Some of the most left leaning people I know will listen to it and actively defend it, portraying it as some kind of sexual liberation (specifically, with the dance associated with the genre, which is basically just grinding). I suppose that makes sense within the context, but how do you justify the lyrics? Some of the most widely revered tracks are <em>insanely dirty</em> and hell, one of the dirtiest duos here just sold out their concert in PR’s largest venue. It’s crazy.</p>	0.753

I&#39;ve also just taken extended leaves of absence to travel and do a couple thru hikes. I can acknowledge that I&#39;ve been incredibly lucky. And, frankly, I lucked into white tablecloth service in high school because a buddy&#39;s brother had a summer bussing job open up and then I got stupid lucky and that same job had an unusual amount of turnover of servers so, at 19, I was making $35+/hr while living at home (at my primary job; I then took a cafe job that was more like $18/he)</p>	0.738

Pete Buttigeig spent 2 moths ~~grooming~~ looking after his new adopted children.   That was A-OK though.	> Trump apparently wrote off $2.2 million in property taxes for his family compound, “Seven Springs,” in Westchester County, N.Y., as a business expense. But the property has been a family home since Trump bought it in the mid 1990s. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have talked about spending their summers there, doing whatever Trump kids do. Even the Trump organization’s website lists Seven Springs as “a retreat for the Trump family.” Calling a home a “business” solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people “working from home” during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.	0.675

Why would you have *fixations* on women? Is it because you're only used to dealing with people online, and actual human contact is difficult for you?	Smartphones, with social media or without, are addictive and when used constantly are not healthy for the human psyche. We need to be engaged in something productive or else we get pretty depressed, and allowing a piece of technology to consume so much of your time will ultimately make you only feel good when you're using it. Social media exacerbates this because it tends to make people believe it counts for social interaction AND it teaches people to base their entire self worth on what peoples crudest opinions are of them. People, and this does not only apply to children, will post the fakest version of themselves online in hopes that they are recognized for it and if it is received poorly they take it personally and if it gets a lot of likes they still know that it wasn't a truthful representation of themselves so they begin to hate their true self because they aren't this image that they created. There is no winning.	0.8

These are each just a single (or two individual) isolated antibody, disconnected from the immune system. Pour it into your veins and it will stick to any virus particle it recognizes.

When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

It’s interesting that TX SB8 171.208(j) provides that charges cannot be brought BY a rapist, but there isn’t anything in there specifically spelling out that a pregnancy due to rape/incest/assault is specifically excluded from charges. At least, I couldn’t find it. There are specific exclusions for medical emergencies.	0.838
Except abortion isn’t a “cause of death” because fetuses are not people.	Fourth, there was also no discussion regarding whether these results are clinically meaningful. They’re using flawed measurements obtained with a device that was not designed for this purpose and stating that this demonstrates harm. There were no actual health metrics reported, like pO2 or pCO2 and no discussion of the actual data needed to confirm clinical significance. These would be more reliable indicators of potential harmful effects on children.	0.835

It's almost like too many people still worship Trump. Notice how Trump only exists in America as well as the extreme push against vaccines, and America has the most deaths despite starting in China.	People like to say its ""nazi"" esq, yet 10 million plus Uighurs are living, working and eating alongside everyone else. As conservatives love to say, follow the law and you won't be punished. If you do actions that might support or encourage a terrorist group, you will be punished regardless of your ethnicity as Han Chinese have been executed for similar crimes.  The alleged ""genocide"" I would clarify doesn't actually involve killing. Not even the far fetched sources report mass killings. On top of this the majority of law abiding Uighers are free and living normally in China among other Chinese, enjoying their benefits as they should.	0.812

US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported.

What you describing are grounds for firing that disqualify people from unemployment. A company adopting a policy that is not enforceable by a state’s regulatory body is not considered a policy that disqualifies people from unemployment. For example, sexual harassment clauses are enforced by state regulatory bodies for employment, that’s why they disqualify people from unemployment because they’re in nearly every employment  code of conduct. OSHA will be enforcing a mandate that required vaccination OR testing. A company only offering people the option to get vaccinated is not grounds for disqualification of unemployment even if they’re terminated for it. What you’re describing is literally the same as passing a code of conduct that requires all employees to get abortion, it’s not grounds for disqualification from unemployment.</p>	0.797

Sadly, the same thing happens when someone that’s critical of trump is immediately written off as being a never-trumper RINO, having TDS, he’s living rent free in their head, blah blah blah... It’s entirely possible to be 1) conservative, 2) think trump is generally a self-absorbed idiot, and 3) also recognize and appreciate the good things he did.	0.85

Except the real conspiracy theory was the fact that Joe Biden, who sat in his basement, somehow got the most votes in US election history without having to campaign in any serious way.

But you realize if we outlawed abortions you would financially pay that bill via future welfare? What do you think happens to those babies? What do you think happens to them in 20-30 years?

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright?

My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.

However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others?

But the trial just spun completely and utterly out of control, because the judge decided to make a soundbite he knew would go viral. And lets face it, the jury will be affected. In a perfect world, jurors go home and never read the news or talk about current events with loved ones and friends. In our world, they will see this go viral online, and again, the judge just basically gave the green light to Rittenhouse defense.	0.828

I'm a conservative but this is one issue I don't get involved in. I totally get why someone would have one but on the other hand I know it's morally wrong. I'm a man and feel it's 100% a women's choice because they are the ones carrying/raising the baby(if no dad is around).	<p>A position of reason and reasonable tolerance is the best counterargument against this sort of absurdity.  Let adult folks have these surgeries if they want to and doctors are willing; don’t ever pay for them with tax dollars, etc, but more obviously don’t do something really, profoundly dumb like put someone who, whatever “gender” they may claim is a fertile biological male human with a female bunkmate.  Because then you predictably end up with prison pregnancy, and a pretty high risk of the sex not being voluntary.</p>	0.844

One of the reasons I'm so exciting for the potential of genetic engineering is to find out what makes paedos paedos and fix it, in the womb. Ditto psychopathy/sociopathy, so much human suffering would be solved.  Until then paedos get two choices of method and location. Knife/chemicals, balls/throat.	The vaccine isn't a fool-proof cure. As I understand it, the vaccine works by training your immune system to react to the protein patterns that match the virus's profile. If your immune system is too far gone, then vaccine or not you will die from infection. And if you die while infected with Covid, I'd imagine your death would still be counted even if you had a pre-existing condition like an auto-immune disease.	0.78

Seeking &quot;natural immunity&quot; not only risks problems for yourself, but if makes you become a part of the contagion chain that is fuelling the continuation of this pandemic to egregious degrees in states with low vaccination rates.</p>	0.777

Poor choice of words. Just get the vaccine and you’ll live your for more years and with more limbs.	<p>A vaccine is often just stimulating your immune system to kick in and start working, building the memory cells to detect future infection early, though it is often not quite as good as your natural system depending on the strategy (hence why live virus vaccines tend to do better than dead virus vaccines). You cannot make this kind of decision to do vaccine boosters yearly without knowing if it is even necessary. For many people, we may find solid antibody levels good enough for at least decades. Maybe they should get a booster once per 10 years? Maybe not at all. We don&#39;t know yet. </p>	0.76

Dr who helped create the basis for the vaccines perm band too bc he obviously know less than a punk skunk head sitting behind a computer. Robert something , can’t remember his full name.	Even though you don't support the seat belt laws, you still choose to wear it.  It costs next to nothing to mitigate that risk.  In my view anyway, same with the vaccine for those without natural immunity.  You're safer with the vax than not even if the risk is small.  There's a miniscule risk to the vaccine itself and it seems to be greatest for young men, but still very, very small from what I can gather.  For anyone over a certain age, if you do the math, they're basically always better off vax'ed if not naturally immune, just like we're better off wearing seatbelts.	0.841

Obesity takes years to kill, is totally reversible, and is not contagious. Previous strains of COVID killed in a couple weeks and were/are wildly contagious.

Vaccine efficacy of less than 100% doesn't mean vaccines are failing.   The serious side effects and death linked directly to a vaccine are extremely rare and are being studied to future cases. They are nowhere near the frequency MTG claimed.   Roughly 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have died from covid.	We're in a pandemic and you're not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It's not ideal when anyone—much less a child—has to spend time in the ICU, but I don't think there's been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.	0.886

Oh since you have had plenty of constructive arguments with people that must mean the mods on here dont ban and remove people arbitrarily based on their disagreements with the trump lovers in your conservative sub..I would give you an example of how trigger happy mods are on this sub but then again you wouldnt believe it anyways.  Do you agree with people breaking the rules of places getting removed?	<p>For the record, I&#39;m not a fan of Trump, though I do like how much he upset people.  You have all these &quot;progressive&quot; fuck the system idiots, who finally get a president that isn&#39;t a straight up politician. Then they lose their minds because he doesn&#39;t act like their bigoted expectations say he should.</p>	0.868

People love to pick one of the two extremes; either it's super dangerous and we should all be scared of it or you're going to die! or, it's nothing special and we should just ignore it--it'll go away.

I'm naturally vaccinated, had it last year.

I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there.

I'm naturally vaccinated, had it last year.  But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.	<p>The media has scared you into believing silly things. The evidence that the Delta variant has resistance to vaccines is based on a very small scale study in India, using vaccines not approved in the U.S. (or most of the world) and the study failed peer review. What we have surmised is that vaccines have less effect on the spread than initially hoped as the virus seems capable of living in the nose without triggering an immune response, which is just more reason that the pandemic should be over from a public policy perspective. We aren&#39;t going to rid the world of Covid-19. There will be reservoirs where the virus continues to live and mutate for years to come. It&#39;s time to move on with our lives. Stop living in fear. If you are vaccinated or previously infected Covid-19 isn&#39;t going to hurt you, and if it hurts someone else, that&#39;s on them.</p>	0.852

More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn&#39;t work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven&#39;t gotten vaccinated, but those who haven&#39;t still wear masks. They&#39;re irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.</p>	0.898

If she is spreading that detail as a means to convince others NOT to vaccinate? Then fuck her she deserves removed. The fact that people can spread it while vaccinated is why EVERYONE SHOULD BE VACCINATED. With a booster your odds of catching covid and having a bad time are incredibly low.    &nbsp;  The vaccine is our safest way to combat this issue, and the non compliance of people like you and those here, are why we are so fucked. You will literally create the scenario where COVID spreads the most and gets to mutate the most. As having unvaxxed and vaxxed people in the same population, actually helps create new mutations.	<p>Before the vaccine was meant to protect us all. It will stop the spread. Now it doesnt snd they want to jab into low risk people, people that have already have had COVID...EVERYONE. and to what end? for what purpose? If it is simply to prevent hospitalization of serious illness in the individual, should ridk fsctors, prior infection, etc. not be ignored?</p>	0.891

If the rules violate the first amendment, than No. The Left started this fight, you seem supprised that there's bleed-over into the right leaning forums.	That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with.

How? This is a literal fact. The younger can spread COVID to others and get them killed. Even children can spread it. How do you know so little about COVID this late in the game?	<p>We can track how COVID spreads through epidemiology, contract tracing and sequencing. So actually we do see that unvaccinated people get the virus, spread it, and kill vaccinated people whose immune system didn&#39;t take to the vaccine. There you go, proved you wrong. Do you even know what sequencing is, or how it works? Do you fucking care enough to look it up? Nobody&#39;s stopping you from opening a textbook.</p>	0.771

I know what dictatorship is. In that context is utterly misused in my opinion. As I said many times before being conservative doesnt mean you are against these mandates...If a person doesnt want to get a vaccine I understand and rescpect but I also understand you will be blocked to meet your colleagues at work...its your decision. No dictatorship seen here.	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don’t want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it’s effectiveness, but that’s a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.884

No dictatorship seen here.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn’t tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous. Interested to hear your thoughts assuming anyone actually replies.</p>	0.883

No dictatorship seen here.	<li>There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (&quot;they were pulled from the market!&quot;) and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don&#39;t have to pull them off. They have wide authority to continue them in a crisis, which this definitely is, and it&#39;s only a net benefit for everyone.</li>	0.882

No dictatorship seen here.	Where I live, it is forced,or you can’t live in society.  That is not ok in my opinion to take away choice.   Work, flying, train, school, coffee shop all require vaccine to participate under health mandate. Is that about health or punishment?  Debatable. Our rights are being taken away and that is the one thing conservatives should agree is wrong.  History shows us it’s never given back.	0.881

Do you trust your gut instinct that you don’t need the vaccine more than the medical experts?</p>	0.88

You don't have a clue what you are talking about.	<p>A very temporary advantage, which is worthless considering the risks from an epidemiological standpoint.

And if we end up with a bad combo of a far more contagious virus, AND it being far more deadly? We will be in for a world of problems.     You don't have a clue what you are talking about.	<p>Even if the current covid vaccines were &quot;relatively ineffective&quot; (they&#39;re very effective) and provided limited protection from covid, the virus would have less chance to multiply and mutate into a strain that&#39;s resistant against the broad antibodies and have less opportunity to move on to a new host. Being unvaccinated provides none of these benefits, which means more opportunity for mutations. We are far closer to a mutation that completely bypasses our natural immune systems than we are to the 3 or 4 or 10 mutations needed to nullify the vaccine antibodies to the point where they provide no protection at all. </p>	0.868

People love to pick one of the two extremes; either it's super dangerous and we should all be scared of it or you're going to die! or, it's nothing special and we should just ignore it--it'll go away. The reality is that both of those need to meet in the middle. It's not a deadly virus (expected 0.038-0.009% mortality rate, but it can and does kill those who are immunocompromised (the old and immune system weak). Halting the economy is a stupid reaction, but so is not taking basic safety measures.	0.86

The virus has a survival rate of over 99.5%, with most people suffering severe effects or death already lacking vitamins and enduring existing health conditions. Please tell me how a statewide lockdown protects the peace and safety of the state when only a small proportion of the population is genuinely at-risk.

They also believe you voting for anyone other than a Democrat a "threat to democracy."	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.826

Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	6. There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (""they were pulled from the market!"") and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off. They have wide authority to continue them in a crisis, which this definitely is, and it's only a net benefit for everyone.	0.87
Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	<p>By what measure? Death rate? Well in that regard your statement is obviously not true because it&#39;s been proven that people are much less likely to be significantly harmed or killed by Covid-19 with the vaccine. Chances of catching it? In that regard the vaccine isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s still helpful. Calling a vaccine ineffective because it doesn&#39;t 100% reduce death rates is simply fucking stupid.</p>	0.868
Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	I'm vaccinated and believes that vaccination has a value for me as I neither want white spots in my lungs or dark spots in my brain due to the corona virus. But I do also respect that there are those who have a different opinion and are prepared to take that risk because they believe that the vaccine is... worse.	0.867
Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	Now, having said that and establishing I'm not just a fanboy of one particular side, the Vaccine DOES actually work.  It protects fairly well against COVID breakthroughs (particularly Moderna) and even if you do get a breakthrough your case will likely peak at a cold or a mild flu.  People should choose to get the vaccine but I honestly don't care if you don't.  It's a free country.	0.866
Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	<p>Personally, I do believe the vaccine is effective to some degree at reducing the severity of illness.

What I do know is I am disgusted at how Covid has become political.</p>	0.866

Why else on earth do you think the left creates affinity groups, and promotes this ideology? To use their political  power for the left wing utopia. Totalitarian control, over a population of easily manipulated, comfort obsessed, mindless lemmings, that desire only trends and the endless consumption of products. Three chord bubble gum pop, short loop prefab rap. This is what passes for culture, because the critical theory that drove teachers into critical pedagogy was designed for this. We elevate the worst of society. The weakest of ideas, the laziest of people, because woke college professors taught a generation of children not to look for merit, but for status in not only elevating the highly ranked within the victim hierarchy, but also themselves with a perverse yet invisible social scoring system.</p>	0.762

Doesn't matter because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the far left. Therefore, it espouses far left policies. That's why I expect a Republican landslide this November.

First, once the proof is out there then republicans will call for most democrats to resign. Of course those who were wrongfully put in office will be asked to resign as well as those who contributed to the fraud. I think we all know they won't. Second, the demonstrated unchecked fraud will introduce doubt into every following election where a democrat wins in a region where they don't have at least 70% support - the fact that they did not resign will only double this effect. Third, if it is proven that the election results were wrong and they win reelection you will see states begin to leave the union. At this point the possibility of bloodshot will hang on a tightrope with one decision - do the democrats allow the red areas to leave.	0.846

Literally every other respiratory prodome. We have upper respiratory virus panels available at every hospital. Take a guess how often they get used? Almost never because knowing what virus it is doesn't change the treatment, which is mostly supportive. Those panels are most helpful in determining if there is a upper respiratory infection, which they also have an absolute terrible time doing. So in essence, short of being on a ventilator with ground glass lungs, you cant really know that you even had covid. Sure, theres a tremendous spike in cases of severe respiratory failure due to covid, that we know. However determining if this specific patient has covid or not is a lot more vague, because as I said, issues with testing and all. Even if we say that 95% of people sick had covid, there's 5% that didnt (which is probably underestimating how many didn't). So as a result, we are left guessing. Yes heard immunity kicks in at ~70 percent, but we're not there yet. There's a lot of evidence showing that antibodies fade quickly to covid for whatever reason. Being sick with it gives better protection than the vaccines, but both have their challenges.	0.864

Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	<p>99.75% of the people hospitalized for Covid at the Cleveland Clinic were unvaccinated. This shows that the severity of symptoms for vaccinated people are orders of magnitude less, since they never required hospitalization. Pretty much the only people that end up on ventilators and in the ICU are unvaccinated. This shows that the vaccines are doing an exceptional job.</p>	0.856
I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.    All of my colleagues have been vaccinated, as well as a significant amount of the other hospital workers.  The only people we see getting sick are generally the ones who are unvaccinated.  Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.  Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	<p>You know what else has that prodrome? Literally every other respiratory prodome. We have upper respiratory virus panels available at every hospital. Take a guess how often they get used? Almost never because knowing what virus it is doesn&#39;t change the treatment, which is mostly supportive. Those panels are most helpful in determining if there is a upper respiratory infection, which they also have an absolute terrible time doing. So in essence, short of being on a ventilator with ground glass lungs, you cant really know that you even had covid. Sure, theres a tremendous spike in cases of severe respiratory failure due to covid, that we know. However determining if this specific patient has covid or not is a lot more vague, because as I said, issues with testing and all. Even if we say that 95% of people sick had covid, there&#39;s 5% that didnt (which is probably underestimating how many didn&#39;t). So as a result, we are left guessing. Yes heard immunity kicks in at ~70 percent, but we&#39;re not there yet. There&#39;s a lot of evidence showing that antibodies fade quickly to covid for whatever reason. Being sick with it gives better protection than the vaccines, but both have their challenges.</p>	0.839

This isn't necessarily "left and right". We have a moslim infiltrator celebrating the silencing of a Christian.	<p>Regardless, Christianity is absolutely intertwined with American conservatism.

I would like nothing more than to see an open debate between all the healthcare professionals (including) those that had their social media accounts shut down due to "misinformation".  I propose a national debate covered by every major TV network, including Tony Fuaci, Sanjay Gupta, Bill Gates, CDC director Rochelle wolinsky, Robert Malone, Richard Fleming, Peter McCullough, Simone gold, Michael Yeadon etc etc...   Pit every medical professional against one another in an open debate about Covid-19 and Vaccines, let the American people decide who to believe. I want to hear everyone's ideas about the pandemic, I don't want to be forcefed one single narrative over and over and over every day of the week, I want everyone to have a say in the matter. That's how we solve this problem!	<p>During Trump we just saw the constant bashing of him, his family, all aspects of conservative life on all media platforms. I didn’t meet anyone conservative/rationally normal who was outright offended by any of it. We just turned off the tv. But now we have the left…my lord talk about give and not take. They can happily burn a Nordstrom down without thinking about it but the second anyone says anything that pokes fun at them then they scream like petulant children. Madness.</p>	0.85

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	cancel culture is forced on us, by using measures to manipulate emotion regardless of ideology. considering personalized advertisements and posts in general on online posts, at best i would have seen maybe two articles from smaller news sources, within a span of a day for most topics of such nature that lean towards my political views. i couldn’t give a damn less about cancel culture yet for whatever reason, they find any which way to push their narrative whether it be a movie scene/ad or a video game collab. the difference is that this isn’t forced into your normal day to day life, meaning you’d never see politics in a child’s video game, and yes that has happened.	0.846

Clearly these quotes only represent the feelings of a handful of individuals, not any significant part of the UK's government like the headline is implying.

The judge has been entirely even handed thus far, compromising with both sides and granting motions to each in kind.

So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	The more wiser portion of the base along with independents/dems do not buy this trumpian nonsense about the Kraken or whatever b/s being peddled by these grifters. There is no fucking ""ballot trafficking"" that is going to be exposed. There wasn't any to begin with (on a massive scale)! Focusing any calories on the past is not helpful. There's another election in a year that the GOP has a good chance of doing well in. It was trump's nonsensical drum beating about voter fraud in georgia that cause decreased turnout in the bumpkin portion of the state. Its an absolute travesty that the months following the November election were wasted on ""stopping the steal"" rather than winning those two seats. Millions of grassroot dollars were wasted to release the kraken that never amounted to jack shit.	0.911

Listen, I honestly couldn't be less impressed by the voter fraud.  After near 50 lawsuits, the Trump show couldn't get one case thru a prima facie case.  That doesn't happen because of a conspiracy.

Third, the issue with Trump's claims that votes randomly appeared was explained by the machines having issues which were corrected. Votes were updated in clusters. Trump had bumps of votes, too. It wasn't just Biden that had 90,000 random votes found for him. More people just happened to vote for Biden in a democratic county. Why didn't they challenge red counties which used the same machines? Why didn't they challenge red states which swung for Trump which used the same machines?

In the name of racial equity they're gonna discriminate against people who need the treatment until everyone lives in equality.  WTF?	The trend seems to be not the pursuit of equality but equity, or the redistribution of power. This will inevitability create further injustice for all races (https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/calling-asians-white-adjacent-is-racist-and-insulting/).	0.81
I’ve always said.  You don’t need to fly a plane into a building anymore.  If I was a terrorist and I stress this is hypothetical I’m not encouraging it, but I would start a couple wildfires.

The following nights their response to the protests felt like overcompensating for the night of the riot. Peaceful marches would get boxed in and tear gassed, etc. These tactics would have been nice to deal with the looters but were unnecessary for the marches. They realized that they were basically fanning the flames at this point and backed off, rightfully in my opinion. Whether you agree with that move or not, they did not need federal assistance either way, and the offer just felt like political showmanship by Trump saying he could swoop into this Democrat city and save the day.	0.839

When every narrative from multiple sources starts to look like propaganda or conspiracy, it might not be a bad idea to also check your own biases as you check your sources. When the whole world looks like it's against you, it probably isn't.	And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  What Weissmann says is technically correct, but he leaves out context that radically changes how one might view the Tucker situation.  Yes, of course anyone reaching out to a Putin surrogate should expect the NSA/CIA to be listening.  No one is surprised by that.  What makes this so frightening is that this information was leaked to journalists.  This could potentially be used (and Tucker alleges this to be the case) for blackmail and to otherwise influence American journalists and influential figures.

He had a lot of talk about bringing back manufacturing, and even had moderate success, but passing the tax bill, the only real major act of his presidency, was an absolute, undeniable betrayal of the working class and the greatest gift to the mega-wealthy they could have possibly hoped for.

Yes, one of the old republican protectionists that gave us the Great Depression, not the President who opened up markets and gave us the greatest economic boom since…after the great depression.	<p>In the twenty-first century thus far, something strange has been happening. Reaganite Republicans have continued cutting taxes to “unleash” “entrepreneurship,” but the rich people thus favored keep turning into Democrats. Loudoun County, Virginia, now the richest U.S. county, was until recently a rock-solid Republican place. George W. Bush won it by 16 points in 2000. But Barack Obama took an 8-point victory in 2008, Hillary Clinton won it by 17 in 2016, and Joe Biden won it by 24 in 2020—a 40-point shift in two decades. In the weeks leading up to December’s finance reports on the pair of Georgia Senate runoffs, the Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, each raised more money than both of the Republican candidates. There are still vestiges of the old dispensation: One of the Republican candidates, Kelly Loeffler, wife of the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, had donated $23 million of her own money. But in general Democrats now enter the political arena as the party of wealth.</p>	0.815

Sure did wonders to New York.

It is generally considered a perk of the job that you can park your car wherever and whenever you like in the city with no consequence, contributing massively to the cities congestion. With city employees its bad enough, but when cops do it in their cruisers it creates a sense among the public that cops think they are above the law. It&#39;s a terrible look.</p>	0.793

Government collapses is a little overdramatic for a PM resigning, it will just mean another guy from the party will replace him. Also finlands healthcare is free and much better than in the US.	<p>This is not to say that no one should get the vaccine because getting the vaccine seems to be much safer than getting COVID for many people, especially the elderly. Just to show that the millions of people already infected are likely now more safe from the virus than those who only got the vaccine. The number of lab-confirmed cases of covid is also probably a very low estimation of the true number of cases.</p>	0.836

What child’s cancer treatment should make money for shareholders?! Why is insulin $800? It costs $3 to make.

Now Norway is far from a perfect utopia like a lot of redditors try to make it look, but it baffles me that USA and Norway can have such similar social and government structures, yet so many people in the states are scared by the slightest tax increase, even when the small increase causes large personal savings in the long run. Why so many go against their own interest? (Less student loan, no health insurance deductible, reducing economic desperation causing fewer crimes, etc).	0.819

Let&#39;s say I administered 1 million vaccines the first day of the month but on the last day of the month I administered 10,000 and the decrease between those days was steady, would it be appropriate to say &quot;on the last day of the month, I administered <em>whatever the average would be across the whole month</em> per day at month&#39;s end? Of course that would be a ridiculous use of that number. It would greatly increase the amount I was actually administering per day at the end of the month. The more useful number is how much I was making per day at the end of the month. The fact that the Press Secretary cited 500,000 per day and wanted to double that, while you acknowledge the last week was 917,000, proves exactly what most in here are saying.</p>	0.777

We are not allowed to ask that community to improve or change. We <em>certainly</em> aren&#39;t allowed to think about restricting immigration to that community. That would all be racist, and we must accept everyone for any reason and welcome them into our melting pot, because even if you wave the flag of another country while burning an American flag, apparently you are still an American.</p>	0.85

Sovereign nations have the right to determine who crosses boarders. Didn’t think I’d have to explain that on a conservative sub.

We must come to some sort of binding global agreement on how to address this issue. As much as I would like the free market to be a solution; this is a classical tragedy of the commons.

It is however a crime for a business to actively mislead their share holders, customers and business partners about potential harms that can arise from the use of their products. Tobacco actively mislead their share holders and customers over decades and worked to discourage research with regards to health issues of tobacco, promoted their products as beneficial for health and discredited scientists voicing diverging opinions. That cost them dearly in the courts and I reckon that quite a few fossil fuel producers might be on the same hook; there&#39;s good evidence that Exxon and others knew since the 1970 that the continued use of fossil fuels invariably will lead to climate upheaval. But that&#39;s for the courts to decide.</p>	0.839

I think there are some conservatives who are going to stand up and say, my individual rights override your unconstitutional mandate.  There&#39;s also a large chunk of African Americans who are not getting vax&#39;ed.  You never hear about the latter.  You hear Biden blaming Trump supporters for not getting vax&#39;ed.  I believe the vax is highly effective at reducing the symptoms and severity of infection and very so-so at best at controlling the spread.  I also think overall, we have like 70% or so vax&#39;ed.  The un-vax&#39;ed are mostly young children and those with naturally acquired immunity.  The percentage of the population with COVID antibodies is likely very high, approaching 90%.</p>	0.836

The only intervention it makes sense for the government to make is to institute a universal charging standard since that would discourage monopolistic practices. Other than that they should get out of the way and let the free market work. They won&#39;t, of course, because the government is bloated and dysfunctional... but they <em>ought</em> to.</p>	0.846

I remember quite well how he coordinated the response with corporations and so on fairly early, and then had states compete over resources while they were scarce (so those that needed/wanted something most would get it) rather than some virtue signaling &quot;equitable&quot; distribution that would result in more overall deaths.

Well, it objectively is. We beat small pox and polio. Now, we are too weak to beat even this inferior enemy.	Once again, ""just Google"" and ""I don't even know what to say lol"" are not answers or arguments or explanations. You are just claiming the US healthcare is terrible with no evidence whatsoever. The US absolutely isn't LAST lmfao. If they're last in maybe some specific thing I can believe that, but at least have an idea of what you're even claiming. Are you talking about OECD countries? Then in some areas we are last yes. But we are also the lowest cancer mortality rate in that list, and one of the best at preventative procedures, visits, and vaccination. We have a big obesity problem in this country which causes us to be lower on many things such as life expectancy too. So our healthcare is not terrible by any stretch, although it's not as efficient and isn't as easily accessible. Ignoring all that though, our healthcare system still has undeniably created most of the medical advancements in the past many decades which even allow countries to improve their healthcare to this point. That's just a fact. Where do you think all the new medicines and treatments come from? The US pulls more than its weight in drug/treatment research costs, and if other countries would share that burden then we'd all be better off in the long term	0.763

A large STACK of MANY ballots all *exactly* the same, same markings, same choices made, not the normal paper, no folds,  no wear of any kind.  Like someone marked a ballot, and then proceeded to photocopy the ballot many times.  THIS is what supposedly happened.  I've no reason to think this woman lied in this sworn affidavit that has so far been ignored by these corrupt fucking judges.  She has been doing this for many years.  It's her career.  Why would she risk her job over this situation, just to make up some really odd claim about the ballots being ""unlike any she had ever seen before (in this long career), and exactly the same in every way?""	0.833

Could Biden (not defending him, I think he’s a clown) have meant that the federal government lacks the police power to mandate masking/social distancing/vaccines at the state level? Is there any possibility that he was referring to FEDERALISM, a fundamental feature of the US government system?   Could you define federalism without access to the internet?   [If I’m removed from this sub, it’s clear evidence that conservatives actually love censorship, when it’s convenient.]	Now he's basically plunging us into fascism. Not only did he enact inter-provincial bans (which is blatantly unconstitutional), but now he's tabled legislation that would basically end free speech on the internet. I'm paraphrasing slightly but his minister in charge of it basically said he wants to ""silence people who doubt the legitimacy of the government a la Jan. 6 / Trump's election fraud allegations"".	0.864

Mandates are implemented to force compliance and have repercussions. The mandate isn’t saving ppl, the vaccine is. Slapping a mandate on it only allows the government to punish non-compliance.	0.855

Even if the epi-pen EO <em>had</em> been implemented it would be a microscopic drop of water in the ocean of corruption and corporate greed that comprises our healthcare system.

So far the GOP have <strong>no plans to fix our broken healthcare system, despite complaining about it for over a decade.</strong> That’s my point.</p>	0.886

It’s almost laughable tbh, it’s like yeah, there are social issues that stem from the system as a whole, but people fail to realize that it’s a rich vs poor issue, because of the emotional attachment that the media takes and spins, which captivates the infatuation of self pity by these types of people, and instead of bettering themselves, it’s easier to create a scapegoat and blame someone else for their short comings in life.	0.851

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.

You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before. But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself. Or even better find a way that nobody has to wait that long that these things are necessary.	Even better, realize that abortion already isn’t a federal issue of any significance and will not be for at least a decade. No one in the federal government wants to change a damn thing about the status quo here - they profit too much from it. Blue team gets much of its vote from single-issue pro choice folks; red team gets much of its vote from single-issue anti-abortion folks. They win or lose largely on that issue, and getting rid of it would mean voters might actually pay attention to other things. And SCOTUS probably prays every night to keep abortion shit off their docket.	0.856

Last year I’d go into a store without a mask and some people would bat an eye, but not anymore. After I got the vaccine I’ve basically lived my life as if this never happened, and quite frankly before getting the vaccine I wasn’t worried about this for more than a few weeks. Nobody in my family took any precautions, aside from just sanitizing things like shopping carts before handling them, and my parents are not only old, but also both have bad immune systems, and even they didn’t give a damn about this.</p>	0.841

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.

For the first time in a long time we&#39;re seeing fathers return to black neighborhoods and with them comes a small opportunity for prosperity in these neighborhoods, with that gang violence and drug use will go down.

Again, I can’t imagine being so sensitive that seeing someone with blue hair makes me almost leave a store in a huff without purchasing what I came for.	<p>It&#39;s painful to read and detracts from the actual discussion. Plays the same as the &quot;Trump wants two scoops of ice cream and everyone else only gets one!&quot; a couple years ago, except the media wasn&#39;t doing it while they were transporting fallen heroes like this sub is doing right now.</p>	0.812

Not to mention, Trump got trounced because of minority voters.  If he got the same percentage of minority voters as did Bush (or suburban voters as did Bush) he remains President.  It wasn't big liberal cities that changed from 2016.  It was suburban middle class voters who turned on him.  Hell, if he got the same amount go suburban voters as Romney did, he remains president… His performance in the suburbs barely equaled McCain in 2008, and the walking corpse of Joe Biden is not nearly as charismatic as was a young Obama.	0.849

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	<p>Anyway, this is another example how the name of an organization is not what is its mission (like &quot;freedom fighter&quot; means the opposite). The NAACP has an agenda and it is not the advancement of Colored People. It is the advancement of socialism and the end of the nuclear family.  That is why they won&#39;t touch Hunter, it does not advance that agenda.  As for colored people, they have not been advanced in 50 years (this is according to the NAACP).</p>	0.855

Racism is rooted in beliefs, not skin color. Look to American History. The white plantation owners in the south couldn’t be bothered to pick their crops, but were more than happy to purchase humans to do so for them.

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	<p>The constitution was not meant to last 250 years effectively unchanged, sans a handful of amendments  It is pointless to try to imagine what the founding fathers would have thought of the internet or automatic weapons, and they left it up to us to figure it out ourselves.  Saying that &quot;xyz isn&#39;t what the constitution intended&quot; is not debating in good faith, it&#39;s obstructionism that, in some cases, is used to hold back progress and keep marginalized groups in their place.</p>	0.834

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery but was not an abolitionist in the sense of the abolition movement that was growing in the north.</p>	0.842

Uh catholics do hound people. And sorry but some people do care for other people enough to "hound" them. Sorry you don't like don't be a snowflake about it. It's not really that big of a deal.	And yes, all the pop and circumstance is BS. You may call me a bigot because I believe the church should have spent way more money helping the poor instead of on rituals and outfits. But, the real bigots are the religious who don't want my fellow citizens the same rights. Ie. Catholics. So it funny that you call me a bigot when its an organization that you are involved in that is actually working to keep your fellow citizens feom enjoying the same rights as you.

A real quick Google search will do you good. Trump visited The Hermitage on March 15, 2017. Gave a speech and laid flowers on Jackson's grave.

Its in the backdrop of a metric shit-ton of photos and there are plenty of articles talking about the decision.   Without knowing what you would consider accurate sourcing or Fake News, I'll let you connect the dots yourself.	<p>Rewind ten years or so and the Republican Governor and  state legislature passed a law limiting the powers of public employee unions.  Our capitol had a real armed resurrection that was cheered on by MSNBC&#39;s Ed Shultz (reporting daily on site), Rachael Maddow, her husband.  This went on for weeks, including the democratic members of the legislature fleeing to Illinois in the same manner as those doing it in Texas right now.

It is the responsibility of the private sector to attract customers by making a better product. The only intervention it makes sense for the government to make is to institute a universal charging standard since that would discourage monopolistic practices.

Then by all means downvote me and report me and what have you. But if I made you pause to rethink our one-sided relationship with Israel, then I consider that a victory in it of itself.</p>	0.853

DC's imperial actions post-USSR have no clear, material goal & offer no benefit to the American people.
