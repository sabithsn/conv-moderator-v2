See what I mean? You don't even consider what I have to say, You aren't engaging with any points, you're just attacking me. I'm trying my best to have an actual conversation with you and you refuse.	<p>Yet you still refuse to answer any of my questions or clarify your argument even when I point it out to you.</p>	0.9
>Vaccine mandates are not "backed by science"  You still have not admitted this was the most retarded thing to say, which was the only reason I ever bothered to try to educate you. You asking retarded questions to try to start new arguments is a fucking \*chef's kiss\* michelin star plate of stupid.  >BuT WhAt If YoU oPpoSe KiLiing HaWaaiiinns  Do you fucking read what you type before posting?	Most people do not think Bodily Autonomy is absolute in matters not relating to abortion. See Vaccine mandates for a pretty vivid illustration of that! Hell, last time I had this argument it was all going the _other_ way - people thought I was stirring shit up because surely nobody would _ever_ argue that bodily autonomy was absolute..! Of course, that was in a vaccine related thread.	0.862
And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren’t willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid. Not sure we have anything left to discuss here.	I am often told that I must change my ontology because it hurts some people's feelings.  But I am incapable of changing it for that reason.  I can only change it if I am persuaded by logical argument that my ontology is incorrect.	0.913
Preach	Also, formatting. Jesus."	0.767
It’s pretty easy to understand. Everyone has grasped it.  But you do you bro. You wanna get fucked? You go get fucked. Or whatever you want to call it.	It's easy to call people phobic this and phobic that if you simply decide you define them that way no matter what."	0.827
Yeah, just say male or female. Same thing..	And yes, the same ""appeal to general consensus"" can be applied to the categories of ""men"" and ""women"".	0.786
A couple of people had, until you have no downvoted my comments.  Reported because you are deliberately being a difficult, obtuse cunt.	So - your main arguments are wrong, you haven't changed your opinion yet. It isn't shocking, since you clearly don't want to. You are starting to resort (well, lets be honest, you started a while ago) with simple insults and sulking about about because you simply can't internalize that it is possible that not only are you wrong, but you were wrong while being so very stereotypical about it."	0.868
No one had. Nice projection.	Cool, no one cares	0.875
The only reason I do that is because it's fucking true. And people have only been assholes on here. Cry about it.	<p>It was in truth, morons that did this, and as such deserve zero sympathy.</p>	0.831
I had 3 likes on both of my comments until you happened to mention it. Other people grasped the premise. But you have continually shown to be obtuse throughout the entire comment thread on your post.   This is a subreddit for people able to change their mind and engage in debate, not rant on a soapbox.	There's always been 3 answers to the whole CA issue.  Either folks are fine with it, sometimes to the point of actively encouraging cultural exchange,  people don't care one way or the other, and the loud but small group that gets offended.  It's a non issue the vast majority of the time, and is only being brought to the fore now because social media brings out the worst in people."	0.82
I'm not. Just make an effort, jfc.	No they're not.  Reread their argument.	0.84
Except you've provided fuck all to prove this "truth" you've done nothing but assert and flame out and block people who disagree	At least that would be the truth. He doesn't need to say anything, you're inherently bashing every other country in the world by making those claims."	0.873
It's not a reasonable conclusion and you should also, kindly, go away.	<p>I argue that you ought to avoid holding such opinions.</p>	0.902
Plenty of people, myself included, have, and you just ignore, wilfully misinterpret, insult, and block us.	<p>This makes your entire post silly. Retard has largely been used in the social sphere and I more often than not you will see it used primarily like idiot or moron.</p>	0.817
Nope.	Nope.	1.0
Lmao Reddit karma = sound argument. I've heard it all.	Okay so like I'm fully aware that you're making sincere arguments and I'm even more acutely aware that it sounds like I'm trolling, but like can you understand that you're saying the same things TERFs say?	0.814
Why the hell are you on this sub if you're going to be a dick to those trying to change your view?	Also, if you don't care what people's opinions are on topics, this is the wrong sub for you"	0.85
Yes I have. Read my fucking post.	Read my comment. I said that too.	0.861
Just because you say no it doesn't make it true. If you want it to be true, address my points.	If I'm reading you right, if someone believes both are invalid, then they do not sincerely hold the belief that both should be valid-- which is the hypothetical you proposed.	0.907
You claim to have heard it all, but fail to address their arguments. Interesting	>It almost feels like you were indoctrinated or somehow overwhelmingly convinced that this is true but you can't support it with any logic, you just keep saying it.	0.85
That person could've read my comment. But she didn't.	You'd think she's got a sense of humour about it but apparently not.	0.829
I did. It's nothing but your personal opinions on a topic that a hell of a lot of people entirely disagree with. And you ignore every criticism they provide.	I'm familiar with their arguments. Their arguments are bad. Given that he didn't give me anything to work with other than 'have you heard about these people' the only thing I could really shoot down was that yes I have heard of them, they suck.	0.866
Again, I'm not going to engage with bad faith arguments. Maybe I should rewrite this because apparently fucking no one understands.	Anyway, you're just asserting things and so I've asserted some things back, but it's clear that in the response to the OP you don't subscribe to the common US view of bodily autonomy, so I think I'll try and leave it here.	0.892
I've already said why.	i already said that (and yes they do)	0.912
You could've addressed people's criticism. But you didn't.	""He didn't say that. And if he did, he didn't mean that. And if he did, you didn't understand it. And if you did, it's not a big deal. And if it is, others have said worse!"""	0.886
Nope, I've adressed plenty.	I've given you plenty.	0.884
No, you just asserted you were correct.	No, it's a description.  You are correct!	0.907
Completely disagree. I'm insulting because people have been insulting towards me. An eye for an eye. Learn to live with it or go cry about it.	<p>About the &quot;I&#39;ll make your life impossible because I dislike you for no reason&quot; assholes, I think they are projecting. They hate themselves so they fuck with people who reminds them of themselves when their lifes weren&#39;t shit and they fucked it up.</p>	0.9

Nope.	Nope.	1.0
Nope.	Nope.	1.0
Not at all.	Not at all.	1.0
Once again, asserting it does not make it a true statement.	Because right now its title doesn't seem to accurately reflect your views."	0.945
Again, I've supported my arguments and made counters. If you want me to go into more detail. DM me in a respectful way or go to hell. But I'm not engaging with bad faith actors.	You mention politely convincing with the Socratic method. Logical extreme: I am polite I am respectfully asking questions , but I have no interest in changing my own opinion. My curiosity is not to find a deeper truth so I can see what you see (even if we choose to disagree) and you can see what I see, etc, I’m just continuing to search for what will make you agree with me. Now I feel I’m arguing in good faith, I’m polite. You accuse me of sealioning. You aren’t wrong, but I feel like you are just using the word to dismiss my quite frankly watertight case. Did you not realise how good I am at showing the flaws in your reasoning? Sure I’ve been called out as “sealioning” before, but that guy was definitely using the term in bad faith as I was merely inquiring as to some of the subtler details of his initial proposal when he tried to shutdown my line of questioning with an irrational accusation of “sealioning”. And so it is that you accuse me of sealioning or rather you think about calling me out on it, but you don’t want to use the term, because you’ve seen it used in bad faith and you have to admit I stayed calm and politely asked my questions, politely reframed your answers because you were so obviously wrong and I didn’t have to give any ground because you were so much less right than me and that is why you eventually let it drop because you realised I had bested you in the ancient art of debate and that is how you let me think I had changed your mind to my bigoted racist opinion... for shame... you disgust me."	0.872
Oh enlightened one. I've just learned another noble truth of which I had no prior knowledge. Criticism is not the same as insults. Who would've known? Truly you are blessed with knowledge.	<p>I just can’t imagine the arrogance required to think your definition is better than the universally accepted one.</p>	0.844
No, you haven't. Your "supporting arguments" are just more assertions of yours. I haven't seen you actually counter a single comment anyone left, only tiny fragments and strawman takes of their stance. You've repeatedly refused to actually elaborate on the entirety of your post, and accused people of gaslighting for calling out your flimsy arguments. If you have details to provide, provide them here. There's no reason to go to dms except to either break sub rules or to save face when no details are sent.	>I dont' think it's always valid, but you haven't even given me a single example to reflect on. The only thing you gave me is a person calls you racist but gives you no context, refuses to engage, and is coming from bad-faith. I don't know if the accusation is valid, because you haven't actually demonstrated anything.	0.91
Again, I have. Plenty of times. If you don't want DMs then go ahead and engage with me respectfully here. But I'm not engaging if you're going to be bad faith.	<p>I wasn&#39;t making an argument, I was sharing an experience and perspective. If you don&#39;t care about it, that&#39;s entirely understandable and fine. I won&#39;t berate or insult you for your opinion.</p>	0.837
Yes only you. Enlightened one. Are graced with this divine knowledge.	<p>In a perfect world </p>	0.839
That's no an excuse. Grow up	Then it don't matter what top or bottom is."	0.79
I'm not in bad faith. I want details you have repeatedly refused to provide. Strange how directly stating what you've done is disrespectful. Perhaps it's because you consider those very things bad, and can't stand the thought of you doing them? Who's to say. Just provide details and stop trying to make excuses.	So - your main arguments are wrong, you haven't changed your opinion yet. It isn't shocking, since you clearly don't want to. You are starting to resort (well, lets be honest, you started a while ago) with simple insults and sulking about about because you simply can't internalize that it is possible that not only are you wrong, but you were wrong while being so very stereotypical about it."	0.927
Grow up yourself	Grow up."	0.906
How about you engage respectfully?	I was being polite with the basically.	0.844
I am. I have repeatedly asked for details you continually refuse to provide. How are statements of what you've done disrespectful?	Which is the point I've very directly been challenging your basis for over and over again. And you keep ignoring your own lack of coherent argumentation.	0.9
Oh another enlightened one. Please teach me, a plebian, a rat of these noble truths. I'm always ready to learn oh enlightened ones.	<p>But yeah, congrats. Hope you understand sarcasm and learn something.</p>	0.718
How about not having such a combattive tone?	As opposed to saying something like:	0.916
Oh of course of course. I'm not enlightened as you. That is why.	Well, I’ll tell you that I’m unconvinced misinformation comes from silencing a viewpoint.	0.852
You first.	First:	0.941
This is very grown up behaviour.	So progressive."	0.793
You seem to be mistaking directness for being combattative. Will you provide details or not?	Do you think those things don't bring intrinsitic satisfaction? That's the crux of what we're discussing here.	0.844
Nice job editing your comment	I appreciate your opinion, and I have mad respect for you taking the time and effort to post about it :-)"	0.806
Stop being combattive. Tell me what you want details of in the first place.	stop saying ""no"" and explain urself."	0.83
I wouldn't trust your judgment on that. I bet you're a bored 13 year old who has too much time on their hands.	<p>The irony is that the maturity level of an actual 13 year old would put you to shame.</p>	0.852
I already did. You just ignored it. Go back and read it again if you want.	Nope. Never did. Re-read the post and try again."	0.836
Oh my, too afraid to give them out?	""Ignorance IS the unwillingness to acknowledge or adopt new information.""	0.896
Yes yes. Ofc. Bored 13 year old. Totally.	<p>The irony is that the maturity level of an actual 13 year old would put you to shame.</p>	0.769
Would you rather me call you a sad and pathetic adult? Regardless I think it's clear you have issues to work on. It may be a good idea to address your anger issues before it gets you into trouble.	<p>Rather than lose control of your anger, you should <em>use</em> your anger as an informative and instructive emotion to alert you to potentially being taken advantage of or betrayed. But you should also use rationality to decide how you should behave based on your anger. Your anger can often be misplaced. </p>	0.876
You came to the wrong website to criticize women about anything, good for you for taking the heat lol	I mean, it doesn't. I think it's stupid marketing, but that hashtag was a satire on anti-feminist characterisations of feminist beliefs. The creator of the hashtag has said as much. That is not comparable at all to communities where sexual assault is encouraged and in many instances, actually planned."	0.883
Go paste it. I believe in you. Prove you're not saving face.	PS committing to being yourself and welcoming rejection is the key to self confidence.</p>	0.818
Wtf are you talking about? You can see on your reply earlier, you quoted pretty much what i said. Your just a piece of shit w issues.  Fuck off.	<p>Read your previous comments asking me why it’s exploitative.</p>	0.805
But you are struggling with reading comprehension. Expecting someone to take off their pants so you can fuck them, is not as bad as asking them to pay. You are comparing apples to grenades.	You're still comparing apples to oranges. The people in the wiki like are victims of a cultural practice where the perpetrators are getting away with it, because it's not a ""crime"". Whereas you're likely not getting away with genital mutilation in the U.S. are you? So yeah the call to mutilate people's genitals is absurd, it's illegal, over the top and without further context you'd not take it serious or do you think this panel would in the near or far future do that?	0.83

I stand by this to this day, 6 years married. Your gender should not determine your financial contribution, that’s ridiculous and I strongly disagree with a lot of commenters here.	Being lectured about my weight, which wasn’t in the list of things that was stressing me out at the time, was literally the worst thing she could have done because it added something else to the list of reasons to hate myself for at a time when I was already talking myself off bridges and tall buildings multiple times per week."	0.858

Dude, your question is in bad faith. Judging by all your responses, you not only have zero interest in changing your view, but you don't even have a real world grasp of the concept you're talking about. If you feel personally attacked by my question, that's on you.	Only weaseling occurring here is on your part. You misread my comment and didn't understand the meaning of the words used and came to a semantic conclusion that made zero sense in any context and are now struggling to find any ground. You blame it on the discourse because, of course, the fault can't lie with you. Everyone else is wrong for attempting to respect their peers and you are right for saying what you want when you want.	0.909

Honestly, as a nurse, I say go for it. The public will only learn when enough nurses are fed up and leave the field. Those that didn't leave for traveling already left to easier desk jobs or computer science. We're tired. Have at it mate. We only learn the hard way after all.	<p>Basically, we all lose our minds when we&#39;re in love, and a lot of the early behaviours we establish need to be renegotiated later when we come to our senses.

Again, context....  You are clearly missing the context here.  Your point would be valid if this werent withing the larger context of the conversationsation being specifically about the jan 6th riot.   If were talking about tomatoes and i say how much i hate fruit, then youll know im also saying i hate tomatoes.  Not sure how you still dont understand how context works.  Literaply every respnse youve made has failed to take that into consideration.  Meanwhile you accuse me of putting words in someones mouth while you are at the same time taking words out.  Additionally, if you think my asking if you can follow a conversation is rude, the same can be said for asking if i am even making a point.  Hypocrite.  Im done with you, you clearly have the reading comprehension and debate skills of a grade schooler.	<p>I mean, I know you&#39;re not OP, but if a person is gonna pull out trite idioms to excuse bad behavior, then they oughta at least use to whole thing... and the thing about bad apples is they spoil the bunch.</p>	0.857

It's such a small % that actually get offended, and in most of these cases, the one offended isn't even part of the "appropriated group"; but rather, acting on their behalf.   I think the entire outrage stems from sensationalism of media, and making clicks for $$$.   The people that "ban" the expression of cultures are likely afraid of media backlash.	<p>I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s why legislation becomes less popular. If you see people from your side and your favorite news channel shit on a bill constantly, it obviously becomes a lot less popular. The idea that if you give a lot of dishonest people a lot of time to lie about a bill will make it less popular is not a valid reason to give a lot of dishonest people more time to lie about a bill.</p>	0.891
Don't have to, it is irrelevant. He is a troll who took another identity and posted under a fake name and then pretended he was a victim.

Like, I'm sorry, but communities _are allowed to have rules_. I've been banned from lots of forums, largely for breaking their rules, and you know what?

I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	<li><p>even if they did do it the way they did to help small states, there&#39;s a big difference between that, and saying this was a big part of the electoral college&#39;s design.

Can you show any data that bolsters your assertion that burning marijuana is as deadly as burning tobacco?

Or was that another one of your fake facts?

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	In terms of the police, they are human. People make mistakes. Police are ridiculed, insulted and they are quitting in high numbers. Those three days of riots had every cop working almost 24/7. They had a precinct burned down by protestors and they had objects thrown at them such as bricks, pee and bottles. I do believe in reform, but abolishing is a dumb idea with no plan, which puts a bunch of elected politicians with no experience in charge. In terms of police shootings by MPS, most have been cleared with the exception of Nour. If you want to break it down look at Chicago, Louisville or New York."	0.882

What a load of propaganda.   ‘Israel is the only democracy…. Bla bla bla….’  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.   As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.    Sorry you chose to ignore the manner in which israel gained and maintains its land and jewish majority, while ignoring the occupation, but that doesn’t make these issues go away.

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>I hate that &quot;recreational drug use&quot; exists. I&#39;ve literally only ever had caffeine and alcohol myself, and I genuinely worry what will happen if I ever end up in hospital and get over medicated.

In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.

Of course the sloganeering would have you believe that all rape victims have the latter experience, which is silly, but it's equally silly to say that none of them do. Though slogans, by necessity of needing to be short, do tend to oversimplify situations. That doesn't make the slogans right, but it doesn't make them wrong, either. Usually people aren't out sloganeering if there isn't or hasn't been some sort of genuine problem to some degree. The polarization is where things get really problematic.

You deny it happens.    If millions of men are being sexually assaulted and raped by women each year, that is a "massive number."	> How many women have looked the other way when it comes to rape and sexual abuse? Further, how many women have had the harm they do completely disregarded as they themselves commit sexual abuse, whether of men/boys or women/girls? For that last one, we have no way of knowing, because the statistics here are so unreliable, but the number of men with a story about this is...surprisingly high.	0.844

Failures in human memory are one thing, intentional malice is another. She lied about him being 100% the one responsible. She lied about him in her book. She lied about him having a record. She lied about him greeting her. What many of you believe about the police could be a lie as well. She has some mental illness issues going on and trying to downplay her vile acts call into question the quality of your character.	3. What trans women who didn't fit the perfect picture did in response to this system was just lie to the doctors. They'd pretend they were straight or they'd pretend they wanted to be hyperfeminine whenever the doctor was looking, and then the rest of the time they just wouldn't be. And I have to say, a system where patients are lying to their doctors to get medical treatment, and having their lives profoundly improved by that medical treatment that they are lying to the doctors to get, sounds to me like a system where the doctors are wrong.	0.873

This is objectively the worst answer of all.    Saying you haven't done your research so you can't be at blame for making bad decisions is just awful, really bottom of the barrel mentality.  Everyone is accountable for their choices in life, being uninformed is no excuse.	<p>I think it’s incredibly ungrateful to spit on their graves simply for being fallible human beings and having failures exactly like the rest of us. Not a single person here will ever be able to boast that they lived up to everything they’ve hoped for. Anyone who might tell you this is lying to themselves or they never had a high bar to begin with. You can recognize moral shortcomings and work to fix them, that’s fine. But minimizing the accomplishments of those who came before you because your baseline for moral values largely stemmed from their efforts is ungrateful for no other reason than spite or bitterness.</p>	0.901

Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	The difference is that the greater fool isn't necessarily the Redditor. GME was shorted over 100% of its shares. That means that those short sellers increased the supply of GME stocks, and when their options expire, they are required to buy the shares back from the market to ""reset"". So, people are buying up all the shares, counting on the fact that there is a guaranteed ""greater fool"" because the hedge funds are required to take that position. This is only this much of an issue because of the fact that hedge funds took a huge risk shorting this stock this much.	0.888

Regardless, you can&#39;t know for certain if this is something born of your own hate or if it is something born of your father&#39;s will. Either way, I can see how this is holding you down.

Elon Musk sold off a lot of Tesla stock in the days before Tesla recalled nearly a half million cars. If that’s not the hallmark of a hero, I don’t know what is.   Edit: *insider trading* autocorrected to *a hero*	<p>It seems to me you still don&#39;t understand how stocks work either. Admittedly, plenty of people <em>buying</em> stocks have the same misunderstanding which leads to many bad investments. Tesla <em>produces</em> things which have value. When you buy Tesla stock you own a portion of the capital and assets belonging to Tesla which are used to generate revenue. You are entitled to a portion of it&#39;s profits/retained earnings. If the price of a stock I bought drops I care only in so much as it represents a drop in the value of the company I own. If I own a company and the price drops because nobody else wants to buy it but it still produces goods and generates revenue and I feel it will continue to do so, I do not give a damn about the price. </p>	0.82

Electric Diesel Semis that are cheaper than Rail?  Tesla Automated Taxis that can earn people 30k a year?  8) StarLink?  A system that needs 10k sattelites that have to be replaced every 5 years?  9) Even SpaceX, was built on the idea of being able to launch a rocket, recover it and launch it again in 24 hours, the fastest turn around so far that I can find is 27 days.  The reason his taxes are so high this year is because he is dumping stock like a mad man while his company is so grossly overvalued.  So what if he pays 10 billion in taxes, if he sold 50 billion in stock, thats literal chump change.	<p>They don&#39;t need to &#39;operate&#39; doors.

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he’s going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of “richest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone”	So what you're doing is saying that the team below Musk did all the technical/manual work so Musk deserves none of the credit. This truly isn't fair to Musk or anyone who's started/managed the company. Supposedly he's been somewhat involved in the actual design of the rockets but for the sake of the argument, lets assume that he has 0 contribution. Musk's largest contributions aren't technical. That doesn't mean his contributions aren't significant or Meaningful.	0.887

When I was on vacation in the summertime visiting my nana and pop, various other family members in the uK as a adolescent - the sun Page 3 girl was quite the story to tell my friends when I got home.	It’s much easier to go calling everyone else racist then to actually do something. I raised money for the Equal Justice Initiative last summer in the wake of George Floyd. I didn’t just post a black square and pat myself of the back for being woke. I, like one of my favorite women in history (Elizabeth Pankhurst) believe in deeds not words. I do a lot of volunteer work, at my local homeless shelter, animal shelter, food pantry, women’s shelter, and other organizations. I play with the kids at a disadvantaged school in my city while their parents are taking English classes. I also enjoy working at this community farm located in the middle of a food desert (about 30 minutes south of where I live.) And yet, some woman on tiktok who doesn’t even know me attacked me for listening to jazz music. She said I am stealing from black culture. And she’s not even black. She’s also in her late twenties, whereas I’m only 17, so it was a little scary to be canceled by her. I blocked her and somehow she found my Instagram, and I blocked her again.	0.713

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society). Sure, gender might be important to you, but what will that bring in the end. Ask yourself that.	<p>I feel like this is under-estimated when discussing attraction and intimacy between cis and trans people. It may not be true in all cases, but I&#39;d say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a <strong>subconscious</strong> role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don&#39;t think people are actively saying “I could never date someone who was infertile!” — rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it&#39;s true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it&#39;s rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it&#39;s immediately a given for trans women.</p>	0.862

I wonder why?  I wonder what ur group is trying to cover up?	<p>That’s why if you read between the lines: we aren’t about race but about oppressive systems and the white race happens to sit atop because of history.

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	The logical conclusion of your ""we need to be breaking down stereotypes"" logic is that ""the rules"" should be just as strictly enforced, except, opposite. Wearing women's clothes because you are a woman and want to dress like a woman is bad and reinforcing stereotypes. Presumably, just as much for cis- as well as trans women. So the only people who should dress like women are men, who ought to do it not to feel like women, but to feel no particular way at all, I guess. Therefore the only ""correct"" way to dress is as the opposite gender that you identify as, but not because you associate those items with the opposite gender, that would be bad."	0.92

The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	<p>Also, isn&#39;t it capitalism that supports slavery? I think we both agree that sweatshops are basic child slavery? Under capitalism we simply agree to overlook sweatshops, because we don&#39;t want to pay too much for a tshirt.or a phone, or computer, or the cobalt in out batteries. Child labour, and sex trafficking are all at the hands of capitalism. It&#39;s all done to make more money.</p>	0.885
if someone called me a cracker id laugh in their face.  this is so dumb.  if you’re offended by “cracker” you’re probably a racist.	It's like seeing a black person holding a watermelon.

great argument.	Amazing argument."	0.968
I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.   I see no ideological framework where the use of the word cracker is acceptable whereas the use of other racial slurs are not.	I would be on your side that we tend to label a lot of things as racist when they shouldn't, though I do not believe this has has any impact on the very real racism, and if it has any, it would be negative as it would make closet racists less able to dogwhistle to other closet racists. I don't see how it would help in any way racism.	0.887

> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	Then write this to the OP of the CMV article? I don't think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn't be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can't even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc."	0.883
'Crackers' were Scottish people who settled down in the Southeast United States. They were seen as poor and low class, even as someone a black slave could look down on.  'Cracker' is a racist slur.	I don't think I agree with that at all.  My point was that systemic racism is a system of keeping poor people down and just blaming the poor for their own problems.  This falls disproportionately on black people because of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.  Was that not clear in my post?"	0.831
Ah yes, the classic “calling someone a racist is just as bad, *if not worse actually*, than experiencing racism”	This is the same reasoning why someone calling a black person a racial slur is worse than calling a caucasian person a racial slur.

Why do you think if someone says ""I'm not a pedophile, but"" followed by something only a pedophile would say is okay?

All you had to do is not be racist against white people, but it was too much to ask.  Thanks for proving my point though.  How about we compromise again, "I will join the rest of my superior race in being the only ones held accountable for racism, taking solace that you're content with the perpetual low expectations of non-whites"?	Therefore I am also sympathetic to the view on the left that racism towards white people, and sexism towards men, just isn't the same because there is no element of oppression. And I am sympathetic to the argument that we should reserve the words ""racism"" and ""sexism"" to specifically talk about oppression.

It’s so unfair :( this is the *real* racism in america, unlike those fake problems that people complain about like having 10x less wealth, or dying more frequently due to not having healthcare, or getting killed by the police”	<p>But then I realized how bad police are in some of these places, how people get harassed and everyone knows awful examples of abuse, how many wellness checks end up seriously botched. I realized I know almost no one who had stories of police making a situation better. It doesn’t take too many people getting killed by police before people think you’re a horrible person if you call the police.

>The oldest attested -phobia compound of these kinds in any language is hydrophobia, attested in the Latin works of [Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus). It referred to the rabies symptom where rabid people/animals become dehydrated, but unwilling or unable to drink liquids.   That sounds like exactly what I said. The medical use is the original. Last time I checked, rabies is a medical condition.    >We're talking etymology, where there's no such thing as original meaning. We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written. That gives us the oldest knowable meaning of the term, at least. Here, it's the Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to run".  Nice straw man. It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary. I bet you can't find a reference that doesn't use the word "fear" or some synonym to define it. Go ahead, I'll wait.  Proto Indo European? I want to see your sources on that claim. What is the derived root?   Because I think you just made that up.   [A quick Google tells us](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/%E1%B8%B1ers-) that the PIE root for "run" is "ḱers-" while the [root of "phobia" is from the Greek word "phóbos"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=-phobia), meaning “fear”.	<p>Regardless, it doesn&#39;t even matter. The original claim was that &quot;covid is solved with a shot&quot; and if everyone got vaccinated we wouldn&#39;t have covid anymore. That is not demonstrably true and influenza is the best proxy we have for a similar disease in that it started as a pandemic and is now endemic due to its rate of mutation.</p>	0.778

They are extremely poorly targeted and most people who have received the covid checks have not needed the money. In general you&#39;d be better off spending more on enhanced unemployment benefits, healthcare, food, and housing. Comparatively some debt forgiveness is good because a lot of people are really deeply indebted which can weigh them down for years. I agree a huge issue with these large forgiveness plans is the doctor, lawyer, mba debt. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous when these folks complain about their 100k+ debt expecting the government to pay. However average undergraduate debt is over 30k and there are millions of people with college debt who never graduated and have no way to pay their debt. That&#39;s why targeted programs in the 10-30k debt forgiveness make a lot of sense.</p>	0.879

Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.  Common phrases like "men are trash" and "kill all men" indicate that many people view men as morally inferior people.  Discrimination against men is also accepted in Modern Western Society.  I have read very many stories of male victims of Domestic Violence being arrested rather then helped.  Male offenders get [60% more time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002) for the same crime.	What I see now as opposed to growing up in the 60s n 70s is redefining terms with what seems to be intended results. We talked about racism in the past as hatred based on skin color.

I do not believe in respectability politics where you see a bigot being a bigot (like you) but you cannot call them a bigot (which you are). We need to be able to use words appropriately to be able to communicate - for example, it is appropriate to say that you are a transphobic bigot.

There is no real evidence of objective or universal morality.

I didn’t mean art per say, but arts degrees (could be bachelor of dance, or bachelor of music, or gender studies). Undoubtedly some of these are needed but when you look at the demand for jobs in these areas and contrast it to degrees, many people taking these degrees never get a graduate job and are usually rich young girls studying something they find interesting or someone with a clearly unrealistic view of their skills/talents and/or the job market.  Our taxes should NOT be used to support these people so if we do cancel student debts it should have some sort of criteria that includes familial asset checks, degree type etc.   But people signed up for uni knowing the debt etc and I don’t think they should be bailed out as people going to uni are already privileged ON AVERAGE.

Like you, I'm not exactly worried about trans women dominating sports. I'm worried about all the voices like the individual you were replying to causing trans women to be subjected to hyper scrutiny in an attempt to tear down our validity.	The panic of trans women in right wing media is a solution in search of a problem. You almost never hear them share such *profound concern* over women's sports when they ask for more pay, or are threatened by cut funding or institutional sexism, but when *hypothetical* trans villains are at play, all of a sudden it's priority number 1. Funny that."	0.882
Again, stop using absolutes. You are just showing over and over again that you lack the mental acuity to actually process any of this. Go get a better education. Yours has failed you.	You seem to not even have the concept of respect right. Respect is not earned. Its given. At the start of this debate i gave it to you. You could see this when looking at with how much care i tried to establish an understanding. But look at what you gave me. You did not care.

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	-You’re talking of “bias,” but you’re attempting to discredit “me” based on my education background and not my “points?” Come on… We’re not “finding any evidence” here. Everything we’ve been talking about is textbook biology for 40-100 years.  It’s fairly obvious that this attempt to redefine biological sex isn’t native to biology, but it’s a larger social push for inclusion of marginalized minorities. Whether that is a good thing or not (and my view is that it is), that is TRUE bias encroaching on a field that demands absolute objectivity. And just because this redefinition is a good thing, doesn’t mean that it’s the right or correct thing to do. We depend on science to solve all types of issues, and we need it to remain objective and free of social biases no matter how good the cause is.	0.843

>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	""Racism"" has evolved as well. It used to be a catch-all for anybody experiencing degradation from another race, but now it's evolved to the use of degradation to keep a minority/marginalized group ""down"". That's why white people (in America) can't experience ""racism"", because it's not a tactic used by people in positions of power to keep the white race from advancing its standing in America. This is why you'll often hear ""systemic racism"". So while white people can still experience ""prejudice"", they can't experience ""racism.""	0.898

So you had a car, which many people don’t have. Thanks for agreeing with my point.  It also sounds like you didn’t have kids, since forcing children to live in a car and relying on the slim chance that you get a job that deals with food and lets you have that food in advance of getting paid so you can put food in your children’s mouths is not a realistic path to take. It also sounds like you didn’t have any elderly relatives who relied on you for their wellbeing, who you’d have to abandon if you just took off.  I’m not asking you to feel bad for me. I have a very comfortable life and have no need or desire to get out of my situation. I’m just not so self-centered and short-sighted that I can’t imagine situations that are very different than mine, an ability that you apparently do not possess.	I could have gotten a decent used car for 1K, **maybe**, if I had the time to look. But I didn't.

Humans are different than other animals, they just aren't special or better because they have souls or because they're shaped like a God.	You’re making semantic points within the overall argument and claiming you are correct - outside of the context they were intended in is arguably irrelevant, so there’s that - but you’re also claiming that you can define humanity and I can’t, but haven’t yet actually identified the *only* thing which categorically separates us from animals, which makes me suspicious that you don’t know what it is.	0.886

First, I said "perhaps you believe"? I didn't accuse you of anything.      I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly. Then why would humans not killing eachother be any measure of us being "special"?   You want to talk about non sequiturs?     Riddle me that.      And don't blame your inability to CMW as my fault?	It's not like there is some fundamental right to owning dangerous animals, we all saw Tiger King and found the people in it to be nutjobs, thinking they can just keep a bunch of tigers and lions as pets and expect anything less than disaster.

I agree with you completely, but as a white guy when I get asked about race on an application that spends more time talking about efforts at diversity than the job requirements… it’s clear I’m not the type of applicant they’re looking for.  Honestly though this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.  The sooner we start focusing on giving everybody an equal opportunity in life instead of measuring equality by outcomes, the better.	<p>Then write this to the OP of the CMV article? I don&#39;t think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn&#39;t be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can&#39;t even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc.</p>	0.911
Yes, and humans kill eachother all the time too.     Great argument for why humans are special.	There are a lot of things we do that have a tremendous effect on things around us. As a species we inadvertently kill all the time. We've brought extinctions to plants, animals and civilizations.	0.851
> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.  That is not obvious at all.

“Academics and politicians”  Right, because what the peasants think doesn’t matter. It’s not like we elect politicians or anything. The definition of words doesn’t change because of who’s in power. That’s some “alternate facts” bullshit.   Racism is something in your heart. It’s something you believe. Prejudice just refers to any kind of vague preconceived notion about an out group. Racism refers to a preconceived notion specifically about people based on their race.   OPPRESSION is power + prejudice. Racism just means you believe people are inferior based on race.   And don’t gaslight us, I remember reading this definition for racism in like 2014. Not the 60s.	The thing is that unless you're racist, you really don't care that other people of your race succeed, especially if you're not succeeding. And forcing people into that perspective is how you get neo-nazis and white supremacists."	0.884
To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.	<p>This doesn&#39;t stop it from being racist. Instead, it justifies certain types of racism. Since the term &quot;racism&quot; has a negative connotation, a lot of people feel it&#39;s easier to refer to such policies as not being racist - instead of trying to argue how some forms of racism are justified. The latter is more honest. I&#39;m not even going to go into how affirmative action harms minorities (who are only accepted into universities due to affirmative action).</p>	0.873

The Roma whom my gf was translating for were originally from either Romania or Moldova, where Romanian is a common language. Therefore when they move to the UK they can speak their Roma language, and Romanian but not English. There are not Roma translators available so they were tried in Romanian, in which they were fluent.   You're either deliberately misunderstanding a very clear statement to troll or are just really dense.	Now it is true that these countries do broadly speaking create defined ethnic groups we can measure to some degree. So you might argue that people of Anglo-Saxon descent are ""ethnically British"", but what happens if they move away? A German baby raised by French parents in France would not spontaneously adopt German cultural values, so the formation of ethnocultures is typically an accident, not a requirement. When it is a result of happenstance, these cultures are typically welcoming of people from other ethnic groups who are willing to adapt to the native culture."	0.763

I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements. Or the movie Thor, or Coco. It's is wrong just in some moments.	0.872

Based solely on the title, I agree completely.  To me, the answer is a very small tax on assets. People who accumulate a lot to themselves drain the economy and distort society with their increasing wealth gap.	<p>Most people who run corporations like this only care about their avarice, their love of wealth, their obsession of maximizing profits. With little care for the well-being of their labor or the working class in general. What matters is money, money, money. Not just profitability, an unsustainable and harmful level of wealth generation that engenders the conditions that increase suicides.</p>	0.856

I agree with you for more reasons than what you gave. On top of irrefutable proof of covid's danger to the deniers/ignorers, people would die too quickly for the virus to spread this quickly.	<p>Since covid is highly infectious, it only takes one infected person to threaten a large number of others in a high risk environment. Due to the numbers involved, even with a vaccine passport system, there would be enough fraud (and enough difficulty identifying which individuals actually committed the fraud), that there would still be great risk in large gathering; thus making all the work involved ineffective.</p>	0.871
>Programmers do, those go more into machine code or very low level programming languages.  The meaning of the bytes is determined by the program. There may be some assembly language that map those bytes to a specific CPU instruction, but that's true of any integer, there's no reason to avoid those code points for that reason.  So you can load a number into the CPU as an instruction, but you can also load it as data, and computers are good at not getting mixed up as they work.	<p>Let us consider some really advanced AI that has the incredible power of differentiating between objects, ideas, concepts and other things. Yet this AI is still a computer, presumably working with chips and zeros and ones.

Yes, I absolutely agree that black people, on average, are less intelligent than white people.  The question is WHY. Do you hold to the belief that primarily because of genetics or environment? You seem to imply genetics in your post but you never say, I'll assume that I'm correct and go ahead and ask the question.  How can you design an IQ test that tests for genetic intelligence capabilities?	<p>Right now, racism can&#39;t be justified. We have studies saying that black people aren&#39;t genetically dumber.

You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	<p>The real solution is to accept the short comings of socialism and capitalism and merge them to create a better system. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have 2 billion or 3 billion, in both cases you&#39;re insanely rich. So you can easily afford to pay more taxes. Those taxes can be used to assist those that need it. Giving the poor means of escaping poverty. You&#39;re forgetting that people are an asset. So by investing in people&#39;s education, they can become more productive and innovative members of society, which leads to a better economy, which means more taxes which means a better life for all.</p>	0.888

The joke when it comes to health care in the state is that we currently pay the most for it and get some of the worst bang for the buck.   If I'm a citizen making 20 k a year health care is free.   I would much rather have a free service from the government in which where I'm guaranteed health care than the piecemeal system we currently have.	Add in the facts that controlling costs with Medicaid and Medicare forces companies to charge its paying customers more to cover bottom line and profits. The end customer doesn't really see costs since insurance obfuscates the price. American demographics are also highly skewed towards higher cost per individual plus more individuals in the system that anywhere else, 300 million. Also, the American medical system is one of the most regulated markets in the world. It's a perfect storm of half measures. There's no other system quite like the American medical system in the world to compare.	0.856
Do we have national health care? Last time I checked the answer is no. We have a system based on private  for profit insurance.   Such a sad person you are you are to call me a liar over facts you don't like.   Have a great life pal. Good bye.	<p>If your concern is that &quot;look, some of the best doctors only take private insurance and they don&#39;t take medicare because their reimbursement rate is so low&quot;, then a single payer program is actually going to fix that problem. Right now providers can pick and choose how to make their money. If there was only one payer for their services, where are they going to go aside from taking this new Single Payer program? Some may be worried about &quot;brain drain&quot; and we&#39;ll lose doctors to other advanced economies and honestly there is no where else in the world that has that much money in their healthcare system as the US. Where are they going to go? Germany has Universal healthcare, Canada has it too, UK has NHS, etc etc. China? Japan? All some form of single payer system with reimbursement rate lower than what the US has, so where are they going to go to make the big money? No where. They&#39;ll stay in the US because at the end of the day doctors are not robots. They have families, friends, etc here. USA as a global reserve currency also means that the same $ you get paid here, goes a lot further elsewhere if you retire to another country too. At the end of the day, staying here in the USA, even under a single payer system, will be the best pay they will see.</p>	0.875

If you eliminate rental properties, then demand for decent property to own would go WAY up. Then home prices would skyrocket along with the number of trailer parks.  That's how economics works. Landlords make it possible for young people with limited resources to have a safe place to live.  I rented for 16 years before buying a house.	<p>When we had our first child we knew we wanted to move out of that neighborhood to a better one by the time they reach school age. We scrimped and saved every penny. When we finally got to the point we could afford to buy a new house (took about 4 years of saving). We decided to rent our duplex since the housing market was cheap at the time. That&#39;s when we found out how difficult it can be to be a landlord. The local municipalities have all kinds of expensive regulations to adhere to, to protect renters. Now, we had two properties to maintain. Also, the process of weeding through potential tenants can be very daunting. Our hard work paid off. Over the 5 years we rented we had wonderful tenants and we never raised the rent regardless of the prevailing rent prices around us. When the housing market came back we sold at a modest profit. </p>	0.831
Definitely agree with you on how coopted it has become, but given that “woke” originated in black communities (and i’m white), i’m not really ready to tell black people to stop using language they created because dumbass right-wingers have taken over their language	<p>The &quot;white moderates&quot; would say the same thing.

Ultimately, you&#39;re still telling black people how they should respond to racism &quot;the right way&quot;, which is something MLK was very obviously against.

Landlords are those folk whom know little to nothing about investment or they would invest in something mush more profitable and much less worry / trouble all they provide is high housing prices.	<p>That has more to do with your housing market and less to do with social democracy.

Yeah, no, you're wrong, but by all means keep defending pedophiles. I'm sure you'll find yourself on the right side of history.  It is actually difficult to find the EXACT studies you're looking for.

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids. I'm ready to bet, you not gonna help him, you not gonna network with him, you will tell him to fuck off.  One of my best friends turned out to be a pedophile just a couple years ago. I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	<p>I&#39;m confused, because you said this is not the way politics works, but this is exactly what I&#39;m asking for. I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not enough to just say &quot;61% of people care about crime.&quot; You have to analyze how <em>much</em> they care about it, and who do they think will do a better job of solving it. None of the data you&#39;ve presented shows that people care about crime more than other issues, or that they think Democrats are not the ones who will solve it.</p>	0.846

A pedophile is someone who has a sexual attraction to children.  You don't look up pictures of pretend children if you aren't sexually attracted to children. You are welcome to delude yourself into believing otherwise, but that is incorrect. So, sorry that calling a spade a spade and pointing out how abhorrent your position is upset you.

It&#39;s great for enhancing the evidence, but without the discretion to turn it off, you may well not get the evidence at all.

We will never get rid of the “virus” because the media will keep pushing it out. With a survival rate of 99.89%, and no symptoms.

I can’t blame everybody though, most people just turn on the news in the morning and don’t even think to question anything they hear. The competent will survive this fake pandemic, because we just ignore the communist rules.	That's a fantastic leap in logic. No one has to treat this seriously because it's patently different and does not follow logically from requiring vaccination for a virus that has caused one of the most infectious pandemics in history. One literally involves killing a human, could incur serious psychological trauma, and does not clearly prevent any potential harm to others.

Anecdote time!  I worked at Fuddruckers for like 6 or 7 years. For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.  I understand VERY WELL that parents need a break, but not at the expense of random people I don't know.	But a few months ago, I went to a restaurant with an option for a completely custom burger. Choice of meat, a huge list of toppings, and choice of bun were all offered. My two friends and I all did the custom option. Me and one of the friends went way too hard on the toppings and both of us were somewhat grossed out by our choices. The one friend who kept his relatively simple, sticking mostly to traditional burger toppings and not overloading, was laughing at us as he housed his burger."	0.872
When my children were younger, it only took ONE follow through. They were told that if they didn't behave respectfully in the restaurant, we were going home. The older one decided to test this.

You can bet, the next time we went to a restaurant, the kids behaved themselves!	<p>Eventually, you reach the point you feel safe letting your kids out to play without stressing.

You’re evidently child-free, so why don’t you go enjoy your water in a place that doesn’t allow children?	Imagine being forced to live as the opposite gender you are now.

You have no one outside maybe a couple friends (most people in this situation have little to zero social network) who you can talk to. If you try to do what makes you feel right you are punished, you have your games, tv, phone, etc all taken away because you won't conform. You are confined to your home unless you're with your family, you have zero recourse, you are essentially a prisoner to your own parents. What do you think you'd do after a year? Two years? Five? How long before suicide doesn't seem like that bad of an option? You can't get away from the situation, your parents aren't doing anything illegal.

I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.  Anywho, here’s a delta! Happy Friday!	For the record, all of the weight shit is super relevant to me.  I've always had more strength than mass, and lacking reserves is not so good for extended work.  I was always a sprinter, high output for short times.  135 pounds and deadlifting 600.  Benchpressing 210 like it was nothing.  I'm not like that, anymore, but the extra mass has helped with my tendency to push until burnout.  I literally have more to give with a ""spare tire"" than I ever did as a lean machine.

This is exhausting! You are asking a first year college philosophy question. And it's an ancient apologetics arguement. By (supposedly) clever wordplay, setting up  logically opposite parameters, you attempt to make your strawman God-concept impossible.  It's the equivilent of asking if God can make a rock so heavy that He can't lift it.   The scenario is so sophmoric and naive, it's the type of a question that needs more than an answer. Please come back after you pass your third year philosophy classes.	<p>I think this is the reason McWhorter, in his latest book that I admittedly have not finished, talks about the idea that not everyone needs a college degree. I believe it was him that talked about the idea that a teen that would have done great in community College gets screwed because they are elevated into something that is over thier head.</p>	0.819
I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	Saying ""violating bodily rights via scientifically tested methods is not the same as violating bodily rights via unsafe methods"" is extremely similar to what a religious zealot would say. Just replace ""via scientifically tested methods"" with ""in the interest of sending people to heaven"" and it's the same picture. The distinction doesn't matter because it doesn't matter to the ""idiots"" who don't want to be vaccinated (or be sent to heaven). Even if the ""idiots"" survive the vaccine (or are sent to the afterlife) they'll still experience the trauma of going through something that they thought was going to kill them.	0.891

To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.

Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	<p>Why should anti-vaxxers be a protected class?

Yes actually humans can and do cause earthquakes and even cancer. In fact cancer is so prevalent nowadays largely due to human chemicals.   As for natural disasters they are supposed to happen.

I’m not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it “the problem of evil”, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can’t exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions. It’s an interesting debate!	Also while you are correct that atheism isn't a religion, it should be grouped in with religions when religion and beliefs are discussed because it is a belief about faith and god.

It's like cognitive dissonance so thick and concentrated you could eat it with a spoon.      You want to argue that   >it should be made free to all citizens and be easily obtainable.      Yet are literally forming bullshit arguments that make no sense in order to justify saying the exact opposite.      You can't even make this shit up, it's so stupid it could only be a reddit comment someone actually believes.   Trolls can't even pretend to be this dumb.	> This is my biggest pet peeve because anybody could label anything “human rights” and effectively shut down any and all opposing debate. For example, say I’m a Karen who thinks forgetting to put pickles on the cheeseburger I ordered is a violation of human rights.	0.864
Damn bro your seething. What's so hard to grasp? I get the point of an argument but I fight against its active implication because it's blatantly obvious why said politicians are doing it. And therefor believe that blanket statements applying racist motives to voters is morally wrong.	Not sure why you feel this is relevant really? Of course my opinions offend a lot of people. A lot of people's opinions offend me. That's sort of how opinions work. But even on reflection, no, none of my views are what I would consider overtly racist etc. Unless, you know, questioning the assumptions something like CRT is built on and thinking it is in fact more racist than what it purports to correct, is a flaming neo-Nazi viewpoint worthy of being fired, or worse. Because that's exactly what I fear over exact that kind of opinion being used maliciously.	0.901
ok mr honda civic. but when a they/them looks like a woman I will call her a woman BECAUSE SHE LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN. I DONT GO ASKING PEOPLE FOR THEIR PRONOUNS FIRST IF I WANT TO TALK TO THEM. If his or her name is male or female i will call her/him by male or female because I can not adapt to using broken fucking english. "They" is multiple people or things. I cannot say they is because that does not make sense	no, i am not going to treat someone with a beard, Adam's apple ane man's demeanour as a woman because that basically means that i am denying common sense. someone with gender dysphoria, as evident with people who transition proves that people go to lengths in order to alleviate that dysphoria. i am not going to to extend the same branch to someone who isn't even trying and wants to be called a different gender just because of self identification because that's absurdly inconvenient.	0.874
Funny how you interpret someone thinking you're dumb as a brick as anger. Might want to think about why you do that, could learn something.      >therefor believe that blanket statements applying racist motives to voters is morally wrong.      Cool, keep arguing for the side of racists for their racist and power hungry agendas. It's actually even more sad that you don't even realize it, you're in blissful ignorance, at least most of the other ones are smart enough to realize what agenda they're pushing.      >Can you not grasp someone wanting to have a state election verified by state agency issued id's      No, I can not. It is absolutely stupid beyond belief, if you understand the entire system around it and it's implementation.   But of course, you don't.      Enjoy... that.	So, you're saying that people are willing to throw away the rational arguments against racism if they know that other people are having racist thoughts that they suppress? To me this is an extremely dangerous situation. We keep the racism in check just by people that have racist thoughts pretending they don't have racist thoughts. We may end up in an explosive situation where a small openly racist sparkle triggers a huge number of people becoming openly racists. People who we didn't even know were racists.	0.918
I'm done arguing with you. One of us is right but none of us are wrong. We are just 2 idiots arguing from the 3rd mans perspective. I think their is not 1 person and you think it is. No one will win this argument because we both think we are in the right	<p>People don&#39;t (generally) just randomly do things for no reason at all with no forethought or motivation and then feel nothing about it. We have brains that have to decide and then respond to whatever we do and that&#39;s just not how brains generally work. The fact that people can feel good or at least morally justified when they do things that are objectively bad for their material comfort, social standing, survival, or whatever other concrete advantage but that they perceive to be right is because many people hold helping others to be a good in itself.</p>	0.865

First of all I am not u/ralph-j. And secondly:  >The only appropriate way to call **someone** by non-binary is by their name or a new word.  Someone clearly indicates that you're talking about a singular person and as such "their" refers to that person, doesn't it?	And if it was the only main meaning, then therein lies my previous argument... It is not the dictionary that has it wrong, but *you*. If you're not an adult male, but an adult female, that wants to be known as a man.. sorry, but you are not, by the very definition as presented in the world's English language dictionaries, ""man"".	0.79
This is why humanity is doomed. I wanted to just end the conflict because none of our opinions matter at the end of the day here but you go on to ramble on	And then you described the alignment problem over and over. And over. Yup, we get it. Odds are, we fuck it up and everyone dies. But everyone was going to die anyway. And if you think this is all a pipe dream after all, there's nothing to worry about in the first place, right? So either the alignment problem is important and we need to solve it, or it doesn't matter because AI was never going to do anything anyway. Your argument lacks internal consistency.	0.892
My point was that a) I am not the person you had that debate with initially and b) that you're claim that you use they/them/their in plural form only is demonstrably false by the fact that you used it in that way in that same sentence most likely without even realizing it so natural is that use of language to you.	Funnily enough, your confusion about the data set is the exact point of the CMV, you weren't made aware that there was an ""unproven"" category, and have been misled by the way it was represented."	0.866
Yes. I read that you are not the original person i had the debate with and b) stop fucking arguing already and don't argue with me if im an idiot because smart people are hard argue with and idiots are impossible to argue with	<p>And it’s maddeningly egotistical for people like you to argue otherwise, which is probably why you feel attacked so often, because you’re doing the exact opposite of what you think you’re doing (staying neutral) while also preemptively shielding yourself from any criticism of your ideology with thought-terminating cliches like “oh I’m not political” or “oh why can’t everyone just be treated equal, that will solve everything.” Like, no, it won’t, because people aren’t equal <strong>right now</strong>, so you can’t start treating people equally and then judge them on the footrace they’re running when a substantial portion of our population is 50 yards behind the starting line with a broken leg.</p>	0.885
>fucking arguing already and don't argue with me if im an idiot because smart people are hard argue with and idiots are impossible to argue with  That's a weird philosophy. Often enough misunderstandings are not about being smart or stupid but about having different perspectives and showing other people something that they haven't seen is usually a good way to change that. Also if you're not interested in debating ideas, why do you post here?	If you *truly* believe you're on the right side of an argument, allowing the other side a chance to explain the inconsistencies themselves pokes holes in their argument and ultimately allows *them* to make the change towards your side. More often then not when I've used this technique, people go ""Hey.. Yeah I dunno, you're right that's kinda weird."" And strong opinions don't change in a day, but insulting them does nothing but make them dig their heels in even more.	0.911

I've worked at a place where my colleagues are the type that asks that about others. It was not a good place to work at. Narrow-minded, judgemental, lots of microaggression. If you're not a Christian praising your parents, then you're a bad person. After I left that place, I noticed a huge difference to my health, self-esteem, and confidence. Someone who asks that kind of question to judge others say more about the small world they live in than the person they're hoping to judge.

Anarcho capitalism is a fundamentally unworkable system. It would at best lead to fuedalism and at worst lead to some sort of plutocratic anarchy hellscape. We've seen the US's original government being scrapped in favor of the current one because it's failure to raise unified forces and others protections offered by tax revenue of the government. The US got libertarianism instead until the 1920s, which is a life version of Anarcho capitalism which failed because even the lite version, libertarianism, is unsustainable due to the fact that people are selfish. However, radical idealists will suspend belief and willfully overlook the fallacies to claim that anything short of mixture of ideas is truly workable.	The right answers to the conundrum are a jobs guarantee and UBI, and you want the former to be more appealing than the latter. You can't run capitalism indefinitely with no social safety net and with no government option and no checks on monopolization, it just starts deteriorating into a giant rent-seeking arms war race to the bottom that stifles growth and innovation, impoverishes the majority of the population, creates civil unrest and allows bad faith actors to manipulate politics with money, and basically undermines the stability of the entire nation."	0.898

Children of narcissists don't have "relations" with their parents so much as they have defensive strategies induced by years of trauma.	<p>this hurt them in a lot of ways, they could only make friends with other homeschooled kids and their lives were so insular and cyclical that they became little echo chambers they build for themselves. Social norms were alien and as they grew older they wound up regressing a bit until the rest of us, adults, couldn&#39;t relate to them and hanging out with them felt more like babysitting someone&#39;s kid than hanging out with a mentally deep adult..... and sometimes people just don&#39;t want to do that.</p>	0.845

There&#39;s no black and white answer to that. What&#39;s the accurate way to measure that? Considering how society fails to realise the legitimacy/severity of men&#39;s issues even to this day, it&#39;s going to be hard to calculate who&#39;s had it harder.

All I know is my Raiders were 4-0 in OT games this year, so I say leave it lol.	<p>Ultimately though, nobody is a &quot;contender&quot; at 0-0. It&#39;s the NFL. Even most really good teams have maybe a 10% shot in any given year unless you&#39;re Tom Brady. The most favored team in the league right now is the Chiefs at +550. That effectively translates to a less than 20% chance. If that&#39;s all it takes to be a &quot;contender&quot; then the Packers and every other 2021 division champ certainly fall into that category.</p>	0.774

That Bills/KC game was amazing. Two evenly matched teams giving their all with spectacular plays on both sides. The winner came down to a coin flip. They should be able to answer the TD with the next kickoff in OT, and back and forth til one doesn’t make it. I could have watched that for hours. The NFL needs to reconsider their rules at least during playoffs that was bullshit	<p>Again I agree Super Bowls are a team sport.

> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand. And you set standards which we have no interest or benefit in following then condemn us for not following them. Eat shit dude.	Anyways, since i know you wont respond positively to that (or this comment in general lol), ill give you a more proper response to that.

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	That extra button push you're hearing is the edit key being pressed twice which is required to start and complete an edit, plus of course his strafe keys clacking. That particular player also plays on rather high latency so the timing needs to be even more perfect. Regardless of whether he can be a pixel or several off in his crosshair placement, consistent, large and fast mouse movements are required. Here's a better example of near perfect mouse precision and timing in a controlled environment: https://youtu.be/rhGq7_FGmTY.

>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.  If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.   Normalization and encouragement of children questioning their sex will increase suicides.  &#x200B;  >if people spent less time telling them they're attention seeking, pervert, liars they wouldn't have so much self loathing  The self-loathing is primarily from their physical body not matching their desires; no one says anything to them, people are too afraid to be shamed, judged, and fired.   Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?

Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.  The pandemic is over. It’s the politicians and media that want to keep it going for personal gain.	I'm not particularly thrilled with the way insurance is run, and in theory Is like to think that a single payer government run program could be more fair but in practice, CMS is as scrupulous in his then manage Medicare as any private insurer is.

In my 30s, unvaccinated. I just recovered a few days ago after roughly 3 days of actually feeling sick.   I don't intend to vaccinate, and I'm open to having my mind changed, but I see the same talking points over and over, and I still don't see the value. I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish. Not to mention, having recovered, I now have antibodies to eradicate any exposure I have in the future.	<p>I don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories about vaccines, I work every day, came from a working class family, i am white, and I&#39;m Christian. I choose not to get vaccines for several reasons. Because I believe willingly submitting to pharmakea (medicines) is to say that God cannot heal you. I haven&#39;t been sick in years, except pneumonia which I recovered from quickly without medicines. (Albeit, in order to soothe my cough I did sip of tea and honey, as well as dayquil. I felt pretty terrible for doing that.) In addition to my faith, I have had reactions to some vaccines in the army and as a kid. Nothing terrible, but uncomfortable. And masks aren&#39;t oppressive,  I agree these people can be delusional. Although, I can see the logic of it as well. Governments of the past have done terrible things starting with something as small as mandating the possession of a shovel and hardhat. Then blossoming that into mandatory drills, which intern led to a militarized civilian force that could easily train brainwashed soldiers more quickly and efficiently. History is a good teacher of how to prevent a dark future. Though thinking of America performing such a feat is a reach. Doesn&#39;t hurt to be cautious.</p>	0.875

People seem to ignore that. Which I brought the Nazis argument because everyone blames not only the higher ups like the Hitlers or Goebbels but the german soldiers or nazi soldiers since again lazy people love to just put everyone else&#39;s groups in one and we held them accountable as Hitler and Goebbels so with that same standard we should apply that to the soldiers and military personal.

mate that's because you're suggesting an idiotic thing in "Muhammad isn't idolised".  are you really trying to suggest me that a Jefferson or Gandhi statue is just attacked because people don't like that statue. or is it because people don't like the person whom the statue represent.  and i wasn't talking about metaphorical statues. i was talking about putting someone at a pedestal, idolising someone and to take you word at its face value, I'll have to go against the word of all four schools of Islam that covers all Muslims.   and no shit different things means different to different people. That still doesn't change the fact that Islam declares Muhammad as an ideal man. you're challenging me on my knowledge of Islam but it seems like you know nothing about it.	Not criticising the extremist aspects of Islam actually harms moderate Muslims who are lumped in with the extremists and gives actual racists the opportunity to recruit more people as the perception is that the mainstream left are hypocrites who condemn in Christianity what they seem to ignore or excuse in Islam (I won't go as far to say ""condone"" as I don't think I've heard many on the left say they agree with the more extremist aspects of Islam, but ""condone"" could be used if meaning staying silent)	0.896

I agree w/ you.   There's very few policies which make the offer "you can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year and it won't detract from the quality of life a single living person."

I believe that in the US an employer cannot *legally* force you to do so. However, that doesn't mean that the employee won't be aware that they're going to be fired if they don't ""keep up"" or else you might be... ""let go"" due to ""budget concerns."" Many employers don't even need cause, but those who do can probably conjure some cause within a month even if you've otherwise been a perfect employee."	0.85

> Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns.  This is just whataboutism being used as a red herring. Nobody is talking about mass shootings here. Mass shootings have nothing to do with this discussion. Literally nothing.  >You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.  So let's be real on a few things here. First of all 2.5 million is bonkers-insane-nuts completely unsupported by facts. There are stats put out by individual cities, and from those stats, we know that the real number can't be anywhere close to that high.  But, as a fun fact, the reason why the CDC doesn't have more accurate numbers, is because it's legally forbidden from sponsoring that sort of research, As our Republican institutions and entities that receive public funding. The NRA lobbied hard for a law making it illegal for us to find out how often self-defense happens relative to other gun actions..  I think that speaks pretty clearly to what the numbers would show if we could actually do that research.  Second of all, 60,000 per year is nothing. That's 1 in 6,667.  Considering that there are 48 lotteries in this country each doing multiple drawings daily, that's roughly how many people win the lottery per year.  If that happens to you, yes, you are a statistical unicorn. That's not misleading; that's fact.   But let's not stop there, because in fact, even that number is wildly inflated by law enforcement statistics being mixed in.  Yes, one in 6,667 of us may engage in acts of self-defense, but most of the people included in that stat are not people in their own house. They are people whose jobs put them in conflict with people, like law enforcement.  That's a totally different scenario.  But don't take my word for it, do this simple search for yourself: Go to news.google.com, pick a large city with over a million people in it, and just search and that city specifically over the last year, for stories about home invasions and self-defense  How many did you find? 10? 20? That's my point exactly. That sort of scenario is super rare. It happens, but it's not going to happen to you. You aren't that lucky/unlucky.    > Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  The only one of us attempting to mislead, is you, with the red herring at the start..   > That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  It can be both. You know the famous Seattle study showed that there were roughly seven suicide attempts and four accidental shootings for every self-defense shooting in Seattle In 1998.  The conclusion from that is pretty clear, that you are a bigger risk to yourself from your own gun, then people who would do harm to you are at risk from it.  That's just facts.	<p>Let me explain a little further. Leftist policies do not refer to...most anything the Democratic party has actually accomplished in the past several dozen years. Making healthcare slightly more affordable for only some of the populace is not a leftist policy. Putting more women of color in powerful positions is not a leftist policy. Massively increasing incarceration, allowing ICE to continue existing, expanding the drone bombings of innocent civilians, doing nothing of note to decrease the enormous wealth inequality of the nation, doing nothing to prevent the impending ecological collapse of the planet, and criminalizing whistleblowers are all obviously not leftist policies.</p>	0.869
Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here? Cause a "realist" would clearly see that your engagement in the discussion is 100% ideological motivated.	The problem is that it's not anti-discrimination legislation that segments populations by groups. It's society itself that does that through its biases and the discrimination. Repealing all anti-discrimination legislation tomorrow isn't going to change the fact that people will be seen as part of an identity and a community based on their characteristics.

No, I'm suggesting that if you're cmv is; *people shouldn't be idolised*, then picking a religion that already not only agrees with that, but has it as a sin, is stupid.

First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	Sorry Deborah, I know you grew up in an era where your trans sister wasn't considered a woman and you're struggling to come to terms with the idea that a penis isn't actually manhood, but considering there's like 4 billion women on earth, it's time to stop acting like womanhood is some sort of special, exclusive club that you can gatekeep access to.	0.857

\^ Imagine raising this person LMAO. Your mom must have committed suicide by the time you were 15.	My grandma had Alzjeimers for over 10 years. At then, the only thing keeping her alive werr forced feedings and meds... why?!? If her body wants to die, why not let her family make that choice legally. At that point its not even assisted ""suicide"", its allowing life to takes its natural course. When our family finally got permission to change her care, she dies within a day. Imagine how long she had been eady to go for?!?! She suffered unimaginably... she was once found by my aunt in agony (but has lost her speech by then). Xrays revealed a crush injury in her hips that could only have been caused by falling or being dropped.

You're clearly not a good Psych grad, because anyone who was would know that DID has nothing to do with transgender people. And if you actually were a psych grad, you'd also know what gender dysphoria is - something completely separate from DID. And you'd know that the validity of gender dysphoria is only disputed by transphobes, but it's a very real condition.   The fact that you even tried to bring in DID shows that you're here in bad faith.	Anyways, what's your alternative? We're not going to just stop existing because people don't like us or think we're crazy.

That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too.

When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people.

Disagree. We should be turning the vulnerable into Soylent Green pet food	Yeah, fair. I think this supports a stance we'd probably both agree on ""food should be grown where it grows best"". The point I was trying to make, which I don't think I made super well was in two parts: 1) everyone eating like vegans eat now probably means crops have to be grown in places that don't grow them well. This was raised as an issue when the whole ""100 mile diet"" fad came around. Growing crops like that is inefficient and pretty wasteful, and might have certain environmental problems. Is it doable? I mean, probably yeah, but it'd be different and that's worth recognizing and considering those implications. 2) Cattle are usually grazed and then grain finished (i.e. they eat grass for most of their lives, and then they are rapidly fattened with grains). Sustainable cattle farming would probably mean all or almost all grass fed (grass-fed beef is currently a premium product, the cattle take 25-40% longer to raise). This would work very well with the idea of fertilizing resting fields, and very importantly \*it means cattle can be fed with land that isn't farmland\*. No one would need to grow any crops for entirely grass-fed cattle, but I'd imagine that would put most beef production into the Midwestern US. Cattle can eat grass, humans cannot. I mean, you can, but it's got basically no calories for us and it tastes kinda bad. Basically I'd say we should grow about as much cattle as we can support without having to plant grains to feed them, because that's inefficient for a whole lotta reasons.	0.737

Look at the difference in sentiment to someone killing cows for meat vs someone torturing cows for fun. What's the basis for the disparity, when you get right down to it? You can claim that one has a benefit to outweigh it, but this doesn't hold up - nobody is *outraged* by meat being wasted more than other food, so it's not about that. It's because there's big category-walls that prevent us-and-ours being slaughtered for food along with cows (along with a massive specific taboo against eating people), so we just don't think it's a threat - whereas *recreational torture* isn't confined to species boundaries, and someone who tortures animals for funsies isn't someone you want intercepting your kid on their way home from school.	0.915

No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents’ fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.

Your instincts serve you well. VAERS already has more than 22,000 death reports from the vaccines, which is needless to say far, far more deaths than every single other vaccine combined. Most vaccines are pulled from the market after just a few dozen deaths. This is absolutely unprecedented to recommend a vaccine to young people, at zero risk for serious symptoms from the virus (not a single kid who didn’t have leukemia died with coronavirus let alone of it), that is potentially fatal. Not just that, everyone by this point knows someone or many people who’ve had bad side effects. My wife’s very pro vaccine friend has had vertigo and other alarming side effects for months after her booster, another family friend went to the ER for heart issues two days after the second shot, and my 37-year-old former classmate from both high school and college died within 48 hours of her second shot. She didn’t want the vaccine but had to get it if she wanted to be involved with her kids at school; she left behind two young children.   That aside, who are you trusting exactly? Big Pharma? Dr. Fauci? All people who get a nice payday when everyone is vaccinated, even though there’s zero medical reason that anyone under 55 should need a vaccine against the sniffles. It’s all scare tactics, the emperor has no clothes. They throw this huge number at you - oh but 860,000 people have died from it!! No they haven’t. Who said that?! 860,000 people perhaps had it at the time of death? Sure, but they didn’t die from it. In fact the average person had 3-4 other underlying issues and that’s right from the CDC. About 3 million people die per year, so yes, a certain number of those people will happen to have Covid because it’s widespread. If you look at who actually just flat out died of Covid, it’s 5% of that figure. 5!! That’s as many people as die of the seasonal flu.   When people say trust the science, you know, I do. I have since the very start actually. The science says you don’t need a vaccine if something isn’t a threat to you. It says right now the vaccines don’t stop infection, don’t prevent the spread, and stop illness but may prevent more serious side effects (if the vaccine doesn’t kill your, of course). The guy who invented mRNA vaccines, incidentally, Dr. Robert Malone, is a die hard anti-vaccine mandate advocate and said that under no circumstances should mRNA vaccines be injected into people. That’s right from the guy who invented the technology. But why trust him, right?! I’m sure he didn’t risk his reputation to speak out for any particular reason.	more people have long lasting side effects that harm them in the long run with covid than anyone has been hurt by the vaccines that have rolled out. more people have died with covid than have gotten blood clots (by J and J) or died from the vaccines (i’m pretty sure only 1 or 2 ppl have died from the covid vaccines but feel free to fact check me cause even if it’s more the chances of you dying from covid is much greater)."	0.893

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	I expressed plainly and clearly from the beginning what it is I’m searching for here: I’m looking for examples of governments who failed to protect their citizens then gained more influence as a result. The status quo claim is that climate change will result in individuals giving up more rights so the government can protect them from global warming, but this claim ignores the fact that the collective might of multiple world governments has failed to protect us.	0.871
Many would say that political ideologies such as Capitalism or Communism or Humanism are just as much “religions” as Christianity or Judaism or Islam.   If we define religion as a belief system derived from outside of what science can provide us, which many do, then we aren’t experiencing a transition *away* from religion. We’re experiencing a transition to *different* religions.	<p>It would be one thing if we argued that no religion can be the one objective truth of morality. But that is infrequently the case. Most of the time the people who are islamaphobic have convenient excuses for why Christianity or Catholicism are preferable.</p>	0.832
I completely agree. Parenting isn't a job you graduate from when the kid is 18. Different boundaries or dynamics may have to be placed as the person ages but parents should always be a source of support. In essence it's about building a community together. I want my kids to not fear where they'll get money for food or rent or tuition. I want them to know they can always come home. I want them to have a stress free young adulthood for as long as physically possible so they get to explore and experience themselves as much as they can at the start of their adult lives. It makes for happier, healthier, well rounded and well adjusted adults. Adults who care about other people. The idea that at 18 you're suddenly expected to have everything sorted and survive on your own is a garbage, modern day farce demanded most prominently by capitalism and is not actually how rearing young humans should work. Many people, not because they're lazy or unmotivated, simply aren't ready to launch right at 18. That's normal. That should be ok. They should have a support system.	The only way that changes is by making fathers staying home more normalized and increasing the value society places on fathers. If the kids are being raised by a stay at home mom and a working father it’s in their best interest for the mom to get primary custody they’re used to their mom taking care of them. As long as women are seen as the primary caretaker they’re going to get custody more often it only makes sense. As far as abolishing child support that has nothing to do with women it would hurt children it’s literally money to help take care of your child."	0.887
CNN, is that you? Because not a single thing I wrote is anything but a verifiable fact. The drug companies and global elites LOVE it that you’ll do their dirty work for them! It’s amazing. Not a single part of the entire Covid narrative has been true, not one, from the very start. And unless you’ve been in a coma you’ve probably realized that my side has been correct about everything, not wrong once. 1) It wasn’t a wet market, it was a lab leak. That’s now widely understood. 2) Cloth masks don’t work, they never did. The reason we were sure of that is because we can read, unlike your side. I read all of the dozens of peer reviewed research studies published from 1981 through 2020 and they studied surgical and N95 masks and still *not a single one* found any benefit against airborne respiratory viruses. That’s because even N95 masks have 0.30 micron holes and viruses are 0.13 microns. It takes just 100 virus particles for infection and millions are propelled into the air with coughs and sneezes. Even blocking 99% of them does you no good. The data confirms this - mask mandates states didn’t have any better infection rates than ones that never had a mask mandates. Masks aren’t for viruses, they’re for bacteria. 3) We said they’d mandate vaccines and create vaccine passports. They did. 4) We said there would be booster after booster. That’s exactly what happened. We called that before the first vaccine was even on the market. 5) We said antibody dependent enhancement was a risk. Studies from Israel show that’s very possible.

This is very true and a major cause of the political division nowadays. The two political parties are becoming more polarized cause their constituents are increasingly treating politics like a religion.	I argue that, many Americans are instead upset because they feel that political discourse is seeping into a space that they feel is apolitical. Thus, the cause is not the only reason for the backlash.	0.866

So instead of addressing my point (that your point about ‘the argument that conservatives mischaracterize the liberals’ arguments about the gender pay gap’ is incorrect), you make an straw man about the man making the argument???  Here it is.   Maybe in your next argument, address the point, not the people making the point. It reveals your bias a little too plainly.   https://youtu.be/aMcjxSThD54  https://youtu.be/yZYQpge1W5s	Is it that we liberals can’t bear differing opinions, or is it that our opponents mistake argument and refutation for censorship?

>Where was the goal post, and where am I moving it to?   In your original post you said  >What most of them are showing is simply that there are A LOT of military stuff right now, not BUILDING UP of stuff. To convincingly show that there was BUILDING UP, we need to show that there were less before, and there are more now.  Here you establish the goalpost "there must be more now than before." And your next sentence was:  >Interestingly, the best site that I found to show this buzzfeednews lol. It shows a before / after picture, a more convincing argument that there is a building up.       And there you say that you have exactly what your goalpost wanted but that's not enough. Ergo you moved your goalpost. Then you go on moving it two more times.  Fact is that no amount of evidence will ever be enough for you because you don't want evidence. You have already made up your mind.	<p>You almost directly undercut your earlier argument here. The military industrial complex doesn&#39;t need conscription to function. One could even argue that the removal of conscription almost works in its favor as it shifts the language of service to one more compatible with hyper-individualism. Now the complex can claim that all soldiers <strong>chose</strong> to serve, helping provide a smoke shield to their own influence on the situation. In essence it may claim &quot;We don&#39;t <em>need</em> conscription, and that proves the virtue of our actions&quot;.</p>	0.787

I a so agree with this except I don’t believe the soul is a real thing, unless you are just using it figuratively.	These all sound like claims that are intended to be objective, but that would be a self-refuting position (i.e. ""I can objectively say there is no objectivity!).

The 40+ hour week dates from a time when the majority of workers lived in families with 1 breadwinner and 1 home naker. That one person earned enough to feed, clothe and house their family. This only lasted a comparatively short period. Pay didn't keep up with inflation / cost of living. Women joining the workforce, automation, robots, computers/outsourcing to cheaper countries all reduced the amount of jobs, and that brought down pay (just to be clear, I don't blame women! I blame bosses / capitalism/globalisation).  I agree with OP that for the majority of people, a 40 hour week doesn't leave much time to live and grow and learn and enjoy.	<p>Also yes, I know most people in the developed world are service workers. But that still doesn&#39;t address the issue: there are poor people. You can have 0% unemployment, 100% service workers, but if 11-14% (depending on year) of your population is poor, your system is not good enough.</p>	0.864

Do you follow the Kardashians on social media? You might think celebrity gossip is reductive and garbage and the people that are interested in it are basically stupid and wasting their lives... and you'd be right... but it has a strong relationship with religion and perhaps your opinion.  Whether the Torah was dictated to Moses by God in the wilderness or not, it's laws are a set of social guidelines that helped form a distinct community. It helped bring reform, order and bring social cohesion to people. People need social guidelines to conform to for a sense of equality in their tribes.  Over the decades there are many ways for those social guidelines to manifest.  * The Church until the last century * Actual Laws * Gossip, and people who Gossip. "Oh look Maggy at 42 is pregnant again. At her age.... " * Newspapers, Soaps during the 80s - 2000 * Facebook Memes, Twitter accounts, Trashy celebs are how morals are propogated and pushed on to each other these days.  Facebooks Memes aren't always supposed to be funny, they are sometimes supposed to push a political view on you. You Uncle with the weird posts is essentially just from a different social tribe as you - even though you are related! These social expectations and rules, this public lambasting of certain people are a replacement for the bible. That we all understand and conform to certain social rules.  With Politcs in America becoming ever more divisive (since and thanks to Trump) and escalating into hard left and right stances it's easy to identify how this is causing people to choose one of two tribes in the US. How it matters more than Facebook Memes, TV dramas and actual laws. So yeah politics is replacing religion in America somewhat but it's a meandering journey about social identity and more than that - trying to force people to live according to your core beliefs.	<p>But, I think one of the reasons why people have started shying away from organized religion is because it&#39;s difficult to reconcile your identity as a good and kind person with organized religion&#39;s legacy of violence and oppression. The religions that have the largest number of adherents today didn&#39;t become popular because their ideas were &quot;better&quot;, they became popular because of genocide and forced conversion. Religion has often been used as a tool for social control of women and minorities (look up the slave bible), and it&#39;s understandable that people nowadays don&#39;t want to be a part of that. </p>	0.845

So in your case you don't live on a very well thought out or diverse farm. You specifically farm livestock and nothing else, it also sounds as though you have no access to pasture or large grasslands, otherwise your opinions are just opinion, and based on imagination.   There is no future for the meat industry.  You are suggesting that farmers would simply pay to destroy their only assets, destroying their business and choosing bankruptcy in one fell move? Instead of making a significantly more passive income from supplying to the organic fertilizer industry and local arable, fruit and etc farmers which would boom in response to the massive increase in demand.   Forgive me for calling BS, you come off as either a fantasists, delusional, or just intentionally feigning ignorance in an attempt to justify the continuation of what you have always considered the norm.  Yes I'm alright but I'm getting tired of obtuse poorly thought out opinions and having to hear them come out of what I would hope are usually intelligent people, it's extremely wearing.	<p>Except we haven&#39;t stopped breeding dogs, we just control their population. And we continue to breed them because there is a massive demand for them as pets. By eliminating the meat trade you would eliminate all demand for animals such as chickens. If no one buys chickens for food or eggs, then no one will keep chickens around. You&#39;re right that this probably wont result in their killing, as that takes time and resources. Rather farmers would probably just release them all into the wild where they&#39;ll die from starvation, unable to acquire food for themselves, or be mercilessly devoured by local predators.</p>	0.883

Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.

We understand what you mean , we just disagree .  I've read up and understand how these ideas were formed.  I just think they are bad and make errors.  Im not using concepts I think are ill thought up and conflict with facts.

> Lies? Really? I’m responding to OP in a sub called change your view. Don’t insult me.  Yes. Lies. Stop it.  You are linking to a website that is totally false. It goes against all facts and common sense. It goes against what is on the UN website. Against what the US DoD says. Against what the Security Council says. Against what even wikipedia says.  And on top of it all. it outright lies about what Chapter 8 is and what resolution 1973 is. Here's plenty of evidence for that:   It's literally on the wikipedia page for regional organizations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_organization (click show at the bottom, it's in the list).  The US military considers it a regional organization in its official documents https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA445041 "allows a regional organization, such as NATO"  All of this nonsense about "regional organizations" in Chapter 8 of the UN charter is absurd. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-8 Read the chapter. It's like 10 sentences. "regional organizations" never even appear anywhere in the Chapter!  The confusion really stems from a misunderstanding of how the Security Council works. The Security Council can say they are acting under their Chapter 7 powers, https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7, to secure peace. Or, they could say they are acting under their Chapter 8 powers to delegate peaceful settlement to other organizations. NATO has made it clear that it is not interested in being part of Chapter 8 operations because its ability to respond to escalations would be more limited, if it gets involved, it's going to be through the more powerful Chapter 7.  But that's not an issue. The Security Council almost never uses Chapter 8! And what the original story said is a total lie. Resolution 1973 is a Chapter 7 resolution, not a chapter 8 resolution. https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1973%20(2011) It's right there in black and white, bottom of page 2 "Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nation".  I think someone carelessly overheard a NATO spokesperson give an interview and got super confused. Sometimes, they will say something along the lines of "NATO isn't a Chapter 8 regional organization". That doesn't mean it's not a regional organization, because that term means nothing! It's not defined anywhere in the Charter. They're just saying, if you're going to look for a regional organization to get involved, you need to do it under Chapter 7, not 8, if you want NATO involved.  Now, there have been people arguing for 60 years that NATO should switch to getting involved via Chapter 8 not 7. To have more limited operations. But NATO doesn't want to be chained this way. Anyway, consider this: all of these resolutions could have been vetoed by Russia. If they thought NATO was acting illegally why would they allow this over and over again? It's all pretty absurd.	<p>Provide a link to these studies. And please I beg you; don&#39;t let this link go to some crazy crackpot whack-a-doodle website full of flat-earth and other nonsense.

You're sounding like a whiny kid that got woken up from their nap too soon and now they're banging on the wall, trying to annoy their parents.  Grow up and either knock on their door and tell them to shut the fuck up or call the cops to come and do it for you. This whole being petty for revenge is so 16. This isn't some passive aggressive sibling fight. You are an adult, act like one.  Sorry your building management is so shitty. I would be emailing them and calling their after-hours line every time your neighbours are loud. Annoy them into helping you.	<p>My landlord had my neighbors harass me by banging on my door, and then flash lights in my windows at random times of the night, so I called the cops while it was happening. Even though I called, when the officers arrived they  interviewed the landlord for about 15 minutes then came over and said &quot; He has the right to be here at anytime if hes working on air conditions or checking on the property&quot;. I followed up by explaining the harassment, and the officer along with 2 other officers standing by shrugged. The landlord then had my brother attacked the next day, to which he defended himself by pulling his firearm, which ended in his arrest because the neighbor gave a false testimoney, saying he see my brother supposedly waiving a &quot;silver gun&quot; unwarranted ,when 1) he didnt have a silver gun and 2) he was attacked by the landlord and an associate. Police came and interviewed landlord again and then he was arrested. Moral of the story, fuck the police.</p>	0.845

>For most of my life I have been pretty left leaning.   You have like 350 posts in /conservative, you couldn't even get past the first sentence without lying to us, to say nothing of the glaring red flags of the rest of that paragraph.	The system has been rigged for decades so that certain demographics are trapped in a cycle where the alternative to working those jobs is death. In the 50s and 60s, the buying power of the dollar was more than 4 times what it is today, and a single income at one of those terrible jobs was enough to support a family and own property. It's the jobs that failed to keep up, and now it's finally biting them in the ass. They colluded with politicians and media outlets for DECADES to pretend that if they paid a living wage like they used to, they'd all go out of business even though that's been proven false time and time again.	0.809

> It is happening, man  Solid rebuttal.  I'd argue you have your head in the sand because you're unable to comprehend a very simple series of events. It's not worth my time continuing a discussion with someone unable to grasp a simple concept.  X number of animals were killed as of today to provide meat in the grocery stores. There is a deer in the woods still alive, if I go decide to kill that deer it's now dead... It wasn't dead this morning, but it is dead now that I shot it. Again, it's really not hard to follow along.   The meat in your grocery store was dead already, the animals in the woods are alive until you decide to go kill one. It really boils down to you being able to wrap your head around this concept. Given this situation, it is immoral to go out and kill another animal when you didn't need to. That's literally all I'm arguing at the end of the day - a hunter doesn't wake up and NEED to kill an animal, but they do anyway.  More death is unacceptable, I don't care if it makes you feel better about yourself. From the animal's perspective, you just killed me even though there's 1000s of pounds of meat in the grocery store down the road.	If you cant afford it, chances are you cant afford to not buy mass produced corn products which are extremely detrimental to everyone and especially the environment. Its a complicated issue is my point, and to think that not eating animals means you are helping them can often be backwards. People need to start researching and thinking deeper than that. There are too many deer, and most die very painful uncomfortable deaths do to overpopulation and starvation. Maybe we should try to find a win win solution for this instead of spreading propaganda like ""meat is murder"" (not accusing you of this, but its a common thing).	0.873
following. I'm half Serb. I was too young to understand at the time but my serb family detest the western governments for their faux wars.	<p>When I was in this environment, I didn’t understand why people judged the pro life movement. Now, looking at the issue as a whole, I understand it. Many socially conservative men, particularly politicians, are judgmental, controlling, misogynistic pieces of shit, and their disagreement with abortion isn’t even about the science of fetal development - it’s about shaming women for owning their sexuality. Given the religion I grew up in, I received an overwhelming amount of this kind of judgment. I actually just escaped my extremely controlling &amp; physically abusive father a little over a year ago. I’m now a stripper, and it makes me feel empowered that I’m using my sexuality to be financially independent, live a modest, but comfortable lifestyle, and pay for my college education.</p>	0.813
You don't go from voting for Sanders in November 2020 to carousing with people who openly pine for overthrowing the government and keeping anybody who isn't a WASP from voting over the span of 15 months, but you DO you voted for him and moved right if you're a right-winger who wants to spread FUD and other types of misinformation designed and applied specifically to hurt Democratic turnout to the benefit of republicans. Given the absolute shitshow that has been and still is /conservative the fact you've managed to rack up such a high post count with them says a lot more about who you really are than any hollow word you have or will ever put out.	In summary: you don't hate Trump for consistent ideological reasons. You hate him because he's on the news a lot. The next time a Republican is elected president, you will hate him just as much as you hate Trump now, and will in fact go out of your way to compare him unfavorably to Trump or to make the same accusations against him as you now make against Trump. You will treat the next Republican president after that in the exact same way. You can see this process happening already on the right with Biden, and you can observe the course of it for the next four years at least.	0.904
I completely agree.  It feels sickening to me that we are born just to have to work 9-5 for the rest of our lives, and live like that.  But at the same time, there's many things you can do. For instance you can save up, or take a loan, then move abroad for some time with that money. And perhaps you find a way to sustain yourself while you are over there, at minimal cost, at minimal effort, or at an effort that you enjoy?   I feel like life has many options, it's just that we haven't discovered them as we are. Rather we settled with our parent's or forefathers way of living, instead of finding new ways.   Im not sure thought, the idea of working 9-5 for the rest of my life seems really awful, when i could just live on an island somewhere tropical for the rest of my life.	however, you only have 1 life to live. and we often waste it working just so that we can in fact live. and I often think that our lives would be more enjoyable if we didn't have to do so. I do believe that we are healthier when we are staying busy. but I believe that what we do to keep us busy should be what we want to do. things we enjoy. unfortunately, we cant do that. not for free.  which is why the secret to happiness for many is taking what you enjoy. the thing(s) that you would choose to do anyway, and making money with it. though that is not easy to do. and many people are not able to reach that goal (so far, myself included).	0.829
I will upfront say that I am skeptical of this conversation going anywhere. Your responses so far have not indicated that you are genuinely interested in attempting to see my view. I will make an attempt though.  I have already explained why this mandate is an overreach. The rationale that was used is something that is not limited to one industry and can used to force almost anything on any industry. It appears analogous to the commerce clause interpretations in regards to its far reaching nature (at least to me).  I am not saying this is the only overreaching regulation. I’m fact it’s has made me start to question multiple other regulations. This was probably the most in your face one though to where it made me stop and think while the others I never really thought about. I am very big on trying to be consistent in my views.  In no way would this be analogous to firefighters. The only way it would be analogous to fire fighters is if I was saying all government services are bad….which is not what I’m saying.	Headlines exist for a reason and personally, going into the piece having read either one of those would affect my impression of the message. This wasn't Merrill's fault specifically, but if I was an employee reading the first headline, I would feel like the entire article was directed at me. I would perceive it as more of a threat than a warning because as I outlined above, Merrill possesses a non-insignificant degree of control. Unfortunately, I can't really speculate much more beyond that since the actual piece is unavailable to me."	0.883

I totally understand your point of view and I stand by it. Accepting people and not body shaming them is different than idealizing an unhealthy way of living. In fact, in my opinion, being obese or overweight causes a lot more trouble (medically speaking) than weighing less. Yes, EDs are serious, don't get me wrong, but obesity is serious.  Exactly like most things in life... extremes aren't good, always aim for the middle. I'm sorry for the models that have to go through all the pain and tears of feeling not beautiful enough! We're all beautiful in our ways! Love yourselves! And try and give your bodies a little love too by maintaining them inside a weight range that is health wise satisfying :)	<p>A more articulate version of this perspective is: not shaming obese people is good. While obesity is due to a number of intersecting causes, the fact is that each of them are difficult to do much of anything about, and shaming obese people only makes it more difficult for obese people to do anything about them and also makes is less socially acceptable for we as a society to do anything about (since would be helping these unacceptable fat people to whom we owe nothing — according to the perspective of the shamers).</p>	0.903

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	Not in women's sports because people who transition after puberty have a huge advantage similar to that of a person on steroids plus advantages that steroids can't even give you.  It's not about hurting transgender people it's about protecting women's sports and giving the most level playing field possible.  Since this seems to be a common counter of course there are genetic freaks, Micheal Phelps was a genetic freak, but what if he a genetic freak in the men's world decided to compete in women's sports.  Outside of a hypothetical we've seen men compete against women and absolutely destroy them, Serena Williams lost to someone ranked 203rd, us women's soccer team lost to a u15s boys team at 14 they have barely entered puberty."	0.88

If op wants to send his kids to fight other countries poor for the sake of the rich let him, his kids will probably be retarded too thin the heard of retards	The other huge issue is that you’re exacerbating class stratification by drawing different sets of options for poor and rich students. If you tell rich students “you can choose X or Y” but tell poor students “you should only choose Y if you’re smart”, a problem that’s already bad gets worse. The rich kids get to be *all* the lawyers, doctors, writers, journalists, artists, etc. and they can also choose vocational training if they want it. While the poor kids only get vocational training. The fields I mentioned for the rich are already disproportionately dominated by the rich. We don’t want that problem to get worse.	0.864

Idk if this is a CMV post. More like a LPT for people into hunting	My post is to say that ARs are good for hunting.	0.797
I would say this CMV is way too specific. It looks like you are trying to practice a bunch of rebuttals so you can pivot taking points when arguing with your liberal friends.  But I will give it the ole college try: The AR is a versatile rifle, but your view is that it “can” be an “excellent” hunting rifle.  Your criteria seems to be weight, ballistics, accuracy, and accessories.  But then you suggest that not all configurations would be ideal for hunting. Any rifle can be modded for any situation with the advent of rifle stock systems.   So comparatively, to be considered “excellent”, and not simply sufficient, an AR would have to be better than an “average” hunting rifle.  Any top brand .308 rifle off the shelf can be reasonably expected to hit 1” MOA with no additional accessories. They all weigh between 4-7 lbs loaded. And most hunting rifles will include sling hard points, bottom rails for bipod and ring mount rails for the scope. Very similar to an off the shelf AR aside from the AR having side rails in most applications.  Out of the box an average hunting rifle, with the same scope, will outperform an AR. Every time.  The AR was designed to put a few bullets on a man sized target from 150-500 yards. To which is excels at. The hunting rifle, perfected over a hundred years, is designed to take down game with one bullet out to 1000.  Your CMV could read: A .50 cal can make an excellent hunting rifle. For the same reasons.	<p>Yes, I do agree that if you asked me what weapon I&#39;d prefer for wiping out a crowd of people, I&#39;d likely pick a semi-automatic rifle over a pistol. But I can think of plenty of rifles that could get that job done that most people who use terms like &quot;AR&quot; would not consider to be an AR. It&#39;s a useless, fear-mongering word. Those weapons are just as much defensive as offensive, yet of course we pick the word &quot;assault&quot; to represent them...</p>	0.883

Yea this whole take is fucking ape shit. There's plenty of black UFC fighters who have competed at the highest level.

Mayweather is no longer at the top of that - he’s a middle age man without the appetite to engage in dangerous fights anymore, understandably.

It has nothing to do with whether or not people are smart, and you trying to call me a racist for pointing out racist policy is just an unnecessary ad hominem attack.

Did you read carefully and with comprehension?  >The reason UFC isn't as big as boxing is because boxing has been around longer and there's more money in it.   There’s more money in it because it generates more money. That’s how business works. The conversation is that it will never be as big as boxing not why UFC isn’t as big as boxing.   >They are completely different combat sports, where boxing favors endurance and striking, and UFC favors wrestling techniques & grappling (thus a different body type is favored), generally top heavy guys with thigh strength.   A non-sequitor that can in no way be mistaken as a real response. Besides, strikers are dominant in the UFC. This right here doesn’t make sense for so many reasons but I’m not going to spend time on it since, again, it’s a non-sequitor.   >But that doesn't always mean 'non-black' as you stated Francis is built like a wrestler. In the lighter divisions, Nurmagomedov was utterly dominant for a long time, and is proficient at wrestling, he isn't a good boxer at all. This entire post is just wrong on all levels.  You’re don’t know what you’re talking about.   >Just looks like some 'black superiority fetishism' post, mixed with some standard homophobia.  If you feel like it a black superiority fetishism post and you disagree then address it. To my understand claiming things to be homophobia is against the rules. Your loaded terms and European words avoid actual and intellectual discussion.	EXACTLY why I didn’t get it! I don’t just buy the UFC PPV anymore either. I have to know who at least 4 of the fighters are on the card (and hopefully one full match) AND like at least 2 of them. People have been rotating in and out so fast and there almost seems to be too many weight classes or too many fights that you don’t get to love the fighters anymore. Again though people are paying for them….so Dana gives them what they want more more more.	0.862
Bro just stop typing up a storm, you’re trying to larp as some intellectually smart person, when in reality your just a crybaby snowflake who’s offended by a fucking joke.  Do you genuinely think Rogan is a racist? If so, that’s why people call you a snowflake. You haven’t ever actually had any real life world experience. In the real world you haven’t yet experienced, people say racist and offensive things as jokes and they’re not racist.	<p>If they shudder at the thought then why did they openly support it? Pleading ignorance isn&#39;t valid here. Hitler was a special kind of evil, fascists are only marginally better, in that most of them simply fall in line as opposed to being driven by their hate.

After reading all your replies I’ve realized You take everything emotionally and that’s why nobody can change your view. Anytime a logical fact comes about you argue it with feelings. Do you really want your view changed or just mad about Rogan because of your ideology?	<li>Them saying &quot;don&#39;t give me attitude&quot; is because they need clear and concise answers they could honestly give two shits about the emotions involved especially when time is of the essence. If you want your shit back don&#39;t get emotional (yeah hard I know but really have you ever tried to get info out of an emotional person? Its absolutely the worst).</li>	0.848
There is no difference between the two, (other than the obvious difference in genitals) male or female, you are forcibly removing genital skin, of an otherwise unwilling, non-consenting sentient being. Causing unknown amounts mental anguish, among being a completely unessicary cosmetic surgery on infants and adolescents	But this doesn't even address my argument. Even if it was compulsion and every single person who was attracted to children somehow magically lost control and ended up raping children (ridiculous), it still doesn't change the fact that it's still a sexuality AND a mental illness.	0.817
You definitely caught me not checking your response though, I wish I had, it would have saved lots of redundant and useless dialogue. I should have known; the typical Reddit ‘research’ take is to directly google for data to support your conclusion, then browbeat with it with some superfluous grammar that suggests superior intelligence, then pray that no one reads it.  Or more likely, pray that if they do, they don’t understand it’s implications and limitations that you weren’t able to grasp yourself.	<p>In terms of political discourse, it is far more effective to post a flat out lie on social media claiming some terrible thing your opposition did as being factual.  People who want it to be true wont bother to fact check it because it is what they want so they just spread it around.  but if you said &quot;my opinion about candidate A is that they are not a nice person&quot;  that won&#39;t get any attention and will be dismissed.</p>	0.88
LOL! I knew someone was going to say that I wasn't being persuasive. I knew someone was going to say that I wasn't treating the right with enough respect and that was getting in the way of my message. You guys are so predictable. It is insanely revealing that accurate descriptions of behavior feel like attacks to you. It's an admission that you ***are*** contemptable and you **are** bereft of redeeming qualities and your only recourse is to blame the person who points out your emperor has no clothes.   People outside of the fact based community bemoaning a lack of nuance is a level of irony that is difficult to locate with existing measurement devices.	<p>Your continued responses here are a waste of everyone&#39;s time? Your construing me as tense is just your understandable defensiveness at someone whose opinion has been rejected by everyone else. You would prefer me to be unhappy, so that you can have someone to relate to. But that&#39;s not going to happen for you either </p>	0.908
Yeah, you don't want your view changed. It's as set in stone as your ideological framework will allow. You haven't critically looked at anyone's comments, merely just deflected them with vague comments that I'm not sure you agree with.	I'm not suggesting anyone needs to pick up on every single facet of a culture. But, I do think that simply \*an intent not to cause offence\* is not sufficient. You can intend to cause offence and fail to. You can intend not to and cause offence.	0.905
With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.  I recommend everyone whose blood is burning with contempt for "the other" read [this magnificent essay, "I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup" by psychiatrist Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/).  We desperately need to pull back from the brink.	Man, whatever. Believe whatever you want. The truth is staring you right in the face and you want to close your eyes because it doesn't fit your narrative of ""Rogan is dumb"". There's no point in debating people if we can't even agree on the facts. I'm saying it's a lie. You're saying ""well technically it's not a lie because this is my definition of a lie"".	0.845

The thing that amazes me the most is how retarded people are when it comes to the anatomy of the penis, I mean if a women slept with a thousand dudes none of them are going to have 10 inch dicks, that’s not how dicks work lol they have literally debunked this stuff like millions of times over too and people still don’t learn its bizarre. All this being said I could easily imagine how a man obsessed with dick size might put off women for other reasons, I feel like it’s almost separate personality type.	<p>In my opinion 95% of Incels who can&#39;t get laid are secretly gay and unable to deal with it.

I know what you're intentions are posting here. You are trying to make it come across like what I've said is confusing when you know fully well you are the one trying to confuse and dilute the conversation. How about answering what your thoughts were on the article about Covid vaccine passport chips being created in Sweden? Like are you really going to try to discredit me by saying key terms you think will help label me as a deranged person, when the topic you bring up is a literal thing being implemented in real life. Are you going to pretend like the world economy isn't on the brink of collapse because of the pieces of shit in global power who failed to respond an international pandemic with a sense of duty, and instead chose to find ways to profit off of it at the sake of millions of deaths? Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?   If the answers to those questions are yes, then I want you to know I truly think you are a pathetic person who brings no value to society, and you should shut your fucking mouth when others are trying to have grown up conversations about crime and corruption.	As to the part about the government having confusing messaging, I would encourage you to try and separate the guidance on vaccines, which has largely been consistent and is in line with the guidance the rest of the world is getting, and messaging regarding other of health practices like mask, social distancing, isolation, etc. I could go into detail as to why the messaging wasn't consistent but long story, short, messaging regarding mitigation steps will always evolve when dealing with a novel virus, and things like shutdowns have an added economic and policital element to them that vaccines don't have."	0.832

The problem with these numbers is they actually don't include graduates who are unemployed upon graduation. They only account for the number of people who are employed. I've looked into this before. So the wage gap is actually much smaller. Also, you forgot to account for university costs and housing costs too.   &#x200B;  The other problem is that your college graduate salary includes people who attended postgraduate education but you didn't account for the extra tuition cost and opportunity cost. Also you need to factor in interest at 6% per year. There's a lot of gross assumptions you made here.	<p>And, chances are that college students who took out 6 figures in loans don’t have anywhere near that much sitting around in other assets if they were to be liquidated.

The whole point of the term is for Americans, Jews, and Muslims to distinguish the male circumcision/genital mutilation they do from the female circumcision/genital mutilation that Africans do. You're trying to say that they are similar/equal by using the same term to describe both. Your view isn't about the best term to describe things, but a debate about religion and politics. From the perspective of atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, South Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc., it's all genital mutilation. Also, the next layer to this global culture war is trans surgery, which is often described as genital mutilation by conservative Americans, Jews, and Muslims who practice male circumcision/mutilation.  The interesting thing to the debate is that genital circumcision/mutilation is largely an African concept. The countries in the northern parts practice male genital mutilation (which are often described as Muslim and Jewish countries in the US). And countries in southern parts practice female genital mutilation (and they are often Christian/Muslim countries). The US is the exception. Because of the masturbation beliefs of the founder of Kellogg's, circumcision spread around the US.	<p>If there were a significant group of Somalians that identified with racial attacks against them as anti-semitic and wanted to distinguish this from attacks against Jews as anti-judaisim, I&#39;m fine with that.

First of all, the OP doesn't give ANY examples of ANY of the claims he is making. So not sure how anyone would be able to argue this and get a delta. The mods should actually remove his post or ask him to specify what he is talking about instead of making vague and general claims like he is doing.  &#x200B;  OP, just remember, you called him right wing but did not provide proof. If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?	You're also misquoting them with your statement, as they're not making the claims you are.  They make no claims about ""not operating as intended, and deemed unsafe to do so.""

It’s been pretty well accepted at this point in time that this is a problem in the African American community. Here I’ll throw you a bone if a racist system throws black dads in prison it’s going to be hard for them to take care of their kids that being said it’s still an issue for their kids. Another question you do not think their is a disparity in a black kids experience with fathers and a white/Asian etc kids experience? Dude there are hard truths out there I’m sorry if you want to be ignorant to them that’s your choice.	Regarding whether the father should be able to legally ""abort"" himself,  courts have judged that the interests of the child trump the interests of the father.

The usage of ""critical theory"" as a perjorative for ""progressive thought I don't like"" is just an example of a euphemism treadmill; for a while it was ""SJW"", but you can't say that and look erudite anymore, then it was ""cultural marxism"", but that eventually fell by the wayside because it made too many Nazis happy, and now it's ""critical theory"" being used to describe the exact same thing as the other terms were."	0.861

Similarly, there&#39;s no clean answer for how to improve things — it&#39;s about listening to POC about patterns of harm they experience, and working to do better.

They should suffer the same punishment as the crime they falsely accused someone of if it comes out to be completely manufactured to put an innocent in prison.	Almost everyone forced to give one answer to both questions would come up with the same answer: the person who took revenge should be tried, and if his belief was reasonable (even if untrue) and his revenge was proportional, he should be lightly punished, if at all; if his belief and actions were not appropriate, punished more severely.	0.842

There is a large body of evidence that points to broken family units in the African American community. If I provide said evidence would you even accept it? Do me a favor right now at random look up a black celebrity or any kind of influential black person on Wikipedia I would bet money their father was not in the picture. I would argue that children without fathers is a systemic issue in the African American community that is way easier to prove than systemic racism the latter is so hard t define and quantify while the former is simply a matter of correcting the right data in the right way. We live the in the Information Age sir you can only bury the truth so deep before it rises from the grave to reap its vengeance on your lies and bogus ideology that ultimately undermines peoples autonomy and strength. YOU ARE WELCOME SIR FOR ME TELLING YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸	Black people several decades ago had to endure a lot of abuse and discrimination. One person calling them a bad word would have barely registered. If the scale of the reaction to an isolated incident today is representative of the size of the effect that one incident would have had in the past, then black people would have just been reeling from the trauma all the time. I don't think that experiencing pain is unhealthy, but I believe that if we try to 'babyproof' everything and make sure that the sting of social friction never occurs, then we're going to make people more fragile	0.879
Your arguments are bad faith. Vaccination mandates are for the public health and safety. They are constitutional, and right now those who are unvaccinated should be forced	You ignore the purpose of government, and the social contract which makes society work. Governments make and enforce rules, and perform actions for the benefit of the GROUP, that we cannot do alone. Defence was of course the first of these, and is clearly still important. Justice and policing is another. Public health is a third. It’s not only the government’s RIGHT, but their RESPONSIBILITY to make and enforce rules that protect the health of our population. Those rules should be made with consideration for the members views and beliefs, but setting a minimum standard to achieve the required result is fair and reasonable. The imprisonment of Typhoid Mary was an example of this. She carried Typhus, but was unaffected by it. She passed it to 53 people and 3 died. Since she could not be cured, and insisted on working as a cook, she was quarantined for over 30 years. Was she happy? No. Was it necessary to protect the lives of others? Yes.	0.863
I’m fully vaccinated. I’ll get my flu shot and whatever boosters I need every year.  But you sound like you’re in a cult. Your argument has a cult vibe.

You&#39;re just not <em>totally</em> immune to every strain; you have partial and varying resistances to the whole slew of them, waxing and sometimes waning with time, exposure, and vaccines.  You are born with some you inherit from your mother, you get more from her breast milk, you gain some from exposure over your life, and you develop them from vaccines.  Same thing will happen with COVID.</p>	0.84

The flu shot should be mandatory. You aren’t a skeptic, you’re just a contrarian. Your views are worth less than the electrons used to spout this crap	So either way, you’re wrong lol.

Duty, Responsibility, Defend, Protect, Serve.  Those are all words that come to mind when I think of what it means to love your country and patriotism.  I also believe a country is more than just a piece of dirt, the country is the people.  To me if you love your country you are suppose to do your part to prevent harm. This means wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!  Here is another thought. Picture an invading military attacking your country. What are the goals of this invading force? Perhaps to harm as many as possible, overwhelm the countries hospitals, and to kill as many as possible. People that help this invading force would be guilty of aiding & abetting, basically reason.  Not getting vaccinated is helping that invading covid force do more harm to the country.  In the US there are now over 900,000 deaths.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed multiple times. Seems to me that the invading force has done quite a bit of harm with the help of those that are anti vax and anti mask!	<p>Yes, you&#39;re trying to give meaning to death, make it seem like a potentially noble and glorious thing under the right circumstances.

That's non sequitur. I'm not talking about music reviews or opinion. I'm talking about white nationalists espousing debunked "race science" to push white supremacist policies. But yes, any media program should vet its guests to make sure they're not absolute cranks who spread racist bullshit.   And yes, I am saying we shouldn't let white supremacists speak in public to spread their message. You seem to be running head first into the [paradox of tolerance.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) One of the ways around it is to simply not tolerate bigotry. Again, I recommend doing the reading here. Why are you so adamant that they be able to share their hate?   Frankly, your second paragraph didn't even make grammatical sense. But yes, as stated above I do want to censor bigots. I do support "science facts" as you put it. I'd love for you to provide an example of "experiential designs" that were rapidly disproven. Do you mean phlebotomy and the other "race science" fields? Because yeah, we threw those out when they were disproven.   And no, not everything had scientific consensus* (you can't spell) but everything we've discussed today does. The only people disagreeing are bigots. You've thoroughly shown us here where you stand on this.	<p>Yeah because they&#39;re not already doing this! I&#39;m not particularly interested in where this discussion is going. I don&#39;t have a low opinion on you but I already know you&#39;re going to try to hit me with the &quot;white people are victims of white supremacy too and they don&#39;t know it!&quot; And I just don&#39;t agree and don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get you to agree white people have purposely tanked the social safety net in America of their own free will and not because billionaires brainwashed them. I&#39;ve been in America my whole life and I&#39;ve seen where the racism comes from. It&#39;s not just something flowing from the bottom up, and most white people flat out don&#39;t even realize how good they have it compared to other people not only globally but in America itself. We have this thing where we make all problems broad to seem as if they primarily affect white people, then the government primarily only helps white people. Happened with affirmative action, happens every year with various types of welfare (look up welfare spending in white areas vs black areas - it&#39;s a doozy). This was a nice discussion but I&#39;ll have to end it here.</p>	0.899
Look, if you are trying to be a jerk, then maybe go to some other subreddit. People here generally like to engage in discussion with civil people. You asked "So you think people should be arrested for things that no one is willing to press charges on?" and I answered.	<p>Not really. You&#39;re saying that it should be legal to coerce people into committing violence against each other because you find it theoretically enjoyable. I am trying to disabuse you of the notion that violence is enjoyable. It&#39;s pretty hypocritical that you&#39;re gung-ho about violence and bloodshed until you imagine it happening to yourself, and that was the point of me saying that.</p>	0.856
The US and Canada arnt most developed nations. There's a quite a few beyond that I think.  Regardless, it seems your unwilling or unable to complete the thought exercise. So it is impossible to change your view, as the only person who can change your is yourself. Take care.	<p>Almost any list you find online ranking countries in terms of ease of immigration (not just the rate) will put the US at the top. The easiest one for me to personally compare to is Canada, since I went to school there and considered staying permanently, and know many classmates who did. It is <em>wildly</em> more difficult to immigrate to Canada than the US. If you don&#39;t have a skill or education that makes you uniquely employable, you&#39;re probably not getting in. If you don&#39;t speak the language (in Quebec, that&#39;s English AND French), you&#39;re probably not getting in. If you&#39;re not the right age, you&#39;re probably not getting in. They have very high standards, and if you don&#39;t meet them, they just say no; in the US, almost anyone can come, it just takes some time and commitment.</p>	0.814

Shit’s fucked	Nobody deserves to spend the rest of their lives being hated and feared, and I feel like that's the culture of a certain group of feminists.

I'm Jewish. Literally, in the lifetime of living people, 89% of my family were murdered by Nazis. I know their names. All of there names. I work on a project to document all 6 million name's murdered by the Nazis. There are today fewer Jewish people living in the world today still than in 1933 thanks to Nazis.   Any claim that a Nazi is not an extant threat to every Jew is an antisemitic racist assault upon our soul and a flagrant ignorant intentional erasure of our pain from history.   Fuck you.   Kill every nazi.   Damn the consequences	But on to the more substantive issue: Nazism.  Nazism *is* an evil ideology.  Nazism is *actually* totalitarian.  When you call someone or something Nazi, you're drawing an explicit comparison to the nationalistic, oppressive, racist German regime that committed multiple genocides across Europe in WWII.  But the Nazis didn't start out murdering 11 million people including 6 million Jews.  No, for years, they had to be induced to do those things.  There's a popular image of Hitler as this kind of singular monster, the most evil person who ever lived, who murdered millions upon millions of his own people because he deemed them inferior, but that's not right.  Hitler didn't murder millions upon millions of people.  HIS FOLLOWERS DID.  And his followers were not singular monsters, the most evil people who ever lived.  No.  They were regular folks like you and me.  THE NAZIS WERE REGULAR PEOPLE.	0.882

I don’t think ‘I was drunk’ has ever been an accepted excuse. If it was then no one can have sex while in alcohol and drugs. That’s never going to happen.	If consent is required, then no one could ever have babies.  If it is not required, then your ""point"" is irrelevant.	0.882
My view is if you say yes in any state that is a green light. Condom or no. If you commit a crime while drunk you can’t claim you didn’t know what you were doing in court. “I was drunk so didn’t know the implications of drunk driving”. Why should that be acceptable here. Sober you chose to get drunk in that situation and so knew the risks involved. If you are aware of what is around you and can communicate that that is enough even if you are drunk off your ass. The only case this doesn’t apply is if the person is so far gone they can’t register what is around them. So long as they are awake and able to interact intentionally with their environment that counts as consent in my book.   Take for example if a man and woman are both drunk. Did the man rape the woman? Did the woman rape the man? Did they rape each other? After all if you rape someone while drunk it is still rape. The answer is it is just two drunk horny people. Pass them a rubber and leave the room.	Unfortunately, the stochastic nature of the problem makes things difficult to argue.  It's a bit like drunk driving.  Most of the time when people drive drunk, they aren't actually going to kill anybody.  And if they did, we could easily charge them with murder.  Why do we need a separate penalty for where nothing bad actually happens? Because the penalties change behaviors, causing fewer people to drive drunk.  Because empowering the law to pull people over for drunk driving allows us to stop that loss of life before it occurs.  Because we cannot allow reckless endangerment when it isn't simply ones own life that is endangered.	0.906

>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	Saying that there are other ways for a relationship to have a power imbalance doesn't mean that having a power imbalance can't cause problems.  It just means that we are choosing to regulate (either socially or legally) relationships that we can easily lump together as likely to have power imbalance while also choosing not to regulate other relationships that may also have an imbalance.  We regulate drunk driving because it has a very high likelihood of impairing your driving, but there are plenty of other impaired drivers (tired, sick, signing their favorite song) that we don't regulate because it's harder to do.	0.87

Attacking a group, any group, because they believe differently than you is wrong. Full stop. Saying your violence is justified because you think the right things, are support the right ideas or look the right way doesn't change that you are simply making an excuse to attack people who you think don't deserve to live their life as they see fit. How any of you can sit here and say you absolutely feel justified in attacking someone who has done you no harm is sick and disgusting. You are no better than those you claim are evil; you are literally doing the thing you say they are doing. See h isn't violence. Ideas are not violence. Action is violence, and if you attack someone because of who they are or what they think, it is you, not the one who you deplore, that are to blame.	The point of this hypothetical is to show how absolutely insane scorched earth tactics like that are because you will -inevitably- hurt people that were innocent of the crime.

Probably not, but if I see someone beating the shit out of a nazi I'm not gonna stop them	<p>I do despise the beliefs and methodologies of Nazis, racial supremacists of any stripe, and other hateful people, but meeting their beliefs with violence does nothing but legitimize them. It becomes abundantly clear that you can’t debate them or prove their idea wrong in the public sphere, and instead just have to shut them up. Violence doesn’t make Nazis stop being Nazis, any more than it would stop you or me from believing what we believe respectively. Besides that, we have a right to free speech for a reason, and that right is <em>especially</em> important when we hate what someone has to say. Because otherwise it is only a matter of time before whoever you grant the power to decide speech is violence places something you’ve said on that same level. The goal post always moves. Today it is white supremacist rhetoric which necessitates violence. Tomorrow it is a person saying the n word. The day after it is “marriage is between a man and a woman”, and so on. You might not agree with those things, I certainly don’t on the majority, but do you see what I mean when I say that it’s dangerous? We saw this once with the Sedition Act, and again with the HUAC. Criminalizing speech and thought does nothing to stop that idea from taking hold, and as much as we might disagree or even despise what someone says, the best thing we can do is let them talk and burn their credibility themselves.</p>	0.814

This. Everyone on this post is attempting to change the views of someone who has no intention of changing in the first place. The language was a dead giveaway. Things like “problematic”and like you mentioned: “consequences to free speech” are emblematic of a preset of value judgments from a hyper sensitive portion of the population, hell bent on cancelling anyone who challenges their fragile world views.	I do think the body positivity movement is needed, but separating all these movements to create acceptance is really just pulling us apart. Do what you wish with your life, no one is stopping you, but to act like every advocate of racism or shaming has been afflicted directly is ludicrous.  It's the pictures, messages we get. How about we get positive about life? That would cure all of it. We live in a society of shame cuz we are taught our emotions are scary and our ego is more important. We live in a culture of repression.  I mean, who gives a shit if you are fat, the positivity movement can perpetuate a feeling that one should feel oppressed.  Live your life, be love in action, who tf cares what someone else thinks.  Anyone shaming you is projecting their own fear or shame"	0.878
The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I’m lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it’s very comforting to know I have an option.	<p>It is wrong to encourage suicide because you discourage people from trying to fix their life. You discourage hope. You discourage healing. You encourage people to be cowards and give up. That&#39;s the opposite of helpful. Suicidal people often feel helpless or like they have no way to make their situation better, but they&#39;re wrong. We just have to make them see it. Also, if you were to encourage someone and they completed suicide, that would be immediately harmful to their family, friends, coworkers, etc who would have to deal with the grief and readjustment of their lives. Suicide is selfish because it bastardizes the effort of people who have given their blood, sweat, and tears trying to help, and then they traumatize them by dying. Suicide hurts everyone, not just the person who dies. If you encourage suicide, you force grief, and that is very wrong.</p>	0.895
They are your thought and your thought alone. I am supprised that so many people volunteered to be part of a gene theropy experiment, one that has not been used on humans before. Made by companies who's only goal is profet and those same companies had been fined multiple billion for their fraud, bribes and their drugs killing people.	The comparison is, of course, incomplete. Trump, for all his misdeeds, never got to the point where he was intentionally building industrialized murder machines for entire demographics. But the scope of mass death caused in large part by his administration's failure and outright malice should put him in a similar category with other people responsible for mass death on a truly horrific scale.	0.859

So you're okay with Russia hypothetically weaponizing and funding white nationalist groups in the US and encouraging them to violently overthrow the government? I mean that's what almost happened in 2021.   Russian trolls on Facebook spreading misinformation about how the election was stolen. Trump being so self-absorbed and an ego-maniac played right into Putin's hands. Culminated to retarded Trump supporters invading their own capitol, chanting "hang Mike Pence".  What unfolded in 2021 showed the world how fragile the US really is. It was a national embarrassment. US adversaries now know the key to the downfall of the US is to exploit the political and racial divisions in this country and pit Americans against Americans. Divide and conqueror.   But hey if it isn't Russia actively bombing the US, then it doesn't matter right?	<p>Then entire 2020 election Trump promoted insane conspiracy theories and misinformation, I assume due to his vanity and narcissism, and did more to unravel our country than any enemy.

I won't get into semantics about what you view your character as. I personally would think your character is more than just an argument on reddit but if that's what you want to water it down to by all means. For me an ad hominem would be more akin to "you like chocolate ice cream therefore your opinion is invalid". Citing a separate argument you made to question your motives is not ad hominem, but i'll drop it regardless.   I apologize for attacking your unrelated argument/character in another thread.   However I don't think it's that wrong to question whether you're arguing honestly when in another thread you're making the claim humans can't rape animals. Reddit is full of trolls, I don't want to waste my time with one. If you're not one, great, my mistake. Any further replies should be under my other comment as to not get cluttered.	<p>I mean my justification for consequentialism would have nothing to do with happiness. It would just be that if we have something we think is desirable (be it happiness, or &quot;not-suffering&quot;, or chocolate cake) then we should look at actions in a way to judge their outcomes as it relates to this goal. Not just say they are &quot;inherently bad&quot;. I can&#39;t see a logical reasons not to base our system or personal actions on the outcome. Seems like it leads to less contradictions (like the &quot;if everyone on earth would die but killing one would save them&quot;) thing. It&#39;s not perfect, but I think it&#39;s better, I don&#39;t think any moral system is perfect, so if your response is going to be to give me loads of examples that disprove it I&#39;m  not going to find that very convincing unless they are a) massive or b) you have a better alternative. </p>	0.887
I've been arguing this since Richard Spencer was sucker-punched in the head live on television on inauguration day 2017, while calmly speaking with a reporter.  People were all 'hell yeah!' at the time, too.  No one wants to listen, or have even the slightest bit of imagination about how normalizing it could come back to bite you.	But the first time I saw a TV show with an actual male-male romantic subplot that wasn't played for laughs or a ""one special episode"", I spent hours watching and re-watching those scenes online. When I heard that the teacher on Arthur (my favorite show as a little kid) had been shown on-screen marrying another guy, I immediately started happy crying right in the middle of a group of my straight guy friends, something I never do. Even I was shocked at my reaction and couldn't explain why it mattered so deeply to me.	0.844
>You are quit literally arguing that my argument is invalid  I never said any argument is *invalid* because of another one you made. Quote me saying that.   I merely questioned your motives based on other comments you made.   Your current argument about vaccines not being effective is wildly invalid, but not because of what you said about humans and animals. I was simply concerned we weren't going to have a serious discussion as im sure you can understand most people saying stuff like that on the internet are not doing it for serious discussion.	Where did you pull this standard? That's a total red herring and as far as I can tell you just arbitrarily introduced this to the conversation. I would argue this is not the argument we (or anyone) should make. Employers should mandate vaccines to maintain and protect the health and safety of their employees and customers... same reason they can send sick employees home and refuse to let them work. Abortions don't affect the health and safety of other staff or guests, so it wouldn't follow."	0.9

Most of the time kkk and neonazis just like to talk hot air, they rarely act (physically/violently) on their beliefs.

Liberals on the other hand will swear up and down that they are my allies but when I turn around they plunge the dagger in my back. The squad and others were hanging out and having a field day (there is plenty of Google photo evidence to this) with Louis Farrakhan (known and video evidence anti Semite) and Linda sarsour who also promulgated hate towards Israel and by extension Jews.

Again, we are talking about means of production. Being a self employed accountant isn't it pal. I have no idea why you think the number matters anyways, but fyi, it is a pretty small number compared to the number of employees. Really small.  >Far more died of hunger under communism.  Ok so you're not even going to try to speak honestly? You're just going to blatantly lie? Ok, nothing more to say then. Pretty pathetic. If you believe in something you should be able to defend it honestly. The fact that you have to lie should tell yourself that you are on the wrong side.  I hope you can grow from this.	As a bit of trivia:  re: redistribution of high level employees wages — this would generally have very little effect.  The number of low-wage employees is so huge that you can, for example, divide a CEO’s entire wage amongst them and you’ll get something like $5 - $10 *month* difference for even smallish businesses.  And just a few cents for huge places like Walmart with millions of employees.   — The human mind like to compare exemplars (example individuals) to each other and neglects scale.  Things like CEO and related salaries are usually a very, very tiny % of a businesses operating costs."	0.872

My grandma was terminally ill and was of clear mind until the very last days. She spent her last year bedridden and unable to move but completely clear minded. She begged us to let her die and asked the doctors nurses to end it. We had no recourse and seeing her like that destroyed all of us who had to take care of her until her last breath. I think this case was an ideal situation for euthanasia because there is no treatment no remedies for what she has gone through. It was a slow and painful journey for her and all of my family. Doctors were very emphatetic but their hands were tied.	My sister was working on a patient in full PPE gear. The patient was terminally ill from an un-covid related illness. The patient received 2 negative covid test results back. Her supervisor told her she didn't need PPE on anymore for that patient. A few days later that patient passed away. In the notice it said death due to covid. She was shocked not just because of the 2 negative covid test results. But because her supervisor never alerted her of her ""accidental exposure"" to covid. This is a HUGE no-no in the medical field right now because she could spread it to other people in her hospital wing or immuno-deficient patients and essentially take out an entire wing.	0.906

Please quote from the book to debunk anything I’ve said on linguistics and etymology and show me where it speaks on the term cock please.	Forcing someone in college to go through basic literature classes so that everyone can be on the same baseline is asinine at best. If I don't need to be reminded what are the parts of an argumentative essay, which I had to at least understand the basics of in high school, and the college forces me to sit back down into how to analyze grammatical structures such as the difference in purpose between a subject complement and an object complement, and how to properly write them and conjugate around it, I'll feel patronized and made fun of.	0.832

I've had this conversation recently and I fully agree with you. People here are trying to argue that power is a broad term, but I say it isn't, because you are particularly referring to the power they have to permanently ruin lives on a whim. The power to send someone to prison is something society takes too lightly.   Others argue that you can counter them with money (equally powerful lawyers) just proves the point. The majority of people doesn't have the kind of money you would need to very technically argue your case. The fact that you have to navigate the law with money just shows that even if justice is blind, it is effected by the smell of money.   Judges do not serve justice, they serve their own whims when they decide someone needs to serve a harsh sentence if they're having a bad day. I am deeply disturbed by this fact.  The solution I came up with is to have multiple judges independently decide if a sentence is just. People will argue that it will be expensive and cumbersome. I argue that if you were in a position where you wanted a fair outcome, you would want the best possible practice.  I have zero faith in the justice system as it currently stands.	<p>If so, then leads to another excuse that I&#39;ve heard for why some people were on the Chauvin&#39;s side. They said that it doesn&#39;t matter what the evidence says but because of massive political pressure to convict him, the jury had no other alternative than to do so as otherwise massive violent protests would have erupted. Their argument is that the verdict was done for political reasons, which they oppose. Again, I&#39;m not of this mind, but this is one of the comments that I heard during and after the trial.</p>	0.895

Everytime I hear someone going on a rant about “left wing/right wing” all that comes to my mind is architecture and grandiose buildings.   I really wanted to play devils advocate here, but the truth of the matter is you’re exactly right. About right and left being meaningless. It’s just another reason for people to remain divided under the guise of freedom and choice.   Because there is no actual choice. Not in any society. It’s all the same shit with varied marketing and price points to give the illusion of choice.   This applies to consumer goods, infrastructure and our government. And we do it to ourselves.   IMPO of course.	That everything relating to human beings is 'socially constructed' is complete nonsense, doesn't withstand any debate at all and absolutely demands you adhere to several leaps of faith that have no credible science.

What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.	My other main issue with the prevailing narrative is the vaccine itself.  It is largely being advertised as an effective cure to this pandemic, which is just false.  The virus has animal hosts, and vaccinated people can still transmit the virus.  It will mutate and continue to forever, regardless of which percentage of people are vaccinated.  They also believe that a variant soon will emerge where the vaccine is ineffective.  They've convinced people that the unvaxcinated are the problem, when the reality is that nothing can stop this virus from mutating.  I'm also upset that instead of focusing on treatments, we throw all of our eggs into the vaccine basket, and shit on people who are experimenting with potential treatment solutions.  You likely don't find them credible, but America's Frontline doctors will prescribe Hydroxy and Ivertecimn, and they are certified Dr's, not fox news pundits.

Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.	<p>This entire policy wasn&#39;t approved by the Supreme Court until recently despite the Trump administration doing everything to block it. John McCain famously voted against the Republican plan right before he died. This plan is likely going to grow from here. Right now your complaint about being too rich for free care, but too poor for paid care is completely valid. But the big Democratic bill in Congress right now is working on this problem. We&#39;ll see how it shakes out. But in any case, fining people for not having insurance is necessary to the plan because it covers the added cost of taking care of them so everyone else in society doesn&#39;t have to pay for it.</p>	0.834
It can only be called a vaccine because they changed the definition of vaccine.  You also might want to check the most recent Israel numbers.  In the US there was a 40% increase in mortality for people aged 18-64 in 2021.  Hmmm. Strange.	<p>In order for the risks from the vaccines to outweigh the risks from COVID, at the US lower bound of about 10% of Americans having had a confirmed case (could be up to 3x higher), and at a case fatality rate for young(er) adults of 0.1%, there would need to be about a 0.01% fatality rate from vaccines--which, looking only at fully-vaccinated people, would be about 6,600 fatalities in the US.  That&#39;s a lot of worst-case assumptions and we&#39;re obviously orders of magnitude short of that.</p>	0.848

>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??	<p>As well I&#39;m really a lot less proud to be Canadian after hearing about these graves and IRS&#39;s than I was before hearing about them. Like that&#39;s really fucked up that MY country did this. I&#39;m not proud of my country for doing that. When I think about IRSs and the graves of innocent children, I am NOT proud of my country. Should I be? Should I look at this information and just maintain the same feelings of national pride I had before learning about this? I don&#39;t think so. </p>	0.857
Not trying to be that guy, but I think your viewpoint is the common viewpoint rather than the devils advocate.   The only thing I would add is I think it’s totally fine if their salary is cut in half and each of them get half the money if they want separate bank accounts.	<p>On your second point, I agree. I think the current government programs that help people ignore personal freedom too much. If the government is aiding you, it should aid you in most circumstances, not give you a million strings attached, not so many limits on how you spend that money. It should be your money, just like tax breaks are your money. </p>	0.852
That's not how rational discourse works, that's not how debate works, and that's not how CMV works.   If you make an argument in your OP, it is up for debate. When someone comes along and disagrees with that point in your argument that you can no longer counter, you don't get to say "no no no, I just mentioned that, it isn't actually what I want to talk about."  That is a bad faith argument and you are no longer able to be debated against when you refuse to concede even an INCH of ground from your original topic against someone who makes a rational argument against your initial topic.   You brought up the mandate protests. That makes them a topic that is on the table for conversation. Then, when you ran out of arguments about that point, you just said "no no no, I don't wish to discuss mandate protests any more."   If you want to change the conversation that is allowed to be debated in this topic, then that is a VIEW CHANGE. otherwise, you're just making bad faith arguments that any time you hit a wall against you can then just change the topic of conversation again to steer it away from a point you brought into the debate to begin with.	You can't have a meaningful conversation if all your rebuttals are ""Yeah but this unnamed study I won't show you says you're wrong""."	0.923
Let's face it: if you only award salary based on how much work you can do, aptitude, etc. you'd get prorated down to 10 cents an hour, bud.	<p>The problem is that people will work for $10/day if the choice is that or don&#39;t work and have $0. So as soon as you have a labor surplus at all, wages can spiral down to basically nothing. We&#39;ve seen this happen before, it&#39;s not theoretical.</p>	0.882

I’m saying this is a very very specific situation, and you specifically don’t want an actual person with an extraordinarily unique disability to get paid, even though that person has a degree and works. I think that’s a dickish position, or at the very least, wrong. I personally am happy for them that they made it work, not mad that one of them is getting too much money.	I am saying that I think ""it is what it is"" arguments are unsatisfactory on their face and that we *should be able* to come up with a better system - but in the event that one cannot be imagined, it is ultimately more ""fair"" for the paid party to be offloading as little of the work as possible onto applicants until they are under serious consideration, precisely because *nobody owes anything to anyone yet*, but the status quo (evidenced by many responses here) appears to be that applicants actually owe something to the company.	0.884

Why would you think id find value in a CNN article when the two news orgs on the list I gave you are known for being not bias and are a gold standard for reporting?  Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1	This point is really slippery and vague to me.  I've talked to people who say this sort of thing before, and every single time I've challenged them on specific examples, I've been able to easily google up CNN reporting on the good thing Trump did they supposedly ignored.  Or, they find me a CNN op-ed which expresses a negative opinion about Trump, even though that doesn't remotely suggest the *news reporting* about him is biased.	0.837

i mean i don't think you really want us to change your view.. you just want to give your opinion traction and an audience.. i'm all in with you.. good job writing this post and good job doing what you are doing. islam is indeed one of the truly oppressive forces to gay rights...   i'd say the most oppressive forces are as follows...   1. death threats from conservatives(this is mostly Islam)   2. Christian conservatives(maybe not as hostile generally but very oppressive   3. laws that don't protect us around the world(many laws of oppression still exist)   .. after that i think it gets a bit more confusing as to where the source is.. but there sure are a lot of assholes out there.	<p>Not criticising the extremist aspects of Islam actually harms moderate Muslims who are lumped in with the extremists and gives actual racists the opportunity to recruit more people as the perception is that the mainstream left are hypocrites who condemn in Christianity what they seem to ignore or excuse in Islam (I won&#39;t go as far to say &quot;condone&quot; as I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard many on the left say they agree with the more extremist aspects of Islam, but &quot;condone&quot; could be used if meaning staying silent)</p>	0.914

Good post mate 😁✌🏻 You aren’t Islamaophobic, you are simply stating the reality of life for countless LGBT living in constant fear under the theocracy that helps govern almost all of the countries you listed. You will of course get non stop “whataboutism” from over emotional hacks, but that being said it doesn’t change the facts. Also, the hypocrisy of these defenders is often times astounding as they will decry China’s treatment of the Uyghurs who are placed in “re-education” camps to curb what they view are extremist beliefs which can (and has) lead to terrorism.. all the while supporting or at least defending throwing gays off buildings and/or stoning them. I agree with neither of those for the record since it has to be said in todays cringe world. There are Muslims like Maajid Nawaz who I respect a great deal as he and many others are attempting to reform Islam and its more extreme beliefs and practices. Also, for the idiots who say “[insert other religion here] used to do XYZ” - yes and they have already undergone their reforms in the past to the point they’ve reached today. Ffs even the Catholic Church, which has had some of the strongest anti-LGBT beliefs, their leader Pope Francis has holds more conciliatory views on LGBT as opposed to the past.  Oh and prior to him they weren’t throwing gays off buildings so there’s that as well.	<p>If you think Twitter&#39;s censorship isn&#39;t politically biased you are either arguing in bad faith or ignorant. Just look at their ruling on dead naming. They don&#39;t give a fuck that the policy they enforce goes against half of the countries&#39; view on those issues, they think they are moral arbiters. The same could be seen from lefties supporting BLM riots and violence, they just don&#39;t face the same consequences.

It’s not anecdotal you ignorant clown, it’s the beliefs held by the religion in question. Learn how to use anecdotal correctly in the future please. That is neither  one person’s beliefs nor is it incorrect or unreliable.	One thing to remember is that ""rational"" doesn't mean ""impossible to be wrong"" or ""conducted an experiment"".  It only means that you have a justification based in reason, intuition, induction, or empirical evidence.  Anyone who converts *to* a religion almost certainly has at least one of those.	0.885

Sure, if it's two consenting adults of sound mind (and no power differential) are doing it, it's not inherently immoral, however realistically I don't see any way of arriving at that point which doesn't involve a major moral gamble. The immoral aspect doesn't begin with the act, it begins with changing your attitude towards the other. *Even if* the attitude is reciprocated, you've already irrevocably changed the nature of the relationship.

It's true. I can't even keep track of the number of times I've said "permanent and life changing" instead of "invasive and medically unnecessary". Naturally, the only choice is to just gaslight people by pretending you said the right thing the whole time.	Most people do not think Bodily Autonomy is absolute in matters not relating to abortion. See Vaccine mandates for a pretty vivid illustration of that! Hell, last time I had this argument it was all going the _other_ way - people thought I was stirring shit up because surely nobody would _ever_ argue that bodily autonomy was absolute..! Of course, that was in a vaccine related thread.	0.83
You are focusing on something I have already clarified, many times, and are both acting Hostile and accusing me of acting in bad faith. Clarification is not gaslighting, and by conflating the two you are degrading actual examples of actual gaslighting, and convincing others that it's a term that can be used to just shut down discussion. You really should consider learning what gaslighting actually is.	Goes to show you that reading old philosophies still doesn&#39;t make one smart, especially since they didn&#39;t grasp the whole point of this subreddit.

True, I agree with your opinion, particularly as fundamentalist Islam carries so much weight in the countries you’ve highlighted, in addition to quite a few others, such as Brunei. I remember when the sultan of Brunei proposed a law to stone homosexuals to death when it introduced a new set of regulations that were based on sharia law. However, he backtracked after global boycotts of Bruneian businesses and protests outside of embassies, showing that perhaps political pressure can work in certain circumstances. However, homosexuals are still incredibly oppressed in Brunei, and I have to agree that fundamentalist Islam is the greatest oppressor of the LGBT community.	<p>And what about where LGBT individuals are persecuted today? I was rather disgusted when LGBT individuals were saying things like &#39;Sharia Law is Right&#39; despite one of rules being to throw gay people off buildings until they died. And Iran executing gay people just a couple years ago. There are at least 10 nations where being gay is punishable by death (as of 2019). Not even including where being gay could earn you a prison sentence. But America is the problem? And not just A problem, but THEE problem that needs to be addressed. </p>	0.858

> ... and accusing me of acting in bad faith... clarification is not gaslighting...  Lying about never having said something when it's quite obvious that you did would easily both be gaslighting and acting in bad faith.

Lol holy fucking shit. Are you literally comparing trans peoples panic attacks to the suffering of LGBT in Muslim nations? You seriously think this is comparable in any capacity? That’s incredibly stupid.   It’s a good thing that almost all nations don’t use the teachings of the Catholic Church to make their laws then isn’t it?	<p>Using the American standard of free speech with covers religious beliefs as well, no religion is more valid or less valid than another. If you commit crimes in the name of that religion it’s not protected by free speech. But if you just practice Islam in a way that doesn’t harm others your fine. Personally I think all modern religions are equally idiotic and capable of causing its followers to harm others in the name of that religion. Every group of people religious or not has bad eggs, some more than others. However I don’t think imprisonment for believing in a religion is a right or fair course of action.</p>	0.875
Clarification =/= lying my guy. I may have phrased it poorly but that doesn't mean I'm acting in bad faith or gaslighting. First off, It's literally impossible for me to gaslight in this situation because there is a history of what I've said. Secondly, saying someone is lying when they misspeak is disingenuous and toxic, and am *actual example of gaslighting.* How could you possibly know my intent better than me?	<p>How is that a misinformed position? Its still a lie, you said so yourself: He knew the effectiveness of masks, and he decided to tell the public otherwise. You might think that it&#39;s a reasonable lie to make, given the circumstances. Personally, now I know that the CDC has no problem misrepresenting things if it thinks it will cause major undesirable problems if there is a truth they know but don&#39;t want revealed to the public. This makes me have to think twice when I hear something from them that sounds counter-intuitive to me, if I think there&#39;s a reason they&#39;d prefer people to think that than to know what they know. In short, it seriously damaged the CDC&#39;s reputation for me, which already wasn&#39;t stellar.</p>	0.897

Please, you suddenly show up in LGBT subs and start mocking people. You said that trans people should have to undergo constant psychiatric evaluation.   You vomit when people talk about trans things.  You literally spent hours complaining that i stalk you and yet you show up here calling me a troll.	<p>It is because this isn&#39;t about fairness. This is all about the absolute hatred of the transgender community. That is why we also see laws about transgender use of bathrooms and the near-constant blathering about how sex change operations for children should be banned (when that isn&#39;t something that happens). That is why any inclusion of a trans character in a TV show or movie is met with howls of complaints and accusations of being &quot;woke&quot;.</p>	0.862

your experience isn't universal. tragic, I know.	<p>lol this is not the norm. Far from it.</p>	0.848
Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.	You seem to have a history of gatekeeping what trans people get to call themselves… why?"	0.744
It will shut people up around you, you might think I'm being glib with that answer, but it's a real consideration. You are probably right, you probably aren't in any appreciable danger, but it shuts people up and it won't hurt you.	What I'm proposing is that people shouldn't be removed arbitrarily because people don't like what they say or think, so long as it isn't illegal or physically harmful to others. We have the wonderful ability nowadays to block the things we don't want to see."	0.898
>Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.  Nope it wasn't why do you keep lying?	<p>I already quoted you saying this. You said that the media lies in order to catch people&#39;s attention. That is to say, you think they&#39;re &quot;dishonest&quot;, and their dishonesty is motivated by their need to sell papers - or &quot;greed&quot;, if you will. So go ahead and point out where I&#39;m wrong.</p>	0.822
I’m not lying about anything, I’m calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day. When will you take responsibility for what you comment?	TBH, I have no idea what comments you've been receiving. If you say they're inappropriate, then they are. They're not excusable, regardless of how someone feels at the time. I hope you've been reporting them. I report all comments that break rules, especially non-productive comments."	0.827
>I’m not lying about anything, I’m calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day. When will you take responsibility for what you comment? > >And why did you pretend to be someone else?  That comment wasn't about transracialism why lie?  Who am I pretending to be know? You gonna bring out your vomiting alt next?	<p>Everyday you remind me of your pronouns and every day I call you the  wrong one. Do I just not care and fail to absorb the information and am  ignorant? Or am I an asshole choosing not to use the information I’ve  adopted?</p>	0.856
>I thought you commented that you’re a man, maybe i was mistaken. I saw in another one of your posts that you said you’re a woman. So I don’t understand  You should get your vision checked.	<p>For example: if you were to mistake a woman with male-pattern facial hair (hirsutism) as a man, and she corrected you, would you trust that she was in fact a woman? Or would you ask for some kind of confirmation?</p>	0.837
So we should address people with the pronouns they identify with apart from you? Got it. Not like you’re trying to push some agenda at all.	why should we make accomodations for you? why should anyone else use your pronouns or your name? what if I want to call you ""assface"" and ""it"" for your pronouns bc I've just decided to treat you less than human?	0.83
>Are you a man? You said you married a woman, so how does she feel about you being bisexual?…   Creepy stalker.	[ Does not wanting to date a bisexual man make you a bad person?](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a27407125/bisexual-men-dating/)	0.844
I don’t care, that’s not your decision to make. Stop infringing on people’s rights and you might just make some friends in France. You’re just as bigoted as all those fundamentalist Christians you rage about.	<p>which would just cause those wealthy people to leave the country in the first place. France tried doing what you&#39;re advocating for and it was an abject disaster - so bad that their socialist party was forced to quietly repeal the policy.</p>	0.811
Actually, I have no desire to change your opinion. You're so far off the reservation that any sort of changing of minds wouldn't be worth the effort. You started by saying that maybe just a little bit "jaded", welp that's the understatement of the century. You're full on a fkn nut job and frankly no one should take you seriously. Your unearned sense of moral superiority not withstanding, perhaps you should get a little therapy.	And it’s maddeningly egotistical for people like you to argue otherwise, which is probably why you feel attacked so often, because you’re doing the exact opposite of what you think you’re doing (staying neutral) while also preemptively shielding yourself from any criticism of your ideology with thought-terminating cliches like “oh I’m not political” or “oh why can’t everyone just be treated equal, that will solve everything.” Like, no, it won’t, because people aren’t equal **right now**, so you can’t start treating people equally and then judge them on the footrace they’re running when a substantial portion of our population is 50 yards behind the starting line with a broken leg.	0.921
>The entire party consists of incels, Karens, Trumpers, and Nazis, all of whom have no place in the modern world. They are more than just an annoyance to me: they are an active detriment to humanity! A waste of resources.  If this is a troll post, well played! The irony of calling for ideological genocide because of their "harmful" views is \*chef's kiss\* levels of irony. Alas, we live in the era of Poe's Law so I can't tell.	<p>The nazi thing is super over played. So where was the outrage against all the people calling Trump a Nazi, or all the conservatives during his term Nazi&#39;s there was none, because that was the &quot;EnVogue&quot; thing to do, if someone wants to make a lousy comparison that&#39;s fine, do I think it was out of line yeah, do I think it was so offensive that I would just bash someone and seek that they lose their job no.</p>	0.902
I never forget how old I am myself but every once in a while I remember that I'm consuming content on Reddit from teenagers half my age.	<p>Doubt this has much to do with it. I&#39;m old enough I didn&#39;t have home internet access growing up and still managed to masturbate multiple times a day every day as a teenager.</p>	0.764
honestly, this is borderline racist	That's pretty racist"	0.946
Yes. Anyone with half a brain can see that things have gotten better in spite of race baiting horseshit like this.	Anyways, like you said, the hindsight is helpful but now it's reaching the level of beating a dead horse, so I congratulate you on your relationship and wish you both the best in life. Cheers!"	0.734
Agreed. Hump it and dump it. Fatherlesness increases your chane of becoming a felon by 46% and lowers your chance of graduating by 39%	<p>The irony about this is that the companies that pay the largest percentage dividends are those about to go under. Young, growing companies don&#39;t pay dividends at all. Older, mature companies do, and companies on the brink of bankruptcy pay the highest percentage dividends per share (since the shares drop in value so much). If your friend is living on dividends as you describe, it&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re reaching the end of the line.</p>	0.803
Bullshit. You’re trying to drive a wedge between people with different colored skin. You’re exaggerating what is wrong to keep people from coming together.	Then you're assuming I'm being biased to the point of withholding pertinent information in order to push some type of biased agenda, and you'd be wrong.	0.857
>No. Look at the blue lines which appear to be far more granular than 1000 years.     You're not looking at the same graph as me if you think you can narrow anything down to 1000 years based on that graph.      You either don't know how to read graphs or you're being disingenuous to push a narrative if you try to make conclusions on 1000 year time frames from that graph. My guess is it's a little bit of both.	<p>Can we make a model to predict how those 10,000 different factors will affect the two population averages?  Absolutely not, especially not today, when we don&#39;t even know what they all are yet.  Too complex for us to model, and we don&#39;t know enough.</p>	0.825
So I was right, it's a bit of both.	Well, it kinda does.	0.906
That you can’t read the chart? That does seem clear.	<p>so if your view it’s that it’s normal (as in common), the data says that is fairly clearly false.</p>	0.8
