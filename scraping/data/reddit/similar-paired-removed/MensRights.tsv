Come on what? I am simply stating things as they are, nothing more and nothing less. Men typically operate with logic, women normally operate with their emotions.	It takes some stoicism to be able to calmly say ""i am angry"", instead of screaming it.  But it is absolutely a standard men and women alike should absolutely be held to.	0.781

Seriously? Do the moderators even look at the subs when they mindlessly ban people from other subs just for existing on them? It’s so easy to tell that none of the popular posts (or ones that stay up for longer than a few seconds) aren’t incel beliefs. It’s literally just acknowledging that men have problems. What a fucking joke.	<p>For anyone wondering this guy is full of sht,he even supports the whole men cant call a kid cute since the op does it once and he immediately jumps to a bias(i don&#39;t think i need to spell this out for anyone).</p>	0.877

We can't even file a fucking case to the government. we open up to women and get laughed at and told ""should have enjoyed it"" , ""are you gay"" , "" stop lying"" , etc .   We open up to fellow men and get told "" wish it was me"" , "" she did nothing wrong"" , ""give me her number so i can get it too"" and so on.	0.85

Would you mind perusing my conflict with the highly downvoted feminist who replied to me? You do not have to weigh in at all, I’m just hitting a rock wall, and would like to know if I’m crazy.

But if you wouldn’t mind, could you just tell me if I’m completely unreasonable?	<p>But like it&#39;s seems to be a unrealeastic to assume that feminism can resolve every issue, Like thats why we can alternate between different thoughts and beliefs. This is why I don&#39;t really go major Ham at Feminists generally although FUCK ME TERFS i fucking crinnnnnnnnge, but even then there is still utility from feminist thought and discussions which I assume you would agree with as well. </p>	0.853

Even if you don&#39;t have the capacity to understand that Feminism as an ideology has a lot to answer for, and is full of hateful rhetoric and doctrines, and is thus rightly due to be considered &quot;Hate&quot;, others will read this discussion we&#39;ve had and realise that defending feminism from it&#39;s particularly evil adherents doesn&#39;t do anything to help prevent the problem of feminism ideology pervading our society, and that for any strides forward in equality feminism will need to be dismantled.</p>	0.852

I am sorry that is literal the dumbest thing I have ever heard, but that’s your perspective.  Here is my perspective.  My dad, me, my eldest son and my grandson.  All cut. All no issue.  My second son. Uncut until he needed emergency surgery to free up everything down there.  It’s a tiny issue.  Ill continue recommending it to any new father, just because of the risk that it poses and the issues i know it has caused.  I am sorry your penis broke or is shorter.  Sue the doctor.  My dick is fine.  And I see no harm or foul in performing hygienic surgery.	I get that your penis still works, but it is a matter of fact that it doesn&#39;t work as well. Do you need lotion to jerk off like many cut men? That&#39;s a very clear example of how the function of your penis was damaged.

I made them mad and I didn't say what they wanted to hear, so they reported my post to the mods so they would delete it. Simple as that.	The issue is...*I* had been the one to cross-post the thing to begin with. So the mod was objectively wrong. I had found a thread on their subreddit, commented in it, and then cross-posted it to another subreddit to say, ""You guys see this shit?"" That is not brigading. It's cross-posting. I point that out to the mod, with the evidence plainly available to see if the mod hadn't been blinded by rage. I am 100% confident I was actually banned because the mod disagreed with what I had said in my comment, and made up the excuse of brigading to justify it. But now that I had proven I had not brigaded, I told the mod they are obligated to unban me. And they just responded, ""Oh I am, am I? I'm pretty sure I'm not.""	0.868

I told your Mother the Same thing Last Night...When she was smokin my Circumsized 8" ---- suck it Bitch~!	One of my best friends got married a couple of years back. Arranged marriage. Everything was fine until after the marriage. On the first night of marriage my friend got to know that the girl has serious mental issues. Ran out of the house screaming on their first night, all the while shouting expletives. Then the abuse started. That bitch started physically, verbally, and emotionally abusing my friend even in public claiming that he has ruined her life. There is recorded evidence of that. Not a one time thing. All this within the first one month. Couldn&#39;t file for divorce until a year has pass and that too had to be a mutual one. This is a very sparse picture of the story. Lots has happened. My friend was also accused with dv and dowry allegations. Luckily him or no one from his family ended in jail. Case is still going but due to pandemic it is being delayed. He is one of the sweetest people i know and I&#39;ve known him for over 20 years. Grew up together. Watching him being hurt like this makes me very angry.</p>	0.779

I just read that in your article :  "1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."	<p>The CDC NISVS studies showed that in the previous year 1.6% of women were raped, and 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator.

According to a National Family and Health Survey in 2005, total lifetime prevalence of domestic violence was 33.5% and 8.5% for sexual violence among women aged 15–49. A 2014 study in The Lancet reports that although the reported sexual violence rate in India is among the lowest in the world, the large population of India means that the violence affects 27.5 million women over their lifetimes. However, a survey carried out by the Thomson Reuters Foundation ranked India as the most dangerous country in the world for women.The 2012 National Crime Records Bureau report of India states a reported crime rate of 46 per 100,000, rape rate of 2 per 100,000, dowry homicide rate of 0.7 per 100,000 and the rate of domestic cruelty by husband or his relatives as 5.9 per 100,000.</p>	0.865

>These male activists have targeted anything that smacks of feminism, forcing a university to cancel a lecture by a woman they accused of spreading misandry.   And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	<p>Last guy I talked to dismissed my concerns regarding Michael Kimmel and his &quot;activist scholarship&quot; as non-indicative of broader problems with quasi-religious, agenda-driven perversions of academic integrity in the movement, because... <strong>drum roll</strong>... he was accused of sexually harassing a woman, and it obvious to him that  no true feminist would do that.</p>	0.878

And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	3) Thou doth protest too much, methinks - Anytime a group of MRA's or just Men try to organize a talk / discussion around issues affecting men you'll get feminists protesting outside the venue or lobbying to get the venue to cancel the event on the grounds of ""hate speech"" or other BS reasons..	0.878
>These male activists have targeted anything that smacks of feminism, forcing a university to cancel a lecture by a woman they accused of spreading misandry.   And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	- Backlashed against  the one mainstream non-hitpiece Men's Rights documentary ""Red Pill"", made by *a feminist* (former really, after all the abuse and bad vitriol she got from them for daring to listen to men). They fought violently to cancel its screenings, including organizing demonstrations and acts of sabotage. (e.g. pulling false fire alarms in theaters to force evacuations)	0.873
>These male activists have targeted anything that smacks of feminism, forcing a university to cancel a lecture by a woman they accused of spreading misandry.   And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	Ok, what about when one side systematically silences the other, smears them with insults, claim they are all misogynistic shooters who hate women, stages demonstrations to get the documentary that discuss their issues banned. Do you still converse with that side assuming they will hear you?	0.871
>These male activists have targeted anything that smacks of feminism, forcing a university to cancel a lecture by a woman they accused of spreading misandry.   And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	• All protests for boys and men's issues, male suicide and the abuses males face get counterprotested by toxic feminists to suffocate it all, while at the same time the protesters getting discredited by feminist journalists to add further desperation. That doesn't help either with male suicide.	0.871
I'm just talking in general terms , women are tricky , good liars and actresses , so you never know who's a problem and who's not.	<p>That&#39;s what you might as well say when you spout such nonsense.  Amazing how women are so incapable of things (i.e. stupid as all hell) when it fits the narrative men bad, women good.  Otherwise women are smart, strong, powerful, independent and all that.  But oh man, a woman fucks up, she was the victim, coerced, she was depressed and the litany of other flimsy excuses that don&#39;t even fly for a freaking child.</p>	0.876
