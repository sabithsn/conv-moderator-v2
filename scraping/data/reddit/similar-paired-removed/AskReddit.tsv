As our coach is listing out each person's average and highest scores, she lists mine. Everybody claps.

Until 2019, Bayley was not only a hero-type, but a goodie-two-shoes hero. She came out heralded by ""Bayley Buddies"" (wacky inflatable tube men). She hugged everyone. She wouldn't even use weapons to beat a rival. And then, in 2019, after losing her Smackdown Women's Championship, she snapped, tore the Bayley Buddies apart with what I think was a crowbar, and slowly transformed into the ultimate mega-Karen that we loved to hate.	0.733

You've been brainwashed by the same institution that invented the term psyops in the first place. Your "people that think like you" is telling. You have been manipulated by a fascism ruse named "othering." You have bought into the idea that critical thought and skepticism should be banned world wide, that only a select few have the right to ask questions, and you call me anti-science? You have it backwards.      I won't be staying home, I'll be living my life while there's still some left of it. We can all die at a moment's notice, no matter how "safe" we pretend to be, or how much of our lives we hand to war criminals, and it didn't stop with Bush, the drones still fly today.	Nobody ever said a genocide was coming.  The analogy is about a corrupt power convincing the populous to hate a group of people based only on their beliefs.  That's it.  That's the analogy.  Dismissing hate like you just did is very concerning and reflective of the exact problem I'm talking about.	0.863

Why do things taste bad? My guess is that there isn’t anything that inherently tastes bad. It’s just that every organism has evolved to dislike poisons. So a big colony of nasty bacteria will probably taste bad to us because our bodies have evolved to avoid that stuff. It’d be super hard to make meat not taste like meat, but you can probably add something to it to made it taste like poison.</p>	0.816

Let’s pray that this never becomes truly illegal. Abortion is a necessary part of life	The best method to prevent abortion is free, long-term birth control, fact-based sex education (as opposed to the 'abstinence-only' crap), and a large increase in social services such as welfare, food stamps, free childcare, free education, and so forth. And yet, these are things that 'pro-life' people are almost universally against.	0.748

Gaylord Focker is probably the worst I know of. I heard he got married and had a couple kids.	<p>At one point my moms friends generosity ran out and she had her boyfriend throw us out. Afterward the whole situation kind of screwed me up. I thought it was my fault we got kicked out. I had some warped notion of this must be what a relationship was like. I heard from her son (we were in the same school) that she was pregnant and had a baby girl. We never used a condom and the timing lined up so still to this day I think maybe I got her pregnant.</p>	0.766

This is true, but many trans women are shorter than many cis women. If height is the real issue, then why are we talking about gender at all? Not to mention that hormone levels in trans women are tightly controlled, which is not the case for cis women. This means that many cis athletes actually have *higher* testosterone levels than their trans counterparts. As it stands, the current regulations are working, and rather than seeing trans women dominate (as some would have you believe), we actually see trans women winning less often than their cis counterparts, even when adjusted for population size.  In the end, this is an issue that has been basically solved already, and is mostly just being used as a culture war issue to win seats for politicians.  One more side note: "a transgender" is not really the preferred wording. It comes across a little dehumanizing, like saying "a black" to refer to a black person. Transgender is an adjective, so it doesn't really work as a noun like that. I am not "a transgender", I am a transgender woman (or a trans woman, or even just a woman).	<p>But if you allow trans women to set records for cis women, you’re disadvantaging a much larger portion of the population.

People who are concerned about transgender athletes often seem to claim to want some form of intra-sex equality of opportunity, where anyone they consider to be a particular sex should have the same opportunity to excel with the same amount of effort. Human bodies obviously don't work that way. Many people (me included) would have practically no chance of success at an elite level in either the XX or XY league. Any system that could come close to approximate intra-sex equality of opportunity in sports would also be able to approximate such equality of opportunity regardless of sex. Such a system would certainly require more than two categories to achieve its purpose of having everyone start on roughly even terms. Even if you have to create exactly two categories, I doubt chromosomes would be the most effective way of dividing up the population so that both categories were as competitive as possible.	0.787

"white opinion" you don't get to have an opinion on black people's business. however might i ask why people not being racist is cringey to you..?	If you have a hard time telling them apart it's because you don't spend alot of time with them, which isn't necessarily racist. So saying that either white or black people all look the same is racist imo, but if you say you have a have problems telling them apart it's not inherently racist"	0.84

There is a big difference between using the word as a form of racial discrimination, and saying it while singing along to a song.	People who are concerned about transgender athletes often seem to claim to want some form of intra-sex equality of opportunity, where anyone they consider to be a particular sex should have the same opportunity to excel with the same amount of effort. Human bodies obviously don't work that way. Many people (me included) would have practically no chance of success at an elite level in either the XX or XY league. Any system that could come close to approximate intra-sex equality of opportunity in sports would also be able to approximate such equality of opportunity regardless of sex. Such a system would certainly require more than two categories to achieve its purpose of having everyone start on roughly even terms. Even if you have to create exactly two categories, I doubt chromosomes would be the most effective way of dividing up the population so that both categories were as competitive as possible.	0.742

As a teen, watching teen shows and seeing all the characters making friends, going out, and forming relationships, meanwhile I sit at home and do nothing all day.	For me, it was low interest in toys. This was when I was also a kid. I knew a girl that would always invite me over to watch me play with her things. She never wanted to play or do anything with others and her house was full of brand new untouched looking toys. She only ever invited me and never talked to me much either besides asking if I wanted to play with specific stuff. Her parents were never home. Her  house was empty every single time I went over there and it was OFTEN. She always dressed up a lot even when she was outside. She didn’t look like she belonged there at all but my mom also overdressed me even though I was a tomboy so it didn’t bother me much. I get the feeling her family was extremely wealthy. When I asked where she got this amazing huge dollhouse she had, she just said her dad got it for her but had no emotion in it.	0.752
As a teen, watching teen shows and seeing all the characters making friends, going out, and forming relationships, meanwhile I sit at home and do nothing all day.	When i was in high-school I was so lazy for exercise, don't even mention weight lifting, i would just do squats and abs at home. So I thought the fastest way for me was just drinking my protein shakes and that's it. But i never gained weight.	0.749
As a teen, watching teen shows and seeing all the characters making friends, going out, and forming relationships, meanwhile I sit at home and do nothing all day.	I had no friends. I didn't eat lunch. Instead of going to recess I'd hide out in the library and sometimes not come to class for a while after -- no one noticed. Every time I visited the social worker it was about how I could make people like me and how I could change myself. The kids at fault never changed.	0.747

Well, I would certainly agree with you that the real problem is ***NOT*** trans women (or trans *people* for that matter). Side note: that's a great point for me to emphasize in future discussions, so thank you for that!   But rather, I think the root problem—in this discussion anyways—is, "laws that erode the category of 'female'". In my view that's the problem that needs to be solved.  And I think it will never get solved if liberal / progressive-minded groups continue their approach of censoring, bullying, and / or threatening anyone who disagrees with them. We as a society need to be able to communicate openly with one another and try to resolve our differences. There is no "us" or "them", except in our minds. We're all human, and we're all in this together. Every single person is right about some things, and wrong about other things. And we can help each other, to fill in the gaps where we fall short, and to help everyone be a better version of themselves!   /soapbox 😅	<p>Your examples with names are very clear, I get the issue. There are biases. But I don&#39;t think that forcing people to act in the opposite direction is going to solve the issue. You&#39;ll just foster an environment where Mohammads and Maggies will be the &quot;privileged class&quot;, and Johns and Harolds will be oppressed for no reason. That will be just as bad as what we have now, and I hope I don&#39;t need to explain why.</p>	0.845

I would be extremely wary of any legislation to force trans people to face legal penalties if they don&#39;t disclose their biological history to sexual partners, but at the same time I would be super disappointed in any trans person who didn&#39;t disclose it to a sexual partner voluntarily. Much of the problem here is that, when it comes to casual sex, especially among younger and more immature people, you&#39;re basically fucking a stranger...and that often leads to problems.</p>	0.823

Republican and democrat biased news networks literally lie and omit facts on a daily basis in order to push their own agendas.

What I've been reading/hearing about recently is that the whole "conversation therapy" name is really abused here. Of course it sounds horrible because we associate it with therapy that tried to force gay people into not being gay etc. But apparently the issue here is that this ban extends to the idea that a therapist would question or simply not automatically accept or agree with a kid who claims they're trans. So for example if a little girl comes out as trans after 4 other girlfriends in school did the same (apparently this is a thing) and her reasoning is that she has "masculine" interests or some nonsense, a therapist can't talk to her through that and about that, ask questions, etc before assigning her to hormone blockers or treatments, let alone reach the conclusion that the issue is something else and work with her on it. Therapists are apparently supposed to non questioningly validate the opinion of their patient	<p>Again, especially after becoming more aware of what women often have to put up with from men, she would have been very well within politeness to tell me to stop because my behavior <em>wasn&#39;t</em> okay. But as a socially awkward teenager who definitely wasn&#39;t performing active stalking and harassment, it was a huge blow to my self-confidence, and I felt tremendously guilty for years after the fact.</p>	0.851

Well yeah, but only having fried chicken is not enough of the stereotypes to make it racist.	Most veggies don't belong on burgers. They add nothing to the taste, and the mixing of textures makes me nauseous. (I'll actually add and remove pickles and onions just for their flavors to impart themselves onto the burger.)	0.799

Baking soda is a miracle worker that cleans everything from ovens to dishwashers. It can also clean your iron  Dampen a paper towel or rag with water or distilled white vinegar and dip a corner in baking soda or coarse salt. Baking soda is less likely to scratch your iron than coarse salt. Buff the soleplate clean. Wipe clean with a damp rag or paper towel.	<p>After brushing, I would use water to rinse the toothpaste from my mouth. Apparently what you should do is just spit out the toothpaste/foam, and that’s it. At first it felt strange, but now it feels completely normal and feels much cleaner. It doesn’t leave a weird taste in your mouth either, no different than after you’d rinse.</p>	0.804

You were afraid of losing your family… presumably through death or estrangement as that’s how you loose your family… that you held them to an impossible standard and told the second to youngest she was hurting the family??? What? That makes no sense.	You'll be confused about why she does these things. You'll be upset. You'll want to lash out yourself because you don't understand how your own mother could treat you so poorly. You'll start doing things to avoid bringing her wrath on you. You'll lie, and you'll get really good at it. You'll be a perfectionist at the things you think you can perfect, and you'll avoid everything you think you can't. You'll be afraid of coming home from school every day because you don't know what you're going to walk into. You won't feel safe or stable.

Im very left wing, but i think some of the pronoun stuff is a bit ridiculous. Fair enough calling someone whos transgendered by their preferred gender pronouns, but it doesnt need to be such a prominent subject that you have to ask everyone their pronouns when you first meet them, or that its on every form you have to fill in, and if you arent transgender, and even if youre gender neutral, you should understand that when other people have to refer to you when talking to others, they are just going to use whatever seems obvious. The amount of over labelling is just stupid. Pronouns are just words that have no power over you other than what you give to them	Although I'd prefer ""Trans people"" instead of ""Transgenders"", that phrase is used a lot to demean (like ""the gays"")."	0.855

The point is that gender and sex meaning different things is not an objective fact. It is a definition created by a small group of sexologists that has gained *some* support and common use, but I would be willing to bet that the majority of English speakers (going beyond the Reddit/Twitter bubble) think of gender and sex as being the same thing. So linguistically, your definition certainly can count as an alternative definition, but the word has certainly not undergone a full shift in definition.  And there was no "discovery" that gender and sex are different things. A few sexologists just up and decided that from now on gender meant gender identity, and sex meant biological sex. And that's the thing, we already had a perfectly good term: gender identity. Why do we need to change the meaning of the word gender?	<p>Like, no, hearing these slogans doesn&#39;t make me personally more conservative, but it&#39;s naive to think it doesn&#39;t push people away who could be persuaded.

The interesting thing is that I am not even a very left leaning fella (at least not in the european sense). I think some people are so deep into the thinking that anything 'liberals' dislike is something they have to support, just out of principle. And they forget that there was a time (not that long ago) where women weren't allowed to study, work, have a bank account choose their husband and they could be legally raped in their marriage next to other things just because they were women. And that such a system by definition is called patriarchy. And as a man i don't think I want my sister, daughter, friend or even me for the matter, to live in such a system."	0.824

And sex, by definition, tends to feel pretty good. I can only speak for myself, but I don’t really have a ranking system for the guys I’ve fucked. The terrible one night stands are more memorable. (Bonus question for both genders: How do you elegantly extricate yourself from sex once you become aware that the guy has a literal micropenis? Like, clothes were already off. It became a literal courtesy fuck because I didn’t want to crush his self esteem.)"	0.824

It takes two people to make a kid and the father should have some agency, even if I think the decision should ultimately be up to the mother. She certainly didn&#39;t take my brother into consideration even for a second.  His pleas for her to keep it were met with, &quot;I don&#39;t care, you don&#39;t get a say, I don&#39;t feel like it.

Edit: posted this before getting in the shower so basically r/showerthoughts ...but I don't think it should just be a choice for women either, the roles placed on men are arguably worse than those of women... expected masculinity and toughness- the phrase ""man up"" speaks for itself. If a man doesn't want to work and wants to be the ""trophy husband"" while his wife/ SO provides then that is his right.

rofl...says the 40+, overweight, broke single mom from manchester.  cute dog tho.	However this is by far my favorite Guy story: I worked alone, no bouncer no nothing, just me (5'2 woman, early 20s at the time) and one night I had a table of 6 frat bros try to walk out on a $200+ tab. So, being the enterprising young woman that I was, I chased them down the street to yell at them and try to get my money, because if not I was gonna have to pay for their tab out of pocket (yes, my boss did suck). I'm yelling at them, they're yelling at me - insisting they payed, calling me a fucking bitch etc etc and it starts to get a little scary. But then from behind me comes Guy, who seeing me run out of the bar had followed and he screams ""I WILL FUCK YOUR GIRLFIRENDS AND BURN YOUR HOUSES DOWN. PAY. HER."" and man, despite the fact that they out numbered him six to one, those frat fucks paid, and tipped.  I think they knew that you really, really should NOT pick a fight with crazy."	0.674

Men carry seed, which gets planted in that empty egg.	Also, when picking eggplants the rule is dots not slots. Look at the mark at the base of the eggplant. Pick ones that have nice round marks, not slot shaped ones. Apparently the for dot ones have fewer seeds. Again, that might be a bit of an old wives tale, but I always do it anyway.

The definition you literally just copy pasted agree with me.   >or lack of belief in the existence of god or gods  I don't know why you're so pig headed on this issue when it sounds like you haven't actually investigated the issue that much.   Why do you care so much? Especially when you're wrong.	The ""parasocial"" argument is dumb. All he does at this point is say ""I love my fans."" That's literally it.

Why do you care so much? Especially when you're wrong.	Then the other piece is facing the vast gap between what you wish you could do/what's needed to fix the problem and what you're actually able to do. This is really hard. It's easy to get into the spiral of ""why is it that no one seems to be doing stuff about this and there are these people with all this power who just seem to be interested in themselves and humanity is so fucked and..."" etc, continue disillusionment ad nauseam. Maybe you're even aware that it's kind of a crazy megalomanic thing to wish you could be a superhero and save everyone, so then you spiral into the second stage of ""not only can I not fix this but am I a narcissist/super villain in the making for even thinking that somehow I could be a savior figure? Am I a bad person?"" etc etc unhelpful spiral continues. I try to stop myself when I catch this and ask myself ""is this an effective thought train to follow that will materially contribute to making better the things I claim to want to make better?"" The answer is pretty much always no. So then you have to move back into the unfortunate reality that (1) there are a lot of awful things happening that, while maybe not 100% preventable, could be helped a lot more they are being helped (2) most ordinary people like us only have the power to address things on a small/local scale (3) there are people with power to address these problems who are often not only not trying to solve them but actively making them worse to further their own bottom line and MOST IMPORTANTLY (4) it's usually incredibly ineffective and unhelpful to the problem to dwell on these unfortunate realities. Try to be simultaneously compassionate to yourself—it's very understandable to feel overwhelmed by these shitty facts and doing so is a normal good human reaction—and to firmly guide yourself towards effective action—dwelling on these realities is ineffective at solving them and only reduces your momentum towards solutions."	0.832

What? She died so as to not ruin everyone's year? This has gotta be the dumbest shit on reddit I've ever seen. Eat rocks, dipshit	Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in."	0.816
