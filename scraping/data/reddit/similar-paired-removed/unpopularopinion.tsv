If you buy the houses that city folks are buying you won't have city folks duhhhhhhh	<p>Completely separate from that I have the opinion that there will not be an uprising in the US due to housing based on the fact that in times that were significantly worse, an overwhelming majority of people did not try to overthrow the government.</p>	0.801

If you buy the houses that city folks are buying you won't have city folks duhhhhhhh	Regardless, my point is that luxury purchases are not investments- I’m not saying no one should invest in real estate.

I work in the mental health field. Anybody who self-diagnoses themselves with a mental illness are annoying as fuck.  Go see what a actual bipolar manic episode looks like and then hear a early 20s basic white chick say they're bipolar because "mood swings". It's infuriating.	<p>It reminds me of when they went on about Adam Lanza having Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. I mean, he did absolutely awful things, but by immediately saying that he had such and such a condition, immediately people latch onto that. Speaking as someone who is neurodivergent,  it is annoying. It&#39;s universal in the world of mental illness, unfortunately. We stigmatize constantly. It&#39;s just that those with paedophillic disorder are scorned even more so, and it&#39;s even worse than stigmatizing other conditions because kids are at risk.</p>	0.833

I know someone who experienced mild depression after the loss of a loved one. That's definitely depression and you would be right to call it that. Also, an actual depressive episode such as a bipolar episode CAN be triggered by life stressors, but that's different from feeling sad for a day because you had an argument and then otherwise feeling fine. Yes, I think it's important to talk and receive support for no matter what you're dealing with -- anxiety, sadness, feelings of being overwhelmed, etc. I just disagree with using the term ""depressed"" for it. I've seen a lot of posts on this sub stating things like depression doesn't exist, or people with depression just need to change their mindset, or you shouldn't medicate yourself to deal with life, etc."	0.818

Not every young person with an older person is a victim of grooming but the underdeveloped frontal lobe of an 18 year old 'adult' makes them more susceptible to it. When there's clear red flags in a relationship where there's a large age gap, it is not unreasonable to question the motives of each partner. Red flags and age gaps almost ALWAYS meet in the middle, rarely does one have nothing to do with the other. There's always a motive when a grown ass adult wants to date some kid fresh out of high school."	0.797

Even if men do come out, we're belittled just like [Earl Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Silverman) or they’re gaslit into believing women have it worse as if the patriarchy gives us a free coupon for every hit or verbal abuse we take. The worst shit is when we’re being told that we’re taking up space. In the UK, [576,000 men and 1.2 million women](https://www.mankind.org.uk/statistics/) reported being abused and nearly 51% only reported their abuse. Let's also remember COVID-19 has shaken the table for a lot of victims in abusive relationships.	0.858

Some people shouldn't breed. Often times its the ones with the most kids, but some people shouldn't breed.	If you want to look for offence where none was intended, then that's up to you. The reality is, though, is that most heterosexual people aren't ""childfree"". They might not be able to have kids. The might not be able to afford to have kids. They might have missed the opportunity to have kids. But people who absolutely *don't* want kids are a minority."	0.801
Some people shouldn't breed. Often times its the ones with the most kids, but some people shouldn't breed.	Your argument is based on how it makes “no sense” when in fact it absolutely does. Not everyone has the desire to procreate. Not everyone has the opportunity to procreate. Not everyone wants to go through the process of carrying a child to full term (even though they can).  In all those instances someone may be biologically able but choose to go a different route.	0.8
Some people shouldn't breed. Often times its the ones with the most kids, but some people shouldn't breed.	Most people don't think these things about childfree people solely because of their decision to not reproduce. Except for the parents of the individuals in question, who might want grandkids, it doesn't affect anyone else whether or not these people want children. What people take issue with is the vitriol directed at ""breeders"" and indeed, at little children themselves. It's weird.	0.797
Some people shouldn't breed. Often times its the ones with the most kids, but some people shouldn't breed.

It's not necessarily that I (or anyone else cares about them) it is more so that (if nothing else) a law to dictate helmets/ seatbelts in order to reduce the chances of a kid getting traumatized from seeing someone splattered on the asphalt.	If you want to wear a helmet so bad, just do it. I don't intend to argue why you shouldn't wear protective gear, as long as it doesn't make things worse you can if you want to. I wouldn't tell a pedestrian to not wear helmet if they want to, if they fall it could help. Same goes for most things you can do.

Refusing to yield to faster traffic is more dangerous than speeding.  There is nothing more infuriating than being in the middle of a multi-hour road trip and having someone in the left lane who will not move over to let you by, despite going under the speed limit.  What makes the most sense is that you must yield to overtaking traffic if you are in any lane except the right lane (i.e. passing lanes).  For some reason, some people are either unaware that there are other cars on the road or they feel entitled to dictate the flow of traffic. Slow traffic not moving out of the passing lanes is what causes traffic jams and accidents due to many people passing on the right.  Slow driving in passing lanes is oblivious at best, usually inconsiderate, and dangerous at worst.

Either way, if the government just raises taxes on each citizen by the amount given by the GUBI, it does nothing to help citizens, and in countries with enough citizens and a low enough GDP, the taxes they pay would be less than the money they get.

For example, even if there's no censorship, I probably won't be able to write a newspaper criticizing the Supreme Leader if all the means of production are owned by the government. They may not directly ban my publication but there are several different perfectly reasonable excuses they'll use (""we are cuting too many trees so we have to reduce paper consumption"", ""we have shortages so we'll only provide ink to essential services"", ""only fact-checked publication are allowed in official sotres"" and so on)	0.741

The only difference between that and BLM/Antifa is how socially acceptable or unpunishable a violent action becomes."	0.809

What specifically changed for me was a day in 3rd grade when a classmate called my mom a ""fat bitch."" My reaction was abbhorent and indicative of the racist household I was raised in. I will forever feel ashamed of what I said but my only offer of understanding is that I was 8 and unfortunately being raised by a a white junky racist step dad at the time. When the kid called my mom a ""fat bitch,"" I called him something I'd heard my step dad say at the TV or black charecters on TV...I called him a ""stupid N*****.""

If you want to argue something you need to cite your work. And knowing someone conveniently dose not count. Cuz I can say oh well my uncle has ocd or my best friend and those certain are not valid reasons to claim you understand what they go through and what helps. From my personal experience I know drugs and therapy didn’t help *Me* however I also can function perfectly normal outside just not in my own home. Drugs actually made it worse for me cuz it gave me panic attacks and more frequently. I’ve even been homeless a few times over the last 4 years once caused because I almost burned my house down due to therapy not working and fear that my house was completely full of germs.  Regardless my personal experience only makes up for my own experience not everyone who suffers from ocd, some have more or less severe cases and from different points and possible reasons. Just cause one person has it a certain way dosnt mean everyone dose. It just means you don’t have an absolute answer.

It's not a weird expectation that someone make an effort to leave common areas comfortable for all. That's some selfish trashy "sweet home Alabama" shit.  And if my partner can't be clean and decent they can fuck right off. I've never experienced this issue through all my partners, but this incel neckbeard hillbilly shit isn't normal and shouldn't be normalized.	My friends have children who are not spoiled and they are cool . So in  truth I hate the fucking useless parents of brats too.   In the UK these useless parents take their children to the pub with them  so you can't even escape the little cu**s there either.. it's so fucking annoying .. So if you want to get on with adult strangers , don't be annoying don't be over indulged ."	0.865

I bet you're an unmarried man. Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing. My lived in 2 cents.	My experience is a little different to OP because I have only been with 2 women. My whole kink is getting them off so I also put in the work to make sure they get theirs but my wife&#39;s work friends have all made the statement (to my wife whom later told me) about their sex lives not being as fulfilling because their male partners rarely get them off. In my opinion I agree with OP that the issue would be a lot of laziness on mens side to put in work for their partners pleasure.</p>	0.857

One of my favorite ""smart"" jokes was in the pilot for Rick and Morty\*. A scene where Rick and Morty has to go through galatic customs is preceded by Rick saying he hates bureaucracy. Moments later, they are fleeing the people at galatic customs, Rick throws Morty a gun, and tells him it's okay to shoot the guards because ""they're just robots"". After Morty shoots one in the leg and he begins screaming and bleeding out, Morty says, ""they're not robots, Rick"". To which Rick responds, ""it's a figure of speech Morty! They're bureaucrats!

The fact that the media added her age and race to make her seem like she was the victim clearly shows this was media bias, if it was a George Floyd situation, it would make total sense because he did comply but got claustrophobia causing him to panic. But her on the other hand, she was asked more than once to shop and even said ""I'm gonna stab the fuck out of you, bitch"" as her last words.	0.771

That said, it does have a lot going for it. I found the themes quite interesting. I thought the scene were Rachel discovers she's a replicant and her life has been a lie, and plays the piano whilst contemplating the significance, or lack thereof, of her life and her memories, with that amazing soundtrack was well done. I also like the famous tears in rain monologue. It sounds poetic, but Roy's arc is too. He's a combat replicant, built to kill and has done for his whole life, yet for his last act he saves Deckard. Maybe all this pales in comparison to the book but I haven't read it. There's definitely more to it than a lot of other sci-fi ""classics"". I prefer it to a few of the other supposed classics I've seen, for example Aliens, which I really didn't think was that great(I do really like Alien though).	0.764

weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"

weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"

What another user mentioned that is a lot better argument is that men can get a vasectomy for free, which is indeed a gross imbalance.

I love how you bring up slavery as if it’s only limited to just the two places and not a thing that has been around in every human culture. Countries that reform for the better are great but regressing into degeneracy isn’t get the idea? Ik you twisted fucks are into that but damn.	One thing that I do find weird however is that, even when we are rooting for Americans, they get oddly defensive about it. Of course i'd rather see them get better healthcare, better workers rights, better social security, etc... Im not here to laught at you because im better off, im here because i wish you all had it as good as us. But when we start talking about this stuff a large majority like to pretend that no healthcare is better for x, y, z reasons, that capitalism pushed to it's limit is the best thing in the world, that workers rights are for dirty commies and whatnot. Honestly it just makes me sad. I want to see them thrive, not read horror stories upon horror stories about things that could be easily prevented"	0.838

Focus on building the world you want and not tearing down the one you see. I truly think that's the path of least resistance and what is most likely to allow us to strip away racism in this country.

Ik you twisted fucks are into that but damn.	the reality is groups of people act pretty predictably given a set of material conditions. It's not really exclusive to black people, it's everybody. Hence why progressives care about fixing the material conditions that influences the behavior. It just goes back to conservatives be against like welfare or government improvement in social service and will post hoc justify it by saying you're the real racist for advocating for those positions"	0.827

None of those are facts, but different definitions being asserted by different groups. I can also link you to a page that defines racism to mean that POC cant be racist because the definition of racism is prejudice + power.   Here's one from an actual dictionary: Gender: "either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones."  Much easier to see that its linked to sex here.	People just changed the meaning of gender and argue over it. It’s semantics. If gender means what sex chromosomes you have they’re are 2 (XX, XY) and if it’s and identity thing then it can be infinite or a spectrum, but the argument is just what the word gender means. People need to stop arguing over words it’s dumb as shit. Just get down to what the argument is—1 side says that all there is is XX (woman) people and XY (men) people. The other side says they’re are more genders then that but I don’t see why that side can’t admit that 99% or whatever gender you identify with or are even, still fall into either the XX or XY category.  So it doesn’t even matter, because someone calling you a girl (if you have XX sex chromosomes) is completely logical even if you identify as something else. Words have meanings and boy and girl just mean XY and XX.	0.854

Saying sex is assigned is somewhat dishonest as it implies it is not an objective, physical trait of a person but rather given to a person somewhat like a name is. Sex is observed, not assigned. They claim gender is along the lines of how a person self identifies as it relates to their sex. Perhaps a clumsy definition/ rewording on my part but close enough I think. Correct me if you think I’m wrong here. If this is the definition you want to use than sure I can agree there is a spectrum as different people make themselves into unique people and have different ideas on what makes a good man or woman. Regardless however each person is either a man or woman. Regardless of how you define your personality it does not change your biology. Speaking of changing biology they also mention trans people. These individuals are aware of the fact they are a man or woman but do not appreciate it and choose to make themselves more like and call themselves the other. This does not change the fact that they are a man or woman even if the individual chooses to undergo hormone supplements, surgery, changing their name, or anything else. Their outward look may change but it does not change what they are. No more than I can make myself a different race. My genes always remain the same. Also thanks for taking the time to reply.

If we called either of those sexist, I'd be questioning that as well, simply because the fact that both exist contradicts the idea that there's any sexist, unequal treatment of one gender compared to another. Yes, Manic Pixie Dream Girl is applied to women, but there are male equivalents to it and all of them are pretty much just more specific sub-categories of ""the Mentor."""	0.822

There's no law saying that newspapers can only use the specific legal terms. They could call a woman a rapist with no repurcussion. Men who have sex with minors aren't convicted of rape either because the legal term for that isn't rape."	0.804

Homophobe? I think your confusing the terms there. Really your really ignoring all the shit posted about her but you’ll go along with all that how very convenient of you. Men don’t being in the women’s restroom and just to clarify cis women don’t feel comfortable with trans women in the restroom in general.	Someone saying they don't like how Disney wrote Rey, for example, doesn't make them a misogynist, yet I've seen people snap back with 'you just don't like strong female characters'. Like, c'mon, it's got nothing to do with their gender and everything to do with lazy writing. If anything the people calling foul are even more guilty of it by primarily defining the character by their gender."	0.879

I have nothing against trans people, I hope trans people face less discrimination and are more accepted by society - but I am still critical of the idea that anyone can invade safe spaces for women if they make the claim that they&#39;re also women - and according to you that makes me transphobic. I don&#39;t feel transphobic, but if the bar of phobia is some critique in some instances, then maybe I am. And if I am, then why should I support the cause?</p>	0.871

If you think trans women are just men in dresses, you're problematic. Genuinely just Google it if you wanna know more, however if you're transphobic you won't care what she did.

Probably though the good thing is modern psychology already throws out most of that only thing that remains is the trans crap.	Battlefield is pretty much the same story except it bothers me that they have repeatedly removed fantastic features and then when they go to readd them they are terrible version of it (Commander in BF4 is nothing like on BF2) of course MP use to be the only focus of Battlefield (and mod support)	0.783
Probably though the good thing is modern psychology already throws out most of that only thing that remains is the trans crap.	<p>By your logic, all anyone can be is agnostic, as there&#39;s no &quot;proof&quot; for either-or. Except when there is, plenty of documented miracles, but let&#39;s disregard those unpopular examples for now. The point is, &quot;religious&quot; is a word that describes a belief, not a &quot;knowledge&quot;. It should be the same with &quot;atheist&quot;, but they barely ever talk about what they believe in, from my experience. They mostly define themselves via their negation of others&#39; beliefs. I&#39;m sure there are others, but since nowadays it&#39;s unpopular to think about big questions like this for oneself and instead adopt one of the simple labels, we have &quot;atheists&quot; who don&#39;t know what they believe in and &quot;religious&quot; people who openly claim not to believe in what their religion entails.</p>	0.777
