See what I mean? You don't even consider what I have to say, You aren't engaging with any points, you're just attacking me. I'm trying my best to have an actual conversation with you and you refuse.	> Your response to my comment where I made it clear I wasn't interested in engaging with you, simply because I choose not to argue with a hostile opponent, further proves your hostility.	0.694
>Vaccine mandates are not "backed by science"  You still have not admitted this was the most retarded thing to say, which was the only reason I ever bothered to try to educate you.

And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren’t willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid. Not sure we have anything left to discuss here.	You're again trying to focus just on the literal or even artistic meaning. It doesn't have anything to do with that. You can say the word with the exact same meaning and intent, and the pushback will be the same. Why? Because it's not at all about the meaning.	0.469

A couple of people had, until you have no downvoted my comments.  Reported because you are deliberately being a difficult, obtuse cunt.

I had 3 likes on both of my comments until you happened to mention it. Other people grasped the premise. But you have continually shown to be obtuse throughout the entire comment thread on your post.   This is a subreddit for people able to change their mind and engage in debate, not rant on a soapbox.	But you weren't the only person who jumped to the conclusion that I must have been making that gatekeeping argument and smacking him down for being too ignorant to have an opinion. That just couldn't be further from the truth as far as how I feel, nor do I feel like that's at all a fair reading of my response. I also already addressed this misperception because even though hundreds or thousands of people liked my post and clearly got the gist of it being mere questions from a few different perspectives, some open ended and some a little more leading or challenging just to feel OP out--but in know way was I making an argument myself at that point.

Oh enlightened one. I've just learned another noble truth of which I had no prior knowledge. Criticism is not the same as insults. Who would've known? Truly you are blessed with knowledge.	<p>You have criticized others for choosing to remain ignorant.  Now that you&#39;ve been presented evidence from myself and others that contradicts your views, what are you going to do?</p>	0.62
No, you haven't. Your "supporting arguments" are just more assertions of yours. I haven't seen you actually counter a single comment anyone left, only tiny fragments and strawman takes of their stance. You've repeatedly refused to actually elaborate on the entirety of your post, and accused people of gaslighting for calling out your flimsy arguments. If you have details to provide, provide them here. There's no reason to go to dms except to either break sub rules or to save face when no details are sent.	<p>This isn&#39;t a debate sub. The idea of this sub is that you come here with a view that you are at least willing to change and that others will come with counter arguments. So, yes...I ignored what you said and provided counter arguments because that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to do.</p>	0.647
Again, I have. Plenty of times. If you don't want DMs then go ahead and engage with me respectfully here. But I'm not engaging if you're going to be bad faith.	Shame on me though for giving you an honest and considered response. Even though I can see it coming a mile away... I still engage... even as I'm saying I'm not going to engage.	0.55

Again, context....  You are clearly missing the context here.  Your point would be valid if this werent withing the larger context of the conversationsation being specifically about the jan 6th riot.   If were talking about tomatoes and i say how much i hate fruit, then youll know im also saying i hate tomatoes.  Not sure how you still dont understand how context works.  Literaply every respnse youve made has failed to take that into consideration.  Meanwhile you accuse me of putting words in someones mouth while you are at the same time taking words out.  Additionally, if you think my asking if you can follow a conversation is rude, the same can be said for asking if i am even making a point.  Hypocrite.  Im done with you, you clearly have the reading comprehension and debate skills of a grade schooler.	I have to say there&#39;s not point continuing trying to debate the point.

Incels are mainly white dudes. Wanting to rape and kill women is not a very diverse coalition. Which is a good thing.	Incel isn't just a 'thing'. It's a mentality. It's a community of people. It's words and phrases like chad and normie and betabux. It's internalizing those words and meanings and using them to interpret the world, the people in that world, and the interactions had with others. It's about learning a whole new way to read people and interactions and also to think about how people behave, how people communicate, and what your lot is in life. It's racism that's baked into it and the concept that whiteness is the *best* race and how many of them share a view that black men are 'stealing' all the women.	0.68
It's such a small % that actually get offended, and in most of these cases, the one offended isn't even part of the "appropriated group"; but rather, acting on their behalf.   I think the entire outrage stems from sensationalism of media, and making clicks for $$$.   The people that "ban" the expression of cultures are likely afraid of media backlash.	I mean, I get that. But at the end of the day when someone who isn't part of the culture is depicting that culture, they're not going to pick up on every facet of the way that culture is generally expressed. But sure, that doesn't mean they're trying to poke fun or cause offense, like. Aye, they're just making a wee bit of media that's probably meant to be consumed by people who wouldn't even pick up on the more subtle cultural touchstones you'd take for granted."	0.668

I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	<p>No argument here. I mean, some hunters hunt just for meat or the general sport (not the trophy), but hunting for meat also means preferring larger animals (hunters are usually limited in how many animals they can harvest, and tags aren&#39;t cheap, so there&#39;s reason to be picky, but you are taking a gamble turning down a kill).  I know fishing is undergoing some reworking specifically about this. The status quo is you can only harvest X fish above Y length/weight or whatever. This is a proxy for age, which is basically a proxy for &quot;has this fish bred yet&quot; so we don&#39;t accidentally drive the whole species to extinction. Turns out, that puts massive evolutionary pressure for smaller fish sizes, and now wild fish grow smaller. The new proposals (and I think in some places, actual practice) is you can harvest X fish in range A, Y fish in range B, Z fish in range C, etc. Maybe something similar can be applied to hunting, but I&#39;m not sure how.

CMV: Student debt shouldn't be cancelled. I was making 60k a year out of school with 50k of loan. I lived very frugally for 3 years ( shared accommodation, no car, barely eating out, no vacations) to get rid of that debt. I don't fucking want to pay more taxes for other people to get rid of their debt.	<p>With that concept out of the way, let&#39;s consider what is happening when we cancel the debt. Basically, the expenses of the education are short-circuited, meaning that the money for the debt is directly created by government activities, meaning that the end result is exactly the same, with the exception that the student now doesn&#39;t have to pay interest on their student loan, meaning they can be more productive earlier in life. This has enormous benefits for the economy because instead of paying off money that technically never existed, we now have people who can save and invest money back into industry.</p>	0.72

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	If the 6th riots were the same, I.e. people taking to their communities to march, agitate, or even riot, I’d be inclined to defend their rights to do so. What makes it different was that it was not an indiscriminate show of defiance against a real or perceived injustice, it was a coordinated effort with *specific* political motives, which crosses the line into a domestic terrorism event, or given the facts, an act of insurrection.	0.697

What a load of propaganda.   ‘Israel is the only democracy…. Bla bla bla….’  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.   As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.    Sorry you chose to ignore the manner in which israel gained and maintains its land and jewish majority, while ignoring the occupation, but that doesn’t make these issues go away.   Your reply is pure parroting of israeli talking points I and everyone who has attempted to discuss this issue has heard ad nauseam.	<p>The point of the above is to say, Israel <em>did</em> take the land as a result of conquest during war, in 1967, and have have had plenty of opportunity to kick the Palestinians out since then.  If Israel really wanted them gone, they could have - and should have - gotten that done before 1970, at the height of their power.</p>	0.725

That's a wild take. Are you really going to pretend that you can't make a connection between the origin of someone's name and their likely ethnicity?

In practice, a lot of people will choose the patriarchal naming scheme, not out of hypocrisy as you pretend, but out of habit and practicality.

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	I’m solidly in camp “legalize weed.” For some people - yeah, it’s got shitty effects. *Just like alcohol.* What I struggle with are anti-pot folks who aren’t also anti-nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol.

In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened.

Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	<p>I think you don&#39;t understand it if you think the way he hasn&#39;t paid taxes for decades are the same rules that apply to everyone? Who gets offered their entire compensation in stock? The top 0.01%? What proportion of those can borrow enough against those stocks that they never have to sell and can afford to live like the top 0.001%? How is that the same rules that apply to everyone?</p>	0.674

HERO?!?  WAYYY Closer to conman than hero..  1) Hyperloop will NOT and CANNOT exist until new materials are created and more efficient ways to generate vaccums exist, this entire concept is bullshit.  2) Fully Automated cars.. Consider The Las Vegas loop ONLY has tesla cars on it, it is 100% controlled environment, traffic wise, and they STILL do not trust the AI enough to allow it full control in that tunnel.  3) The Solarcity scam.. Shoulda been jail time for this one  4) People traveling on earth by rocket ship... GTFO, you have to be a moron to believe this one  5) He didn't found tesla, he paid for the right to say he founded tesla  6) He got fired from leading paypal, only got the huge payout when someone else took over and turned it around  7) Flying Tesla cars?  Electric Diesel Semis that are cheaper than Rail?  Tesla Automated Taxis that can earn people 30k a year?  8) StarLink?  A system that needs 10k sattelites that have to be replaced every 5 years?  9) Even SpaceX, was built on the idea of being able to launch a rocket, recover it and launch it again in 24 hours, the fastest turn around so far that I can find is 27 days.  The reason his taxes are so high this year is because he is dumping stock like a mad man while his company is so grossly overvalued.  So what if he pays 10 billion in taxes, if he sold 50 billion in stock, thats literal chump change.	<p>That&#39;s not quite true. Tesla was very wealthy compared to an average person. The fact that he never became a billionaire had more to do with the fact that he had no interest in business and personal wealth.

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he’s going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of “richest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone”	I don't exactly admire Elon Musk, but, I think his cult following can be mainly attributed to him being perceived as competent in physics, economics, industrial engineering, software development, etc. Not just him being a billionaire.	0.703
It’s always so funny when someone takes the most productive human on the planet and tries to poke holes in them. What an ugly side of human nature.

Men should sexualise women because that's what women are meant to be - sexy. The whole point of a woman is to attract a man so they can reproduce. How? By being sexy.

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society).

>Sure, there will still be boomers  An ageist cunt such as yourself arguing for the abolition of another form of discrimination. Sounds about right for this sub.	No your generally asserting that these phrases/words are ageist and sexists when their primary usage isn't meant to be. You're shutting down a conversation by focusing on semantics and nothingness. I mean I called it conservative because they love to do that, but even if you remove that, it's still a rhetorical slight of hand rather than an argument. The point is not that they are old the point is that they are out of touch with reality but still assert themselves in the public discourse with a presence that other groups lack. There are lots of boomers (old people) who are not like that and there are lots of grifters that get tagged with the label who complain that they are not technically old enough to be boomers, when it's not about their age but their bullshit.	0.68

"to see who rules over you- simply find who you are not allowed to criticize"  -voltaire  I find it interesting how quickly those with even a little bit of power rush in to desperately silence any talk of how the roles are being reversed.  liberals openly denigrate white people in private and in public but bringing it up gets u silenced.  I wonder why?  I wonder what ur group is trying to cover up?	Why might you think that white people shy around conversations on racial policy decisions? If I were to guess, I would say that the toxic culture of accusing people of 'white fragility' plays into this quite well. The central idea of accusing someone of 'white fragility' centers around directly targeting their social and mental insecurities on racial topics. If a white person, for example, wanted to voice a genuine opinion on a racial topic, especially one that questions the fundamental stability of racial legislation, they may be accused of things like 'white fragility' and 'white privilege'. From what I have observed in my lifetime talking with young people, there is no real place for white people who want to voice critical thinking against racial policies and be taken seriously outside of the conservative media. So I guess I would say that white people would have a tendency to shy away from these conversations, but simply because they know that the color of their skin will be a dictating factor in the input they can make. This is a dangerous thing. When we limit the voice of the dominant racial group from voicing opinions on topics that impact everyone, we create separate echo chambers and shut down genuine criticism by targeting the person, and not their beliefs. The whole 'white fragility' accusation culture reminds me a lot of the Ad Hom fallacy, being that it attacks the person's unchangeable attributes as a representation of the legitimacy of their beliefs."	0.637

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	How's that? I don't think you're countering his core point very effectively here. OP is making an argument that whatever your sex happens to be, that does not imply that you are locked into a certain set of values or attributes corresponding to that sex. We've had exceptions of that since the dawn of man. While it is true that societies have a tendency to shape stereotypes and certain expectations that correspond to things like sex, social class, ethnicity and much more, this doesn't mean that you are in any way inhibited from expressing or realizing your true self, lest you decide that you're gonna fall victim to stereotypes, which I personally believe is the true 'problem' that non-gender people are battling with."	0.709

The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	<p>Cracker is perjoritive that is distinctly different from other slurs. &quot;Crack&quot; refers to the crack of a whip. &quot;Cracker&quot; is specifically a negative word about oppressors. Compare this to some other slurs. I really hope this doesn&#39;t trigger an automod, but terms like wetback and spear chucker are specifically terms that insult people on a perceived historical issue of inferiority. The first of those words is based on how Hispanics often had to swim across the Rio grande to enter the country, while the second of those terms is referring to how a group of people got slaughtered and enslaved because they didn&#39;t have guns.</p>	0.775

> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	I agree. I'm a fan of what works, but I think you are missing the point of labelling something systemic racism. The term is misused, to be sure. But as I have said before, my view is that basically a lot of things are a result of system racism and the perpetuation is something that happens naturally pretty much. That doesn't mean addressing *racists* is the solution, but it does help impel people to act. If they believe all the disparities are because of a lack of ""personal responsibility"", because all poor people are idiots or something, then they are (1) wrong and (2) unlikely to think helping is worth it.	0.738

I really hope this post wasn't just you feeling uncomfortable about possibly being a racist or that you were called racist and felt it was unfair. This is very common amongst whites: they have a strong desire to lump as many people into the ""racist"" label as they can, and that dilutes the power of this label, since if everyone was racist, why would we care who was a racist anymore? Often I see whites do exactly this, and once they've achieved their objective, their next move is to forget that racism exists, since hey I guess we're all racist so who cares, amirite? And then the FAR WORSE consequences of racism no longer get singled out, the spectrum of severity is blurred, and people just don't care anymore, all because some fragile white egos didn't like that they could be the cause of problems affecting minorities, or more likely, that they could do more to prevent it and undo it, but they won't, because giving up one's power requires sacrifice, and sacrifice is hard.

Last time I checked, rabies is a medical condition.    >We're talking etymology, where there's no such thing as original meaning. We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written.

It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary.

As far as I can tell, the first phobia that was coined is ""hydrophobia"", and the earliest phobia in a meaning that isn't literal fear, but aversion, is ""photophobia"".

Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.

I have read very many stories of male victims of Domestic Violence being arrested rather then helped.  Male offenders get [60% more time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002) for the same crime.

The phrase "gender identity" might be somewhat recent, but we have data about people identifying with various genders that dates well over a thousand years.  By the way, the term "constructive conversation" doesn't mean just lying down and accepting whatever factually false bullshit some random bigot on the internet throws at you. It is reasonable to continue the conversation without pretending as if the wrong transphobic bullshit you write was true.

We need to be able to use words appropriately to be able to communicate - for example, it is appropriate to say that you are a transphobic bigot. If you don't want to be called a transphobic bigot, you should stop being transphobic and bigoted.

And then there’s people as well who are *fine* with trans people, but for some reason *get upset when you label things as transphobic*. These are the “we must tolerate the intolerant” types. You see them a lot on Reddit, but it’s interesting because it seems to be mostly limited to Reddit.

The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.	Thirdly, the reason I imagine there's the double standard between men and women watching gay and lesbian porn is because heterosexual mainstream porn can fully cater for men. You could easily find almost any sex act involving a man and a woman catering for the man. So the only extra bit in gay porn is the gay sex. Conversely, as I already mentioned, mainstream heterosexual porn doesn't easily cater for what the women want to see unless they want the ""rough and male orientated"" sex. So then the lesbian porn is the easier to find, more sensual and female orientated option."	0.64

Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options.

[This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	If you look at the study, randomly assigning partners results in 89.8% of relationships having a taller man.	0.66
This is obvious to me. Everyone here who disagrees is living in a fantasy world.

After all, thousands of top highschool male sprinters have broken the women&#39;s world record. Yet, we haven&#39;t heard anything about transwomen doing the same.

I didn’t mean art per say, but arts degrees (could be bachelor of dance, or bachelor of music, or gender studies). Undoubtedly some of these are needed but when you look at the demand for jobs in these areas and contrast it to degrees, many people taking these degrees never get a graduate job and are usually rich young girls studying something they find interesting or someone with a clearly unrealistic view of their skills/talents and/or the job market.  Our taxes should NOT be used to support these people so if we do cancel student debts it should have some sort of criteria that includes familial asset checks, degree type etc.   But people signed up for uni knowing the debt etc and I don’t think they should be bailed out as people going to uni are already privileged ON AVERAGE. Would prefer taxes support the working class in unskilled jobs or trades	I think the characterization of people who cannot pay their student loans as not having worked hard enough is not necessarily true. The fact of the matter is that certain people are not valued by the economy as much as others (ie. teachers, researchers, psychologists, etc), but this does not mean that these people do not work hard, or are willing to work hard. It also does not mean they are less valuable to society as a whole. Where would our culture be without Shakespeare or Rousseau or any number of great authors, psychologists, political thinkers, teachers etc. Furthermore, a lot of these expensive undergrad degrees (psychology, Poli-Sci, etc) really require a higher level of education (grad school, law school, med school) to be really valuable. Oftentimes, the student might simply not have enough money for more schooling and be forced into the workforce with a degree that does not pay as much, and be forced into a field that is not even relevant to their major.	0.673

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	it seems to me that you are conflating sex and gender and treating them as the same category, and this is where 99% of conversations about this topic end up falling apart. sex is biology. gender is a social category. gender is changeable and has been changeable throughout the entirety of human history"	0.685

OP you shouldn't have focused on MMA fighting specifically bc now people are only stating "include weight" classes as the main solution to this. This is obviously not applicable in most other sports (like in the context of track and field sports for instance) and sports where men have biologically advantages other than just weight. I agree with you so that's all I have to say.	Boxing has weight classes, it does actually have rules set to address biological advantages to try and make things fair. Turns out...this is possible!	0.699

Trans people should only compete with other trans people. If anyone needs proof that men and women are not made equal, google Lucia Riker. Aka lady tyson, the best female kickboxer of all time. Undefeated. Expect for the time she fought a man. He didnt outweigh her, and he wasnt a professional fighter like she was. He was an amauter who never went on to do anything. A no name random. But a man. And he knocked her out. No woman on earth could even touch her. But a man put her to sleep in 3 rounds. Not a pro either. She was way better than he was in terms of technique. But you cant beat nature.	If a trans-woman, who was a below average male athlete for her entire life befor this, is allowed to compete in the women's category and is suddenly a world championchip contender, that wouldn't really be fair either, would it?	0.741
>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	Let's start with the argument itself. I am going to amend it slightly to fit the conventions of the argument, as there's no point in talking about an argument nobody is really making. The argument, in essence, is that it's impossible to be racist against white people because racism has a societal and institutional component. If a person's prejudices (which are still possible under this line of thinking) are not institutionally backed and enforced, then it is not racism. It's kind of an academic argument, one I don't think is especially well suited for politics, but it makes sense in the world of finicky definitions and hairsplitting that is academia. It's an attempt to distinguish prejudices that have some social and political power behind them from generic prejudice, so to speak. It is a valuable distinction in academia because academics who deal in these subjects are often more focused on the complexities of racism and how it manifests at a systemic level. There is theoretically a debate to be had here, but it kind of boils down to ""This framing of racism lets us define a wider range of behaviors and more easily dig into the complexity."" versus ""This framing of racism is wrong because any form of prejudice based on race is racist.""	0.674

Absolutely. Democracy doesn't scale up very well.   Plus, Minnesota and Iowa combined are like the size of all of Germany. It's absolutely absurd that 50 states all pass the buck up the ladder to the ineffectual boners on the top of the pile.   The founding fathers did not want a congress	IIRC (please correct me if I’m wrong) the population of each state (or county) is NOT equal to the representation in the house. We have the senate for example which is COMPLETELY weighted to make small states have a giant say in legislation. We most likely disagree as to whether or not that’s a good thing but having some level of national direct democracy like I’m suggesting would not stop small states from having power.	0.641

So you had a car, which many people don’t have. Thanks for agreeing with my point.  It also sounds like you didn’t have kids, since forcing children to live in a car and relying on the slim chance that you get a job that deals with food and lets you have that food in advance of getting paid so you can put food in your children’s mouths is not a realistic path to take. It also sounds like you didn’t have any elderly relatives who relied on you for their wellbeing, who you’d have to abandon if you just took off.  I’m not asking you to feel bad for me. I have a very comfortable life and have no need or desire to get out of my situation. I’m just not so self-centered and short-sighted that I can’t imagine situations that are very different than mine, an ability that you apparently do not possess.	<p>I’m still that same girl, just better informed. I’m now no longer pro life, but the same empathy that drove me to become very active in the pro life movement motivates me to strongly enjoy helping strangers. I regularly do things like buy a couple of days in a hotel for a homeless person &amp; order them an Uber to take them there, carry bags of packaged food &amp; water bottles in my car to give to homeless people or stuff like when a few weeks ago I overheard a bartender who was serving me at a restaurant comment to a waitress that she doesn’t want to work tomorrow, but she has to because she’s stressed about her car payment due Monday, and after the waitress left, I called the bartender’s name so she’d turn around and handed her two hundred dollar bills. She was confused, and once she understood it was for her, she started crying. I’m not power leveling - I don’t tell people in my real life that I do these things, and I don’t think I’m that great of a person for it because they aren’t huge good deeds when percentage wise compared to my income (like I said, I’m a stripper). I just enjoy being able to come through &amp; show empathy when I encounter people who are stressed &amp; in need. When I was brainwashed &amp; in a socially conservative environment, it led me to being pro life, while now, I express this desire in other ways.</p>	0.539
I didn't say that humans were the same as other animals or that we should be equal.     I said was criticising the beliefs I described.     You're making a sort of slippery slope argument here where by not believing humans are special, we would begin giving other animals Human Rights?  Don't be daft dude.   Humans are different than other animals, they just aren't special or better because they have souls or because they're shaped like a God.	If you say that people of different races are equal because all people are equal, you are then admitting that people have an inherent value.

First, I said "perhaps you believe"? I didn't accuse you of anything.      I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly. Then why would humans not killing eachother be any measure of us being "special"?   You want to talk about non sequiturs?     Riddle me that.      And don't blame your inability to CMW as my fault?	2) You are different from a lion because a lion cannot be held morally accountable. They act on instincts, so whatever they do is neither moral nor immoral. You are someone with moral responsibility because you can choose actions with varying consequences.	0.594
I agree with you completely, but as a white guy when I get asked about race on an application that spends more time talking about efforts at diversity than the job requirements… it’s clear I’m not the type of applicant they’re looking for.  Honestly though this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.  The sooner we start focusing on giving everybody an equal opportunity in life instead of measuring equality by outcomes, the better.	<p>Whether diversity quotas or similar programs are &quot;just&quot; in their attempts to right the past wrongs of racial injustice throughout America&#39;s history, or if they&#39;re causing the problem to fester further, is a question we&#39;d need to answer before tackling if they count as systemic racism. And frankly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a question we&#39;ll be able to solve until we see the effects decades from now.</p>	0.709
Yes, and humans kill eachother all the time too.     Great argument for why humans are special.	<p>However, if my assumption above is wrong, and you&#39;re exclusively thinking that we only cannot kill any living human being, then my question would be: what makes human beings so special as compared to the rest of the living things in the world? Intelligence? Some great apes show intelligence comparable to a toddler. Does that mean they should also not be killed anyhow? Some other animals have been tested to show intelligence greater than human babies. Pigs are one of them, yet we still kill millions of them for food. Is that wrong or not? If it is not wrong to kill pigs for food, why can&#39;t we kill human babies (or even simpler, foetuses)?</p>	0.642
> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.  That is not obvious at all. You are literally here, *in this post*, doing exactly that.	<p>This is offensive to you, because you believe you are depressed beyond your control... And so you are. That is exactly the point. That is the belief. I had this belief too -  I did not believe these kinds of ideas and opinions. Then I noticed, that they are true... And I dont have depression anymore. This is a self-fulfiling logical concept. If you dont believe me so much to the point of being offended by this notion, you logically have to stay depressed. If you are not offended by this notion, there is a chance you can start to believe me. If you believe me, you will not be depressed.</p>	0.637

“Academics and politicians”  Right, because what the peasants think doesn’t matter. It’s not like we elect politicians or anything. The definition of words doesn’t change because of who’s in power. That’s some “alternate facts” bullshit.   Racism is something in your heart. It’s something you believe. Prejudice just refers to any kind of vague preconceived notion about an out group. Racism refers to a preconceived notion specifically about people based on their race.   OPPRESSION is power + prejudice. Racism just means you believe people are inferior based on race.   And don’t gaslight us, I remember reading this definition for racism in like 2014. Not the 60s.	Keep in mind, under this definition, racism= prejudice+power. (And as mentioned, power in this case means a very particular type of broader social power, not any power, e.g. being an employer)	0.78
To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.	I in no way deny systemic racism, just you're analysis of it. Systemic racism is the product of a class based society where inequality is baked into the social structure.	0.725

I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements.

>Programmers do, those go more into machine code or very low level programming languages.  The meaning of the bytes is determined by the program. There may be some assembly language that map those bytes to a specific CPU instruction, but that's true of any integer, there's no reason to avoid those code points for that reason.  So you can load a number into the CPU as an instruction, but you can also load it as data, and computers are good at not getting mixed up as they work.	<p>It&#39;s the same difference between data and information.

Yes, I absolutely agree that black people, on average, are less intelligent than white people.  The question is WHY. Do you hold to the belief that primarily because of genetics or environment? You seem to imply genetics in your post but you never say, I'll assume that I'm correct and go ahead and ask the question.  How can you design an IQ test that tests for genetic intelligence capabilities?	Cultural biases such as these are considered one of the major reasons why black individuals tend to score on average approximately 15 IQ points lower than white individuals, and *not* due to some genetic difference. While having a high IQ *can* be an indicator of intelligence, it is by no means *the* indicator of intelligence. Similarly, having a low IQ doesn't mean that you aren't intelligence either."	0.773

You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	Capitalism doesn't promise *wealth* for everyone in the same way you think of it. Consider that a king 300 years ago would have a lower standard of living than the average middle class American today, because the fruits of capitalism - the innovations that have expanded the ""pie"" so to speak - have improved the lives of everyone, making them comparatively rich. Consider that the electric refrigerator was invented in the last century. Before that, food tended to go bad *fast*. Less than 100 years ago over half of all households in the US lacked a flushable toilet.	0.617

If you eliminate rental properties, then demand for decent property to own would go WAY up. Then home prices would skyrocket along with the number of trailer parks.  That's how economics works. Landlords make it possible for young people with limited resources to have a safe place to live.  I rented for 16 years before buying a house.	Your understanding of supply and demand is inconsistent. Increased demand for purchasing houses, pushes up the price of homes.

Definitely agree with you on how coopted it has become, but given that “woke” originated in black communities (and i’m white), i’m not really ready to tell black people to stop using language they created because dumbass right-wingers have taken over their language	<p>I’d say that the really “woke” people though would say that the term “third world” is racist. You’re describing generic liberals or progressives or whatever. They can hold “woke” opinions but I feel like people are getting to calling everything they believe “woke” which was not the way I understood that word to mean, which was a very obnoxious, hypercritical, performative kind of left wing politics obsessed with intersectionality and language policing.

No. That's still being a selfish piece of shit. These aren't imaginary people. Those are real people that assholes like you are killing. And believe it or not, plenty of folks can give a shit about strangers. That's just you and people like that only care about people you know. That's kind of a staple for conservatives and libertarians. You don't give a fuck unless it's at your door.	Several times now, I've encountered strangers on the internet making flip passing jokey comments about killing themselves – which seems to be exactly the thing and the sort of people you are dismissing – and reached out to them privately, only to discover they were, actually, acutely suicidal and not under any sort of psychiatric care whatsoever, and, yeah, actually did need someone to rescue them.  Sometimes I've done this, and found out, they did have mental health care, and it was being dealt with – but they were grateful to find out someone noticed and was looking out for them.	0.538
That's not the same thing, is it? Of course you care MORE about the people you love. That doesn't mean you have to a selfish douche and not give a fuck about anyone else at all. That doesn't mean you don't care if strangers die or fall ill just so you can party.   If you hit the bars, ate inside restaurants, or went to parties during the pandemic you're a fucking asshole that helped contribute to hundreds of thousands of deaths, if only by setting a shitty example for other morons. Plenty directly killed their family members and friends because they were selfish idiots. Looking at this from a political perspective makes you a fucking moron.	Ultimately I guess it boils down to how much empathy you want to have for other people. Perhaps you're looking at this the wrong way. Maybe you're interpreting these critical comments as a personal attack, when you should be looking at them as a request to be more mindful of other people in the future. Just because you, personally, don't care doesn't mean your words and actions don't have an impact on others or that you don't need to be mindful of that impact.	0.567

Yeah, no, you're wrong, but by all means keep defending pedophiles. I'm sure you'll find yourself on the right side of history.  It is actually difficult to find the EXACT studies you're looking for.

So where's your actual arguments? Where's your actual evidence to support your claims? Where are people holding up rapists as glorious victors? You haven't been able to present a single defense of your stance that isn't based solely in logical fallacies and bad faith debating tactics.

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids. I'm ready to bet, you not gonna help him, you not gonna network with him, you will tell him to fuck off.  One of my best friends turned out to be a pedophile just a couple years ago. I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	<p>You&#39;re starting from &quot;rape fantasies are bad and cause rape and other negative results (and by extension porn is bad and causes X bad things to happen),&quot; and you&#39;re trying to shoehorn anything you can anywhere you can in order to justify that claim being true. Your links don&#39;t prove it, they don&#39;t prove porn causes anything, and they don&#39;t prove fantasies cause anything. Those are positive claims that need to be specifically studied and controlled for, not hypothesized and pseudo-justified due to a blatant preconceived bias.</p>	0.619

A pedophile is someone who has a sexual attraction to children.  You don't look up pictures of pretend children if you aren't sexually attracted to children. You are welcome to delude yourself into believing otherwise, but that is incorrect. So, sorry that calling a spade a spade and pointing out how abhorrent your position is upset you.	It seems clear to me that when people say pedophile they mean an adult attracted to a minor. Bringing up that the description could be used to describe someone that no one is talking about isn't an objection to the argument. It's just a distraction from OP's point.	0.782

Learn how to read retard.	<p>I assert that being a pedophile means you have an &quot;urge&quot; and having an &quot;urge&quot; automatically means there&#39;s a risk. Now, defining &quot;high&quot; is complicated. Personally I think human sex drive is pretty strong so in my opinion it&#39;s &quot;high&quot; enough to be concerned. Just be happy that we&#39;re not in the world of <em>&quot;Minority Report&quot;</em> and we do wait for people to actually commit the crime before giving out punishment.</p>	0.624

Given you either can't be honest or read correctly I'll say again that homelessness is not why I'm against renting.

Anecdote time!  I worked at Fuddruckers for like 6 or 7 years. For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.  I understand VERY WELL that parents need a break, but not at the expense of random people I don't know.	But definitions aside, it can be tricky to judge from afar: maybe the parent knows the kid doesn't get along with the other kids who were playing, and wants to protect them from something specific; maybe the kid has diabetes; There are so many scenarios where their actions seem cruel or unnecessary to an outsider, but make sense with more context. Of course it's also entirely possible they're being overly strict, but it's good to keep an open mind."	0.559
When my children were younger, it only took ONE follow through. They were told that if they didn't behave respectfully in the restaurant, we were going home. The older one decided to test this. I immediately took him out to the car, where we waited until my wife and our younger child were finished. Our food was ordered to go.   You can bet, the next time we went to a restaurant, the kids behaved themselves!	Maybe. But at that point, this is a strawman. I've been in lots of restaurants around lots of kids over many years, including several working at restaurants, and I have never once observed something like that happen.	0.547
You whine more than a kid at a restaurant.   You don’t own the world, you’re not owed a child-free restaurant any more than parents are owed a night out with their family.

You’re evidently child-free, so why don’t you go enjoy your water in a place that doesn’t allow children?	I addressed this argument.

I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.

This is exhausting! You are asking a first year college philosophy question. And it's an ancient apologetics arguement. By (supposedly) clever wordplay, setting up  logically opposite parameters, you attempt to make your strawman God-concept impossible.  It's the equivilent of asking if God can make a rock so heavy that He can't lift it.   The scenario is so sophmoric and naive, it's the type of a question that needs more than an answer. Please come back after you pass your third year philosophy classes.	To use the old saying : Can God create a boulder stone so heavy, even he can not lift it?	0.74
I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	In conclusion, I guess the way I would put it is, ultimately we have free will. But if we choose to make certain choices in life which results in another, coupled with the fact that God does not strike us down for it and further allows it us to make these decisions, one could say God wills for the same. Because we know that God can do anything including striking us down right before, say, me killing somebody. But God technically does not will for me to kill someone rather he allows me to make my own free choice to exercise my will. Does God will for someone to die by my hands? Some may think so, but I would say the distinction is obvious enough."	0.69

What in the race realism is this shit??	So it really seems to me like there's no such thing as ""*actual""* race, because race is a concept that changes from time to time, moment to moment, and place to place."	0.601
To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	This doesn't negate the idea that there could be an all loving God, it simply means there is a God watching, but not intervening. It could be argued that a finite amount of suffering on earth in order to 'grow' on some sort of infinite, cosmic scale, isn't as morally objectionable as it sounds because if we go on to live in some other plane of existence where everything's blissful, then suffering and death in life doesn't really matter beyond what matters here on earth."	0.646

Yes actually humans can and do cause earthquakes and even cancer. In fact cancer is so prevalent nowadays largely due to human chemicals.   As for natural disasters they are supposed to happen. Life isn’t supposed to be without suffering. Raise a kid without discipline and see what u get.   As for predators you can’t blame god because animals eat that’s just retarded.	Natural disasters have always been a part of the human experience.  The fact that there will be more of them as climate change continues doesn't negate the ability of humans to adapt and continue living happy lives."	0.658
Logically you are correct  if it's offensive to do it to one culture its offensive to do it to all cultures. But the die hard sjws only care about nonwhite cultures being appropriated. Because cultural appropriation is racist and you can't be racist against white people because they have all the power. At least that's how my former liberal friends screamsplained it at me when I made tacos for my superbowl party.	<p>And even then, these SJWs usually don’t listen when people from the actual culture they are getting offended for tells them that it’s not offensive, since of course they all know better. </p>	0.698
I’m not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it “the problem of evil”, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can’t exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions. It’s an interesting debate!	Maybe you can't believe in an omnipotent god, but maybe god isn't omnipotent and is only being described as omnipotent because the people who believe the stories of god use that word to describe him. Have we seen him try to make a stone he can't lift? Why does he have to be omnipotent according to our flawed language system that would make that paradoxical on purpose just to prove he doesn't exist? This entire argument that you need human words to describe superhuman entities and concepts in order for it to exist and make sense in your brain doesn't hold much water. Things can exist regardless of our words for them.	0.655

Empathy is whats ruined this country. And ya Google which we all have access to can tell you.

Government issued ID is an ease of access program, so that everyone can get it as long as they fit the requirements for very little money it's not a Lamborghini stop with the crap. Who can't afford to spend 20 dollars on an ID. And fuck off I grew up poor and am barely above that now. We all get things are hard and places are far but you can walk and get rides from people it's not that hard.

Anarcho capitalism is a fundamentally unworkable system. It would at best lead to fuedalism and at worst lead to some sort of plutocratic anarchy hellscape. We've seen the US's original government being scrapped in favor of the current one because it's failure to raise unified forces and others protections offered by tax revenue of the government. The US got libertarianism instead until the 1920s, which is a life version of Anarcho capitalism which failed because even the lite version, libertarianism, is unsustainable due to the fact that people are selfish. However, radical idealists will suspend belief and willfully overlook the fallacies to claim that anything short of mixture of ideas is truly workable.	<p>What &#39;system&#39;? There is no &#39;system&#39; involved, that&#39;s the point of anarchy. Anarcho-Capitalism is based upon the idea that you can remove the government and still have free individuals providing goods and services to one another for mutual gain. Because capitalism is defined as &quot;a system where goods and services are produced and distributed primarily by public actors rather than the state,&quot; then any anarchic society with any form of functional economy is capitalist by definition. The alternative is a controlled economy, and a controlled economy requires a central authority to control it - that authority is called a &#39;government&#39;, which means you aren&#39;t anarchists anymore.</p>	0.762

Public education is free? K-12?  Unless I read this wrong, most working citizens don't have a degree. Are you asking the poorest to pay for an education they don't or cant get?  https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/educational-attainment.html	Why should the public pay for people who chose a degree in an area that is evidently unviable for the cost of their education.	0.668
It's too difficult to tell the difference between insanity and stupidity.  Let them die in prison	The insanity defence also relies on this 'no punishment without culpability' principle of criminal law. It requires that the defendant had no insight into his own actions and the illegality of those actions. Punishing a person who really couldn't have chosen to do otherwise    is immoral, and won't prevent that person from doing the same thing again. You therefore have to put them into some type of psychiatric facility where they can get treated without getting the chance to harm others or themselves, instead of punishing them.	0.644

The DSM-V disagrees with you. Which is to say facts disagree with you. Sorry that you are more interesting in continuing to be engage with your bigotry than the clinical consensus.	Similarly, it's perfectly possible for a bunch of doctors to write a definition of autism or anxiety or gender dysphoria in the DSM-V and get that wrong. Indeed they admit they have: the reason it's the DSM-V is because there have been five versions of it, which have been updated every so often as the field of psychology evolves.

And is still a fugitive from Justice to this day.   So, I hope you don’t watch his movies, OP.	Yeah, and look what's it resulted in.

That Bills/KC game was amazing. Two evenly matched teams giving their all with spectacular plays on both sides. The winner came down to a coin flip. They should be able to answer the TD with the next kickoff in OT, and back and forth til one doesn’t make it. I could have watched that for hours. The NFL needs to reconsider their rules at least during playoffs that was bullshit	I think it’s rather fair to count the extra yards, because the quarterback made the decision to target that particular receiver at that time.	0.431

No I will not change your view. You are correct. One of the highest revenue generating sports in the world and the premiere league still has no legitimate OT system. It's embarrassing	<p>Sticking with football, on your point that the changes make things more boring, I’d argue that in that case it’s a function of people being more informed consumers. 20 years ago, ESPN would run segments of players getting wrecked by huge blindside hits with Tom Jackson yelling “JACKED UP!” over them. People don’t want to see that anymore because they know more about the effects of those hits. It’s a case where society has weighed the pros and cons and made a change that’s probably for the better. It’s not that way across the board, but I think “as long as it doesn’t affect the viewer experience” is skewing way too far in the laissez-faire direction.</p>	0.544

I 100% agree with you. Both teams should have 1 shot at scoring and each have OT time to play their defense/offense.

If you want to sit there and compare male genital mutilation to vaccines, you may as well be defending clitoral hood removal (female equivalent of foreskin). We see you as barbarians for performing this evil, but I prefer to educate rather than insult, and I always try my best to do that. If however, you want to insistent on entrenching yourself into your position and carry on defending this evil because you don't want to consider the possibility that a part of you was damaged before you could consent, or that you damaged your own sons, it's going to go about as well for you as everyone else who's done that, so you might want to get a preview by checking my post history regarding this issue."	0.749

That&#39;s way too long and filled with way too much bullshit stuff I don&#39;t want to see for my taste. Granted if you live in the U.S. you kind of meed to get used to it, but honestly just the perspective that it&#39;s going to last more than 3 hours and basically only half of that is the actual game really kills any interest I might have.</p>	0.65

I agree, I hate I was cut at birth. Guys should be allowed to choose for themselves rather than having it forced on them.	Finally, I think trying to find out whether cut or intact is better is impossible to do ethically. If somebody is cut at birth, they won't know what's better or worse. If somebody is cut later in life, they either had issues or didn't like being intact. So they are likely to be satisfied no matter what. The only way to do it is randomly cut off foreskins of adults and take a survey. This is unethical, because an unnecessary surgery is performed ""just to see"" if it's better or worse.	0.638

> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand. And you set standards which we have no interest or benefit in following then condemn us for not following them. Eat shit dude.	<p>Mostly, &quot;adult female&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; overlap, so there&#39;s no much that pushes people to work out precise notions for those words that lets us make a sharp distinction.  The people who say stuff like &quot;trans women are women&quot; seem to be more interested in a social agenda than in &quot;what does &lt;&lt;woman&gt;&gt; mean&quot; kind of stuff.  Considering that people will continue to identify as women regardless of what everyone else thinks, it does make a lot of pragmatic sense this kind of issue in terms of &quot;how should we treat male people who identify as women?&quot;  In many ways, that&#39;s really the question that we need to answer.</p>	0.703

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	<p>I hate the switch controllers. The Playstation 2 dual shock controller is the greatest controller ever made. It fits nicely in my hand and all the buttons are in convenient locations. There&#39;s a reason why USB controllers nowadays typically copy the PS2 controller&#39;s design, and the later generations of Playstation controllers saw minimal change.</p>	0.662

Yes, take a chill pill as fundamental truths are torn down and more children become confused about their sex leading to the children committing suicide.

Attacking me isn’t an argument.  > warps their understanding of sex is trying to fit them in a box based on genitals  Thank you for highlighting how this is a movement solely based on tearing down boxes and labels at the cost of reality. To claim a person with a penis is not biologically male is pretty disingenuous.  Nope, not about votes, it’s about destruction of truth and creating a new generation that is completely confused.	I also think these conversations need to be had, in the way they're ideally conducted in this sub. A lot of people are completely ignorant about this stuff, maybe they're curious and think it's funny, but they genuinely don't get how harmful their views are, due to privilege and lack of exposure. Part of them wants to know, but they've heard mainstream transphobic idiots, perhaps comedians, rant about it, and don't know any different. They genuinely suspect trans people must be delusional, and want to take away their right to free speech. But they're still open to academic info that proves them wrong. Those are the people I suspect are lurking these threads, and when things are explained in a cordial and reasonable way, backed up with evidence, etc, I do believe it will make a difference in changing hearts and minds. Not everyone, but enough. Just in my lifetime I've gone from hearing ""gay"" mostly as an insult or something average straight cis people considered hilariously gross, to public opinion quite quickly shifting to the majority being supportive. I think the internet was part of that, and that now gender identity is having a similar moment. Progress always wins, and I'd like to try to help it along. So, I agree it's not worth it to get upset, but it is worth it to have the discussion. A podcaster I listened to a bit last year often said, ""react politically, not emotionally,"" because reacting emotionally is very ineffective, usually counterproductive. Still, again, people may have difficulty with emotional regulation for many reasons, none of us are unfeeling robots, and the burden shouldn't be on the marginalized group to always be fine with getting a raw deal. I'm also sorry to hear about what you still deal with in public, we're certainly not all the way there yet for anyone in these groups, sigh."	0.585

It is literally an accommodation. I don&#39;t give a flying fuck about if you &quot;agree with gender theory,&quot; gender dysphoria is a psychiatric condition and if you don&#39;t think so  you should take a look at research. I&#39;m not going to explain the ins and outs of transgender research because it&#39;s not my job to explain that to you, take a look at google scholar. The outcome of being misgendered is emotional distress and I&#39;m telling you that right now in no uncertain terms so you don&#39;t have to &quot;tell&quot; if someone is emotionally distressed because you&#39;re misgendering them.

>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.  If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.   Normalization and encouragement of children questioning their sex will increase suicides.  &#x200B;  >if people spent less time telling them they're attention seeking, pervert, liars they wouldn't have so much self loathing  The self-loathing is primarily from their physical body not matching their desires; no one says anything to them, people are too afraid to be shamed, judged, and fired.   Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?  Now suddenly no one is forcing them! Be consistent please.  Also, notice how you started insulting me, that is a sign you are experiencing cognitive dissonance, just change your mind and embrace reality to be at ease.  >Also misgendering is harassment, not murder. Boy people just do not seem to realize that words have meanings around here!  I never said it was murder, the argument is it increases suicides which is used to shame others to comply.

I don't have "pronouns in my bio" and last I checked the cops aren't swatting down my door.  There is a social capital in the real world, and since DEI centers are part of companies and schools, if you act according to what the DEI centers support you get social brownie points.

Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.  The pandemic is over. It’s the politicians and media that want to keep it going for personal gain.	more people have long lasting side effects that harm them in the long run with covid than anyone has been hurt by the vaccines that have rolled out. more people have died with covid than have gotten blood clots (by J and J) or died from the vaccines (i’m pretty sure only 1 or 2 ppl have died from the covid vaccines but feel free to fact check me cause even if it’s more the chances of you dying from covid is much greater)."	0.763

Don't get vaccinated!!!!	> Go get vaccinated	0.832
In my 30s, unvaccinated. I just recovered a few days ago after roughly 3 days of actually feeling sick.   I don't intend to vaccinate, and I'm open to having my mind changed, but I see the same talking points over and over, and I still don't see the value. I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish. Not to mention, having recovered, I now have antibodies to eradicate any exposure I have in the future.	<p>The vaccine is no on/off switch, but it does a pretty good job at reducing risks for you personally (as a vaccinated person), as well as for the population as a whole. If you add to the equation that the risks of death or long covid from getting covid when unvaccinated are (much) higher than dying or having long-term side effects from the covid vaccine, it really is a no-brainer to get vaccinated. And yes, following from that, you could argue that people who refuse to get vaccinated are a danger to society. If they should be demonized for it, that may go too far. But they should realize that this is one example where personal freedom does hurt others way too much.</p>	0.71

mate that's because you're suggesting an idiotic thing in "Muhammad isn't idolised".  are you really trying to suggest me that a Jefferson or Gandhi statue is just attacked because people don't like that statue. or is it because people don't like the person whom the statue represent.  and i wasn't talking about metaphorical statues. i was talking about putting someone at a pedestal, idolising someone and to take you word at its face value, I'll have to go against the word of all four schools of Islam that covers all Muslims.   and no shit different things means different to different people. That still doesn't change the fact that Islam declares Muhammad as an ideal man. you're challenging me on my knowledge of Islam but it seems like you know nothing about it.	Let apply your logic to religion. Someone can spit on the Quran and draw the Prophet Mohammed because that person is not in the religion. Most people  in the religion will probably see it as sacrilegious whereas people that do not practice that religion may think ""So what"". The so what is the respect and empathy to avoid doing that."	0.549
> If you managed to achieve that, you would already be a statistical unicorn.  Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns. You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. [And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html) Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  >Of the people who just call 911 in that scenario, I think a higher percentage of them are going to survive to tell their co-workers the next day then those who get out their gun.  That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  To be clear, I have no issues if someone wants to own a "Smart Gun" but any requirements for their use is asinine as they simply are not reliable.	<p>The only counter I&#39;ll make is that there has been a lot of focus on criminals who go out of their way to illegally obtain guns. Criminals who use illicit means to seek out weapons will always be a factor in any society, no amount of legislation will change that. But people who are generally irresponsible, people who are well-meaning but ignorant, people who have slight antisocial tendencies, or people who are mentally/emotionally unstable...I feel like those are the people who would benefit the most from a required safety course. It wouldn&#39;t stop 100% of avoidable deaths, but it might make the general gun-owning public more responsible on average. Most people in this thread have pointed out that I need to get educated about guns, which I wouldn&#39;t disagree with. Especially because I&#39;ve already had a gun in my bedroom for the last 9 years. If people are worried about my ignorance about guns in a simple conversation, it seems like it should also concern them that I have an actual gun within arm&#39;s reach and 0 training on how to use it.</p>	0.685

Where did I say that veganism wasn't a choice? The point is that omnivorism is also a choice. And why would I care what specific meal you had? I don't understand why people say these things as if they think it's some sort of personal contest. I genuinely don't understand the thought process, as if you are looking to trigger a reaction instead of arguing in good faith.  >By your logic, suicide, murder, rape, is all a choice whereas in reality    not killing yourself, others, and not raping other people and animals    is the default selection.  Uh, what...? How is that "my logic"  >I hope you enjoy the active choice you are making not to eat the    delicious and nutritious animals we have evolved to eat and enjoy for    their superior nutritional value  Given that the majority of people are now overweight and obese in developed countries nutritional value is not the reasoning behind our food choices most of the time lol	Being vegetarian or vegan and it being ""the moral choice"" isn't as straightforward as ""well it isn't killing an animal"" - because the alternative could have a different negative impact. You then need to enter a moral maze of working out which is the lesser of the two evils, and at that point you need to start boiling down what your moral compass actually points to to make those choices."	0.717

> Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns.  This is just whataboutism being used as a red herring. Nobody is talking about mass shootings here. Mass shootings have nothing to do with this discussion. Literally nothing.  >You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.  So let's be real on a few things here. First of all 2.5 million is bonkers-insane-nuts completely unsupported by facts. There are stats put out by individual cities, and from those stats, we know that the real number can't be anywhere close to that high.  But, as a fun fact, the reason why the CDC doesn't have more accurate numbers, is because it's legally forbidden from sponsoring that sort of research, As our Republican institutions and entities that receive public funding. The NRA lobbied hard for a law making it illegal for us to find out how often self-defense happens relative to other gun actions..  I think that speaks pretty clearly to what the numbers would show if we could actually do that research.  Second of all, 60,000 per year is nothing. That's 1 in 6,667.  Considering that there are 48 lotteries in this country each doing multiple drawings daily, that's roughly how many people win the lottery per year.  If that happens to you, yes, you are a statistical unicorn. That's not misleading; that's fact.   But let's not stop there, because in fact, even that number is wildly inflated by law enforcement statistics being mixed in.  Yes, one in 6,667 of us may engage in acts of self-defense, but most of the people included in that stat are not people in their own house. They are people whose jobs put them in conflict with people, like law enforcement.  That's a totally different scenario.  But don't take my word for it, do this simple search for yourself: Go to news.google.com, pick a large city with over a million people in it, and just search and that city specifically over the last year, for stories about home invasions and self-defense  How many did you find? 10? 20? That's my point exactly. That sort of scenario is super rare. It happens, but it's not going to happen to you. You aren't that lucky/unlucky.    > Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  The only one of us attempting to mislead, is you, with the red herring at the start..   > That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  It can be both. You know the famous Seattle study showed that there were roughly seven suicide attempts and four accidental shootings for every self-defense shooting in Seattle In 1998.  The conclusion from that is pretty clear, that you are a bigger risk to yourself from your own gun, then people who would do harm to you are at risk from it.  That's just facts.	>""The U.S. gun death rate was 10.6 per 100,000 people in 2016, the most recent year in the study, which uses a somewhat different methodology from the CDC.	0.757
Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here? Cause a "realist" would clearly see that your engagement in the discussion is 100% ideological motivated.	<p>Really, stop generalizing and judging billions of people based off of something you clearly know nothing about.

No, I'm suggesting that if you're cmv is; *people shouldn't be idolised*, then picking a religion that already not only agrees with that, but has it as a sin, is stupid.

At the end of the day, your neighbor is still your neighbor and you have more in common then you don't. This us vs them mentality is detrimental to society.	When I was in college I used to have a ton of conversations about politics and I spouted ideological idiocy to people who spouted ideological idiocy. We both left that conversation angry with each other. No ones opinions changed. Friendships became strained.

First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	<p>What makes someone a woman is biological, not determined by anything else.</p>	0.641

I dont expect an autist to understand.	But lots of times people take the route of 'we don't understand' to mean 'well, these poor confused/mentally ill/damaged individuals cannot do anything about this problem they have until we fully understand why they have it', which just isn't helpful.

And were they doing that because they only care about party of because the "blue" party is attached to public policy they like or because the "red" party was far inferior to them as leaders and people?  >This mentality is pretty common and most normal humans are well aware of it.  So there is no nuance. These people have no political positions and just vote on party lines because they are party lines? They don't care about healthcare policy, rights, or anything?  All these notions fade away once you have a normal conversation with these people.  >Only a pedant who just wants to argue for the sake of arguing will pretend to not be aware of this just so they can flex their useless debating skills because where else do you expect to show off such a skill?  Who am I showing off to? We're the only ones here. You've already admitted this view doesn't account for nuance. You're just arguing with yourself at this point.	<p>Am I making sense or are you here just to disagree with me? I want someone to actually try to change my view here.

So are you here to change my view or just disagree because you don’t like that I have generalized? Again disagreeing about a fact, the person who thinks a fact isn’t true is an idiot. If you want to talk about something that has less defined correct answers please bring them up, because as I explained in my post, in many cases where a factually correct answer isn’t necessarily obvious or something that is morally grey for example, typically to side with Republicans on issues like that, when they explain their reasoning for thinking, their reasoning becomes flawed, or is too narrow of a scope considering what government actually affects in practice and that’s what ends up making them wrong.</p>	0.614

You're clearly not a good Psych grad, because anyone who was would know that DID has nothing to do with transgender people. And if you actually were a psych grad, you'd also know what gender dysphoria is - something completely separate from DID. And you'd know that the validity of gender dysphoria is only disputed by transphobes, but it's a very real condition.   The fact that you even tried to bring in DID shows that you're here in bad faith.	That’s because... everyone experiences gender differently. You experience gender one way, and your cis neighbor experiences it differently. You don’t *need* dysphoria to be trans. Transgender means that you don’t identify with your assigned gender. Knowing for a fact that you aren’t a certain gender has nothing to do with dysphoria.	0.668

It should be up to the living to figure out how best to use this resource.	<p>Governments never handbag authority that has been even temporarily even to them by the people of the countries. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan government authority is the closest thing to eternal life we have on this planet, if the government mandates that sound good it’s a vaccine, they can mandate you to do anything they want to do with your body. Either governments believe in “my body my choice“ or they don’t. When they stop believing that you have an individual right to choose what goes into your bloodstream and what doesn’t, then individual rights do not exist anymore. This is not a slippery slope fallacy, and governments do this sort of thing all the time.</p>	0.585
That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever’s in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.	In recent years, a lot of popular ideas have made us forget that. There's a lot of use of named fallacies as the road best road to logical thinking. But something being fallacious just means it's not NECESSARILY true. So people love to throw out ""Argument from Authority!"" to terminate a line of thought. But when we're talking about the kind of science we might argue about, very few of the big picture conclusions are NECESSARILY true, especially in the ways laypeople can discuss them. When we're talking about what's LIKELY to be true from our limited knowledge, recognizing expertise is important.	0.644
I said prescription drugs after you edited your comment to narrow down to a specific decade. All of those things have been used to treat hysteria, factually.

Spoiler alert: he doesn't have a solution for a damn thing and has no intention of finding one. They say it's a mental health problem and then immediately start shrieking SOCIALISM NEW WORLD ORDER GEORGE SOROS WARGLE BARGLE the second people suggest reforming healthcare to be more in line with the rest of the first world nations that don't have the systemic mass shooting problems the US does, on top of all the other benefits like reduced cost per capita and greater satisfaction.	It seems pretty obvious to most observers that American healthcare is under-performing, no matter how you slice it.  And there is one very clear area of dysfunction, one big section of fat that we can cut.  That's the profit margins and obfuscation added to the system by for-profit providers.  I'm not saying the government has to step in and do it.  I can think of two or three completely different ways to revamp the existing model that don't involve business interests or governments.  But I think that, looking at the situation we're in today, by far the most straightforward way to get improvements for sick people in America is state action.

I don’t see a single attempt to change your mind that isn’t clearly a case of “no, I got fucked over, other people should, too” or “this world is tough and cruel [the one they didn’t choose to be born into], they gotta learn that.”  OP, I agree with you. No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents’ fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.  FTR, I have a 21 and 18 year old, so please don’t try to claim I don’t have experience.	<p>You’re right. Some parents are shitty. Real shitty. Some of us are doing the best we can.

Your instincts serve you well. VAERS already has more than 22,000 death reports from the vaccines, which is needless to say far, far more deaths than every single other vaccine combined. Most vaccines are pulled from the market after just a few dozen deaths. This is absolutely unprecedented to recommend a vaccine to young people, at zero risk for serious symptoms from the virus (not a single kid who didn’t have leukemia died with coronavirus let alone of it), that is potentially fatal. Not just that, everyone by this point knows someone or many people who’ve had bad side effects. My wife’s very pro vaccine friend has had vertigo and other alarming side effects for months after her booster, another family friend went to the ER for heart issues two days after the second shot, and my 37-year-old former classmate from both high school and college died within 48 hours of her second shot. She didn’t want the vaccine but had to get it if she wanted to be involved with her kids at school; she left behind two young children.   That aside, who are you trusting exactly? Big Pharma? Dr. Fauci? All people who get a nice payday when everyone is vaccinated, even though there’s zero medical reason that anyone under 55 should need a vaccine against the sniffles. It’s all scare tactics, the emperor has no clothes. They throw this huge number at you - oh but 860,000 people have died from it!! No they haven’t. Who said that?! 860,000 people perhaps had it at the time of death? Sure, but they didn’t die from it. In fact the average person had 3-4 other underlying issues and that’s right from the CDC. About 3 million people die per year, so yes, a certain number of those people will happen to have Covid because it’s widespread. If you look at who actually just flat out died of Covid, it’s 5% of that figure. 5!! That’s as many people as die of the seasonal flu.   When people say trust the science, you know, I do. I have since the very start actually. The science says you don’t need a vaccine if something isn’t a threat to you. It says right now the vaccines don’t stop infection, don’t prevent the spread, and stop illness but may prevent more serious side effects (if the vaccine doesn’t kill your, of course). The guy who invented mRNA vaccines, incidentally, Dr. Robert Malone, is a die hard anti-vaccine mandate advocate and said that under no circumstances should mRNA vaccines be injected into people. That’s right from the guy who invented the technology. But why trust him, right?! I’m sure he didn’t risk his reputation to speak out for any particular reason.	<p>We have a universally available vaccine which is also universally recommended by healthcare providers. If you don’t trust the recommendations of healthcare professionals when it comes to the vaccine, I don’t see how it is fair to them or to others needing care to suddenly decide that your health is their responsibility. Not only is it hypocritical, you could make the argument that if somebody didn’t trust the advice of professionals before they were under duress, we should honor their wishes to not be put under the observation of the very professionals they don’t trust.

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	The increasing ""civilization"" in developed nations also coincides with a decrease in devout religious faith.	0.605
Many would say that political ideologies such as Capitalism or Communism or Humanism are just as much “religions” as Christianity or Judaism or Islam.   If we define religion as a belief system derived from outside of what science can provide us, which many do, then we aren’t experiencing a transition *away* from religion. We’re experiencing a transition to *different* religions.	I think the fact that almost no societies have really lacked religion should give you some pause. A new religion, or something very akin to religion, is almost certain to manifest even in places that claim to be nonreligious. The impulse for social belief in a cosmic order seems to be built into humans. The problem is that whatever new religion develops won't be system that has gone through thousands of years of memetic selection to produce a stable and functional system of morality."	0.624
I completely agree. Parenting isn't a job you graduate from when the kid is 18. Different boundaries or dynamics may have to be placed as the person ages but parents should always be a source of support. In essence it's about building a community together. I want my kids to not fear where they'll get money for food or rent or tuition. I want them to know they can always come home. I want them to have a stress free young adulthood for as long as physically possible so they get to explore and experience themselves as much as they can at the start of their adult lives. It makes for happier, healthier, well rounded and well adjusted adults. Adults who care about other people. The idea that at 18 you're suddenly expected to have everything sorted and survive on your own is a garbage, modern day farce demanded most prominently by capitalism and is not actually how rearing young humans should work. Many people, not because they're lazy or unmotivated, simply aren't ready to launch right at 18. That's normal. That should be ok. They should have a support system.	Why should parents stop being responsible for their kid’s lives when they turn 18? The parents still chose to have a kid, presumably assuming that there is a high probability that their kid would survive past the age of 18."	0.712
CNN, is that you? Because not a single thing I wrote is anything but a verifiable fact. The drug companies and global elites LOVE it that you’ll do their dirty work for them! It’s amazing. Not a single part of the entire Covid narrative has been true, not one, from the very start. And unless you’ve been in a coma you’ve probably realized that my side has been correct about everything, not wrong once. 1) It wasn’t a wet market, it was a lab leak. That’s now widely understood. 2) Cloth masks don’t work, they never did. The reason we were sure of that is because we can read, unlike your side. I read all of the dozens of peer reviewed research studies published from 1981 through 2020 and they studied surgical and N95 masks and still *not a single one* found any benefit against airborne respiratory viruses. That’s because even N95 masks have 0.30 micron holes and viruses are 0.13 microns. It takes just 100 virus particles for infection and millions are propelled into the air with coughs and sneezes. Even blocking 99% of them does you no good. The data confirms this - mask mandates states didn’t have any better infection rates than ones that never had a mask mandates. Masks aren’t for viruses, they’re for bacteria. 3) We said they’d mandate vaccines and create vaccine passports. They did. 4) We said there would be booster after booster. That’s exactly what happened. We called that before the first vaccine was even on the market. 5) We said antibody dependent enhancement was a risk. Studies from Israel show that’s very possible. Even the NYT acknowledged that - more boosters could lower your natural immune function, not raise it.  You might want to start taking notes and realizing we have done A LOT more research than you have. And we have the experts to back up our views, you know, since we do actually trust the science!

The 40+ hour week dates from a time when the majority of workers lived in families with 1 breadwinner and 1 home naker. That one person earned enough to feed, clothe and house their family. This only lasted a comparatively short period. Pay didn't keep up with inflation / cost of living. Women joining the workforce, automation, robots, computers/outsourcing to cheaper countries all reduced the amount of jobs, and that brought down pay (just to be clear, I don't blame women! I blame bosses / capitalism/globalisation).  I agree with OP that for the majority of people, a 40 hour week doesn't leave much time to live and grow and learn and enjoy.	The decline in hours to the current 40 (and let's be real, I don't know anyone who actually only works 40 hours) is from early industrial high levels. It's only through capitalism that it spiked so high. And it's only through union protests against the excesses of capitalism and government checks on capitalism that we got down to lower hours."	0.732

Do you follow the Kardashians on social media? You might think celebrity gossip is reductive and garbage and the people that are interested in it are basically stupid and wasting their lives... and you'd be right... but it has a strong relationship with religion and perhaps your opinion.  Whether the Torah was dictated to Moses by God in the wilderness or not, it's laws are a set of social guidelines that helped form a distinct community. It helped bring reform, order and bring social cohesion to people. People need social guidelines to conform to for a sense of equality in their tribes.  Over the decades there are many ways for those social guidelines to manifest.  * The Church until the last century * Actual Laws * Gossip, and people who Gossip. "Oh look Maggy at 42 is pregnant again. At her age.... " * Newspapers, Soaps during the 80s - 2000 * Facebook Memes, Twitter accounts, Trashy celebs are how morals are propogated and pushed on to each other these days.  Facebooks Memes aren't always supposed to be funny, they are sometimes supposed to push a political view on you. You Uncle with the weird posts is essentially just from a different social tribe as you - even though you are related! These social expectations and rules, this public lambasting of certain people are a replacement for the bible. That we all understand and conform to certain social rules.  With Politcs in America becoming ever more divisive (since and thanks to Trump) and escalating into hard left and right stances it's easy to identify how this is causing people to choose one of two tribes in the US. How it matters more than Facebook Memes, TV dramas and actual laws. So yeah politics is replacing religion in America somewhat but it's a meandering journey about social identity and more than that - trying to force people to live according to your core beliefs.	<p>So remember the context of the Torah. Some of those laws are for the greater good, and some of them are for ritualistic purpose. They have multiple purposes. They are like the laws of any nation, and Moses made them to be the leader of his nation. That is again different from a morality.</p>	0.544

So in your case you don't live on a very well thought out or diverse farm. You specifically farm livestock and nothing else, it also sounds as though you have no access to pasture or large grasslands, otherwise your opinions are just opinion, and based on imagination.   There is no future for the meat industry.  You are suggesting that farmers would simply pay to destroy their only assets, destroying their business and choosing bankruptcy in one fell move? Instead of making a significantly more passive income from supplying to the organic fertilizer industry and local arable, fruit and etc farmers which would boom in response to the massive increase in demand.   Forgive me for calling BS, you come off as either a fantasists, delusional, or just intentionally feigning ignorance in an attempt to justify the continuation of what you have always considered the norm.  Yes I'm alright but I'm getting tired of obtuse poorly thought out opinions and having to hear them come out of what I would hope are usually intelligent people, it's extremely wearing.	I do have a serious moral conflict with how livestock is treated, and do my best not to support that industry. I think it would be a lot better if people just cut down on their meat consumption in general and treated it as though it is more scarce. The reason livestock is put through such horrible conditions is because people will eat a 1lb steak for dinner instead of single 4 oz serving.	0.709

Maybe to a lesser degree given the reduced severity, but there should be <em>something.</em> Mostly what I&#39;ve seen - including this thread - is people supporting it for COVID vaccines but brushing off the flu because it kills fewer people. On a personal level I feel like, I dunno, if you&#39;re <em>that</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 600k people, you should be at least a <em>little</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 60k people.</p>	0.67

First, what is the source of that "a few percent gap"?   Second, unless it has been shown that it really *is* due to discrimination, then *we don't know*, if it due to discrimination or for some other factor that we just didn't think of considering.   Third, your last line is extremely childish. You don't need to be any "denier" to realize that if we're talking about a few percentage point differences, at some point the margin of error comes to play and it becomes virtually impossible to attribute the difference to any cause.	And the population difference between men and women is 1.6% with a margin of error of about 1% that’s means little."	0.584
Its because you  want to use the concepts that minimises hurt to people.  But that is completely inappropriate.   A defintions whole point is to be able to meaningfully categorise things.

We understand what you mean , we just disagree .  I've read up and understand how these ideas were formed.  I just think they are bad and make errors.  Im not using concepts I think are ill thought up and conflict with facts.  I think the way gender identity is framed as unfalsifiable makes it lower in the hierarchy of concepts that observable , testable fact.

> Lies? Really? I’m responding to OP in a sub called change your view. Don’t insult me.  Yes. Lies. Stop it.  You are linking to a website that is totally false. It goes against all facts and common sense. It goes against what is on the UN website. Against what the US DoD says. Against what the Security Council says. Against what even wikipedia says.  And on top of it all. it outright lies about what Chapter 8 is and what resolution 1973 is. Here's plenty of evidence for that:   It's literally on the wikipedia page for regional organizations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_organization (click show at the bottom, it's in the list).  The US military considers it a regional organization in its official documents https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA445041 "allows a regional organization, such as NATO"  All of this nonsense about "regional organizations" in Chapter 8 of the UN charter is absurd. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-8 Read the chapter. It's like 10 sentences. "regional organizations" never even appear anywhere in the Chapter!  The confusion really stems from a misunderstanding of how the Security Council works. The Security Council can say they are acting under their Chapter 7 powers, https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7, to secure peace. Or, they could say they are acting under their Chapter 8 powers to delegate peaceful settlement to other organizations. NATO has made it clear that it is not interested in being part of Chapter 8 operations because its ability to respond to escalations would be more limited, if it gets involved, it's going to be through the more powerful Chapter 7.  But that's not an issue. The Security Council almost never uses Chapter 8! And what the original story said is a total lie. Resolution 1973 is a Chapter 7 resolution, not a chapter 8 resolution. https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1973%20(2011) It's right there in black and white, bottom of page 2 "Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nation".  I think someone carelessly overheard a NATO spokesperson give an interview and got super confused. Sometimes, they will say something along the lines of "NATO isn't a Chapter 8 regional organization". That doesn't mean it's not a regional organization, because that term means nothing! It's not defined anywhere in the Charter. They're just saying, if you're going to look for a regional organization to get involved, you need to do it under Chapter 7, not 8, if you want NATO involved.  Now, there have been people arguing for 60 years that NATO should switch to getting involved via Chapter 8 not 7. To have more limited operations. But NATO doesn't want to be chained this way. Anyway, consider this: all of these resolutions could have been vetoed by Russia. If they thought NATO was acting illegally why would they allow this over and over again? It's all pretty absurd.	<p>These larger groups are just a response to other groups that we would like to counter rather than co operate with especially with countries like the US Russia and China. I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll ever get to a point where we have an all encompassing power especially considering how much of a joke the UN is.</p>	0.522

> It is happening, man  Solid rebuttal.  I'd argue you have your head in the sand because you're unable to comprehend a very simple series of events. It's not worth my time continuing a discussion with someone unable to grasp a simple concept.  X number of animals were killed as of today to provide meat in the grocery stores. There is a deer in the woods still alive, if I go decide to kill that deer it's now dead... It wasn't dead this morning, but it is dead now that I shot it. Again, it's really not hard to follow along.   The meat in your grocery store was dead already, the animals in the woods are alive until you decide to go kill one. It really boils down to you being able to wrap your head around this concept. Given this situation, it is immoral to go out and kill another animal when you didn't need to. That's literally all I'm arguing at the end of the day - a hunter doesn't wake up and NEED to kill an animal, but they do anyway.  More death is unacceptable, I don't care if it makes you feel better about yourself. From the animal's perspective, you just killed me even though there's 1000s of pounds of meat in the grocery store down the road.	<p>If an animal will die swiftly at my hand, terrified as its hunted by a wolf, or in the cold from starvation, and its life expectancy isn&#39;t meaningfully different in each scenario, why is it immoral that I kill it, instead of letting it die more slowly? We ought to raise livestock more humanly and eat less meat, but I&#39;m not sure the depleted ecosystems of our world <em>could</em> handle the apex predator suddenly decided it&#39;s an herbivore. Wouldn&#39;t it also be barbaric and evil to release every domesticated farm animal into the shrinking wilds of a world lacking sufficient predators?</p>	0.703

You don't go from voting for Sanders in November 2020 to carousing with people who openly pine for overthrowing the government and keeping anybody who isn't a WASP from voting over the span of 15 months, but you DO you voted for him and moved right if you're a right-winger who wants to spread FUD and other types of misinformation designed and applied specifically to hurt Democratic turnout to the benefit of republicans. Given the absolute shitshow that has been and still is /conservative the fact you've managed to rack up such a high post count with them says a lot more about who you really are than any hollow word you have or will ever put out.	<p>Meanwhile, Sanders ran an embarrassing campaign. He placed inexperienced firebrands and loyalists at the head of his staff who has no idea what they were doing. This can best be seen in the wake of the Nevada primary. Sanders won. It was looking pretty good for him at this point. This was the time to really appeal to the Dem base and keep up the momentum. Instead he just kept railing into &quot;the establishment,&quot; which tends to alienate the people who see themselves being labeled with such a broad, vague term.

I completely agree.  It feels sickening to me that we are born just to have to work 9-5 for the rest of our lives, and live like that.  But at the same time, there's many things you can do. For instance you can save up, or take a loan, then move abroad for some time with that money. And perhaps you find a way to sustain yourself while you are over there, at minimal cost, at minimal effort, or at an effort that you enjoy?   I feel like life has many options, it's just that we haven't discovered them as we are. Rather we settled with our parent's or forefathers way of living, instead of finding new ways.   Im not sure thought, the idea of working 9-5 for the rest of my life seems really awful, when i could just live on an island somewhere tropical for the rest of my life.	3) Similar to above but less concrete - for the moment at least, a significant number of people are just thinking about life differently. Choosing to stay home and earn less as a single income household because of the freedom or flexibility.

I will upfront say that I am skeptical of this conversation going anywhere. Your responses so far have not indicated that you are genuinely interested in attempting to see my view. I will make an attempt though.  I have already explained why this mandate is an overreach. The rationale that was used is something that is not limited to one industry and can used to force almost anything on any industry. It appears analogous to the commerce clause interpretations in regards to its far reaching nature (at least to me).  I am not saying this is the only overreaching regulation. I’m fact it’s has made me start to question multiple other regulations. This was probably the most in your face one though to where it made me stop and think while the others I never really thought about. I am very big on trying to be consistent in my views.  In no way would this be analogous to firefighters. The only way it would be analogous to fire fighters is if I was saying all government services are bad….which is not what I’m saying.	Take some time to research the regulations that have been added to the industry over the past century or so. Look into certificate of need laws, mandatory coverage laws, price structure laws, and so forth. I contend that government regulation is the reason we are in the position we are now, therefore I see no reason to think we can solve the problem with further regulation."	0.582

I totally understand your point of view and I stand by it. Accepting people and not body shaming them is different than idealizing an unhealthy way of living. In fact, in my opinion, being obese or overweight causes a lot more trouble (medically speaking) than weighing less. Yes, EDs are serious, don't get me wrong, but obesity is serious.  Exactly like most things in life... extremes aren't good, always aim for the middle. I'm sorry for the models that have to go through all the pain and tears of feeling not beautiful enough! We're all beautiful in our ways! Love yourselves! And try and give your bodies a little love too by maintaining them inside a weight range that is health wise satisfying :)	While I totally respect your experience, the expression of body positivity that I'm referring to is not via Tess Holiday or the ""HAES"" movement or the ""fat acceptance"" movement or any of that, and honestly, that's never been my experience with the majority of people in the community. What I'm saying is that it's self-righteous and narrow-minded to think that fat people just don't want to get off their ass and do something about it, and it can be harmful to people whose health journey we know nothing about. Are there people who preach that obesity is okay? Sure. But that's not what I'm saying...I'm pointing out that if we're *really* concerned about the health of people whose lives we know nothing about, we do a better service to them to say, ""Hey, it's okay to love yourself even if you're not where you'd like to be"" rather than, ""Stop lying to yourself and lose weight."" And this cultural weirdness about obesity, while certainly based in legitimate health science on one end, is also pretty indicative of societal bullshit that says smaller bodies are admirable and bigger bodies are gross. Although you may have a well-intentioned position towards those people's lifestyle, there are many, many people who use fatness and body-negative rhetoric as a way to belittle and demean people under the guise of ""health."" And *those* people don't actually care about health. They're bullying the fat kid to feel better about themselves.	0.775

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	There is evidence to back up men performing better in many physically based sports than woman however there are not real studies as to WHY. We assume it is increased muscle etc and that is a reasonable assumption however when we close that gap significantly with hormones people still want to argue the other physical differences. My issue with this argument is there is currently no evidence one way or the other and literally every human is physically different in some way."	0.77

I would say this CMV is way too specific. It looks like you are trying to practice a bunch of rebuttals so you can pivot taking points when arguing with your liberal friends.  But I will give it the ole college try: The AR is a versatile rifle, but your view is that it “can” be an “excellent” hunting rifle.  Your criteria seems to be weight, ballistics, accuracy, and accessories.  But then you suggest that not all configurations would be ideal for hunting. Any rifle can be modded for any situation with the advent of rifle stock systems.   So comparatively, to be considered “excellent”, and not simply sufficient, an AR would have to be better than an “average” hunting rifle.  Any top brand .308 rifle off the shelf can be reasonably expected to hit 1” MOA with no additional accessories. They all weigh between 4-7 lbs loaded. And most hunting rifles will include sling hard points, bottom rails for bipod and ring mount rails for the scope. Very similar to an off the shelf AR aside from the AR having side rails in most applications.  Out of the box an average hunting rifle, with the same scope, will outperform an AR. Every time.  The AR was designed to put a few bullets on a man sized target from 150-500 yards. To which is excels at. The hunting rifle, perfected over a hundred years, is designed to take down game with one bullet out to 1000.  Your CMV could read: A .50 cal can make an excellent hunting rifle. For the same reasons.	I'm telling you your statement and wording is flawed from the get-go. It implies that an AR is the BEST all-around for hunting and 'other guns are used more for killing' , but you disregard everything saying it isn't what the issue is.	0.593

They're just mad that the heroes of newer TV shows don't get to be openly racist and misogynistic and still be the good guys. The old racist shit is still up on Netflix or Hulu or whatever streaming service you prefer if they really want to watch it. The newer stuff is just better.	I do not think it inherently makes them racist no. I think it can be that. I didn't watch Get Out because of it's subject matter. I don't find the allegory about slavery and racism interesting. Does that make me a racist? I refused to watch Captain Marvel because of it's leading actress's feminist views, does that make me sexist? I think if someone goes ""uhg black actor gross"" then yeah maybe they're a racist lol, but I doubt there are many people that decide on media they consume that way.	0.608

Reality has a Liberal bias. When people complain about being forced to watch Liberal media, what they mean is that there aren't enough outlets producing fascist propaganda for them to consume.	Meanwhile we have tons of far-right fascist mainstream news sources. Liberal does not equal far left. This really proves my point on how stunted the American political spectrum is, perpetuated in big part by the media and what they're willing to discuss/frame.	0.686
Prop 13 is the reason both my grandmothers got to live in their homes after my grandfathers passed away. If the property taxes had been reassessed, they wouldn’t be able to afford them. What kind of twisted person are you that you want to tax the poor and the elderly out of their homes?	<p>We have a constitutional amendment to tax income.

I'm fairly certain the house I bought last year is taxed based on how much my parents paid for it in 1988, but I could be wrong.	If you inherit a house from your parents, you did not earn that house. Unless you bought it from them. In which case it's not inheritance anymore.	0.607
Are you goofballs using Joe Rogan as a pejorative now?	<p>You seem to be mad that joe rogan is a successful entertainer.

Yea this whole take is fucking ape shit. There's plenty of black UFC fighters who have competed at the highest level. The reason UFC isn't as big as boxing is because boxing has been around longer and there's more money in it.  Just looks like some 'black superiority fetishism' post.	So many people watch boxing with absolutely no idea about the level of ability on show, or how damaging even a relatively modest gap in level of ability can be to a fighter."	0.555
Okay, so now that we're clear on the fact that you're a racist, can we get back to the point where Joe Rogan is not a threat to public health and that censoring him or punishing him, just because he has a huge range, doesn't at all help with the intellectual sediment of the population being easily convinced of things without any scientific proof?

>Yea this whole take is fucking ape shit.   Though it appears you don’t understand it.   >There's plenty of black UFC fighters who have competed at the highest level.   That isn’t the point. Did you read carefully and with comprehension?  >The reason UFC isn't as big as boxing is because boxing has been around longer and there's more money in it.   There’s more money in it because it generates more money. That’s how business works. The conversation is that it will never be as big as boxing not why UFC isn’t as big as boxing.   >They are completely different combat sports, where boxing favors endurance and striking, and UFC favors wrestling techniques & grappling (thus a different body type is favored), generally top heavy guys with thigh strength.   A non-sequitor that can in no way be mistaken as a real response. Besides, strikers are dominant in the UFC. This right here doesn’t make sense for so many reasons but I’m not going to spend time on it since, again, it’s a non-sequitor.   >But that doesn't always mean 'non-black' as you stated Francis is built like a wrestler. In the lighter divisions, Nurmagomedov was utterly dominant for a long time, and is proficient at wrestling, he isn't a good boxer at all. This entire post is just wrong on all levels.  You’re don’t know what you’re talking about.   >Just looks like some 'black superiority fetishism' post, mixed with some standard homophobia.  If you feel like it a black superiority fetishism post and you disagree then address it. To my understand claiming things to be homophobia is against the rules. Your loaded terms and European words avoid actual and intellectual discussion.	<p>I didn’t say paying for a fight entitles you the fighters throwing caution to the wind. They SHOULD want to fight though and not just camp in the ring till the bell sounds and the guy in a coat w the mic comes back though. Professional FIGHTERS are what they paid to see. If they wanted to see guys with their shirts off a male strip club is probably cheaper. It’s ok to feel ripped off AND tell people about it. Like I said before if they don’t….the fights don’t NEED to get better. The Ben Askren fight was a JOKE! Everyone knew it and Paul at least picked a real boxer this time…even if he WAS far far out of his weight class, so he stepped it up from there. You were happy…most (?) weren’t…that’s only positive for his next fight….hopefully he picks someone who is closer to his weight class AND is actually a boxer. I heard maybe MMA for the next fight…that would be fine too as long as he picks an MMA fighter in an MMA fight….and close to the same weight class.</p>	0.572
Bro just stop typing up a storm, you’re trying to larp as some intellectually smart person, when in reality your just a crybaby snowflake who’s offended by a fucking joke.  Do you genuinely think Rogan is a racist? If so, that’s why people call you a snowflake. You haven’t ever actually had any real life world experience. In the real world you haven’t yet experienced, people say racist and offensive things as jokes and they’re not racist.	<p>Again, you have failed to share the full context of the discussion where you alleged you were called a snowflake.</p>	0.572

After reading all your replies I’ve realized You take everything emotionally and that’s why nobody can change your view. Anytime a logical fact comes about you argue it with feelings. Do you really want your view changed or just mad about Rogan because of your ideology?	<p>You seem to be mad that joe rogan is a successful entertainer. He’s not leading people like a cult leader, he’s providing entertainment that isn’t afraid to talk about anything.

There is no difference between the two, (other than the obvious difference in genitals) male or female, you are forcibly removing genital skin, of an otherwise unwilling, non-consenting sentient being.

You definitely caught me not checking your response though, I wish I had, it would have saved lots of redundant and useless dialogue. I should have known; the typical Reddit ‘research’ take is to directly google for data to support your conclusion, then browbeat with it with some superfluous grammar that suggests superior intelligence, then pray that no one reads it.  Or more likely, pray that if they do, they don’t understand it’s implications and limitations that you weren’t able to grasp yourself.	You can't have a meaningful conversation if all your rebuttals are ""Yeah but this unnamed study I won't show you says you're wrong""."	0.616
LOL! I knew someone was going to say that I wasn't being persuasive. I knew someone was going to say that I wasn't treating the right with enough respect and that was getting in the way of my message. You guys are so predictable. It is insanely revealing that accurate descriptions of behavior feel like attacks to you. It's an admission that you ***are*** contemptable and you **are** bereft of redeeming qualities and your only recourse is to blame the person who points out your emperor has no clothes.   People outside of the fact based community bemoaning a lack of nuance is a level of irony that is difficult to locate with existing measurement devices.	<p>Possibly, I guess. I mean, maybe I&#39;m just imposing my standards on them, thinking my standards are universal? Is it gatekeeping to expect similar levels of engagement when debating a topic? I don&#39;t know. Like with you here right now. You responded to specific points I made in a meaningful way. But yeah, clearly I&#39;m biased here because I&#39;m annoyed. Maybe when the smoke clears, I&#39;ll be able to understand the situation better.</p>	0.567
Yeah, you don't want your view changed. It's as set in stone as your ideological framework will allow. You haven't critically looked at anyone's comments, merely just deflected them with vague comments that I'm not sure you agree with.	What will it take to change your view? I'm looking at all of your comments, and I see someone desperately defennding their position."	0.658
With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.  I recommend everyone whose blood is burning with contempt for "the other" read [this magnificent essay, "I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup" by psychiatrist Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/).  We desperately need to pull back from the brink.	<p>However, does that actually work in forming an accepting community? I&#39;d argue it does not, and it seems you&#39;d agree. You can&#39;t simply attempt to redefine the label, because the label itself isn&#39;t actually what is at the heart of the issue. But I&#39;d like to change your mind in the sense that it&#39;s an understandable reaction, <em>especially</em> by those that have a more identitarian ideology (which can often be an understandable place to go for those attacked by such a group association). So from their perspecrive, it&#39;s not as harmful as your perception tells you. Because they desire to be recognized as having this association, and don&#39;t desire a society based more so on individualism.</p>	0.57

This 100 percent, people are so weird about penis size , if you are a obese, obnoxious, just horrible being of a man and you have a monster schlong that’s not going to make a difference.

I know what you're intentions are posting here. You are trying to make it come across like what I've said is confusing when you know fully well you are the one trying to confuse and dilute the conversation. How about answering what your thoughts were on the article about Covid vaccine passport chips being created in Sweden? Like are you really going to try to discredit me by saying key terms you think will help label me as a deranged person, when the topic you bring up is a literal thing being implemented in real life. Are you going to pretend like the world economy isn't on the brink of collapse because of the pieces of shit in global power who failed to respond an international pandemic with a sense of duty, and instead chose to find ways to profit off of it at the sake of millions of deaths? Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?   If the answers to those questions are yes, then I want you to know I truly think you are a pathetic person who brings no value to society, and you should shut your fucking mouth when others are trying to have grown up conversations about crime and corruption.	<p>I also was NOT claiming that the vaccine is a giant experiment. I was only using that to demonstrate that there is a known history of governments, not just the united states government, doing fucked up shit to their populations. That makes the fear that an individual might have about being misled by their government &quot;not political&quot; and &quot;based in reality&quot; whether or not I think its the case.</p>	0.586

The problem with these numbers is they actually don't include graduates who are unemployed upon graduation. They only account for the number of people who are employed. I've looked into this before. So the wage gap is actually much smaller. Also, you forgot to account for university costs and housing costs too.   &#x200B;  The other problem is that your college graduate salary includes people who attended postgraduate education but you didn't account for the extra tuition cost and opportunity cost. Also you need to factor in interest at 6% per year. There's a lot of gross assumptions you made here.	<p>And again, do you have any response to the report I linked showing that even after you account for &quot;college major, occupation, economic sector, hours worked, months unemployed since graduation, GPA, type of undergraduate institution, institution selectivity, age, geographical region, and marital status&quot; there still exists a wage gap?</p>	0.673

The whole point of the term is for Americans, Jews, and Muslims to distinguish the male circumcision/genital mutilation they do from the female circumcision/genital mutilation that Africans do. You're trying to say that they are similar/equal by using the same term to describe both. Your view isn't about the best term to describe things, but a debate about religion and politics. From the perspective of atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, South Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc., it's all genital mutilation. Also, the next layer to this global culture war is trans surgery, which is often described as genital mutilation by conservative Americans, Jews, and Muslims who practice male circumcision/mutilation.  The interesting thing to the debate is that genital circumcision/mutilation is largely an African concept. The countries in the northern parts practice male genital mutilation (which are often described as Muslim and Jewish countries in the US). And countries in southern parts practice female genital mutilation (and they are often Christian/Muslim countries). The US is the exception. Because of the masturbation beliefs of the founder of Kellogg's, circumcision spread around the US.	The term ""genital mutilation"" wasn't used first in regards to female genital mutilation, but as slander against Jews, saying they mutilate their genitals. Christians argued that because Paul of Tarsus wasn't a big fan of gentiles coming under the fold of Judaism. So this hate-on for circumcision has strong historical roots to anti-Semitism.	0.633

First of all, the OP doesn't give ANY examples of ANY of the claims he is making. So not sure how anyone would be able to argue this and get a delta.

If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?	<p>5 minutes of research into Joe Rogan seems to be similar. Couldn&#39;t find any commentary on right wing cancel campaigns. Couldn&#39;t find any attempts to actually talk about the problems behind the current slew of cancel culture. Just telling people that they are wrong. But then again, he seems like an influencer. I generally don&#39;t pay attention to influencers.</p>	0.62

It’s been pretty well accepted at this point in time that this is a problem in the African American community. Here I’ll throw you a bone if a racist system throws black dads in prison it’s going to be hard for them to take care of their kids that being said it’s still an issue for their kids. Another question you do not think their is a disparity in a black kids experience with fathers and a white/Asian etc kids experience? Dude there are hard truths out there I’m sorry if you want to be ignorant to them that’s your choice.	<p>When a high percentage of black children live in single parent homes (usually single mother), lacking a strict father figure, pushing them out to the streets, into gangs, into trouble, skipping school because it&#39;s &quot;cool&quot;, yes they are getting the same &quot;thirteen years of school&quot;, but they are absolutely not getting the same education.  </p>	0.623

There is a large body of evidence that points to broken family units in the African American community. If I provide said evidence would you even accept it? Do me a favor right now at random look up a black celebrity or any kind of influential black person on Wikipedia I would bet money their father was not in the picture. I would argue that children without fathers is a systemic issue in the African American community that is way easier to prove than systemic racism the latter is so hard t define and quantify while the former is simply a matter of correcting the right data in the right way. We live the in the Information Age sir you can only bury the truth so deep before it rises from the grave to reap its vengeance on your lies and bogus ideology that ultimately undermines peoples autonomy and strength. YOU ARE WELCOME SIR FOR ME TELLING YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸	<p>Black Americans specifically have a huge portion of their families being single parent/mother houses. The media encourages this and the government supports these families. The black men get vilified and left with few options. Statistically 2 parent households produce more successful happy people. It has not always been this way. Black Americans used to have much stronger family values. I believe single parent homes has gone from around 20% in the 70s to over 80% now. They by far have the most single parent households. This could also explain the statistical disparities between black Americans and Hispanic Americans even though they are both minorities their family life is greatly different. Black males are the ones with the highest incarceration percentage which brings me back to single parent households. So stop the media villianizing black males as dead beats, encourage strong family units, and decriminalize drugs. Yet the real enemy is the rich that want to make money any way they can. Big pharma, private prisons, and anyone who makes money off this system are going to keep anything from changing the system.</p>	0.638
Your arguments are bad faith. Vaccination mandates are for the public health and safety. They are constitutional, and right now those who are unvaccinated should be forced	> I am NOT for vaccine mandates, it's not a vaccination and could kill people	0.8

Anyone who lies about being rape should be prosecuted.                They should get the same amount of time the person they accused would have gotten.               They should have to register as a sex offender for life.	Now, as a counselor I'm fortunate in that most of the time the situation isn't as serious as sexual assault, and I'm not in the business of reaching a verdict. When the accusation carries legal weight, the situation gets a lot harder. You're definitely right that we shouldn't convict on a whim. But that's not what ""believe the victim"" is about. It's about making it your *starting point* to assume that the victim is not lying."	0.712
The flu shot should be mandatory. You aren’t a skeptic, you’re just a contrarian. Your views are worth less than the electrons used to spout this crap	<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s <em>only</em> or even mostly a political issue. There&#39;s obviously a real pandemic going on. Rather that the vitriol directed at anybody who is unvaccinated was never a thing with respect to the flu, as far as I remember. If it was entirely apolitical I would expect that people would feel a similar way about mandating the flu vaccine. Maybe to a lesser degree given the reduced severity, but there should be <em>something.</em> Mostly what I&#39;ve seen - including this thread - is people supporting it for COVID vaccines but brushing off the flu because it kills fewer people. On a personal level I feel like, I dunno, if you&#39;re <em>that</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 600k people, you should be at least a <em>little</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 60k people.</p>	0.614

It's a reflection of a whole system of problematic messed up things: the history of how rape and assaults are viewed, how women are questioned and viewed by police, how many women have been let down by the legal system, the stigma and shame attached to being assaulted or harassed, and so on.

Duty, Responsibility, Defend, Protect, Serve.  Those are all words that come to mind when I think of what it means to love your country and patriotism.  I also believe a country is more than just a piece of dirt, the country is the people.  To me if you love your country you are suppose to do your part to prevent harm. This means wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!  Here is another thought. Picture an invading military attacking your country. What are the goals of this invading force? Perhaps to harm as many as possible, overwhelm the countries hospitals, and to kill as many as possible. People that help this invading force would be guilty of aiding & abetting, basically reason.  Not getting vaccinated is helping that invading covid force do more harm to the country.  In the US there are now over 900,000 deaths.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed multiple times. Seems to me that the invading force has done quite a bit of harm with the help of those that are anti vax and anti mask!	One possible gripe about the freedom from infection is that it frames freedom alongside a negative term when your goal is to frame what you want them to do as a positive. To make it seem like a social and moral obligation to undertake. Frame wearing as mask and getting a vaccine as the most American thing you can do. The rights of life liberty and pursuit of happiness, and to have those rights defended. By wearing a mask and getting vaccinated you are ensuring everyone yourself included has access to life, they reduce the lethality of a dangerous pandemic and end it sooner. Liberty, by being vaccinated and wearing masks you are more free to intermingle without risking the health and safety of others. And the pursuit of happiness, being able to gather with friends again without there being a risk that a deadly disease sweeps through the community. You can be the most American by loving your neighbor. So framing the action to be taken, the vaccine, as the heroic thing, shapes peoples ideas of what to aspire too.	0.644

That's non sequitur. I'm not talking about music reviews or opinion. I'm talking about white nationalists espousing debunked "race science" to push white supremacist policies. But yes, any media program should vet its guests to make sure they're not absolute cranks who spread racist bullshit.   And yes, I am saying we shouldn't let white supremacists speak in public to spread their message. You seem to be running head first into the [paradox of tolerance.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) One of the ways around it is to simply not tolerate bigotry. Again, I recommend doing the reading here. Why are you so adamant that they be able to share their hate?   Frankly, your second paragraph didn't even make grammatical sense. But yes, as stated above I do want to censor bigots. I do support "science facts" as you put it. I'd love for you to provide an example of "experiential designs" that were rapidly disproven. Do you mean phlebotomy and the other "race science" fields? Because yeah, we threw those out when they were disproven.   And no, not everything had scientific consensus* (you can't spell) but everything we've discussed today does. The only people disagreeing are bigots. You've thoroughly shown us here where you stand on this.	Why might you think that white people shy around conversations on racial policy decisions? If I were to guess, I would say that the toxic culture of accusing people of 'white fragility' plays into this quite well. The central idea of accusing someone of 'white fragility' centers around directly targeting their social and mental insecurities on racial topics. If a white person, for example, wanted to voice a genuine opinion on a racial topic, especially one that questions the fundamental stability of racial legislation, they may be accused of things like 'white fragility' and 'white privilege'. From what I have observed in my lifetime talking with young people, there is no real place for white people who want to voice critical thinking against racial policies and be taken seriously outside of the conservative media. So I guess I would say that white people would have a tendency to shy away from these conversations, but simply because they know that the color of their skin will be a dictating factor in the input they can make. This is a dangerous thing. When we limit the voice of the dominant racial group from voicing opinions on topics that impact everyone, we create separate echo chambers and shut down genuine criticism by targeting the person, and not their beliefs. The whole 'white fragility' accusation culture reminds me a lot of the Ad Hom fallacy, being that it attacks the person's unchangeable attributes as a representation of the legitimacy of their beliefs."	0.606

I work on a project to document all 6 million name's murdered by the Nazis. There are today fewer Jewish people living in the world today still than in 1933 thanks to Nazis.   Any claim that a Nazi is not an extant threat to every Jew is an antisemitic racist assault upon our soul and a flagrant ignorant intentional erasure of our pain from history.   Fuck you.   Kill every nazi.   Damn the consequences	<p>Every Nazi was, and is, okay with killing Jewish people.  Even if they did not do it themselves, because Naziism is literally based upon the idea that certain people are superior based on genetics.  Therefore, even if an individual Nazi does not think that Jewish people should be killed outright, they still support an ideology that calls for their eventual eradication though violence.  Remember that forced sterilization, refusal of identity and culture, abolition of rights, and forcible relocation to ostracize and remove them from common society is still violence.</p>	0.697

My view is if you say yes in any state that is a green light. Condom or no. If you commit a crime while drunk you can’t claim you didn’t know what you were doing in court. “I was drunk so didn’t know the implications of drunk driving”. Why should that be acceptable here. Sober you chose to get drunk in that situation and so knew the risks involved. If you are aware of what is around you and can communicate that that is enough even if you are drunk off your ass. The only case this doesn’t apply is if the person is so far gone they can’t register what is around them. So long as they are awake and able to interact intentionally with their environment that counts as consent in my book.   Take for example if a man and woman are both drunk. Did the man rape the woman? Did the woman rape the man? Did they rape each other? After all if you rape someone while drunk it is still rape. The answer is it is just two drunk horny people. Pass them a rubber and leave the room.	> if you are unsure whether someone is sober enough to consent	0.741

>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	<p>But if those factors aren&#39;t involved, you can willingly drive drunk.

Attacking a group, any group, because they believe differently than you is wrong. Full stop. Saying your violence is justified because you think the right things, are support the right ideas or look the right way doesn't change that you are simply making an excuse to attack people who you think don't deserve to live their life as they see fit. How any of you can sit here and say you absolutely feel justified in attacking someone who has done you no harm is sick and disgusting. You are no better than those you claim are evil; you are literally doing the thing you say they are doing. See h isn't violence. Ideas are not violence. Action is violence, and if you attack someone because of who they are or what they think, it is you, not the one who you deplore, that are to blame.

Probably not, but if I see someone beating the shit out of a nazi I'm not gonna stop them	But unless the Nazis are actually breaking some law (noise violation, physically harassing someone, trespassing, etc.), then what they're doing isn't morally different than what you called having an academic discussion.

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I’m lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it’s very comforting to know I have an option.	2) If euthanasia is legal to some extent, people can still choose not to do it for themselves because of their own beliefs, but if it's completely illegal, people won't be free to make that choice for themself, no matter what they believe.	0.713

So you're okay with Russia hypothetically weaponizing and funding white nationalist groups in the US and encouraging them to violently overthrow the government?

Trump being so self-absorbed and an ego-maniac played right into Putin's hands. Culminated to retarded Trump supporters invading their own capitol, chanting "hang Mike Pence".  What unfolded in 2021 showed the world how fragile the US really is. It was a national embarrassment.

I won't get into semantics about what you view your character as. I personally would think your character is more than just an argument on reddit but if that's what you want to water it down to by all means. For me an ad hominem would be more akin to "you like chocolate ice cream therefore your opinion is invalid". Citing a separate argument you made to question your motives is not ad hominem, but i'll drop it regardless.   I apologize for attacking your unrelated argument/character in another thread.   However I don't think it's that wrong to question whether you're arguing honestly when in another thread you're making the claim humans can't rape animals. Reddit is full of trolls, I don't want to waste my time with one. If you're not one, great, my mistake. Any further replies should be under my other comment as to not get cluttered.

Most of the time kkk and neonazis just like to talk hot air, they rarely act (physically/violently) on their beliefs.

Liberals on the other hand will swear up and down that they are my allies but when I turn around they plunge the dagger in my back.

Ok so you're not even going to try to speak honestly? You're just going to blatantly lie? Ok, nothing more to say then. Pretty pathetic.

My grandma was terminally ill and was of clear mind until the very last days. She spent her last year bedridden and unable to move but completely clear minded. She begged us to let her die and asked the doctors nurses to end it. We had no recourse and seeing her like that destroyed all of us who had to take care of her until her last breath. I think this case was an ideal situation for euthanasia because there is no treatment no remedies for what she has gone through. It was a slow and painful journey for her and all of my family. Doctors were very emphatetic but their hands were tied.	My grandma had Alzjeimers for over 10 years. At then, the only thing keeping her alive werr forced feedings and meds... why?!? If her body wants to die, why not let her family make that choice legally. At that point its not even assisted ""suicide"", its allowing life to takes its natural course. When our family finally got permission to change her care, she dies within a day. Imagine how long she had been eady to go for?!?! She suffered unimaginably... she was once found by my aunt in agony (but has lost her speech by then). Xrays revealed a crush injury in her hips that could only have been caused by falling or being dropped. The doctors said that even she fell, she would not have been able to crawl into bed... so obviously the orderlies just tried to cover it up.	0.696

I've had this conversation recently and I fully agree with you. People here are trying to argue that power is a broad term, but I say it isn't, because you are particularly referring to the power they have to permanently ruin lives on a whim. The power to send someone to prison is something society takes too lightly.   Others argue that you can counter them with money (equally powerful lawyers) just proves the point. The majority of people doesn't have the kind of money you would need to very technically argue your case. The fact that you have to navigate the law with money just shows that even if justice is blind, it is effected by the smell of money.   Judges do not serve justice, they serve their own whims when they decide someone needs to serve a harsh sentence if they're having a bad day. I am deeply disturbed by this fact.  The solution I came up with is to have multiple judges independently decide if a sentence is just. People will argue that it will be expensive and cumbersome. I argue that if you were in a position where you wanted a fair outcome, you would want the best possible practice.  I have zero faith in the justice system as it currently stands.	<p>As for Life in Prison. Many would argue that Life in prison with no possibility of parole is counterintuitive because the basis of Prison exists for rehabilitation, Life without Parole accepts the reality of some individuals cannot be rehabilitated which leaves to the ever growing issue of leaving said criminal as a burden to the state and as a threat to other human beings. Some question of how it is &quot;Justice&quot; to allow a person to still live on this Earth, eating and sleep with money coming out of the Taxes (Many of which paid for by the victims family) for a criminal to be housed when their victims lay dead with often the most disgusting disturbing acts of brutality upon their victims before their deaths, something of which places a Burden onto the Victims family knowing that their loved one is dead but the Purpatrator lives at their emotional and monetary expense.</p>	0.605

Everytime I hear someone going on a rant about “left wing/right wing” all that comes to my mind is architecture and grandiose buildings.   I really wanted to play devils advocate here, but the truth of the matter is you’re exactly right. About right and left being meaningless. It’s just another reason for people to remain divided under the guise of freedom and choice.   Because there is no actual choice. Not in any society. It’s all the same shit with varied marketing and price points to give the illusion of choice.   This applies to consumer goods, infrastructure and our government. And we do it to ourselves.   IMPO of course.	<p>Compare that with the right. Every aspect of right wing ideology is a dehumanisation of someone else. Economically, we have to choose to allow others to starve or be homeless because that&#39;s what&#39;s important to the right. Socially, who&#39;s even human? Gay, trans, black (or any other race than the right kind of white), female, that&#39;s more than like 60% of the population of any given place that just aren&#39;t given their humanity. For that reason, the right counts all the worst elements of society among its members, because it&#39;s a very helpful and convenient way to view the world if you want to do bad things.</p>	0.669
What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.	The vaccine doesn't make you ""immune"", like in a videogame you're immune to a certain kind of damage. Even if you have the vaccine, the virus can still enter your body and live for a while. What the vaccine does is teach your body how to fight the virus, so that it can combat it more quickly and effectively. But the virus can still enter, you just won't feel a lot of symptoms. And that can be dangerous for other people who still don't have the vaccine - you can contaminate them. So for a while longer, even those who are vaccinated still need to practice social distancing, because while they don't get sick, they can make other people sick."	0.714

Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.	Okay. Russia turns their attention to financing and building a working political relationship with Mexican cartels.

It can only be called a vaccine because they changed the definition of vaccine.  You also might want to check the most recent Israel numbers.  In the US there was a 40% increase in mortality for people aged 18-64 in 2021.  Hmmm. Strange.	<p>From the article- &#39;There are 2.1 million vaccinated Israelis over 50, and 290 were in the hospital Aug. 15. That’s 136 per million, a rate that dwarfs anything younger people are experiencing. And unvaccinated older Israelis? There are very few people in that category: just 186,000. But of that group, 171 were hospitalized — a grievously higher rate of 919 per million. In the older population, vaccinated people were less than one-sixth as likely to be hospitalized as the unvaccinated.&#39;</p>	0.713

Have you ever looked into it outside a classroom or Jewish approved documentary? Ya know, a different POV. Watch Europa: The Last Battle if you don’t want to be an ignorant clown.	To be appallingly frank, I think one of the worst things that Israel has done is bore me about the Holocaust. I roll my eyes whenever the subject is mentioned - I am just so tired of hearing about it. And especially tired of pretty much only hearing about the Jewish aspect of it. I don't know if you've ever read it, but Art Spiegelman created a comic-book series called Maus that did far more to interest me in the Holocaust than all those tedious museums. Even powerful stories are diluted by endless repetition.	0.525

>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??	<p>As for vaccination, I’m not sure it’s relevant whether you consider it a good thing. Others don’t, and they’re entitled to make decisions on their own reasoning unless you’re proposing forcing them. And I don’t think you can tell them what is or isn’t rational, because it depends on how they personally weight different concerns: for instance, minimising the likelihood of death from COVID might be less important to them than, say, taking a stance against what they feel is a politically objectionable programme. I don’t know - I can’t really give voice to their concerns because I’m not in their head, but I know many people are implacably opposed to it, and I’m not clear on whether you’re proposing forcing them or simply trying to convince them.</p>	0.668
Not trying to be that guy, but I think your viewpoint is the common viewpoint rather than the devils advocate.   The only thing I would add is I think it’s totally fine if their salary is cut in half and each of them get half the money if they want separate bank accounts.	>The only reason money is consolidated, is because these people are providing everyone else with goods and services others want to pay money for. So I see no inherent issue here.	0.56
That's not how rational discourse works, that's not how debate works, and that's not how CMV works.   If you make an argument in your OP, it is up for debate. When someone comes along and disagrees with that point in your argument that you can no longer counter, you don't get to say "no no no, I just mentioned that, it isn't actually what I want to talk about."  That is a bad faith argument and you are no longer able to be debated against when you refuse to concede even an INCH of ground from your original topic against someone who makes a rational argument against your initial topic.   You brought up the mandate protests. That makes them a topic that is on the table for conversation. Then, when you ran out of arguments about that point, you just said "no no no, I don't wish to discuss mandate protests any more."   If you want to change the conversation that is allowed to be debated in this topic, then that is a VIEW CHANGE. otherwise, you're just making bad faith arguments that any time you hit a wall against you can then just change the topic of conversation again to steer it away from a point you brought into the debate to begin with.	<p>It seems in your experience, that political discussions, were actual discussion, with talking and proper argumentation. But this type of discourse isn&#39;t the type of discourse that the rule seeks to avoid. It seeks to dampen the temper of people who get violent suddenly and send their opponents to the hospital or the morgue rather than on a fact checking quest. </p>	0.631
Let's face it: if you only award salary based on how much work you can do, aptitude, etc. you'd get prorated down to 10 cents an hour, bud.	<p>I myself earn about $30 an hour, but if I could get four people to do my work for $20 an hour and I kept $10, then that would be better for me. Not only would I be earning money without exerting effort (the ultimate utility situation), but I could continue to work and maximize it further. </p>	0.611

Why would you think id find value in a CNN article when the two news orgs on the list I gave you are known for being not bias and are a gold standard for reporting?  Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1	<p>So you honestly think that CNN, MSNBC, NBC, etc. are center or unbiased?

i mean i don't think you really want us to change your view.. you just want to give your opinion traction and an audience.. i'm all in with you.. good job writing this post and good job doing what you are doing. islam is indeed one of the truly oppressive forces to gay rights...   i'd say the most oppressive forces are as follows...   1. death threats from conservatives(this is mostly Islam)   2. Christian conservatives(maybe not as hostile generally but very oppressive   3. laws that don't protect us around the world(many laws of oppression still exist)   .. after that i think it gets a bit more confusing as to where the source is.. but there sure are a lot of assholes out there.	<p>I do think the OP has a point though and that because the left aren&#39;t vocal in their criticism of aspects of Islam it creates problems where they are seen to have double standards. It shouldn&#39;t be that people are scared to criticise Islam because it might be seen as racist, it should be that a greater attempt to draw distinctions between the most extreme and most moderate interpretation of Islam is made. As I touched on previously, I&#39;m not saying the left is the only side guilty of ignoring extremism as you also touch upon how governments in the west are happy to deal with the Saudis and it&#39;s usually the right who ignore their human rights problems</p>	0.6

Good post mate 😁✌🏻 You aren’t Islamaophobic, you are simply stating the reality of life for countless LGBT living in constant fear under the theocracy that helps govern almost all of the countries you listed. You will of course get non stop “whataboutism” from over emotional hacks, but that being said it doesn’t change the facts. Also, the hypocrisy of these defenders is often times astounding as they will decry China’s treatment of the Uyghurs who are placed in “re-education” camps to curb what they view are extremist beliefs which can (and has) lead to terrorism.. all the while supporting or at least defending throwing gays off buildings and/or stoning them. I agree with neither of those for the record since it has to be said in todays cringe world. There are Muslims like Maajid Nawaz who I respect a great deal as he and many others are attempting to reform Islam and its more extreme beliefs and practices. Also, for the idiots who say “[insert other religion here] used to do XYZ” - yes and they have already undergone their reforms in the past to the point they’ve reached today. Ffs even the Catholic Church, which has had some of the strongest anti-LGBT beliefs, their leader Pope Francis has holds more conciliatory views on LGBT as opposed to the past.  Oh and prior to him they weren’t throwing gays off buildings so there’s that as well.	That’s why we have Islamiohobia and Transphobia now."	0.609

It's true. I can't even keep track of the number of times I've said "permanent and life changing" instead of "invasive and medically unnecessary".

You are focusing on something I have already clarified, many times, and are both acting Hostile and accusing me of acting in bad faith.

True, I agree with your opinion, particularly as fundamentalist Islam carries so much weight in the countries you’ve highlighted, in addition to quite a few others, such as Brunei. I remember when the sultan of Brunei proposed a law to stone homosexuals to death when it introduced a new set of regulations that were based on sharia law. However, he backtracked after global boycotts of Bruneian businesses and protests outside of embassies, showing that perhaps political pressure can work in certain circumstances. However, homosexuals are still incredibly oppressed in Brunei, and I have to agree that fundamentalist Islam is the greatest oppressor of the LGBT community.	Countries do all kinds of things. They have caste systems and put people to death for homosexuality.	0.638

Clarification =/= lying my guy. I may have phrased it poorly but that doesn't mean I'm acting in bad faith or gaslighting.

I’m not lying about anything, I’m calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day. When will you take responsibility for what you comment?	>Are you withdrawing my responsibility over others?	0.591

When will you take responsibility for what you comment? > >And why did you pretend to be someone else?  That comment wasn't about transracialism why lie?  Who am I pretending to be know? You gonna bring out your vomiting alt next?	<p>I think you&#39;re mistaking &quot;calling someone out on their bullshit&quot; with &quot;accusing them of being a bad person.&quot; It&#39;s one thing to make an honest mistake like not understanding that as a white person you have the privilege to not think about race issues, or unintentionally speaking over black voices, or virtue signaling. It&#39;s an entirely other thing to be willfully ignorant, make arguments in bad faith, repeatedly speak in coded language, or refuse to acknowledge your mistakes. If you&#39;re unwilling to respond honestly to fair criticism, then you&#39;re the problem.</p>	0.637
>I thought you commented that you’re a man, maybe i was mistaken. I saw in another one of your posts that you said you’re a woman. So I don’t understand  You should get your vision checked.	<p>idk, when I see someone my brain automatically decides if they are a man or a woman, I don&#39;t actively think about it. If someone then tells me &quot;actually no I&#39;m not a man I&#39;m a woman&quot;, I just change the listing in my head I guess.</p>	0.57
So we should address people with the pronouns they identify with apart from you? Got it. Not like you’re trying to push some agenda at all.	<p>You said that we should stop referring to people with pronouns because it reduces people down to their genitals</p>	0.641
>Are you a man? You said you married a woman, so how does she feel about you being bisexual?…   Creepy stalker.	You're going to have to say this woman isn't straight. And I think the rest of us are scratching our heads as to what purpose such a narrow view of straightness has. She ticks every box of what a straight person is (or almost every, I suppose). She does and feels all the things a straight person does. She identifies as straight. She doesn't want to actually be with a woman. She just has this one activity where she enjoys watching, for whatever reason, two women on her computer.	0.554
I don’t care, that’s not your decision to make. Stop infringing on people’s rights and you might just make some friends in France. You’re just as bigoted as all those fundamentalist Christians you rage about.	Saying shit like that doesn&#39;t work here where I live because everyone just knows that barely anyone really is 100% French, I don&#39;t get why people can&#39;t just live together like we do here instead of throwing around fucking racial slurs to make people &quot;guilty&quot; and make them think about their privileges instead of just inviting them to eat and get to know each other, the only way to make people accept each other even tho they come from other backgrounds is not to point fingers at who fucked who&#39;s lineage but to sit down and have a conversation with them on the now and how we can make it better for everyone.</p>	0.575
Actually, I have no desire to change your opinion. You're so far off the reservation that any sort of changing of minds wouldn't be worth the effort. You started by saying that maybe just a little bit "jaded", welp that's the understatement of the century. You're full on a fkn nut job and frankly no one should take you seriously. Your unearned sense of moral superiority not withstanding, perhaps you should get a little therapy.	That's strange, because not once did I say this, nor did I indicate that I felt that way. But your entire argument has been completely incomprehensible and contradictory that it's pretty clear no one's going to change your mind."	0.608
>The entire party consists of incels, Karens, Trumpers, and Nazis, all of whom have no place in the modern world. They are more than just an annoyance to me: they are an active detriment to humanity! A waste of resources.  If this is a troll post, well played! The irony of calling for ideological genocide because of their "harmful" views is \*chef's kiss\* levels of irony. Alas, we live in the era of Poe's Law so I can't tell.	<p>They shudder to even think about genocide. And you&#39;re telling them they&#39;re just as bad as Hitler, insisting upon it.</p>	0.597
I never forget how old I am myself but every once in a while I remember that I'm consuming content on Reddit from teenagers half my age.	In addition the average Reddit users age is much younger than the average age: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1125159/reddit-us-app-users-age/	0.59
honestly, this is borderline racist	Can I stop here or is it not obvious how racist that line is?"	0.649
Yes. Anyone with half a brain can see that things have gotten better in spite of race baiting horseshit like this.	Im really not sure what your obsession with constantly bringing up race is"	0.568
Agreed. Hump it and dump it. Fatherlesness increases your chane of becoming a felon by 46% and lowers your chance of graduating by 39%	<p>also, felons have a hard time getting work.  if you wanna do drugs, fine.  drugs are fun.  but be careful.  if you go to prison, you&#39;re gonna have a hard life, no matter how long you&#39;re in.</p>	0.553
Bullshit. You’re trying to drive a wedge between people with different colored skin. You’re exaggerating what is wrong to keep people from coming together.	But I believe we shouldnt treat people with different skin colors differently solely based on their skin color"	0.63
>No. Look at the blue lines which appear to be far more granular than 1000 years.     You're not looking at the same graph as me if you think you can narrow anything down to 1000 years based on that graph.      You either don't know how to read graphs or you're being disingenuous to push a narrative if you try to make conclusions on 1000 year time frames from that graph. My guess is it's a little bit of both.	<p>I mean, I personally think it&#39;s likely climatological variations in the single digits has let to temperate-zone civilizations cracking under a fairly predictable 750/1500 year cycle about as far back as we can measure, and we&#39;re ginning up the next one hard and early by burning everything in sight.</p>	0.613
So I was right, it's a bit of both.	As for the second bit, once again, that's not what I was arguing.	0.581
That you can’t read the chart? That does seem clear.	This chart compiled by some dude on twitter doesn't show the whole picture.	0.604
