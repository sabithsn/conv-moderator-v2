If this occurred maybe 6 months or a year later then yes this is a large amount. And secondly, the number of deaths did not suddenly jump up just because a new President got inaugurated.

When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself.

And the title is wrong lmao, she was never charged with assaulting police. That’s my point; it’s a sensationalist title. She’s a massive piece of shit who deserves jail time, but she was never charged with assaulting police officers.	<p>If OP really cared about police brutality he&#39;d say it clearly, instead, he has to justify the cop&#39;s actions by saying that the girl &quot;probably deserved it because antifa&quot;.

You're right, it's not political. Why are we putting those struggling with a mental disorder on pedestals while shooting down those that speak the truth?  Enabling those with such disorders instead of correcting them is doing them a disservice. They'll never know reality if everyone continues to cater to their fantasy.	<p>Then give them equal attention. And equal attention to teenage suicides, and equal attention to the suicide of middle class men in their 20s and 30s that suffer crippling mental health issues but are encouraged by gender norms to be tough and masculine and not show weakness. Leftist media to some degree panders to LGBT mental health issues, and now right-wing media is to some degree pandering to mental health issues but only when they&#39;re the result of lockdown. In realty it&#39;s nationwide and transcends any and all socioeconomic boundaries. I guess my point is that the Republican party has, especially over the last 5 years, historically not paid attention to mental health issues, and it comes off to me as kind of gross to suddenly pay attention to a single isolated case as soon as it aligns with the agenda. Other than that I agree with you, and I would love to see mental health policy become a major platform point on all sides.</p>	0.552

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p>Outside of those groups, COVID-19, is not that serious for the individual. It can still be serious for young people, but the numbers don’t suggest that, and the way the virus works does not suggest that. The number of reported cases is likely higher due to asymptomatic cases and people who experienced low symptoms that they probably wouldn’t have considered COVID and never got tested, because it wasn’t serious for them.</p>	0.667

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>It makes no logical sense that conservatives are anti-vax.

Don't be selfish and think that the only rights and freedoms that matter are your own, especially because they are in direct conflict with mine and others.  Are you one of those conservative in name only people who does the "rules for thee but not for me!" bullcrap?  You just stated that loving thy neighbor isn't a conservative tenant?!?!

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	<p>So all said, we&#39;re here with a vaccine that gets less effective the more we wait. We have tons of surplus (for the us. A virus that targets most of the population due to existing risk factors. And to really know if you had covid or not uses an immense amount of resources. And now your company wants you to get he vaccine.</p>	0.724

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	<p>We&#39;re in a pandemic and you&#39;re not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It&#39;s not ideal when anyone—much less a child—has to spend time in the ICU, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.</p>	0.748

Plus the lawyer just said he had performed community service. It sounds like he never offered proof, nor did the judge ask for it. I've seen the lawyers lie many times to get low bail.

So, I see the comedy, but this is an instance where I think pointing out this woman as trans is mean.   She isn't fucking up women's sports.

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	Because COVID is an order of magnitude more contagious than the flu. The reason you get a flu shot every year is because there's multiple strains of the virus. There's currently only a handful of strains of COVID.	0.738

There are a lot of Rinos like you. On Jan 6, my very Republican uncle was watching the news, turned to me and said “there goes trumps chances of ever winning again”.

Exactly my point. Going to the courts is the proper avenue to challenge the election results. Which they did. And the courts sent them home because there was no evidence	When a case goes to court, the court has to allow investigators to go into locations to search for evidence. That's why there are warrants issued in cases. You can't present evidence if you don't have access to the scene of the crime. So while you may be right that there is no evidence presented, there wasn't a chance for someone to actually find said evidence. All data as well as testimony however *does* point to there being evidence available to find and that either or both voter and/or election fraud (which are two different things) occurred.

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn’t between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups. Republicans on the establishment side hated Trump and the populist movement he represented just as much as any establishment liberal.   Because of that, the party affiliation of any judges who looked at cases (when they didn’t dismiss them on standing, as happened in the vast majority of cases) didn’t matter.	<p>Most of the candidates running against him in the primaries and the democrat that ran against him were all of the same faith so that’s not a huge deciding factor</p>	0.529

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election.

Last Thursday I went to the funeral for my best friends father. He died from Covid because he was unvaccinated. He was unvaccinated becuase he listened to people like you.  Many people like myself have suffered greatly and lost loved ones at the hands of Covid. I can tell by your gross comments that you are lucky enough to not have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to Covid. Be better.	I know the mantra is that almost everyone dying of covid today is unvaccinated, but I'm incredibly skeptical of those stats. I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even *had* covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don't know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don't know, but I'd assume she was unvaccinated. So that's 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50.	0.668

The did.  Supreme court didn't want to get involved.  Before inauguration said there has been no injured party so we can't expedite.  After inauguration said "well, can't do anything now."

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots. If you couldn't or can't see and acknowledge that fact that was noted even before the election occurred, then your reaction to this issue is obviously based purely on the election results and your feelings about them.	0.715

The reason I say cult is because Trump supporters have proven time and time again that they are willing to believe anything trump tells them to believe. As far as changing voting laws, it’s kind of the legislators jobs to update and change laws.

Facebook sponsored the first Republican primary debate if I recall correctly.

That didn’t happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies. Just face that your guy lost and he lost without honor because he’s a conman. Grow up and face reality	The Truth is Biden was not Elected by the Electoral College! Trump was!

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	Zero evidence? Testimony of shady events and statistical evidence all point to some form of fraud. And there is no way to produce evidence of said fraud without having access to the ballots, envelopes, counting machines, and the voter registration to compare addresses and signatures. That hasn't been granted to anyone trying to audit an election in *any* state yet. Even in Arizona, the election board and Dominion defied subpoenas to produce those materials.	0.673

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?

If less ppl die when they’re vaccinated as opposed to those that aren’t. Even trump said “ the vaccine works, those that are dying are mostly unvaccinated” like I just don’t get it lol u think because covid hasn’t magically disappeared then the vaccine doesn’t work? It was never a cure it’s just armor to white off being killed or hospitalized and it doesn’t stop spread which we always knew. Who told y’all this vaccine should magically stop all covid and spread of it or it doesn’t work	According to the cdc people who are unvaccinated were 14 times more likely to die from Covid.

the Democratic Party of the 1850s and 1860s was on the wrong side of the slavery issue, and in 1860s, it wrenched the party apart — into northern Democrats and southern “Dixiecrats”.

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.  The important point here though is that no elected official should tell registered American citizens that they can't vote -- a basic and fundamental American right -- just 'cause they came from this or that "blue" state. FFS that woman is an embarrassment.	<p>the point is, the parties <em>did</em> shift- it’s just historically true- and that using the party affiliation of the 1800s to vilify Democrats is disingenuous. it’s literally history. the parties shifted.</p>	0.58

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>Now let me address you second argument. Yes, doctors and nurses have been tackling covid-19 for over a year now with a vaccine and have gotten by. They didn’t have a choice. Whether for better or worse, they were forced to treat patients  infected with a deadly virus, risking bringing it home with them or spreading it to others in public (becuase PPE’s are not 100% perfect). Now that they have the option to take the vaccine, they have the opportunity to continue delivering patient care in a manner that is SAFER for themselves, their family, other non-covid-19 patients they also see in the hospital. Not taking the vaccine presents an inherent risk to spreading the virus to other people that might not be able to get fully vaccinated or cannot reap the benefits of the vaccine (immunocompromised, cofactors with lung health, age). So with doctors and nurses who are refusing to get the vaccine, not only are they refuting the very science they spent years studying, but they are now also putting others at risk. That is a direct conflict with their responsibilities as health care providers. If you can avoid putting other people at risk but you choose not to for personal reasons, goodbye. Go find another hospital to work at.</p>	0.651

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.  Nuance breaks this sloppy meme into the shit that it is	<p>All I&#39;m saying is that it makes sense on paper. As far as being told the vaccine would work forever I never really trusted that too much anyway. I was really happy when I saw America produce one of the first ones because for a long time we were saying they were working on supporting their production and we&#39;d be proud of what we&#39;d done. But it was a new disease, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get it perfect the first time around. That just seemed impossible. I&#39;m cautious but at the same time I feel like I understand. To me it seems less like a conspiracy and more of the typical over promise and under deliver. Is that just me?</p>	0.693

Here's a conspiracy theory for you, vaccines were made political to slow down your democratic country's response to the virus, consequently making it look like a less effective system of governance and diluting the blame of the viruses origins	<p>And yes they have politicized the shit out of this virus using it to affect the election and using it to cause fear in the nation just to see how far they could push the limits of control on the American people, I think if they had stayed out of it and let science do the work without the political spin a lot more people would be willing to get this vaccine.</p>	0.756
This seems like an overwhelmingly positive change. Why wouldn’t we want insurance companies to better be able to assess situations? This will allow police to more concretely arrest the right people. Many people choose to have this happen in their card already because it’s incredibly useful information to have. Would love to see this become standard in American models too (and that wouldn’t have to happen with a law mandating it)	<p>I think the underlying issue is that the requirements to be a cop are too easy for the insane amount of power and authority they get.

There's no use comparing the current situation in Germany to current time USA, they'll keep holding onto their notion that owning guns will prevent anyone with a political or military background from seizing power like with Hitler.   I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past. We should be happy that we can actually step out of our home and not worry about some lunatic with a gun whenever we enter a store, bring our kids to school or being stopped on the road by a police officer.  I don't care whatever kind of response I get by an American by typing this, not if you're fine with the current situation in the USA and not passing gun laws. First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	I'm pretty sure America doesn't have much of a future. I'm starting to look for options. Hungary and Czech Republic have similar gun laws to the US.

Yeah I think I’d agree with you, but from the article the data is anonymous and is in a black box type of situation, so you still have control over it (just like you would any other piece of your property, until the police could take it in the course of an investigation, or you handed it over to aid them).

I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines.

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	During a pandemic you need multiple mitigation strategies. CDC screwed up big time when they prematurely announced vaccinated people could stop masking. We needed more time and more data before making that call. Too much pressure is being put on vaccines to be bulletproof, and they’re not, even though they work really well.	0.749

““It doesn’t matter who is in the Oval Office, whether it’s President Trump, President Biden or some other Republican or Democrat. Either one of them would have been greeted by the higher prices we saw this year," De Haan said, reiterating the current price surge is a direct result of the pandemic upending supply and demand.”  This has been annoying me for so long.

Not a good thing, but also something apolitical, and it’s a bad look on conservatives that we’re so up in arms about it.	<p>Trump&#39;s inauguration week gas prices were around $2.30.

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you’ll get less sick, and you’re less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	You say that, but is it really the case? Of the data that I have seen presented to me over the past months since the ""vaccine was released, I have been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that the ""vaccine"" does *anything* to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus.	0.788
The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It’s not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it’s not a political problem. Get over yourself.	What else gets impacted by fuel prices? Everything, all goods and all services. People are already pissed off at gas prices, just watch the prices of everything at the grocery store.	0.634
Fair enough! You’re right, they did take credit for it. I would point out that they released oil from national reserves, which would have the affect of driving prices down, so that might actually be warranted.

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  “Among 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.”  So, there’s at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it’s symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	There are not 500M deaths *FROM* COVID. That's yet another misrepresentation. Rather there are 500M who have (supposedly) die *WITH* COVID. That's a big difference. We have victims of motor vehicle crashes, gunshots, poisoning, etc. all being listed as COVID deaths. They clear are not. The CDC admits that something like 6% of the deaths are actually *FROM* COVID, while the remainder had an AVERAGE of 2.6 other comorbidities.	0.767
If they have a legitimate reason for taking credit, or taking blame, then I’m not against someone, either party, taking credit. But the high gas prices right now are clearly not the fault of any political body (once again, the guy in the article).   Better than arguing over this, we could just choose to ignore the annoying political spinning everyone does. It’s annoying and isn’t going to influence any of us, people who are actually paying attention.	<p>As Gas Prices Soar, Americans <del>Can</del> Do Blame Joe Biden</p>	0.611
I thought it was pretty obvious that the South was run by slavery loving Democrats. Is this not basic knowledge in America? It continues with those who think Lincoln was a Democrat. Just a bunch of idiots.	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	0.65

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	A vaccine is often just stimulating your immune system to kick in and start working, building the memory cells to detect future infection early, though it is often not quite as good as your natural system depending on the strategy (hence why live virus vaccines tend to do better than dead virus vaccines). You cannot make this kind of decision to do vaccine boosters yearly without knowing if it is even necessary. For many people, we may find solid antibody levels good enough for at least decades. Maybe they should get a booster once per 10 years? Maybe not at all. We don't know yet.	0.748

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>Except... Now we&#39;ve waited so long to actually get the vaccines in people that it&#39;s mutated (Delta variant). And they provide protection, but definitely not as much? So we start this whole cycle over. Once you get to a critical mass of virus out there, it keeps mutating and you&#39;re left with a nightmare of randomized versions. This is basically why the flu (influenza, a long distant child of the Spanish / Kansas influenza) exists and the <strong>quadrivalent</strong> vaccine that gets administered has a 20% protectiveness in younger populations. Even though you get 4 strains that they are estimating to be popular that year, there&#39;s plenty of others. </p>	0.74

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>I imagine what you’re referring to about Republicans being proud of the confederacy has to be about statues that dems are trying to remove.

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since. I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	<p>Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional &quot;party switch,&quot; but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn&#39;t want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren&#39;t wanted and don&#39;t let the door hit us on the way out.</p>	0.656

I prefer to be healthy in my "great free state". Getting into a car accident that isn't your fault and results in hundreds of thousands of medical bills doesn't scream "FREE" to me.

Because the majority of the modern world is now vaccinated and the majority of vaccines occured nearly a year ago now. How is this hard to understand?

Never in my life have I seen such a push to get vaccinated for a virus that almost 100% of people will survive. And yet, not only did life come to a complete stop around the world for over a year, but also the government is trying to coerce you with money, food, time off, drugs, booze, etc to receive this shot.

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>By what measure? Death rate? Well in that regard your statement is obviously not true because it&#39;s been proven that people are much less likely to be significantly harmed or killed by Covid-19 with the vaccine. Chances of catching it? In that regard the vaccine isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s still helpful.

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	She views Ted Cruz as a ringleader of a movement that actively wants to kill her.

Northern racism is systemic. A Southerner might be racist, but still has to go to school with black people, see them at Wal Mart, and so on and so on, so they generally learn to live and let live out of necessity.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

Except the real conspiracy theory was the fact that Joe Biden, who sat in his basement, somehow got the most votes in US election history without having to campaign in any serious way. Then conveniently despite affidavits by election workers witnessing fraud in every metropolitan city, challenges of the 2020 election where all dismissed by the courts.   It’s funny how Black Lives Matter can encircle the White House, actually charge the capital building and vandalize it, and not one mention of domestic terrorism or insurrection made by this current regime. Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done. She was allowed into the capital building, was unarmed, and was shot by some goon cop all of the sudden the libs are praising after bitching about the cops in every controversial police shooting.	<p>CNN just released a report from federal investigators saying they now believe the riot and storming of the capital building was clearly pre-planned by exteme right wingers...</p>	0.581

The Civil war was started by angry democrats who were scared of a Republican President-Elect. The civil war was won by a republican president. The only president of the confederacy was a Democrat. How the **fuck** can you be this negligent	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor.

>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead. You endorse slavery with you purchases, tell me otherwise.	How did Obama happen and bezos isn't president is your main point. The problem with that argument is that you are looking at a single data point or two and extrapolating out of that.

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers.

Feel free to ask me for sources on any of this (since you purport to be following science), but what I want to know is what's the logic behind this.

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	<p>Natural immunity is extremely variable. People get challenged with different amounts of virus, different strains and got sick to different levels.

Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they’re good at what they do? That is literally socialism. If you don’t like social media, just don’t use it. The free market will correct itself as long as people stop enabling it. It’s your fault as a consumer, not the company’s fault.   If you got this far, I hope you can see how ridiculous some of the takes on this sub are. As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	<p>Remember when social media was like the wild west, where you could say anything, then democrats in congress threatened the shit out of them and they started censoring everyone, circa 2016?  They are effectively now an arm of the state and should be regulated as such.  They should be trust busted and broken up as a cabal of ~4 collaborating monopolies looking to limit &quot;free speech&quot; under the constitution in favor of one party that has threatened their business.

I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.    All of my colleagues have been vaccinated, as well as a significant amount of the other hospital workers.  The only people we see getting sick are generally the ones who are unvaccinated.  Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.  Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	Vaccines are developed through research and science.

excellent answer, beats the whole 'left' is crazy no matter what they do replies I have gotten...Do you really think Greene is insterested in having an open and honest debate about anything? that isnt what twitter is there for in the first place(I dont agree with them blocking people, just like I dont agree with the crappy mods here doing the exact same thing).	<p>If you want to see what Rep Greene is about, check her Tucker Carlson today interview out, they have a nice long hour+ discussion.

I would like nothing more than to see an open debate between all the healthcare professionals (including) those that had their social media accounts shut down due to "misinformation".  I propose a national debate covered by every major TV network, including Tony Fuaci, Sanjay Gupta, Bill Gates, CDC director Rochelle wolinsky, Robert Malone, Richard Fleming, Peter McCullough, Simone gold, Michael Yeadon etc etc...   Pit every medical professional against one another in an open debate about Covid-19 and Vaccines, let the American people decide who to believe. I want to hear everyone's ideas about the pandemic, I don't want to be forcefed one single narrative over and over and over every day of the week, I want everyone to have a say in the matter. That's how we solve this problem!	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don’t want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it’s effectiveness, but that’s a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.634
She received 5 warnings over many months prior to her personal account getting suspended.	I guarantee if that was all Minaj tweeted, she wouldn’t be suspended right now.

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	<p>Leftists shouldn&#39;t be showing up at people&#39;s houses using human amplifier chains to cause a disturbance. Leftists should respect basic needs for privacy. Leftists should not push to cancel people for having diversity of political thought. Leftists should not de-platform, shun, misreport, ostracize, demonize and malign those who do not share their view. None of these practices work in the long haul. In the long haul your cause is cheapened by these thuggish tactics that seek to sway by threat and coercion rather than sway by the strength of reasoned argument.</p>	0.578

So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	<p>I agree with you on Trump&#39;s spending, however I don&#39;t think Biden will be better. So on that front I just don&#39;t see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump doesn&#39;t have the personality I want. Then again I actually care very, very little about politicians and their personas. Ted Cruz is pretty notorious for being a prick, but he also has a good track record of voting in line with my interests (not perfect, but pretty darn good). </p>	0.589

To be fair, she's an idiot and needs to be voted out. We need to not be defending her at all. However, she doesn't deserve to be silenced.

Im not here to change you mind about anything, buddy. It’s obviously quite set in stone. And that’s okay. You’re entitled to that.

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket. If Boebert and MTG are the future of the party, then Alex Jones deserves to be the chairman.	> Yet, the Second Circuit’s conclusion that Mr. Trump’s Twitter account was a public forum is in tension with, among other things, our frequent description of public fo- rums as “government-controlled spaces.” Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 7); accord, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469 (2009) (“government property and . . . government pro- grams”); Arkansas Ed. Television Comm’n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666, 677 (1998) (“government properties”). Any con- trol Mr. Trump exercised over the account greatly paled in comparison to Twitter’s authority, dictated in its terms of service, to remove the account “at any time for any or no reason.” Twitter exercised its authority to do exactly that.	0.601

My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn’t fascistic.   There is a long history of countries - including the US - requiring foreigners who are entering a sovereign nation - to present medical records, including proof of vaccination.   It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you’re keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	To your claim that hospitals away from the border are not seeing this level of COVID occupancy, I can only invite you to inform yourself. Because, once again, you are making shit up to support your preconceptions.	0.519
https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-data-vaccinated-people-do-not-carry-covid-19-2021-3?op=1  > During an MSNBC interview with Rachel Maddow on Monday, Walensky said: "Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick, and that it's not just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real-world data."  I’d like to agree with you, but earlier this year there were hundreds of articles touting this information. The narrative changes everyday sadly.	You say that, but is it really the case? Of the data that I have seen presented to me over the past months since the ""vaccine was released, I have been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that the ""vaccine"" does *anything* to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus.	0.691

The deaths are primarily among the people who choose not to vaccinate. Unvaccinated people going about their lives without the same mitigation efforts die at a higher rate. And the political affiliation of the unvaccinated (for COVID at least) leans right more than left. Why would anyone apologize to Trump for his supporters ignoring the easiest safety measure continuing to die?	No matter which side of the argument you're on about these vaccinations, no one should be celebrating the tragic deaths or medical struggles of other human beings. It reeks of the disgusting way people treated those who had contracted AIDS back in the 60s-80s. People justified their abhorrent treatment of AIDS sufferers because they saw it as a ""consequence"" of those people's ""risky"" life choices. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	Just remember. You’re the extremist, and when history is written, you will have been on the side of the fascist regime we narrowly avoided.	0.583
You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before. But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself. Or even better find a way that nobody has to wait that long that these things are necessary.	<p>One could argue that denying food and drink to be available to the voters in areas with higher wait times makes voting more unattractive than prior to this coming into affect. </p>	0.591

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat.

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	I get that generational poverty is a thing. I get that black people are more likely to be impacted by that because of the past. What I don’t get is why I, someone who had absolutely nothing to do with it, should be on the hook for it. Equity policies that address that issue seek to do nothing but punish me for things I didn’t do, with the goal of making life better for people that didn’t experience those things.	0.653
Defcon guys have gamefied hacking those voting machines.	<p>Third, the issue with Trump&#39;s claims that votes randomly appeared was explained by the machines having issues which were corrected. Votes were updated in clusters. Trump had bumps of votes, too. It wasn&#39;t just Biden that had 90,000 random votes found for him. More people just happened to vote for Biden in a democratic county. Why didn&#39;t they challenge red counties which used the same machines? Why didn&#39;t they challenge red states which swung for Trump which used the same machines?

Describing the hiring of different people as an “equitable hiring rampage” is snowflake behavior.

Of course not. There is a reason they all failed. There was no merit to the cases. If any of the cases actually had solid evidence then conservative news sources would be talking about it. Yet here we are more than a year later and we have no evidence.	I didnt do a hard tally of all of the lawsuit results, but reading through them all, a vast majority of appeal attempts were either rejected, dismissed, or denied.

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.  Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.	<p>In regard to HIPPA, that&#39;s only regarding service medical service providers like insurance companies,  pharmacies, doctors offices, ect.

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	MLK was not talking to your sense of white victimhood when he said this. He was saying this in a time when it was impossible to send your black children to school with white children, or drink from the same fountains, or sit anywhere on a bus. He was talking about treating black people fairly.	0.652

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	0.635

Hello, not a conservative but have a question?  Is the issue with this political in nature (you don’t think companies should be allowed to do this)? Or personal (you don’t like that this company is doing this)?  Because this seems to be how a private system is supposed to work. The government rules it can’t enforce a certain policy, and then the private sector chooses to implement the policy if they deem it to be the best thing for their business.	Businesses can and have enforced dress codes, no smoking policy, kicked people out for swearing, or smelling like shit, or being too drunk. The list goes on and on.

The initial claim is that mRNA would totally stop the virus and people who get the shot can’t get or transmit the virus. And no booster would be necessary. And mandates aren’t practical. Practically everything about the virus by the people being paid by Pfizer has been misinformation so far. I’m just asking questions. Made no scientific claims unlike the people who “claim” they know. I ask things like, do heathy kids need this? But the burden of proof is on the people asking questions without long term studies.

You're right in pointing this out. It is, however, the least bad choice in a situation of many bad choices. We accept that their ballots will be inherently less secure because we think the people who have volunteered to fight in our military should not be disenfranchised. It is a tolerable compromise to ensure that Americans who are often quite literally on the other side of the planet have a say in their government. However, if you're an able bodied person in Altoona, Pennsylvania, you can go to a fucking polling place.	<p>I can buy that train of thought, it&#39;s fairly logical. I don&#39;t want to get too deep into how secure current elections are as I don&#39;t want to de-rail the conversation but could you also see that while the two are tightly related that one shouldn&#39;t necessarily negate the other? I would argue that if a jurisdiction believes legal non citizens should have a vote in local matters that making those votes secure is a separate (no less important) matter. If security is the issue, and the current voter base isn&#39;t secure, these votes would be no different to votes from current citizens after all.</p>	0.551

1. It doesn't exist, meaning it's just socialism. That's my point.  2. Learn some reading comprehension. You failed to actually understand my comment and brought up something I never claimed. And fyi if you can't be democrat and socialist at the same time you can't have Democratic socialism. 3. Lol "it's a whole other thing" just admit you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them. We have one of THE most progressive tax systems in the world which by definition is socialist (taking more from some to provide benefits to all). If you want to talk about implementing a non socialist flat tax system I'm al ears. Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth. Not shared ownership (which is either socialism or communism)	The shocker is, it's not even socialist. It's full capitalistic, yet it can offer broad and strong social net, free college and cheap healthcare. The word ""socialist"" is thrown out so much is has lost all meaning. And by that mean, simply offering tax covered shcools, firefighters and i.e lawyers during procecution, is enough to stample the USA as a socialist country.	0.63

They do this because, bar cubans almost every minority group votes democrat, even though they can be incredibly conservative and right leaning themselves. The problem is the conservative party refusing to appeal to anyone beyond white conservatives	&quot;The entire issue they have with voter id is that red states will make them hard to get for poor people and minorities.&quot;	0.64
The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable. Yet...I'm still nervous about November.	<p>That division has been stoked by the left and the media (but I repeat myself) for literally decades—Time and again democrats have been held up as paragons of virtue even as many of them have been convicted of criminal abuses of their authority. Meanwhile Republicans get constantly called every bad name in the book by smug media mouthpieces, often after taking quotes mendaciously far out of context.</p>	0.589

I don't like the law. Absolutely should not have passed in the "bipartisan infrastructure bill." I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all. The technology has to be developed and deemed viable before it takes effect anyway, and if not by a certain date, an explanation as to why it's unfeasible has to be given.     Louis Rossmann did a good job explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg)     Just because we understand the lunacy of the left doesn't mean we should be careless in our criticism of them. Pursue excellence.	It’s really too bad, though.  This Congress *could* have gotten through a bill that was *genuinely* focused on infrastructure.  There were plenty of GOP legislators who would have been on board with that.	0.585
If I were you I’d go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	<p>Also of course there are 1000 articles about how voter ID is racist, one party and ideology depends on voter fraud and must produce that propaganda to survive. The fact is we are the only country that votes that doesnt have voter ID. Literally the only country in the world without voter ID. Seems the rest of the world can do it, why is it racist here and not anywhere else? It only takes a second to think for yourself to realize the absurdity and bigotry of the idea that minorities are incapable of getting IDs that they also need to survive in the modern day.</p>	0.73

So is this a thing now or just something the evil dictator is trying to do?

If they cripple their own bureaucracy to delay releasing the information by 55 friggin years, their bureaucracy is inadequate.</p>	0.559
Yes, a Fox News video. We should definitely base our opinions and world view off of anecdata. Again, try reading actual articles rather than the propagandized versions of peoples’ arguments trickled down to you through Fox News.   In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	I believe that voting is a right but with rights go responsibility. I don’t think any law should be passed to prevent or make it more difficult for legal voters to vote just to target certain groups of voters. I also think that is important to have laws that check the validity of voters. Especially, as divided as our country now is, it is important that people be able to trust the vote.	0.535

Sweetheart, don't hurt yourself too much tripping over your propaganda. Democrats would love nothing more than print at home ballots and drop boxes. Voting rights for illegals and maybe let's just throw online voting. You're pathetic because you've been so brainwashed to think that you're so virtuous that you think we are the ones outside the circle. Save me the propaganda, I wasn't born in the us. Your scumbag gov tried the same color revolution on my country twice. I know exactly what's happening, perhaps YOU'RE the snowflake here with your hurt feelings and constantly having to worry about what next big corrupt thing your party will be guilty of next. Just because the corporate media isn't broadcasting the truth, doesn't give you the excuse to be stupid.	Kinda sounds like you're a Biden Boy, worshipping the Socialist Democrats and their Dictatorial Establishment as the Saviors of this country while they legalize pedophilia, implement heinous material about sex and gender and race into school curriculum for little kids, teaching the kids that ""being white"" isn't okay and that they should be shamed for their skin color, allow abortion and gender changes WITHOUT parental consent for SMALL MINORS, and infringe our Constitutional rights while also repeatedly stomping their Oath of Office into the ground on the American Flag. You praise and worship the party that wants to destroy America. Disgusting and abhorrent. You and everyone else that supports the Socialist Left makes me want to throw up.	0.555
First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights’ worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?”	&quot;The entire issue they have with voter id is that red states will make them hard to get for poor people and minorities.&quot;	0.701
They impose tyranny while hiding behind “safety”. First of all, what science do they have that the vaccine is going to stop the spread of COVID and keep all the precious little snowflakes “safe”??

Are that many companies leveraged by guberment money or are all the corporate board rooms that full of blue haired fat lesbians??	<p>And yes they have politicized the shit out of this virus using it to affect the election and using it to cause fear in the nation just to see how far they could push the limits of control on the American people, I think if they had stayed out of it and let science do the work without the political spin a lot more people would be willing to get this vaccine.</p>	0.708

As far as voter fraud goes that’s purely “what if’s” too, correct?   Why did we need the voting rights act in the first place? At some point, not that long ago, the south was very willing to suppress the vote of minorities. Did it end? When? When someone has shown they aren’t willing to play fair (targeted closures of voting precincts), maybe you tread carefully after.  As far as GA, DE, NY goes, I have no idea.	I know voter rolls are a source of constant debate, whether it's things like this or other Southern states purging tens of thousands of legitimate Black voters off the rolls. The voter rolls hasn't seemed to lead to fraudulent ballots though, or, at least, not in any numbers people can point to.	0.654

Yes, you keep telling yourself that. Last I checked, it wasn't Republicans who were stepping down, signaling they weren't selling rejection.

1) I don’t know anything about but I’d be very surprised if dems are less willing to spend on domestic energy than reps  2) I’m not entirely convinced is a huge problem especially with the labor shortage  3) I absolutely understand your perspective but I also understand wanting more accountability and training for a group that holds as much power over our communities as police do. Not sure if the causation you assume (homicide rates rising due to DAs not charging for petty shit?) is really there  4) I’d argue the trump years were one long extended foreign policy disaster. We looked like a joke	C) job loss doesn’t happen overnight, if you think it does then you clearly don’t understand economics.

I have no idea what you're talking about regarding democrats stepping down, as for republicans they wont step down because they have no principles as evidenced by the florida guy getting beaten by 60% and not conceding https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-republican-mariner-wont-concede-cherfilus-mccormick-house-race-landslide-2022-1?r=US&IR=T  Also I love how you lunatics keep saying something is coming, but you never say what it is or when its coming because youre talking out your ass.	<p>Republicans will lose because they ignore the frustrations of their constituents.

> texas allows weapon permits but not student id    This is such a dumb argument.  Do you know what you need to obtain both a concealed carry permit and a student ID?  A state-issued ID.  So the point is totally moot.  And from what I can tell, a student ID looks much easier to forge than a LTC card.	<p>The only reason to not get a permit in Utah is you either aren’t allowed to, or you’re lazy.  They are not hard to get in UT. A lot of people who have permits find comfort in knowing that others carrying concealed had to go to a class before carrying. A concealed weapons class runs you through a lot of do’s and don’ts, so you don’t get in trouble when carrying a gun. </p>	0.569

all of the people who only had those ids and didnt realise they needed other ones, do you not understand? asking me for specific names isnt a win for you when judges already deemed it unconstitutional	It is another lever that can be used to disenfranchise people from voting.

not moot at all just another example of republicans trying to suppress the vote as with the NC example.

State employees would obviously require valid government ID to be hired, so again, that's a moot point.	<p>They could force businesses to check IDs and not sell to anyone out of state.</p>	0.589
> not moot at all just another example of republicans trying to suppress the vote as with the NC example.  Again.  To get a student ID, the student needs a state-issued ID.

if the state ID means they are validated by another form then they should be allowed to use them, but instead representatives decide to make ids predominantly held by black people invalid.	<p>The law says you have to positively identify yourself.

That should end this nonsense, but it just soft racism to say black people can&#39;t or don&#39;t know how to get an official state ID.</p>	0.691
Then you're requiring pollsters to be able to identify the legitimacy of IDs from multiple colleges, multiple state agencies, multiple welfare agencies, etc.  That's not practical.  [Texas student IDs](https://ut.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&number=KB0011353) don't even show an address.  Texas LTC cards do.      I've already destroyed your argument.

They don’t.  Each state ran its own audits and went through various gauntlets of bullshit lawsuits.   Those things you don’t seem interested in reading.   That’s what mystifies me about the side arguing this fiction.  Seems like reading the findings of the court cases would be the absolute minimum due diligence before I threw my weight behind a seditious traitor.   Because that’s where we are.   You either believe in the rule of law or you don’t.  That used to be a pillar of conservatism.    Seems pretty fluid these days.   Trump has totally broken peoples brains.   Damn shame too.	Listen, I honestly couldn't be less impressed by the voter fraud.  After near 50 lawsuits, the Trump show couldn't get one case thru a prima facie case.  That doesn't happen because of a conspiracy. It happens because they have so little evidence, not even a Trump appointed judge was willing to find anything of merit to argue.	0.529

The vaccine doesn't work. If you believe that it does and you're vaccinated, why do you care if other people are unvaccinated? I hate wearing masks. I was vaccinated with the initial 2 doses, got Covid (which was a mild cold), and have no intention of getting the booster. Why are we still reporting daily cases, why are events being cancelled, and why are people frantically searching for Covid tests? If you feel sick, stay home for a few days and you'll get better. Why is this still being handled like the plague?	You dont seem to understand that most people don't worry about this for their own personal safety. Some do, sure, but most vaccinated people are no longer worried about their own wellbeing in terms of getting covid. It's the fact that hospitals are overwhelmed. I'm not worried about an unvaccinated person getting me sick, I'm worried about enough unvaccinated people getting sick and clogging up the hospital. There's already stories about how individuals are being turned away for non-covid related issues simply because there's no room.	0.749

Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	<p>That&#39;s the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That&#39;s not a protest. That&#39;s not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That&#39;s similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn&#39;t almost decapitate the US government. Plus there was only a couple dozen of them vs tens of thousands of Trump rioters at the Capitol.</p>	0.6
We just don’t see it, or hear it, because we don’t talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say “the leftists” or “the democrats”, not the looters.   Just like democrats say “the republicans that stormed the capitol”. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say “hey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b”. It’s disgusting that we as a people have so little say, or are ignored in what our views our. Currently, we HAVE to match what our leaders say.	<p>Even policies you&#39;d think should be bipartisan aren&#39;t. Democrats don&#39;t seem too fond of school choice. They regularly simp for Big Tech and massively powerful corporations. If you support freedom of speech and the 2A, and oppose illegal immigration,  you won&#39;t have a home in the Democrat party. It&#39;s crazy how much has changed in so little time. In 2008, the elected president and VP were openly opposed to gay marriage. Before they even left office, holding that position made you a far right extremist. Democrats have dragged the Overton window so far to the left that overlap has become incredibly scarce. Would you really want the most conservative Democrat over the most liberal Republican, knowing that you&#39;ll still get at worst 50% of what you want from the Republican and at best about 10% of what you want from the Democrat? Even the RINOS are still holding the line on a lot, bad as they may be in too many situations. If they were replaced by Democrats, then the fake &quot;voting rights&quot; nonsense would have been rammed through the Senate months ago. I&#39;m not saying you should blindly vote for one party, but as it stands right now, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a truly electable Democrat and not just someone you would prefer because the Republican happens to be a piece of shit.</p>	0.553

Yeah this isn’t even going to go anywhere. You can’t even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don’t agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that’s all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says “go home”, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don’t stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to. And I’m not saying with guns, but with common sense before all this shit happens.	>I think the truth is that most people just don't care that much about the petty Twitter world and so most of the coverage of this sort of thing comes from the side who can claim victim points and get their readers/viewers the most worked up. In this case, that's Trump supporters.	0.55

Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	<p>Even policies you&#39;d think should be bipartisan aren&#39;t. Democrats don&#39;t seem too fond of school choice.

How are gun laws "strict" if you could buy one with something you could gook up in Photoshop in 3 minutes?       The people who voted for Cuomo killed more people than anyone ever has with a firearm.  I think we need strict voter control.	While I'm not a huge gun person, I did grow up in an area with people who were, and they all seem to agree with the current rules. I'm talking about people who go out and panic buy ammo and guns anytime a Democrat gets elected president, and yet those same people agree with our current state laws which don't ever allow open carry in public.

Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I’m general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it’s a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it’s a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it’s a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics? Politicians vote with their wallet.	<p>See, in the past, Republicans and Democrats disagreed mostly on principles.  But nowadays, Democrats look like they have simply lost grip on reality.  They constantly confuse reality with idiotic wishful thinking.  They have become unable to differentiate between what they wish the world was like and how it actually is.  And this is evident everywhere, from foreign policy to domestic economics.  It&#39;s terrifying.</p>	0.542
So on that same side, do you think there were no republicans that utilized the rioting and looting for their own benefit? Or exacerbated it?   Again, those people that were at the capitol and looters are not democrats or republicans. They’re anarchists. They’re terrorists. And they’re people that do not know how to handle situations rationally. They follow a herd and nothing can change their mind.	I know there were anarchists last summer who did the things you are talking about and I know they would have done the same to the Capitol if they were there. But you're saying those couple dozen people are the same as the tens of thousands of protestors gathered outside Trump tower with their cardboard signs. They're not. Those protestors didn't break into any businesses. I was watching with my own eyes through my window. Outside Trump tower is a bridge over a river. There's nothing *to* loot. The anarchists weren't with the protestors.	0.661
I expect gun sellers to verify with the university that you are who you are.

You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	<p>I remember Biden saying this after encouraging it weeks before.  He only condemned the riots after people were complaining it affected minority citizens.  He was buying votes with this speech.</p>	0.582

Why do you support strict controls on the right to bear arms, but advocate for being able to vote with a cocktail napkin with your name on it?	<p>Not to mention the gun community already has self regulation. Any firearms vender can deny you a sale for any reason they deem fit. This just makes it easier to get in, show you know how to handle and take care of a firearm, and get access to resources needed to continue to do so. The second amendment is a MASSIVE responsibility.

I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	<p>Which is why you should donate to or volunteer at your local food bank.

Why do you assume that I’m for defunding, and also why do you think defunding means removal of officers? Why do you think that all democrats have the same view point? We don’t.

They even stormed the Capitol pretending to be patriots.	<p>In fact, if you watch the videos from the day, this is clear.

People clearly did not know how to react or what to do, so most simply milled about. A small number (within the small number that actually entered the Capital to begin with) took the opportunity to cause damage to the building, steal property from offices, or (maybe - there is literally zero proof this was the case but it is implied) search for Congressmen/Senators for Nefarious reasons.</p>	0.581

Testy derived from “teste” or “testicle” testy (adj.) early 15c., "impetuous, rash," altered from Middle English testif "headstrong" (late 14c.), from Anglo-French testif, Old French testu (Modern French têtu) "stubborn, headstrong, obstinate," literally "heady," from teste "head" (see tete).

Lol, don’t worry, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden he just got 81 million “votes” from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you’ll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they’ll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don’t see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the “worst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics” even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you’re a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you’re constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	<p>McCain was a disgrace, Romney was a Rino, W.

2019: economy looked great. Trump was holding speeches in large stadiums. The best democrat candidates were Biden, Pete and Kamala. Trump looked like he’d win 2020.  2020: Democrats turn a flu into a catastrophic pandemic. Introduce “election reforms” in battleground states. Engage in mass election fraud.  2021: Biden is president and Kamala is VP.  What’s the moral of the story? Don’t count your chickens before the eggs hatch. Republicans are incredible dumb fucks.	<p>Biden screwed up so bad moderate dems and liberals will even for for Trump now. They won’t vote for other republican candidates because they are democrats. They will vote for Trump because even all the bad things that stick to Trump, the one thing that people really equate to Trump is the economy. So people will want that. </p>	0.59

Comparing that to children who have live through fucking wars, and have ended up just fine, do you really believe the damage is **forever**? Fucking snowflakes.	<p>So has heart disease and cancer.  The primary age groups of war deaths is 18-30, with a total over 660,000 for all of our wars. Covid deaths for that same age group is 11,677.  660,000&gt;11,677.  I imagine if 60+ year olds fought all of our wars the death rate for those would be much higher as well.  And to preempt the inevetable &quot;YoU dOn&#39;T cArE aBoUt GrAnDmA&quot;, yes I do, I am just smart enough to know that there is not really a comparison between a healthy and fit 25 year old being killed in combat to an 80 year old grandma at the end of her life being pushed over the edge by covid.</p>	0.482

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately. I’m a conservative leaning independent and I think a lot of the Covid stuff is bs, but this was full of bullshit dude. Just telling you that this is like the left saying “all the children are on vents” “ gunshots can’t be treated too many ivermectin ods!!”.	FUCK FENTANYL. There's no reason we need an opiate that strong. I love opiates but I'm clean now because it's not worth risking anymore.

Best example of news bias was when white police officer shot young black attacker to prevent her from stabbing another young black female.

I'll update that to "pseudo", it was an active protest to systemic issues. A large scale sit-in, something that had been done many times in American history.   But marching on your nation's capital/Capitol because of blatant lies and falsehoods, very different.	<p>In fact, if you watch the videos from the day, this is clear. People were milling about in the Capital, and many ended up in there simply because they happened to be in the front of the protest and got pushed in by the crowd. People clearly did not know how to react or what to do, so most simply milled about. A small number (within the small number that actually entered the Capital to begin with) took the opportunity to cause damage to the building, steal property from offices, or (maybe - there is literally zero proof this was the case but it is implied) search for Congressmen/Senators for Nefarious reasons.</p>	0.629

As a lefty, I WISH the Democratic Party was as far left as y’all think it is. Please get out of your bubble to realize some amount of that.	<p>That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with.

Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	<p>The real sad thing is what&#39;s going to happen to poor DeSantis.   He&#39;s going to keep rising in the polls.  Once the primaries start one of two things will happen.  Either Trump will run, DeSantis will beat him in the polls one week or at a debate, and Trump will proceed to try to destroy him, insulting his wife, making lies up about his family, and will motivate his followers and supporters to support someone else.  Or, Trump won&#39;t run, and some liberal newspaper will publish an article where an &quot;anonymous source&quot; will say DeSantis once whispered that Trump only deserved a grade of A as President, not A+, and the same thing will happen.  </p>	0.683
Holy crap boys. I get it if you don’t want to get vaccinated I support your freedom to choose, but picking and choosing the data like the author did in this article is junk science.  From the article the author pasted in this article: Boosted vs unvaccinated isn’t even close. Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000. That’s somewhere between 3 times and 15 times the risk of death to be unvaccinated.   This data doesn’t show what the author is trying to distort it to show.	Fact is, the vaccine vastly reduces hospitalizatiom and death rates, the statistics don't lie.	0.698

There has never been a sterilizing vaccine. Not even smallpox was sterilizing for all ppl, and certainly didn't last for a lifetime.   Instead it takes a good enough vaccine, taken by enough people, combined with other measures, to suppress the spread of a disease (what we did with snallpox).

First of all, it was the Capitol they bombed, not the White House ( I know, facts are hard).

Those are rioters, and that is a riot. A riot is defined as &quot; a violent disturbance of the peace by a crowd. &quot; I&#39;d say that the murder of a police officer constitutes violent, 800 folks constitutes a crowd, and as you said, there was a &quot;peaceful protest&quot; that was marred by these rioters.

Such shortsightedness. Many children are born into circumstances that are absolutely not appropriate. Ignoring the obvious (rape etc.), it makes absolutely zero sense to compel a woman to carry to term. You might have a point of America actually gave a shit about children’s welfare beyond this argument, but you’re severely lacking in any kind of appropriate support for mothers, childcare provisions, accessible healthcare etc.  Be against abortion by all means, but it’s an absolute joke to call it genocide.	You couldn't be more wrong. The vast majority of abortion usage is due to a woman merely not wanting a child. There are studies which illustrate this fact.	0.671

It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you’d look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.	What you are taking about is using abortion as birth control. I am against that part. I can not morally and ethically object to someone getting an abortion because of medical reasons or if it was a rape. There are much better and cheaper ways to prevent pregnancies called birth control and condoms.</p>	0.729
Where did I say it was acceptable? You act like I’m glad she got shot. But you don’t willing try to climb through a window with armed guards in the damn capital and then expect people to act surprised you got shot.

Try doing the same thing in my house and you’ll get shot all the same.	<p>This cop was justified, and everybody can see through the insane lie of “knife fights are normal” and “she was unarmed and a saint who didn’t deserve this.”</p>	0.547
Right, so by you’re logic you’re quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can’t support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it’s acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It’s the ‘parents responsibility’ to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they’ll suddenly ‘get it’ and do a good job… but they’re not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	And on the ""something wrong with the baby"" argument, I think that's even worse. Most parents I've met of kids that doctors suggested be aborted due to one problem or another are actually the best people, the most caring and loving people. We as a society are stronger for having these people around.	0.618
I said it wasn’t perfect. But downvote away pussy.	<p>Fuck your presumptuous down votes.</p>	0.446
So I’m presuming you support policies that help mothers/fathers provide the best possible car for the child once it is born? I presume you’d fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves? Or is it some binary thing of “alive or dead” where quality of that life means fuck all?  If you fully support the above, then we may disagree but I could see your stance. If you’re of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you’re not pro life at all, you’re pro control and don’t care about welfare of the child at all.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.  To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.  Now maybe a society comes about that there&#39;s no point in maintaining an &quot;unwanted life&quot; but that gets really screwy and it goes against human nature in that in nature you needed more people generally due to strong death rates in the natural world.</p>	0.553

Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers. Being against tax payer dollars for potential mother's is why the left bashes the right over not caring about the baby after it's born. If you ban abortion there definitely should be outreach for mothers. Especially young ones.	0.587

With abortions, people who should not be parents such as women who’s baby father walked out, are poor, or don’t have the proper support systems are advocating for abortions but the conservatives are blocking that. If people had access to abortions then maybe these kids won’t have to be born into societies where becoming a menace is their only option.	0.62
Being pro-fascist is the same waste of life. You live in a land of no sources, of Fox, OAN, Newsmax and trump. You have no policy that’s worthwhile, only culture war.

Fascists have every right to speech, publishing their ideas, and peacefully assembling to protest as I do.  ***I do not support Nazis and Communists, but the price of freedom is that they must have it too.  Antifa denies these rights to their enemies, and by disagreeing you too become their enemy.***  Think of the slogan ""punch a Nazi.""  Who counts as a Nazi?

Alright buddy.	<p>But if you even suggest they stop using abortion as birth control, and maybe practice safe sex, that’s a gigantic issue and infringes on their rights as a woman.

So let’s kill the entire potential of a 12 year old who was raped to keep a fetus who doesn’t know about it’s existence?	I assume (it’s never been fully explained to me), the conservative thinking goes that murder would be a worse crime yet, especially since a fetus has no way of defending or protecting itself, but to me this seems very much like driving out the devil with the Beelzebub if you wish, committing one heinous crime to prevent another.	0.638
So if a woman lives in a state where abortion is legal but doesn’t get an abortion, that child is not entitled to any support?

 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	<p>I’m curious where abortions reduce crime rates as you state. Would love to see that research or article.</p>	0.597

I can't do anything about an entire group of people who think I'm a bigot for thinking kids and teens shouldn't medically transition, kids should socially transition if gender dysphoria persists past 16 and it started at a young age, and that being LGBT is becoming a trend.

Let me be clear, the test was not positive, and they chose to terminate, the test killed the baby.

Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers. Being against tax payer dollars for potential mother's is why the left bashes the right over not caring about the baby after it's born. If you ban abortion there definitely should be outreach for mothers. Especially young ones.	0.662

Followed up with something along the lines of:   "I will not call them by the gender they say they are, but I will respect them as a person and only attack their opinions." - unless there's a genuine reason to attack them as a person (Ex: Demi and Alok)   "I will call them by gender they say they are out of respect, but that doesn't mean I have to believe it."	<p>Once someone launches a personal attack against you...racist...trans-phobe, etc. you can stop talking because there is no more debate.

Let’s not forget many poor single mothers that seek abortions can’t see a way to afford the pregnancy itself. Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	>providing birth control to women at no cost substantially reduces unplanned pregnancies and cuts abortion rates by a range of 62 to 78 percent compared to the national rate.	0.669

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	By your logic, ""your body your choice"" when it comes to vaccines, so why not when it comes to abortions?	0.707
Vaxed people can spread the virus as well. So everyone vaxed or not can kill people. Kinda drops the extremely small chance even more.	what they don't tell you is that when viruses mutate, they may become more contagious, but also less deadly. vaxxed or not, doesn't matter.	0.641

Is it extremely small compared to the one life?  My math is back of napkin, but there's \~300 million people in the US, so to "balance" the 100% of 1 you only need \~0.0000000003%(1/300,000,000). And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	<p>Just because you don&#39;t die doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re home free. Not only could there be effects we don&#39;t know yet, but you&#39;re also giving the virus an opportunity to mutate into another variant. Multiple that by millions and you get the delta variant. Your perspective, in my opinion, is a narrow one.</p>	0.614
Those other humans involved have the option to take the vaccine, which has been proven to reduce hospitalizations. They have the abiltiy to take steps are needed so that they are protected personally. If they decide to wear a mask? Fine. If they decide to get vaccinated? Fine.  A baby inside the womb does not have that liberty. They are at the complete mercy of the mother.	I think the average person is fine with wearing a mask, just not being told they are obliged to on pain of punishment.

And there have been an estimated 62 million abortions since Roe. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abortions-since-roe-v-wade	*According to WHO, every year in the world there are an estimated 40-50 million abortions. This corresponds to approximately 125,000 abortions per day.*	0.728
So what...the 5 million who died from COVID aren't significant enough?  Roe happened in 1973. It's been 49 years. That means on average we see 1.29 million deaths per year from abortions.  COVID has been around for 2 years and we've seen 5m deaths.  That's 2.5m per year.  You're going to get the vaccine now, right?	Of the people under 40 years old 0.0058% have died of COVID.  The vast majority with 2 or more co-morbidities and unvax'ed	0.694
Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	<p>Moreover abortions are always fatal, wheras being contagious and spreading a virus (with respect to covid 19) is almost always not fatal. I’m not arguing for or against vaccines here, Im only examining the logic being used.</p>	0.655

It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	By your logic, ""your body your choice"" when it comes to vaccines, so why not when it comes to abortions?	0.65

Nope. Are you claiming all those 5 million were from unvaccinated? How about the fact that there have been more deaths since Biden took over as there was when Trump was President, and Biden has had the vaccine with over half the United States  vaccinated? The vaccine is really having an effect isn’t it?	the media will simply stop reporting on deaths at that point because in a year with a vaccine being readily available, just as many people would have died under biden as there were in a year under trump without a vaccine. that completely undercuts the baseless claim that trump handled the pandemic poorly.	0.729
Wow, it’s sad how these conservatives are choosing to downvote a comment about children needing hearts.  But abortion should be stopped right?

First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	<p>E. <strong>Not let hundreds of thousands of people across the border who have no vaccine whatsoever</strong>.

In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption. This is the result of the confluence of these two facts.  There is no lack of a free market here, and there is no lack of private ownership. This corporation is working *within* the system here. This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	Lots of your counter examples to my points say that what I attribute to the free market is actually the government screwing it up. And I agree that is part of the problem.  But the government is also an artifact of the free market. Can I claim that the powerful companies use their market positions to get government to change the rules in there favor? Isn't that just an expression of market power?	0.619
The issue that I have is that your choice does effect others.  For each surge that we had, our hospitals were clogged full of unvaccinated people.  We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.     As a physician I know that the current vaccine is still highly effective in keeping people from hospitalization and death.  Hopefully this will give us time for the production of the more effective medication.	<p>COVID numbers are definitely effecting treatment outcomes of even non COVID conditions at the moment. I would definitely suggest to anyone to look at the vaccine which reduces mortality significantly and can help unclog the system. Everyone thinks they will be fine without it until they are not, and it is almost entirely the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised who end up taking up beds in critical care. Ask a physician to address any concerns if you have them.</p>	0.748
I do think they have somewhat of a point. For example, the trend of people not vaccinating their children in recent years has brought about small outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, etc.	(Don't just read the headline, read the abstract. The trend is higher for vaccines, but they're not sure it is statistically significant. The trend, though, is up, and worthy of more research.)	0.686

With Inflation, jobs paying <20 for unskilled labor even when said labor can lead to 5day 9hour work weeks where you break your back to just live.     You need a minimum of 20-25$/hour just to live beyond eating well everyday, and paying utilities.     \---     You can't make it well for yourself in todays economy. It's not an Obama, Trump, or Biden thing. It's a 60,70s, and 80s problem that caused this. It is not a republican, or democrat problem. It's an American problem.     ***Minimum Wage needs to be 25-30 dollars just to live, and anything less than 45$/hour you need to work 30-40 hours/week, 60+ years of your life, then you can retire.***     Yes, this is America & you could make something of it. Most of the time? You won't be able to cause you're making 20-25$/hour just to make ends meet by yourself.	<p>It’s not like those companies are taking middle-class people that would otherwise be living a comfortable life with a decent income and giving them shit pay in a sweatshop - these jobs attract people with little access to qualify education and would otherwise be forced to make even worse pay in a different sector. </p>	0.526

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They’ll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape.

I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.

Yes, why would somebody blame Trump for helping to try to overturn an election when he told people that the election was rigged and falsely claiming that Mike Pence could overturn the election on 1/6 if he just ignored the will of the voters. /s He was literally the one who brought them there by pedaling bullshit. According to testimony he actually intended to go to the capital and didn't because the Secret Service told him they wouldn't be able to protect him. He only managed his "we love you. stand down" bullshit after a great deal of pressuring by others including his daughter and he still wasn't the one to request reinforcements.

He is an entitled piece of shit with zero emotional intelligence.	<p>So, in essence, Trump sat on his hands while Mike Pence had to assume responsibility and ensure that timely aid was provided to the Capitol - <em>while being endangered himself</em> (a commendable performance, but should absolutely not be necessary). Again, I believe this to be grossly negligent of the duty of office of the presidency and, if true, worthy of impeachment. The second a single pane of glass broke Trump should have been on the phone with every support mechanism possible to as quickly as efficiently remove or eliminate every threat to the Capitol.

Is your question, What happened with the 10 different republican led investigations?	Nor was anything uncovered in the course of the investigation leaked for political purposes like we saw for the entirety of the Trump ""investigations"", many of which turned out to be disinformation.   We didn't even find out about this until long after the government was purged of Trump appointees.	0.606

Eh, apparently the group called The Oath Keepers stashed weapons at a nearby hotel, and there's that photo of the rioter in the capitol building with a handful of zip ties.

It is possible our elected officials can multi-task.    We had a 20 year war in Afghanistan... somehow other business got accomplished.

We spent trillions of dollars, trained a military, and established a government. The moment we left, they crumbed in a week.

Well if your grandma made the pipe bombs, then she should be arrested and the situation should be investigate why so many trumpers have been found inside past police barriers.    Every BLM that damaged a building should also be held accountable.  See how easy that was.  Everyone should be held accountable for their actions.  Instead you deflect, deflect, deflect.  I'll let the Minneapolis police and Minneapolis politicians handle their city.  I want federal investigations on what happens in federal buildings.  Stop with the "but antifa/blm"  you sound like a child	<p>Your argument that there shouldn’t be an investigation into the Capitol because there wasn’t one for the riots is simply illogical .

It took forever to actually get a response for the problem and the President of the United States wasn't ever even who called for reinforcements. Apparently getting him to provide his half-assed message to tell his own followers to leave the capital was its own project that required a great deal of pressure. This shouldn't need to be said, but just because somebody acts like a dictator doesn't mean they're a rolemodel.	Or he was told one thing and had to adjust. Sending troops back in to help get people out I don't see as a bad thing. Shit happens. Look at the obl raid. They used 2 helicopters just incase, and one fucked up. That raid didn't go exactly as planned and had some fuckups, but they had enough redundancy built in to complete it satisfactorily. That was a ""small"" operation with limited footprint.	0.52
Name another US prez that publicly insisted to his base that an election was “fake” and “rigged”.  That right there to me is a huge red flag. I don’t understand why you don’t see that as particularly heinous. Yeah, that in and of itself is, admittedly, not direct evidence for the claim of insurrection, but it certainly lays the groundwork.   Does the damage that rhetoric caused to the foundation of our democracy not concern you?	The one and only claim I have made, is that: you are in err when you say ""The election was clearly not fraudulent"". Providing no proof thereafter, whilst criticizing someone for making a claim without proof. That's a hypocrisy that could be, and should be easily reconciled.	0.622
So we shouldn't do anything about Russia until BLM is handled?  So the FBI can't investigate a crime in Mississippi because a BLM supporter broke a window in Seattle?

The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.' "  https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-effort-live-updates/2021/01/11/955631105/impeachment-resolution-cites-trumps-incitement-of-capitol-insurrection  That sure seems like evidence to me.	<p>Obviously. It does mean, though, that this was not a nefarious attempt to overthrow the election but rather a disgruntled band of hooligans disrespecting the capitol. This explicitly blows up the second impeachment and can be thrown in the face of anyone trying to lie about how Trump tried to overthrow the election results. And before you say otherwise, filing objections and working within the framework of the elections process is not overthrowing the election results.</p>	0.597

Let’s be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what “side” they’re on. So don’t try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I’m not.   But you’re trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn’t be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn’t clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to “protest” a “stolen” election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	<p>I am done talking with you guys.  There have been less than 5 violent protests from the right over the last 2 years.  Less than 5.  In comparison there have been a hundred from the left, dozens killed, hundreds injured, billions worth of prop damage and lost businesses.  Mix in CRT, the woke mob, and the rabid fanatical trans activists and I am 100% over it.   </p>	0.67
This is great..  glad I didn't vote for Hillary.  What does this have to do with the January 6th attack?	We don't care.

If you get pulled over for speeding, be sure to tell the police officers you can't get a ticket because a blm supporter broke a window 6 months ago.  Let me know how that works out for you.	<p>BLM literally spawned out of quarrels with police, and due to it it has caused months of hate towards cops. There was one (1) right-wing protest that caused exactly 2 intentional deaths, one of which was a protester. It lasted less than a day overall. The leftist protests were nationwide and lasted months. No matter how much you want them to be, these situations are NOT comparable.</p>	0.506
This is true.  There are almost no African Americans in Ukraine.  So you automatically know the murder rate is lower there.	<p>The data tells the real story.

First of all, things are already chaos, you can thank Trump and his cronies for that.  Second, I couldn’t notice your lack of defense for Trump’s quote of “if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.” Care to perform your mental gymnastics for me to justify that one? Just curious.	<p>I do love my country and what it used to stand for. I fought for this country and for what it used to stand for. Now I&#39;m looking around and I see people like you who are so presumptuous. Not all conservatives are &quot;Trumpers.&quot; I voted for him because I saw what Biden and Obama did when they were in charge and I compared that to what Trump did the last 4 years. Trump accomplished more and did a better job. We don&#39;t need to be &quot;deprogrammed.&quot; The left needs to pick a fight with a mirror.

This is literally part of the findings of the 1/6th committee. Getting Trump to tell his supporters to leave the capital was a big ask that was at best half-assed.

Why are you adamant on protecting such a scum bag? I can tell you right now that if Biden said half the things Trump had I would also be calling to have him locked up, too.

This is a bad bill and sad to see such support in the comments.  Paternity can't be proven at conception. So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.  This is going to be abused to hell and back, with seemingly no course for action for when the wrong man is held accountable.   A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.

You do know that your body doesn't know why it's producing the injected spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine, right? This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	<p>A vaccine is often just stimulating your immune system to kick in and start working, building the memory cells to detect future infection early, though it is often not quite as good as your natural system depending on the strategy (hence why live virus vaccines tend to do better than dead virus vaccines). You cannot make this kind of decision to do vaccine boosters yearly without knowing if it is even necessary. For many people, we may find solid antibody levels good enough for at least decades. Maybe they should get a booster once per 10 years? Maybe not at all. We don&#39;t know yet. </p>	0.761

See guys the set up..:::they know they’re going to get their ass kicked by the republicans, so if the democrats can’t get election “reform” passed to ensure they can ballot harvest and pull all their shenanigans to steal upcoming elections, they’re already are refusing to recognize the upcoming Republican victory as legitimate. Their media will report that racist voting laws are suppressing minority votes which is why republicans won, so it’s not a legitimate victory…as they sit there and tell us to accept results of 2020 elections and don’t you dare question that. That’s the narrative that play out in r/politics too as those cry babies will share endless propaganda bolstering what I just said.	<p>Now they lie to the audience. Suppress information. They lied to and tricked the least knowledgeable voting group in the country with emotional warfare. They don&#39;t use facts. They can&#39;t even define the systematic racism they proclaim. They can&#39;t define &quot;white rage&quot; they just throw it out there like an emotional grenade and inexperienced people take it as the truth. The young people trust them. They told people they were going to pay off their student loans lol. They lied about that and it was an obvious lie but young people are too inexperienced to know that. Now there&#39;s no accountability for their obvious lie. I Just hope and pray the corrupt Democrat party have permanently lost their trust. </p>	0.611
I don't understand the title of this post. How is it that pro choice is equivalent to pro-life about one person. If you are pro-life about one person, then that means that you believe one person should not have the choice to have an abortion. Which person is it that you are claiming a pro-choice person is thinking about?

Sorry but last time I checked if you had Covid wether they were bad symptoms or not, you stayed home. Vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting Covid or spreading it. Carhartt doesn’t have a policy where you can have Covid, but if your symptoms are low then you can come to work.  Fuck the mandate it doesn’t do anything.	Let’s keep thinking here.  If you get the vaccine you can still get and spread Covid.	0.661
1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	<p>Yes, I do believe that life begins at conception and therefore abortion is murder, but forcing a woman to carry a baby to term against her will seems to be at least as reprehensible as rape, possibly more so because it goes on for nine whole months. </p>	0.712

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	<p>The second is the vaccine itself. It is under emergency distribution authorization and has yet to have final approval from the FDA. Some people want to see what the long term effects, if any, there are from anything they take. These people are not anti vax, but get labeled as such just because they&#39;re even the slightest bit skeptical about something that was rushed. Likely, it&#39;ll be fine, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to wait until the final authorization. Especially if the government wants to mandate it.</p>	0.706

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.  Plain and simple.	<p>The question of morality and whether you are pro choice or pro life really just comes down to whether or not you believe that abortion is murder.  Everyone views murder as bad.  Pro choice people just don&#39;t see abortion as murder, at least not before the point of viability.  You&#39;d be hard pressed to find anyone on either side of the aisle who is okay with late term abortions of perfectly healthy and uncomplicated pregnancies.</p>	0.682

> At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.  None of this was behind closed doors. Most of it was index fund ETFs which I was told was supposed to be the only allowable investment by this sub, and the rest of it was after the completely public bill text was unsurprisingly passed.  What a bullshit hit piece. It's talking about the ROI on 6 individual trades not his actual portfolio.  > But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%.  The S&P ETFs he bought way out performed this purchase by nearly double. After BA opted for private funding rather than the offered public funding.

Answer:👇  Sadly, it’s the West that’s been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia’s doorstep.  Putin hasn’t been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It’s been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What’s happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‘RESPONDED’ by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets’ military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America’s nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn’t having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn’t fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we’re a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.👇  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	Also, Putin is only relevant to Europe. They’re a paper tiger the left likes to pretend is still a superpower beyond nukes. They aren’t. I’d have done more than send Ukraine Javelin missiles when Putin shot down an airliner and invaded Ukraine. I’d have sent them a squadron of F-22’s and an AWACS to control them till Putin went back to his hunting cabin.	0.676

Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	Numerous accounts and affidavits confirm it. Videos showing ballots being manipulated. Ballot drops in the middle of the night after counting had supposedly stopped and the watchers had left.. Counties with more votes than actual eligible voters, etc.	0.68
I don't know anything about deleted footage, but I can assure you if it was legitimate, the Trump judges who heard these cases would have done something about it.	<p>A) To be clear, the video shows 90 seconds of several hours of footage. The video does not indicate that anyone was instructed to leave. That part is a claim by the Trump defense team, whose witnesses melted away into the night.	0.555
https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielcassady/2020/09/05/election-2020-battleground-states-heres-how-theyll-count-mail-in-ballots/  Read this. I'm telling the truth. States that couldn't count their mail in until late: Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, United Nevada, Ohio, Wisconsin.	<p>Mail ballots should be counted *immediately* on election day, not counted after the other ballots. This prevents the manufacturing of a known number of ballots to just tip the scales. The total count of mail ballots received should be known, too. The total number of mail-in ballots handled by USPS must be declared daily and this would set the limit of votes that can be counted. Any discrepancy should trigger a statutory review process. USPS must have a franking machine that cannot be reconfigured, which stamps the date on mail ballot envelopes. This prevents backdating.</p>	0.587

I might care about this if the vaccine worked. All it does now is basically help you get less sick, like a complicated form of Tylenol. Doesn't stop the spread, doesn't stop you getting sick.

Previously vaccine-authoritative governments like UK and Israel have all but abandoned it.	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane.

This is going to sound weird or gay or whatever, but you know what would really drive this point home? Show a full body shot of this dude. All you see are headshots and this type of thing where he’s got his legs crossed.  This dude wants to wear a woman’s bathing suit? Then show him just like you show the women. If that means seeing a bulge from his package, then so be it. It would make the case crystal clear. You have a bunch of obviously fit women with women’s bodies racing against what is obviously a dude, cock, balls, and all.  All these shots that respect his dignity or whatever by obfuscating what is between his legs are just giving plausible deniability to the pro-trans people out there.	Two can play that game: By alleging ""transphobia"" where there is none, you are yourself assuming that OP is not transgender and further assuming that he is simultaneously being irrationally fearful of trans people, thus perpetuating and practicing bigotry yourself.	0.512

Leftism itself needs no insults... lol. It's a self-destructive, pitiful existence. The typical leftist male is a single, white, degenerate gamer. They likely won't marry, if they get lucky and "do the deed" with a woman, they will likely beg her to kill their offspring.     In many cases though, leftist males, night after night, browse grindr for self degregating anonymous anal sex with strangers day, after day, night after night.      It's honestly sad, but thankfully it is an ideology that can't survive more than one, maybe 2 generations if lucky.     How many of these did I get right with you? lol	<p>Leftists thrive on hate.  That is all they are, all they have.  That is what makes them leftists.  The whole point of leftism is dissatisfaction with other people exercising freedom in ways you disapprove of, and amassing political power over them to stop them.</p>	0.661

Transgender athletes are realistically only going to effect women’s athletics. If women don’t stand up to this strongly, it will continue.  I saw one poll that showed only 46% of women oppose transgender athletes in their sports. I mean, if  If the vast majority of women  aren’t even going stand up to this and raise holy hell, I don’t know why men should.	The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn't disqualify athletes from competing in female sports.

This actually makes sense because I have always thought that Jan 21st 2023 Biden is removed from office or steps down on his own.  That way whoever is VP would be able to run 2 more times for a total of 10 years, but then they picked Harris as the VP who is super unlikeable.  But if they put Harris in the Supreme Court then they can get anyone else as VP and then President in 2023.  It is all working out.	Still would not surprise me if Harris becomes President due to the cognitive inability of Joe Biden by mid terms so she can fulfill a full 10 years. The media is beginning their campaign now, after propping up Biden for all of 2020, to set out that agenda. Slander Biden's cognitive state, grounds to remove him from office for being unfit.

From what I've read is that this all happened because of an interview .... They asked the whole community if they should do an interview and most of their users said no... We shouldn't do any interviews.... And that mod in the video basically said well I'm still going to do the interview with fox...hence the video... And when the community said... Why did you do the interview we voted on not to do any interviews and you sent the worst person to represent us the way they spoke dressed and gave anti work a bad name  The mods in the subreddit decided to ban everyone who spoke about it with the reason being trolls, right wingers, left wingers, brigadiers, and transphobes .... Soo much so that the community started making other subreddits because of this... And to protect themselves and not lose anyone else... They privated the sub to themselves.... Now no one can get in... Or do any changes	If youve ever been banned on one of these lefty subs  for making a neutral or questioning comment, you would realize that they have to stamp out anything that doesnt cater to their ideology.	0.521

> But the Dems started this in the mid-80’s with Judge Bork who was clearly qualified to be a Supreme Court justice.  To be fair, it was Just Bork they objected to because he did not support the civil rights SCOTUS decisions, and the Dems did confirm next person that was proposed (Kennedy). Thats alot different that Mitch Mcconell saying that he wont consent to anyone that Dems appoint.	<p>In 2020, Republicans controlled congress, and they used that power to properly confirm a supreme court justice. The democrats would have done the exact same thing. And this confirmation was nothing unprecedented -- there have been numerous times where justices had been confirmed very close to an election and even AFTER an election in which the president had lost.</p>	0.59

The truth that’s too difficult for you to swallow is that her voters are the reason the country is in decline along with Trump voters being the reason our country is in decline. We have horrible leaders because we have horrible systems.

Wait. He has a job. Just because it’s not 40 hrs a week why is he a lazy socialist? If he can support himself, which I wish Jesse would have asked, what is wrong with that? Yeah there are people on there who don’t want to work and be supported but the idea is to. work at a job that is not soul crushing and that you can support yourself on. The name “anti work” is misleading. They are more anti traditional work roles and don’t want to feel like they are being taken advantage of. I don’t think anything is wrong with that logic if they can support themselves.	<p>Once they get out and have to support themselves and finally see that while you work 40+ hours a week someone else is allowed to just sit at home and basically collect twice as much money as you do for no real reason except they were born into the system, will probably change at least some people’s minds when it comes to socialism.</p>	0.554

Funny that's what the dog walker Doreen said. And he works 25 hours a week and isn't sure that's not to much.   Your concerns are legitimate in a few scenarios, however they took those talkings points and used them as a spearhead to accomplish the goal of not working at all or barely at all while screaming for more free shit. So in a way, the people shouting for more worker protections, have damaged the image of that argument more than any other group.	<p>That&#39;s exactly what Kellogs tried to do.

It used to be extremely anti job, then people started posting about how they actually wanted fair compensation for working, like actually getting a livable wage among many other things like having a safe work environment, which would increase staff happiness and productivity. So the sub transformed into that.

Off topic of that sub, but most subs on reddit are run by morons. I've been banned from like 4 or 5 for the most trivial reasons.  buildapcsales because morons misunderstood my title and said I was trolling by telling them how to get a gpu from b&h.  fantasybaseball because I dared say ozuna was innocent until proven guilty.  sportsbook because people didn't like my questions, which were totally on topic of the sub.  news because I said the pfizer ceo said the original vaccine was only beneficial in a limtied way and that twitter removed the vid when someone tweeted it.  I think 1 or 2 others also. And usually they don't even bother telling me how I broke any rule.	<p>Were you that outraged when Reddit shut down conservative leaning subs? What about the fact they&#39;ve banned any gay and lesbian sub that believes sexual orientation and gender identity are different? Are you upset they shut down a feminist sub which believed that male bodied individuals didn&#39;t belong in women&#39;s sports? Does it bother you that posting on certain subs will get you preemptively banned from others?</p>	0.605
I'm sure they'll find a qualified candidate who fits that description. Diversity and inclusion is important.   I always thought stating it that way was kind of bad optics though.

I can't imagine there isn't a list already that both the DNC (or whoever) doesn't keep of acceptable nominees revealed is Biden's comments that doesn't include a qualified black woman. Do you think differently?  Do you really think there's a quantifiable difference between the abilities of anyone on the shortlist for SCOTUS?  You can't seriously tell me you believe they can't find a black woman as qualified for the job as Scalia, Roberts, Kennedy etc, right?	Kamala Harris is a case study on why affirmative action doesn't work. She was hired because she was a black female. (Yes, Biden declared that his VP would be female.  This statement was met with a letter signed by over 700 black leaders that she better be a black one.)	0.568

So you don't know what the DNC has, but you do know how they choose Sotomayor.  SCOTUS isn't a job with qualifications, it just requires someone best to do the job (which you might say is based on... qualifications?).

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess their race (and likely gender) played a role in their selection for the job.	<p>Since SCOTUS is not making any landmark rulings on the election, where I had expected them to do so, SCOTUS is also a dying branch.

So what, is it a slippery slope sort of thing? Or is it that communists in particular are stupid for thinking their ideology would help them and it will inevitably end in fascism?  Or is it suggesting the modern transgender liberal with their crazy hair is a stupid communist?  It kind of just seems like it's a little all over the place. Which is funny, because usually political comics are so bash you over the head simplistic that they aren't thought provoking or interesting. Basically boomer humor.	<p>Does the term “slippery slope” still mean what it used to, or does your lot only use that term for non-mask wearers?

Most of those jobs are part time. If someone is putting in 40 hours of labor for anything, they should be paid a living wage because it’s unreasonable to expect anyone putting in full time hours to have more time to work another job to support themselves	I'm against min wage increases because those positions are for those still dependent on others for their primary means to live, ie: high school kids.

I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court." Biden especially at his age probably has his cabinet taking the reigns moreso than others.  Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.  Unless of course you are saying that simply because he's a democrat, in which case I would ask that you try to be a little more open minded, as the dismissal of others simply due to political affiliation isn't really helping anyone.	Biden might not be Trump in his mannerisms, but he also gets a lot of help from the media to ignore the fact that he's really NOT a nice person. I mean for goodness sake there are plenty of times where he blew up on reporters and voters for asking questions he didn't like, where he said he wished he could punch Trump in the face, ""race shamed"" black people for even thinking about not voting for him, etc... the guy is no peach either.	0.564
Sure.  If you want to get aggressive about it, I'd like to hear your interpretation.	Sure. I'll send links to readings on the subject.	0.471
I would hope that everything else should be assumed with a supreme court candidate.

With things like inflation and the rise of cost of living, rising healthcare costs, rising housing costs, stagnant wages, plenty of people are working 40 hours and not making living wages.

So are you so am I right in that the message is  "if you want free healthcare, you'll get communism instead and you won't get what you want" or something similar?

Unless the intent is to day "you'll turn on it too," but the asking of the question it makes them sound like they're still hoping for it.   The face, doesn't match the stereotype and the comment, which makes me feel like this is poorly executed, unless I'm completely missing something here.	<p>Seems like it works though for both sides to scream their one word to instill fear, “communism” or “racism.” I guess then I don’t find much fault in saying it’s all communism, even if it isn’t.</p>	0.489

I mean... they support people being forced to take medicine they don't need. They loudly cheer when the unvaccinated die from Covid.

It's really not that much of a stretch, tbh.	<p>Do I think they will try and exclude people who do not take the vaccine from normal life? Yes. The comparison to Nazis isn’t about concentration camps and ish like that but rather it’s more about how the Nazis literally punished people for being different.

Well sure, it wasn't a universal security measure , it was a deterrent against assassination plots.

Slightly different responses are acceptable if you encounter a person mid-rape vs being told a person raped someone.   I think we can all agree on that.

Go ahead, downvote this, but I'm a  member of this sub and Anti Work. If people want to go on strike or complain about their shitty work conditions they should be free to do so (America is a free country isn't that the point of America?). The real problem in the country is corporate communism, paying Elon 7k a car, billions to shitty corrupt banks, endless wars, etc etc etc.   &#x200B;  If you think that a bunch of inraged taco bell employees are the problem you are either the owner of that franchise or delusional.	<p>Just one anecdote: there used to be a chrysler factory  outside of St. Louis when I moved to the area 15-ish years ago.  One day the UAW went on strike and shuttered the factory.  The local radio station interviewed one of the picketers who, I kid you not, stated they were on strike for &quot;job security.&quot;  Imagine... walking off the job for job security.  Assinine.  Anyhow, a few months later, the factory closed for good, and all of those jobs the factory supported, both indirectly and directly, were wiped out.  I&#39;m told the factory was relocated to Mexico, but who knows.  These days, I often think about Mr. Striking For Job Security and if he realizes the irony of it all.  I also wonder about all the other people whose livlihoods were lost because of him and those who thought like him.  Such is the price of union avarice.</p>	0.521

Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare.

Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.

I read this whole thread waiting for someone to state these important obvious facts.    You’re the only one that did.

Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.

It is going into a few pockets mainly. This is the problem with how our system works. We permit companies to bid on projects and then the government selects a winner and pays them the agreed contract rate. We end up with companies charging millions of dollars to do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work, and then, we run out of money before we can possibly maintain everything properly.	And because a system such as this incentivizes the employees of the target project to request more funds the longer the project goes on, ie: road construction or climate panels or welfare, generally the initial costs estimated are a small fraction of what the entire project ended up costing, whether or not it met its intended goals.	0.51

Expect act 77 was passed by general assembly and signed into law and not by executive fiat as you say. And it expanded and protected voting rights, not narrowed them like a poll tax would. Doesn’t the ideal democratic republic have every single eligible cast a vote.

And all this is ignoring the fact that this ruling will likely be overturned in time and the law probably will stand.	<p><em>That litigation seeks to have Act 77, the bill that created mail-in voting in Pennsylvania, declared unconstitutional under the state constitution, which according to plaintiffs, requires changes to voting to be an amendment to the state’s constitution.</em></p>	0.504

According to [this website](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/) only 64% of the population has received both vaccines.  And even if it were 75%, 5% of the us is like 16Million people. That’s over twice as much as the entire population of Denmark.   So with all that being said, I do think that the 5% would make a difference, even if everyone in the US was making a wholehearted attempt to follow guidelines, which we know isn’t true even with the fully vaccinated and boosted people.	<p>At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days (Fig. 1). In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people. Notably, Israel with over 60% of their population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID-19 cases per 1 million people in the last 7 days. The lack of a meaningful association between percentage population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases is further exemplified, for instance, by comparison of Iceland and Portugal. Both countries have over 75% of their population fully vaccinated and have more COVID-19 cases per 1 million people than countries such as Vietnam and South Africa that have around 10% of their population fully vaccinated.</p>	0.709

Do you honestly think people are going to get one vaccine and not the other? We both know that extra 5% won’t matter to you. Then you will start whining about why the other 20% didn’t get it even though in the real world it is impossible to ever vaccinate 100% of the population	<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it.

So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way. If they get sick and die, that’s their problem, not yours. </p>	0.729

Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few. He also expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. These are all things that all Republicans and even many Democrats vehemently attack.      Eisenhower was not an outlier among Republicans. Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards. These are all things we now deem "liberal," or "socialist," but they were widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike only a couple of decades ago.	Republicans act like they're the party of law and order and the for the people yet give the people nothing basically in their deals for stimulus checks or extra unemployment benefits. They do nothing in terms of fixing the low income problems of America and prefer if everything would just stay in the 1980s when they first started there terms.	0.574
You are mixing two different stories.     There was a pipe burst @ 6am in the morning, it was taken care of in a couple of hours.     @ 11pm opening the envelopes stopped, which observers are supposed to be there for.  Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.  Zero impact on races. Look at the fraudulent elector scam with forged documents, getting zero news coverage by right-leaning news sources.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots. If you couldn't or can't see and acknowledge that fact that was noted even before the election occurred, then your reaction to this issue is obviously based purely on the election results and your feelings about them.	0.677

Your first four paragraphs apply equally to folk on the right.   Politics is largely a construct of the leadership class designed to keep everyone else entrapped in an “us vs them” war while the leaders control things.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.

You are no harm to any one. At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated.

Sure you can, you just have to be willing to pay the price when some lib puke DA calls it an accusation instead of a rape and charges you for defending the girl from an ongoing criminal sexual assault.     "At the time of his death, Quintanilla had an arrest warrant out for continuous sexual abuse of a different child and assault family violence, police said."	It’s interesting that TX SB8 171.208(j) provides that charges cannot be brought BY a rapist, but there isn’t anything in there specifically spelling out that a pregnancy due to rape/incest/assault is specifically excluded from charges. At least, I couldn’t find it. There are specific exclusions for medical emergencies.	0.511

That’s pretty tame for US voting districts. Sure, 10 and 11 are a bit strange, but that can be explained away as a population density thing combined with an already difficult border with Jersey. The rest of this map actually looks really sensible to me, much better than a lot of Republican-proposed maps in Texas and Louisiana over the years.   Calling this gerrymandering is like calling a small jog sprinting. I don’t care what your political beliefs are, calling this gerrymandering whilst ignoring the absolutely abysmal state of the Texan voting district maps over the past few decades is just plain wilful ignorance.	<p>As for gerrymandering, that&#39;s been going on since state legislatures have been drawing district lines.

As a society have acknowledged the fact that males have high testosterone levels,  and women have low levels.  This leads to different mindsets around sex. Generally women want a commitment and love when have sex. Men are just happy to have sex.  Since girl students are not going to get commitment and love we see that they have been taken advantage of.  The boy student got sex so good for him.  If the male student were younger that would be different.  I'm not saying it is ok,  but that is why people respond the way they do.	<p>By that logic, they don’t care about teachers having sex with students as long as it isn’t at school?</p>	0.588

Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with an adult male having sex with a 13 year old female. *If the female is of reproductive age, and is willing, its just nature.*   Chimps, our closest relative, often give birth to their first baby at the age of 13-14, orangutans are generally 13-15. They have a similar life expectancy to us, if we ignore modern medicine. We have decided as a culture that this is not allowed, and there are good reasons for it, and I am in no way advocating for sex with minors. To say however that it is fundamentally wrong is just incorrect.	<p>That makes it sound less bad than it is.  &quot;Sex crimes with minor&quot; can mean that a 17 year old prostitute lied to you about their age; what this dude is accused of is having &quot;joint training sessions&quot; with a 9 yo, a 14 yo, and their mother at the same time, while also trying to bring other children into it.</p>	0.532

Okay. Where exactly do you draw the line? 2010? 1980? Surely somewhere after 1965, right? After all, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party, **and** the pro-Jim Crow party?

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead.   :heart:️Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate :heart:️. This also is for these provincial leaders	<p>Trudeau is so out of touch he has no idea what’s about to happen.</p>	0.564

Aight I’m convinced you’re a troll because after looking at even a bit of your profile you’re not Christian at all, but I’ll humor you. All of the members of Sabbath grew up and remain religious, mostly part of the Anglican Church, but their lead lyricist, Geezer Butler, is catholic.

That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	>providing birth control to women at no cost substantially reduces unplanned pregnancies and cuts abortion rates by a range of 62 to 78 percent compared to the national rate.	0.729

Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.	<p>While 5 million or 50 million dying to COVID in the US is an obscene exaggeration on your part, those are reasonable numbers if you&#39;re talking about lives ruined by the irrational lockdowns.</p>	0.682

A few things about that. The mortality in those over 80 is close to 90% (although probably old numbers). So ignore those people. The rest of the us populace is fine right? Well 70+ % are overweight or obese, which is an extremely compounding risk factor for a number of reasons. So ignore those people right? Add all of the other chronic conditions that exist in the us and you're left with a small percent of the population that actually doesn't have risk factors for covid. And guess what? **it's a virus that we have (had) a vaccine for. ** It's miraculous that we could have developed it so quickly, but that's what happens when there's money to be made (capitalism) and the whole human populace is facing the same challenge.	0.612
I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	<p>“The explanation is new, too: instead of the traditional link between poverty and crime, this crime wave has more to do with policy. Virtually all the cities with the most notable crime outbreaks — San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles — are places with progressive prosecutors working to limit punishments for looters, organised thieves and the unruly, occasionally violent, homeless. The cities, with the exception of Los Angeles, are also among the whitest in the U.S., with a large population of educated people.”</p>	0.597

Based on Haynes v US (1968, US Supreme Court) a felon/prohibited possessor can’t be required to register a firearm as that would violate his 5th amendment right against self-incrimination.  As this law would require such a person to report to a government entity (schools) that they are violating the law, it can’t be enforced against a prohibited possessor.  Tag u/GLFR_59 for awarness	<p>Not to mention the gun community already has self regulation. Any firearms vender can deny you a sale for any reason they deem fit.

I don't make money from the vaccine in any capacity. My concern about this is a pharmacist for my patients and my pay doesn't go up or down a single cent with sales from medication.  It's honestly insulting that you think my concern for people suffering from the vaccine is from monetary gain and not from genuine concern.	So in shirt of an ultimately way too long response, you should get the vaccine regardless of whether or not you have ""natural immunity"". (Un/)forunately, the freedoms granted to us by this country allow the individual to decide. Now are there restrictions, well yes, but ultimately if you don't want the vaccine, no one is putting a gun to your head like *other* countries. However, the free market also dictates that companies are allowed to require you to have the vaccine as a term of employment (for the reasons above, but mostly due to cost and liability). As a result, the market *has* dictated that requiring the vaccine is the best financial move. If you don't agree with that, you're more than welcome to form a competitor.	0.693

i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence. If you are being bullied and stand up for yourself , you get in trouble. If you get bullied and ask the school for help, their response is you need to learn to deal with it-no support, no trouble for the bully, nothing. So they create an incubator for pain and suffering with zero way out (if you were treated this badly at work you would quit, but it's not legal to do that with school). Then they're all surprised that the kid freaks out and shoots the place up.

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take “global perspectives,” which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn’t have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who’s a minority or has a “unique world view” (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I’m mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn’t speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it’s a threat - including stuff like “global perspectives” classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn’t have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn’t need any video/audio evidence of it and I’m a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	<p>If you want to talk about real policy that harms Asian-Americans, then let&#39;s talk about affirmative action, and how that leftist policy discriminates against Asians when it comes to acceptance into universities.</p>	0.486

Some people want to see what the long term effects, if any, there are from anything they take. These people are not anti vax, but get labeled as such just because they&#39;re even the slightest bit skeptical about something that was rushed. Likely, it&#39;ll be fine, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to wait until the final authorization. Especially if the government wants to mandate it.</p>	0.695

They are.. i own a glock 17 gen 5 moa and it came with 3 magazines that hold up to 16 rounds each . Which is kinda to low in my opinion.  I looked it up and you can get 50 round drum mags for glocks…  Thing is not that democrats care about our safety, it takes more than one shot to put down a potential threat.  Say some one breaks into my home with the intent to harm my family , if i manage to not miss my first few shots due to adrenaline dump and i hit my target, unless its a headshot then one or two hits wont always stop a person… this is why you hear from the left that “so and so cop shot a guy 7 to 8 times” well thats because they keep shooting till the threat is neutralized.  People who don’t own guns i think do not understand that one bullet is not enough to stop a threat. And im willing to bet part of that is thanks to movies.	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok.

Page 23 paraphrased to:  &#x200B;  In particular, vaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, the envelope of the virus, which is a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people. In the long term, the vaccinated are far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein, even if they have already been infected and cured once or more.    The unvaccinated, on the other hand, will gain lasting (if not permanent) immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being naturally infected with it even once.

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   “You only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.” Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let’s be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao’s China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	<p>Communism is out there. It can&#39;t be bargained with. It can&#39;t be reasoned with. It doesn&#39;t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.</p>	0.6

Abortion wouldn't be as common if "pro-life" advocates instead advocated for universal health care, universal free access to birth control, and sex education in every school, but if Republican politicians actually supported that they'd lose single-issue voters so it will never happen. The Republican Party has no real platform and has completely succumb to Trumpism which is little more than a cult of personality around a failed elitist millionaire who doesn't care about anyone who isn't currently kissing his ass. Critical Race Theory hasn't ever been taught in elementary schools.

Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).

Something that has bothered me since becoming a parent is this:  Gotta watch everything you but on the baby from sunscreen to fabrics because they're system is so new and sensitive they could have reactions. Same with medicine. There are stuff like all natural drops and Tylenol that isn't recommended until so many months in.  But, let me shot em up 32 (I can't remember the actual number but I'm probably not far off) times in their first year with a chemical cocktail.  All my kids are fully immunized but I just think it's odd the level of inconsistency. Couldn't we wait a bit? Maybe a year or two? We already have herd immunity and likelihood of infection at their age is so low.  I dunno, it just smells like a dock in here.	<li><p>Children need to be exposed to germs and common  illnesses around them to help build up their immune systems. If they are always masked or kept home all the time and not going out and doing things, they are losing valuable time to build up their immunity to common illness that are usually not life threatening to people who have been exposed to them when younger.</p></li>	0.625
I don’t take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being “retarded” ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I’m proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity. I do wish you the best in life.	You should always take an active role in your child's education. It's some of the most important shit growing up but everyone treated it as 'their little break from their kids' for so long we weren't considering the damage it could do. I'm hoping that we can really get to the bottom of our shit school system as a whole with this divide but I digress.	0.526

The Olympic as a whole is a joke. You don’t even have to compete for your own country anymore. The Chinese team is hockey team is made up of Americans, Canadians and a Russian.   Why would I support something making millions of dollars for the country that let a virus escape their lab, not ask for help, blamed Americans for starting, and shut down the world for two years.	<p>The League is definitely not thrilled at players going to Beijing though. If they test positive then they have to quarantine for up to <del>90 days</del> 5 weeks (unless they can test negative twice, but sometimes tests keep coming back positive after prior infections). For players whose teams don’t really have a chance at a medal (USA, Canada, Russia, and maybe Finland and Sweden), that’s a huge risk (plus the risk of injury) for very little gain. The NHL is trying to further dissuade participation by not paying players quarantined in China. It would be spectacular if a US/Canada-based group organized a competing hockey tournament here to avoid those restrictions and got the monopoly on NHL talent, which would drive people towards that and legitimize it while giving China and the IOC the farce of an Olympics they deserve.</p>	0.67

Seems like it's written by a leftist. I don't boycott anything....Olympics isn't about politics. And the current US Government, Big Tech, mainstream media and deep State is way worse than China and  Russia combined. Give me more Putin and Xi and less AOC and Nancy Pelosi.

There is zero proof that China is committing genocide and Uyghurs are being used by the US state dept as geopolitical pawns. The USA gives direct financial support to ETIM in an effort to destabilize and balkanize China.  I bet most of the people here haven't even read the primary sources behind the claims of genocide. They are backed up by "eyewitness testimony" that cannot be independently verified and that's literally it. It's WMDs in Iraq all over again.

This guy is being an ass for the sake of being an ass.  He doesn't have to swim on the girls team, he could easily swim on the men's team. Everyone shaves their legs and pits regardless. The only difference is that on the women's team he is ranked number one and on the men's team he is over 400.  To me, that makes his motivation clear - he wants to win, regardless of the damage he does to the sport or the collateral damage to the women swimmers.  It's a selfish act and it's shameful.	<p>Why does anyone care what anyone does so long as they are not hurting anyone else?

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband’s current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn’t still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband’s tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.	She (like so many other career politicians) has only appeared to support President Trump while it helped her career.

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	<p>This is the space democrats have occupied since the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s. Anyone who disagreed with them about anything was a racist. And they did it because as a tactic, it worked.

I don’t agree. And honestly you missed the second part of my comment which was even the praise is on outward appearances. Good, smart women are being whittled down to how clean and pretty they look. Most girls that are pretty know it and would much rather have a compliment that praises their intelligence.  So that being said, I think we agree that it doesn’t take 1,000,000 to praise or insult somebody. Good roasts are concise. And cartoons are lazy and hyperbolic. And hyperboles are weak.  If you have to be creative to deliver a burn then you’ve already lost.	<p>Not everything is worth learning about. Part of intelligence is knowing how best to apply your energy.

There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why? Because at that point, there might only be a few white supremacists, but 1 is too many.  If you see a group of 10 people, and 1 of them is dressed like a nazi and no one is kicking that person out, or telling them to at the very least fuck off, there is a group of 10 nazis.   This last paragraph gives a glimpse into how the rest of the world sees canada right now. A convoy of misled truckers and racists standing outside our capitol demanding federal government change provincial restrictions.   Oh wait, their second group of hooligans are at the Couts, AB border crossing essentially demanding all the MPs to leave the cabinet or else they'll continue to disrupt 44 million in trade per day. Sounds a little bit like domestic terrorism, but I'd have to read up on some Canadian domestic terrorism laws to be safe.   And FYI the city police have estimated the rally to be between 7,000 and 15,000 protesters at its peak. While that is the first ten of thousands, it is not tens of thousands.   Reddit will rake you hard over the coals if you come to a debate without clear data and posting conjecture (black supremacists) and opinion (fox News, extremely right wing, they wouldn't give 2 positive minutes to BLM)  If I were you, I'd stop. You look foolish.	But after seeing what&#39;s happening in Canada here, cops bullying small businesses, attacking protestors, and  arresting people for the most idiotic reasons. it&#39;s disgusting.

I fought for this country and for what it used to stand for. Now I&#39;m looking around and I see people like you who are so presumptuous. Not all conservatives are &quot;Trumpers.&quot; I voted for him because I saw what Biden and Obama did when they were in charge and I compared that to what Trump did the last 4 years.

That's what is sad in our age. Revolution like the ones we can read in our history book can't never happen again. So there's no scenario in which we can take up arms and win - the result would be the total opposite.

Their democracy lasted for almost as long as ours now, couple of centuries, before falling into totalitarism because of social and economical issues that plagued the world at that time. It is the cycle of life and I can't see how it is possible to escape it.	<p>You can&#39;t overthrow democratic governments and install fascists and not be surprised when the people oppressed by the fascist powers fight back against the supporters of said tyranny.</p>	0.567

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'

Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	<p>I wrote a scholarly inquiry paper regarding mask use in healthcare settings. Definitely found that medical grade surgical masks and N95s were somewhat effective at preventing staff and patients from becoming sick. There was some overlap in my research with cloth face coverings, and those pretty much showed massive in efficiency at stopping particle penetration, though there was a decent amount of discrepancy between studies.</p>	0.761

... I'm failing to see where I remotely suggest this. To make it clear, I want historical facts to be taught. Nothing more. As conservatives, we need to teach our history because it contains our past failings and successes. So in the future we pass policies that have historically worked, and don't pass policies that have historically failed.  I'm simply here to gain more information about this subject, I'm not suggesting some stupid anti-white sentiment.	<p>And the lack of history class diving into John Lockes work, Adam Smiths work, Thomas Jeffersons writings, the federalist papers, and even Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s &quot; True Americanism&quot; is where a more patriotic history curriculum is needed.

I have yet to see verifiable evidence of any Uyghurs being abused.  Much like previous hoaxes created by the US government, such as the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and chemical attacks in Syria, the Uyghur allegations look like misinformation designed to demonize China.	Now we look at China, and see that in recent years before 2017 there were around 200+ reported domestic terror attacks on innocent Chinese racing from mass stabbings to car bombings. All of which carried out by the East Turkic Islamic movement, a recognized terror group operating out of Xinjiang consisting mostly of Uighers. So the Chinese government instituted what it thought was necessary to protect the people, and it worked. Since 2017 there is no reported mass terror attacks on Chinese soil.	0.555

“Obvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities”  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.  Conservatives want a strong leader who will do what’s right for the country without engaging in inflammatory, childish attacks and furthering the divide in this country. We need a presidential candidate who can have honor, dignity, and class. Trump unfortunately does not possess those qualities and never will.   Yes I voted for him in 2020. No I will not vote for him again.	<p>Show me proof of widespread voter fraud. You know how I know? In order for it to matter you would need thousands of votes. Let&#39;s say you buy 1000 votes. People go in, sign as someone else, and vote. If only 20% of the actual people go in to vote and see someone already signed their name that&#39;s 200 people complaining and then there&#39;s an investigation and the perpetrators are caught. But that&#39;s not happening. If there were fraud we would have 100% uncovered it in this last election. But we didn&#39;t. So if we aren&#39;t worried about fraud what&#39;s the motive to put this barrier in place to vote?</p>	0.671
You wanna hear some real stupidity? People commenting things like “stupidity knows no bounds” in a conservative sub when you’ll go to a dem sub and see the exact same comments there. If you picked 10 random comments in both subs and got rid of the obvious words that’d give it away, no one would be able to accurately say which sub the comments came from because they’re all the same comments.   C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb” C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb”  Back and forth forever and ever.   Politics are fucking stupid.   Another thing that drives me nuts is when I see “they’re hypocrites!” I see the same comment in both subs. And the funny thing is THEY’RE BOTH RIGHT AT ALL TIMES BUT NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHEN THEY DO IT! “Well, we’re being hypocrites right now because they’re hypocrites” but they were hypocrites because the other side was hypocritical and so on forever and ever and ever.   It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don’t actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	<p>I mean, honest question, not trying to be a dick, how is it possible that this hypocrisy is not apparent to you or literally every other conservative who is commenting here? </p>	0.565

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.  I honestly do advocate for state's rights, but some things NEED to be looked at from a top-down view (from fed government) to determine the minimal amount of work needed for the success of the country as a whole.	I support government aid for Kentucky. Disaster relief should be a part of the government's job, in my opinion, as events like this can be better handled by larger logistical operations who can pull from multiple states, as opposed to a single state's responsibility.	0.553

Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated. The government should be responsible for allowing a cost-free path to the middle class, because:  1. That increases the country's worker output 2. Increases tax revenue 3. Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth. If we keep going this route, people will need to be housed by their jobs, and that's just the start of it. We're quickly approaching the endgame here.	<p>Destroying the middle class is the real goal. It’s where most of the policies will be aimed, just watch.</p>	0.635

Sooooo you just want the same thing we have now. Which sucks. Healthcare costs are huge because administrative fat cats take a huge chunk of the change. And they do that while doing very little themselves. Literally welfare kings. And you're fighting for them, which makes me very sad. I know a few international doctors, and I ask them the reality of US healthcare, and they back up this claim - a lot of our healthcare costs go to millionaire administrative folks that would rather pull the plug on someone without insurance than help them out.	<p>To me when I think of wealthy in the healthcare industry, I think of private coverage being the golden ticket because I am hands on in the system and I know how the corruption truly works. This is where my argument comes from with people at the poor/poverty levels not having the same privilege to quality healthcare, which in turn could lead to a shorter life span as opposed to those who have access to better care from their private healthcare options. The US healthcare system thrives off of capital. There are pros and cons to it, but the way I see this is as a major downside. There has to be a better way to offer equality in healthcare to all, regardless of Medicare Medicaid or Private insurance status.  I am not necessarily in agreement with a single payer Medicare for All option in America. I think our system is too far established and reliant on capital to be fully funded by the federal government and tax payer money. The amount of money people would need to be taxed to cover the expenses of the multi-billion dollar healthcare industry that this country has built and established… would leave the middle class broke.</p>	0.655

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	What happens next? Colleges have an endless supply of students with endless amounts of federally guaranteed loan money. Banks take on no risk, so they lend to anyone willing to apply for them. Colleges create more and more coursework and degrees that don’t lead to jobs, and worse yet, they indoctrinate entire generations to believe they need a degree to get ahead in life. Tuition skyrockets, student loan debt soars, all because we decided to take away the free market forces that kept college affordable (pre-1965) in the first place.	0.77
I keep talking to people saying the same thing about federal politicians being corrupt. Of course they're corrupt, people don't pay attention to elections. Our government structure is relatively good, and our representation is relatively fair, so we have the ability to elect good politicians. But a lot of people just don't care, which is one issue. Another issue is too much corporate money in politics, obviously.  And it sounds like your solution is to burn it all down and start new... How about we start electing good politicians that pass policies we want like universal health care?	Your response to corrupt politicians is “oh well” then vote in more corrupt politicians.	0.585

What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water. The healthier they, the more they can work. And citizens who know their government has their backs are more likely to be happy, and provide more output.   That said, I'd probably just model it after Canada's or Germany's system. They have proven to be robust, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.	<li><p>Health insurance tied to employmen....Now this one is a real mixed bag for me. On the plus side for universal Healthcare I think it would be hugely helpful so that people could make career changes or take risks with opportunities. I have one in particular that could potentially make me a millionaire if it worked out but in doing so my wife and child would be without health insurance. That&#39;s not a risk I&#39;m willing to take. On the same token, I like the idea of those who are working and contributing to society being the ones to stay healthy so they can continue to do so while those who are a drain on society don&#39;t get to be a drain on Healthcare as well </p>	0.669

According to his old profile Dave Zegarac is a far left, violent, extremist associated with antifa types.   https://web.archive.org/web/20210905065814/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave\_Zegarac   "His song lyrics deal primarily with anarchist politics.\[3\] Zegarac is an outspoken vegan and long time Anti-racist activist." -- antifa terrorist they should edit this to be.

Government should be there to push citizens in the right direction to get the most efficiency out of them, which involves responsibility over health, because individuals are pretty terrible at maintaining their own health.

While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	If it wasn't for those things, I'd be actually torn between which US party aligns the best with my European views. But the fact that these things are political, and that the Republicans are the ones who have issues with everything I just mentioned, makes me a communist I guess.	0.638

Much better than forcing them to work by tying healthcare to work, right? Generally speaking, government policies are made with citizen efficiency in mind, and that's very true for our current situation. Except it's worse than my suggestion. Forcing productivity out of citizens using fear is no way to govern. Currently a person's savings can completely deplete due to a freak health accident.

I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.	Conservatism is usually about solving your own problems and not relying on others.

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	The problem, as I see it, is if we discriminate to be &quot;fair,&quot; what is the point at we have &quot;achieved true fairness?&quot; How is that measured, and by whom? Are diversity offices going to just give up their jobs, and agree that they have counter-discriminated to the correct point that their jobs and salaries and political influence are no longer needed?  That&#39;s when we tend to see people &quot;find&quot; new problems.	0.567

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.  It will act the way it does, and the results will follow.	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane. Let me guess, you’d welcome treating the common flu like we currently treat COVID, right?</p>	0.715

Yeah it has really gone downhill, but what's scarier is the amount of so called science being politicized	Psuedo science is politically driven with the illusion of being science (without following the scientific method).

 The study contained multiple methodological flaws that call the reliability of its conclusions into question. For example, there are indications that many people assigned to the ivermectin treatment group didn’t take the drug consistently, or stopped taking it after a while. It is therefore unclear whether any observed effect in this group can be reliably attributed to ivermectin treatment.	<p>I&#39;m not familiar with the study you&#39;re referring to but I&#39;ll look at it if/when you get a chance to link it. My anecdotal experience:  early in the pandemic HCQ, zinc, azithromycin were used concurrently in India, that was not supported by science. Misinformation runs rampant there too, and they were desperate to try it all, including stuff like ivermectin. I got all kinds of conflicting info about treatments from my physician contacts there but nothing suggested that any of this worked.</p>	0.63
This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.   And idk what you mean by massively devaluing college degrees... Just by forgiving loans doesn't mean the education is worth any less.	What happens next? Colleges have an endless supply of students with endless amounts of federally guaranteed loan money. Banks take on no risk, so they lend to anyone willing to apply for them. Colleges create more and more coursework and degrees that don’t lead to jobs, and worse yet, they indoctrinate entire generations to believe they need a degree to get ahead in life. Tuition skyrockets, student loan debt soars, all because we decided to take away the free market forces that kept college affordable (pre-1965) in the first place.	0.749

Meanwhile if you were to add up the total amount of deaths through religion, whether it's being a martyr to being persecuted for your religion, it adds up to ~200 million. So by your logic all religion- whether it be Christianity, Catholicism, Islamic, and all other religions are terrible to the point that if you mention God or have a cross on your wall it's akin to heiling Hitler and hanging a swastika on your wall.   We can add up how many people have died for or been killed by America over the course of two world wars in the name of preserving our American capitalistic values and freedoms and guess what that number would be? 100 million. So now again, with your logic, American Capitalistism also falls under the category of being classified as a bad word.

While I agree with you on some of that (the dems have lost their minds). Republicans have made plenty of errors as well.

Wait, I think I get it now. I'm sorry it took me awhile but I definitely thought about your comment so much more than you did.

If you ask someone a question *solely* because of what you ***think*** their name means, but your belief of what their name means is inaccurate, your question is no longer valid because the assumption that prompted it is not valid.   &#x200B;  At least... that's *my* take on it. If you disagree with my take, that's fine! It's America and you're free to disagree with whatever you want. You can't change the meaning of deflect though, so you may want to find a new favorite word.	There was no deflection.  It was a direct refutation of the point you attempted to make.	0.486

>Now who doesn't know how they generate revenue?  You, dipshit. Because you've consistently missed EVERY single factor here while babbling about subscriptions; which would be one thing if you were correct, but you weren't even correct about THAT. He retains 11 million listeners per episode. Spotify now has a metric they can measure value to as opposed to just "People like music". ONE GUY keeps 11 million people paying 10 bucks a month. He paid for himself in under a month.  Then you have the free accounts, who have to listen to ads, but still listen to Rogan. Do I need to explain advertising dollars to you? Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game. Joe Rogan, from all conceivable angles, is literally spotifys most valuable asset.  Meanwhile, you're talking about fucking subscriptions amd doubling down on trying to say a **market share valuation doesnt mean anything** like you know a THING of what you're talking about.  Fucking goon.	Read again. I never stated this leap of judgement as you're suggesting it to be.

A. Listeners are not subscribers.  Since you're so fixated on their revenue...where they get most of their revenue are from ads, not subscribers.    B.  You said they got 5 Billion in revenue from announcing him.  They did not.  Market valuation is not revenue.  I didn't say market share valuation means nothing.  Not even remotely close did I say that.  I said that's not 5 Billion in revenue...because it isn't.   C. Spotify has been in the podcast game for a very long time.  Their biggest leap actually happened when they grabbed The Ringer.  D. You getting angry over you misunderstanding the difference between market valuation and revenue is not only funny, but proves the point I was making.   Once again...I'm not saying losing Rogan would be good for them. I'm saying it wouldn't be this massive hit a certain brand of people, such as yourself, would believe it is.	Read again.

So these are the same dads that say they'll "kill a man" if their daughters get touched but as soon as the daughter is 18 and they have been raped, the dads just mutter "personal responsibility" as they pass out from their 5th beer while still wearing mud on their camo overalls.	I'd find that notion a lot easier to swallow if it wasn't an area with a hell of a lot of false accusations.

Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	<p>Why does anyone care what anyone does so long as they are not hurting anyone else?

They negotiated themselves into lower pay.   Their initial contract offer was the same as the men's. They renegotiated it to have a lower bonus for winning but a higher guarantee. They also negotiated non-monetary benefits into the contract which was offset by a lower cash payout.

Just got over being sick with covid despite being vaccinated. My unvaccinated wife was not significantly more sick.  Leftoids: stop fucking pushing this nonsense. This vaccine WILL NOT eradicate covid, nor will the next one, or the next after that. The only thing it will do is keep *some* people out of the hospital who might have a severe case. You can still get it, you can still spread it, you can still die from it. Stop buying this bullshit that unvaccinated people are a threat and are standing against this fantastical "end of covid" fantasy you have.	Let’s keep thinking here.  If you get the vaccine you can still get and spread Covid.	0.721

I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	Just like salem.	0.514

Yes. I recently watched an interview of this trans (f-m) Ugandan LGBTQ advocate who faced off against a baffled moderator and a local pastor. The pastor sounded like a condescending,  hostile nutjob while the activist, who explained she was just advocating for "human rights," was so polite and patient that she started to made so much sense. I had to stop and remind myself that just because she seems like a very nice, decent person and just because the pastor is a total maniac, that doesn't mean she represents the right side of the debate. It almost got me.	You reduced people down to sir/mam, and countering people who only believe in two genders is a major part of trans advocacy.

I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..   Some of the toughest, kindest family oriented people.  One woman legally got into the United States left her children in Honduras and for the next 8 years saved every fucking penny she could raising 60k and getting her children into the states just so they could work in motels cleaning up after people that have no respect, accuse them of being illegal.   I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump... Is a criminal that has admitted multiple times he wants to fuck his daughter, he lies, he belittles everyone, he doesn't pay his taxes, he's stuck up... Does that man look like someone who's bled red for his country... This is the mother fucker who built a casino called it the Taj Mahal Trump and went bankrupt his daddy had to bail him out. He has terrible ideas when it comes to investment. Remember this.. He's doesn't give a fuck about anyone. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION... HE LIKES YOUR FUCKING MONEY.   Wake up.   Joe Biden is gross to, he's boring and old and gets nothing done. Our political system is failing on BOTH sides.   The dems and reps of this country need to stop fighting each other and figure it out. The whole world is watching us and laughing. We are getting dicked.   The fuck are you worrying about a wall for... Look at the inside of your country. It's falling apart, people are working they're asses off for nothing, poor health and a population and next generation of lost and confused kids because we can't grow the fuck up.   Our grandparents despite the differences would have set aside our opinions and picked this shit up. We made it through the civil Rights movement, we made it through war.. We made it.   White, black, brown, yellow... We're all American.   Stop being racist... Stop listening to fox News.. In fact turn of your fucking tv and go talk to someone in real life. Go walk around your neighborhood. Have a BBQ at the park and invite random people to eat. Do something to connect with people around you.   Fuck.	<p>Also, these people tend to do jobs neither of us want to do.  I think you really need to sit back and think about how stupid you are sounding.   You are acting like illegals are taking jobs that pay well and are desperately wanted.  There are so many places hiring right now... but unfortunately our own people who have ever chance to better themselves... refuse to.

Antifa was implemented and formed to stop the governments from fucking over it's citizens.   Turn of the fucking tv and actually read something or interact with a human in real life you dumb asshole.	<p>The storming of the Capitol and murder of two police officers to overturn our election was also bad, and was directly called for by our sitting president and his allies at his own rally.

If you'd actually read any of the studies or releases about the side effects, you'd know that the incidence was not statistically significantly higher than an unvaccinated population.

Tbh his communication needed some polish but, more importantly,  conservative media clockwork oranged people like you and now  his visage is carved into your reptile brain as THREAT forever.

You’re 100% correct. All my experiences with Central American immigrants have been positive. The vast majority of them are hard working family people.   It’s just become the American way to demonize and blame others for our own problems, rather than constructively work together.   Both parties have been running on the same issues for decades now. They’re in no hurry to solve them, because then what would they scream and yell about?	This notion from the left or the right, that “only my people work hard” is completely ridiculous.

Some of those people come here and are so fucking happy to be working shitty jobs that people don't want to do.. For close to nothing. They save that money and open small businesses like taco trucks, housecleaning services, landscaping services.. You know shit middle and upper class Americans love for cheap but quality.

Between punching Nazis (which I agree with) and punching racists (also, hard agree) and now punching unvaccinated, and all the other expressions of aggression and dissatisfaction.   Just make it legal.  Surely the progressives would vote on something that allows them to express their frustrations.  Some might say that this would devolve the world back to 'might is right,' where only the strongest and most violent can speak their opinion while anyone weaker lives in fear and submission.  But let's not listen to all that.	The difference with your examples and why they aren't assumed to be calls for physical violence is simple: physical violence in those situations is ridiculous or impossible.

The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.   Screw that.  So yes, the masks are harmful.	Masks now are sort of like the controlled burns to help bring wildfires under control.

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	<p>My main point was to the dude saying Covid is only the sniffles. My hospital has 550 rooms and the census was 607 the other day and it&#39;s all Covid patients. I dont think the sniffles would cause that. Again, fuck mandates, and fuck government encroachment, but let&#39;s not pretend this thing is totally benign because it isn&#39;t.

I'm only speaking from a us type beat to clarify because I have no clue what's up with other countries typically, and I haven't actively watched the news of UK to see what's going on there, but the last time i remember things being closed in the us was when we were meant to quarantine until the virus was gone which was entirely ignored for the most part (even by elected officials) and things were closed then I won't argue there.	<p>Still, they are rethinking lowering the quarantine period to 5 days, because people are swarming ER&#39;s and are completely flooding the Covid hotline.

The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb 😁😁😁  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am 😈 Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years. It's a shame, because I don't see it turning around this time.	<p>The most frustrating part of BLM and &#39;defund the police&#39; is it has put departments on the defensive, causing them to close ranks and often pull back from the most agitated communities. This is a big part of why violent crime is exploding. No officer wants to be the next guy that politicians and the MSM are calling to be charged with murder cause they see someone acting suspiciously, the suspect pulls a knife, and the cop shot them. Additionally, it has completely drowned out any conversation about reform efforts that are actually needed, such as increased training/education, or meaningfully eliminating behavior like cops looking the other way for cops+friends of cops who are caught in low level offenses.</p>	0.716

The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	Vaccine = reliant on just the spike protein.	0.739

Facts	Edit: so much for “truth” and “facts,” lol	0.591
I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don’t know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn’t tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don’t think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that’s not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don’t know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It’s also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we’ve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn’t be. This is concerning. Perhaps something similar is happening with the heart too, but so far I haven’t seen it.	Vaccine = reliant on just the spike protein.	0.65

Certainly won’t trust you on this.  You do realize that monoclonal antibodies is more experimental than the vaccine right?

Is it a fair critique to argue they’re being overly cautious and that their approach has downsides? Absolutely. But if you want to be honest on the topic, you need to also consider there are genuine arguments for still pushing for vaccinating those with natural immunity, and reasonable people can have different conclusions.	0.674

That actually is one of the methods for more developed fetuses	The current, and somewhat recent, veneration of abortion as a moral virtue and the outright denial of the humanity of the baby has erased the ability to have an actual conversation on the subject, intentionally so. Our understanding of fetal development allows babies born as early as 22 weeks to be fully viable. We can now literally see into the womb and see a tiny human with its own digestive system, with eyes that move, its gender, or it reacting to the sound of the parents voice. Advancements in technology allow us to see that a baby in the 2nd trimester isn't ""just a clump of cells"".	0.623
The fetus is not known as a baby until it is born. Also, it is not considered murder - the title is ‘child destruction’. So literally your entire statement was wrong.	A fetus is a human being at a very early stage of development. It is unique and separate from its mother while being wholly dependent on her. Giving women the “right” to murder their children is abominable, regardless of the stage of development of that child.	0.769

Yup and the right wanted to be able to hit protestors with their cars if they block the road back during the oil pipeline and BLM protests.

Freedom prevails!	<p>I completely agree that it was pathetic how politicians endorsed and excused the rioters last year who didn’t give two shits avoid protesting but just wanted free shit and to destroy stuff.

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.	<p>I get where people are coming from, but i think it&#39;s only because it wasn&#39;t successful. People tend to think &quot;well those idiots wouldn&#39;t win anyway&quot; which is probably the majority of level headed republican/conservatives. My issue is they came with intent and people died because of that intent. Whereas if you compare it to BLM protests that turn into riots you it quite literally isn&#39;t the same.</p>	0.552

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	BLM and Antifa riots,	0.627

So if BLM rioters are criminals and everyone also associated with them are also just as guilty does that mean you also consider January 6th rioters just as bad and all the people "cheering them on" would also be bad people too right?

I actually don't know your opinion on Jan 6th but if you agree with me on this then you are at least being consistent with your opinions. If you do agree with that then I would concede my BLM points here.	I think anyone who riots should be punished the same. I'm not mad that they are going after the Jan 6th people I'm mad they aren't going after the BLM rioters as hard.

> expert  *J. Alex Halderman professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where he is also director of the Center for Computer Security & Society.*  *After the 2016 United States presidential election, computer scientists, including Halderman, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly, while Clinton won New Hampshire and Maine narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome.*  *On 21 June 2017, Halderman testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.The hearing, titled "Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election" focused on the federal government's role in safeguarding U.S. elections from outside interference.*  *Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Halderman stated that a software glitch during the unofficial vote tally was not caused by fraud, but rather by human error...*  ...*and said the conspiracy theory that a supercomputer was used to switch votes from Trump to Biden was "nonsense".*	<p>Third, the issue with Trump&#39;s claims that votes randomly appeared was explained by the machines having issues which were corrected. Votes were updated in clusters. Trump had bumps of votes, too. It wasn&#39;t just Biden that had 90,000 random votes found for him. More people just happened to vote for Biden in a democratic county.

Lefty Reddit subs like r/politics were foaming at the mouth as usual. Saying the exact same shit. They locked the comments and prevented future discussion as soon as it was released that it was a Black BLM Leader and the farthest thing from a far-right extremist, lol. The same thing has happened DOZENS of times. The media picks up a story hoping to spread this message that white people are committing acts of violence at significantly higher rates only to quickly drop the story when it is found to be a Muslim Extremist or some other extremist group. They don’t even have the mental maturity to apologize and learn from their mistakes. They just start twitching and drooling, waiting to get triggered like the unemployed zombies they are.	<p>You are demonstrating that leftists continue to not have any standards at all when it comes to this stuff.

True, but who was the last real well meaning, honest, republican official see anywhere near the oval office? When was the last democrat? Each side is so vile towards the other that they're bringing out the worst of one another. America's 4 year presidential election is a total farce and its only propagated through media blinding everyone else to the fact that our government needs reformation and every year we wait is furthering us towards the path of actual civil war. If not some disgusting capitalist dystopian reality where 90% of the population will suffer to pamper the top 10%	Hmm that’s weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes.

What actions did you take in this protest, and how did the mayor and police respond?	<p>In fact, if you watch the videos from the day, this is clear. People were milling about in the Capital, and many ended up in there simply because they happened to be in the front of the protest and got pushed in by the crowd. People clearly did not know how to react or what to do, so most simply milled about. A small number (within the small number that actually entered the Capital to begin with) took the opportunity to cause damage to the building, steal property from offices, or (maybe - there is literally zero proof this was the case but it is implied) search for Congressmen/Senators for Nefarious reasons.</p>	0.636

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	If youve ever been banned on one of these lefty subs  for making a neutral or questioning comment, you would realize that they have to stamp out anything that doesnt cater to their ideology.	0.552

The liberals are infiltrating the GOP to bring it down from the INSIDE to make Republicans LOOK stupid but actually they're the good guys and Trump will ride an eagle and save America from the gays and the foreigners to a better oil filled, gun toting future!!! YEEEEHAAAAAWWWWW MAGA!!!!!!!! #JESUSSAVES	But just as with gun control the Democrats can't leave well enough alone. They already are winning and as demographics go with middle class adults retiring out of state they are likely to continue to control politics.

A small percentage with no power can still be a threat.  Big picture, they don't have the power to make a real difference.  Small picture, they're terrorizing people who have nothing to do with the decisions being made. If they were sitting on parliament hill not disrupting everyone else's lives, I guarantee there would be way less resistance.  Personally, I wouldn't care if they weren't blocking a border or terrorizing people who didn't make the decision.	<p>Beyond the facts though, the fact that conservatives are trying so hard to undermine the fears felt by politicians in the area that day is very concerning. We had an armed insurrection take place in our Capitol, in which multiple people died and there is evidence that more were in imminent danger. Our politicians, especially vocal ones on the left, have a very good reason to be afraid of the far right, which has moved from vocal opposition to violent opposition. AOC&#39;s fear is founded, and to undermine her legitimate feeling of fear while people tried to kill her coworkers in the building next door is ridiculous.</p>	0.51

Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	<p>Get the fuck out of here with that revisionist bullshit. Go watch the video of his whole speech on Jan 6, go look at an archive of Trumps tweets after the election. He didn’t say he barely won, he talked about hundreds of thousands (!!!!) of fake/fraudulent/whatever votes and there is still no evidence of even 10! Then he told people to come to DC for a protest and that “it will be wild”. He lied out his ass, whipped a mob into a frenzy, then told them to walk down the street to “stop the steal”. One of the single worst acts by any president in the history of the country - actively attempting to thwart the results of an election using lies and a mob. Un-fucking-forgiveable.</p>	0.574
