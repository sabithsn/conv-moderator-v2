>Vaccine mandates are not "backed by science"  You still have not admitted this was the most retarded thing to say, which was the only reason I ever bothered to try to educate you. You asking retarded questions to try to start new arguments is a fucking \*chef's kiss\* michelin star plate of stupid.  >BuT WhAt If YoU oPpoSe KiLiing HaWaaiiinns  Do you fucking read what you type before posting?	Most people do not think Bodily Autonomy is absolute in matters not relating to abortion. See Vaccine mandates for a pretty vivid illustration of that! Hell, last time I had this argument it was all going the _other_ way - people thought I was stirring shit up because surely nobody would _ever_ argue that bodily autonomy was absolute..! Of course, that was in a vaccine related thread.	0.862

EDIT: These conversations basically go ""Oh just because you saw it doesn't mean anything! It's fringe extremists!"" But I guess saying ""Well I never saw this, that must mean it doesn't exist!"" is the preferred viewpoint, for some reason. Look how fabulously that's worked out for everyone! If I don't see it it's not real. If you think glamorizing obesity is a fringe Tumblr movement then congrats on never going outside or interacting with the world except through Reddit I guess."	0.857

Final point: At no point EVER have I thought that getting vaccinated against COVID would make it impossible for me to get COVID. I never even felt like anybody with any authority or knowledge was trying to convince me otherwise. I have genuinely no idea where you got the idea that vaccine effectiveness was 100%, because it was always exceedingly clear to me that it was a preventative measure that was not 100%, but *was* helpful.	0.854

Saying that people who chose to not take a vaccine ""refused"" it implies that it was always treated as a demand and not an offer for which one could make a voluntary, individual decision. Many of us saw a situation which was presented as Scenario A, the carrot, while the writing was on the wall that Scenario B, the stick, was likely to be the final implementation. It was never a free choice.	0.853
And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren’t willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid. Not sure we have anything left to discuss here.	I am often told that I must change my ontology because it hurts some people's feelings.  But I am incapable of changing it for that reason.  I can only change it if I am persuaded by logical argument that my ontology is incorrect.	0.913

No. I'm the type of person that desires to understand the words I use. If you want to provide a different alternative definition, I welcome it. But I can't simply ""cater"" to someone, because doing so most likely harms another. In this case, myself. It pains me to do something I don't understand. And I dislike the ""culture"" that would have me pressuring others to do the same. That to me it would be harm toward others. So I'm basically asking why people aren't recognizing the harm upon me to make me do something I'm uncomfortable in doing.	0.908

You mention politely convincing with the Socratic method. Logical extreme: I am polite I am respectfully asking questions , but I have no interest in changing my own opinion. My curiosity is not to find a deeper truth so I can see what you see (even if we choose to disagree) and you can see what I see, etc, I’m just continuing to search for what will make you agree with me. Now I feel I’m arguing in good faith, I’m polite. You accuse me of sealioning. You aren’t wrong, but I feel like you are just using the word to dismiss my quite frankly watertight case. Did you not realise how good I am at showing the flaws in your reasoning? Sure I’ve been called out as “sealioning” before, but that guy was definitely using the term in bad faith as I was merely inquiring as to some of the subtler details of his initial proposal when he tried to shutdown my line of questioning with an irrational accusation of “sealioning”. And so it is that you accuse me of sealioning or rather you think about calling me out on it, but you don’t want to use the term, because you’ve seen it used in bad faith and you have to admit I stayed calm and politely asked my questions, politely reframed your answers because you were so obviously wrong and I didn’t have to give any ground because you were so much less right than me and that is why you eventually let it drop because you realised I had bested you in the ancient art of debate and that is how you let me think I had changed your mind to my bigoted racist opinion... for shame... you disgust me."	0.872

Would you rather me call you a sad and pathetic adult? Regardless I think it's clear you have issues to work on. It may be a good idea to address your anger issues before it gets you into trouble.	<p>Rather than lose control of your anger, you should <em>use</em> your anger as an informative and instructive emotion to alert you to potentially being taken advantage of or betrayed.

Would you rather me call you a sad and pathetic adult? Regardless I think it's clear you have issues to work on. It may be a good idea to address your anger issues before it gets you into trouble.	You'll have to think about what is the worst scenario that might happen and then decide, is it worth it?

Would you rather me call you a sad and pathetic adult? Regardless I think it's clear you have issues to work on. It may be a good idea to address your anger issues before it gets you into trouble.	<p>While this is specifically about fear, the same principal applies to any powerful negative emotion. Letting go of anger isn&#39;t about rejecting your anger, it&#39;s actually about the radical acceptance of it - but in order to accept your anger fully and let it go, you need to see what the anger you feel is trying to tell you instead of acting on the emotion without examination. </p>	0.865

You're still comparing apples to oranges. The people in the wiki like are victims of a cultural practice where the perpetrators are getting away with it, because it's not a ""crime"".

My experience tells me otherwise. If you take a quick look at my history, you can see that I've gotten a lot of hate when I point the double standards out. Even got banned from a subreddit where I was having a similar discussion with a woman. My whole stance was that women had privileges too, not just men. Who had it harder? There's no black and white answer to that. What's the accurate way to measure that? Considering how society fails to realise the legitimacy/severity of men's issues even to this day, it's going to be hard to calculate who's had it harder. The woman called me sexist for saying that, and started throwing insults. I did the same. And then I got banned and she didn't."	0.855

I'm a trans woman & I transitioned after college, so I grew up hearing that all the time, especially in hyper-feminist spaces.  I know several people who literally didn't trust me as a person until they found out I'm *not* a man.  Like that's patronizing & offensive.  Nothing about me changed, simply their perception of me.  Or 2 winters ago my car died & I needed someone to help jump start my car but women refused to help on the basis that they couldn't trust that I as a man wasn't using it as a ploy to hurt them.	0.853

Not to be TMI, I was once on my period for an entire month, and consistently having to change 7/8 times a day and I was in agonising pain all the time, work doesn’t take me seriously, uni doesn’t take me seriously, infact no one really gives a shit and just expect women to get on like men do. If you are not a woman, I don’t think you should be arguing about how we express our emotions on our period. It’s quite literally incomprehensible for men to understand. It’s a very valid reason to be emotional and if you don’t understand this when you begin dating women, you shouldn’t be dating women. Bleeding involuntarily and legitimately suffering when you have no choice is a very very very valid reason to be upset. Yes some girls don’t apologise for their behaviour, but most of us do. And we shouldn’t need to anyway. Unless it’s extreme. Your saying that you have ADHD but can’t sympathise with Menstruation which is also not a choice and can severely impact your mental health.	0.851

Another reason your argument is such an outlier is because you yourself are such an outlier:  people like you who think it's okay to fire people for the color of their skin or because they won't give you a handjob are very, very rare in society and it makes sense they have a hard time relating to others."	0.881
It's such a small % that actually get offended, and in most of these cases, the one offended isn't even part of the "appropriated group"; but rather, acting on their behalf.   I think the entire outrage stems from sensationalism of media, and making clicks for $$$.   The people that "ban" the expression of cultures are likely afraid of media backlash.	I don't believe that's why legislation becomes less popular. If you see people from your side and your favorite news channel shit on a bill constantly, it obviously becomes a lot less popular. The idea that if you give a lot of dishonest people a lot of time to lie about a bill will make it less popular is not a valid reason to give a lot of dishonest people more time to lie about a bill."	0.879

Like, I'm sorry, but communities _are allowed to have rules_. I've been banned from lots of forums, largely for breaking their rules, and you know what? I may think that those rules are bullshit (if you're going to allow fascists to blatantly and repeatedly lie in bad faith but will punish anyone who points out this dynamic, _your rules are bullshit_), but it was not a violation of my free speech, any more than it would have been if I had been banned for posting gore and shock images in every thread.

A troll is just a person who tries to get you all angry and emotional- for the sake of anger and emotionality. There is no special ""recognition"" skill required in most cases. The whole ""trolls everywhere"" is also used as a tool of political demagoguery- you just call your oponent a ""russian troll/chinese troll/whatever"", and disregard all his data- even if, especially if, his data is more valid than yours, and even if he was much more polite than you.	0.857

Fighting people deserve rights to not be held responsible for any damage they cause to other people when they say stupid shit.	- I have no idea what awful things you can think about but that are 'filthy' and 'without discernible outward harm' yet need to be stopped. This is mostly what I meant was unlikely to be popular with most people. They may or may not like shaming others for their dirty secrets but they certainly don't want theirs in danger of being exposed, let alone those that don't harm anyone. This could ruin many people's lives (many of them in power), which they would never allow. And so it would just ruin the lives of those without power, that they want to punish instead.	0.886

We have a small sample size of 4 quarters (and a sample size of 1 season for seasonal businesses). We have a long way to go. People just got their 2nd round of stimulus checks. The fear is that when you take the foot off the gas that the economy will start to unravel. And when interest rates are low and QE and stimulus is high, you don&#39;t have many more tools in the toolbox to stimulate the economy. All our cards are on the table. So I think it&#39;s best to wait and see how this all plays out before we declare victory.</p>	0.841

I know this because I've been in transition since 2009 and back then nobody knew anything about us and there were genuinely only like three websites about transgenderism. And as someone who saw this erupt from the inside, it's been fascinating to observe. Take the archetypal issue: ""bathroom bills"" - I've been peeing in women's bathrooms since I looked female in 2011, and so did my trans friends, so why are we talking about it? Because the right-wing propaganda machine got routed after same-sex marriage passed and the sky didn't actually fall, so it figured bleating about ""men in women's bathrooms"" would rile the base easier. And then, true to the concept of enantiodromia, the mainstream establishment liberal crowd noticed the right was doing this and decided to jump in it from the left to cash in on the identity politics game. Game, set, match.	0.833

If her body wants to die, why not let her family make that choice legally. At that point its not even assisted &quot;suicide&quot;, its allowing life to takes its natural course. When our family finally got permission to change her care, she dies within a day. Imagine how long she had been eady to go for?!?! She suffered unimaginably... she was once found by my aunt in agony (but has lost her speech by then). Xrays revealed a crush injury in her hips that could only have been caused by falling or being dropped. The doctors said that even she fell, she would not have been able to crawl into bed... so obviously the orderlies just tried to cover it up. </p>	0.832

I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	<li><p>even if they did do it the way they did to help small states, there&#39;s a big difference between that, and saying this was a big part of the electoral college&#39;s design.

The other is a half-second prick that you probably won&#39;t even notice, is very unlikely to hurt you in any way, and will increase both your own likelihood and that of literally everyone that you will ever come in contact with of not contracting Covid-19. </p>	0.812

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism.

Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	In terms of the police, they are human. People make mistakes. Police are ridiculed, insulted and they are quitting in high numbers. Those three days of riots had every cop working almost 24/7. They had a precinct burned down by protestors and they had objects thrown at them such as bricks, pee and bottles. I do believe in reform, but abolishing is a dumb idea with no plan, which puts a bunch of elected politicians with no experience in charge. In terms of police shootings by MPS, most have been cleared with the exception of Nour. If you want to break it down look at Chicago, Louisville or New York."	0.882

What a load of propaganda.   ‘Israel is the only democracy…. Bla bla bla….’  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.   As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.

You could argue about the borders that were set, but that 1/3 of the population was there already so there were really only a few options. You could try to leave the region as some kind of non state protectorate which no one wanted. You could try to create a single state under area majority rule, which at that point would have by almost 2/3 majority driven the resident Jews, many of whom were Born there, out of the country.

None of that is evidence of genetic superiority or anything similar. African countries are **among** the poorest nations due to the colonial exploitation and violent reshaping of natural borders. Black people in Africa are also the majority of doctors, engineers and researchers. In other words, the proportionality of ""races"" in a nation are no indication of genetic predisposition.

Racial slurs are not merely mean things to call someone, they're so abhorrent because of their subtextual meaning. White people have never, will never, be subjugated on the basis of being ""fragile"". Me calling you fragile, while maybe hurting your feelings, isn't harkening for a time when society viewed you as inherently lesser. Me calling you fragile isn't a threat.

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>I hate that &quot;recreational drug use&quot; exists. I&#39;ve literally only ever had caffeine and alcohol myself, and I genuinely worry what will happen if I ever end up in hospital and get over medicated. But without recreational use of drugs and people prepared to experiment through history, many of the medical use drugs we have now would never have been discovered. </p>	0.889

Remember - you can be physically and/or psychologically addicted. People will always say that weed isn't addictive which isn't entirely true. You may not suffer the same kind of physical symptoms of withdrawal but you'll definitely feel it psychologically. I honestly didn't think it was addictive until I saw someone that was basically high 24/7 when he couldn't get weed for a week. It wasn't pretty.	0.886

I&#39;m certain that most of those people don&#39;t <em>want</em> to be addicted to drugs, but that&#39;s not what your brain does when it&#39;s addicted to a substance. You can want to stop but be fully unable to. It requires an incredible amount of willpower and support to stop drugs.

I’m sorry you went through that. No jokes here - sexual abuse impacts on men, and enforced penetration is as serious as rape.   I hope you get some closure, therapy, and justice.	Next comes the issue of culture.  It's very clear that there is a culture of rape.  Similar to what I wrote in that other response, we normalize rapist behavior (that is, behavior that isn't rape but if not addressed and singled out as bad, can lead to rape).  We bend over backwards to excuse rapists, and rely on almost a ""boys will be boys"" mindset if it's male rapists, (or outright say it's just not possible if it's a female rapist).  The thing is, if it's true that men are simply naturally inclined to rape, *then men shouldn't be allowed outside without supervision*, and if they aren't naturally inclined to rape, *then we should be focusing on what social factors create such a gender disparity in rape*.  When we look at burglaries, they are most often tied to economics.  That is, the more income inequality that exists, the more economic uncertainty a community faces, the more likely people are to turn to burglary.  To be frank, the people who say that ""watch your drink"" and ""use a buddy system"" are victim blaming are the same kinds of people who want to eliminate economic inequality, to get at the core issues of burglaries.	0.883

There&#39;s an inherent double think - I notice far too often that the same people that insist America is great also want to make it great again. Which means it&#39;s not great? So don&#39;t counter them by saying it sucks. Counter by telling them it could be even better. Universal healthcare is the best example I know. We could have it. And it would be cheaper than our current system, while being available to everyone. The only reason we don&#39;t have it now is because of this brainwashing around &#39;individual responsibility&#39; - this idea that if you fall on hard times, it must be your fault.

My point in this second argument is that often people's positions are less poorly justified than you might think, because the justification they choose is rather dishonest (but also not technically a lie). In reality, most people already have a good understanding of their place in the economy. People understand what they buy, what goes into that, how it affects them. People understand their job, who buys from them, what makes it more successful, and what makes it less so. Moreover, most people only really care that much about themselves, so most people, I would say, probably know if healthcare or the minimum wage is good for them in particular, it's just that economists *might* have the best ability to know if it's good for everyone. The honest sources of people's opinions are usually justified, it's typically the convenient ways they choose to sell them that are poorly justified."	0.825

Of course the sloganeering would have you believe that all rape victims have the latter experience, which is silly, but it's equally silly to say that none of them do.

False rape accusations are extremely rare AND some of them DO get prosecuted.

And the issue here isn&#39;t so much to avoid rape. Rape, at least legally in the UK, is a standard whereby no reasonable person could have believed that they had consent. Reasonableness is a cultural standard, and is evolving, but even so definitionally you are being unreasonable in thinking you might have consent if rape is even in the picture. No one should be anywhere near that end of the scale, and no reasonable person could be - again by definition. But that&#39;s not the real issue, the real issue is avoiding bad sex, sex you or the other person regrets afterwards, and sex which while it might fall a long way short of the legal standard of rape is still sex that you did for reasons other because you were really really into the idea. </p>	0.871

There’s a lot of information about how curse words actually help you with different situations- it’s worth a read if you’re ever bored, you should definitely look it up. I know if you hurt yourself and you use curse words in response it actually takes your kind away from the pain and helps. And also, the fact that it helps convey the emotions you’re feeling. It’s been awhile since I read up on it, but I know there was some really interesting stuff I never realized. Highly recommend learning more about cursing and the benefits etc</p>	0.744

Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	The difference is that the greater fool isn't necessarily the Redditor. GME was shorted over 100% of its shares. That means that those short sellers increased the supply of GME stocks, and when their options expire, they are required to buy the shares back from the market to ""reset"". So, people are buying up all the shares, counting on the fact that there is a guaranteed ""greater fool"" because the hedge funds are required to take that position. This is only this much of an issue because of the fact that hedge funds took a huge risk shorting this stock this much.	0.888

This isn’t a view you should want changed, the man is a MONSTER who told his wife to “not be so emotional” after their infant son DIED	<p>I realize why. Its because it upsets you. And I don&#39;t blame it for upsetting you, you have a right to feel your anger over this situation. But again I don&#39;t have a reason to cater to your feelings, and I don&#39;t think you know what your father actually wants here. I don&#39;t think you <em>can</em> know what he wants because as unfortunate as it is, he is dead. If his ghost were to tell you that he wants you to move on would you then think differently? Or is this on a different sort of principle? A principle of honor that your father might not even share with you. Regardless, you can&#39;t know for certain if this is something born of your own hate or if it is something born of your father&#39;s will. Either way, I can see how this is holding you down. The injustice here is how much its locked you up in your own feelings and I can empathize with that more than you might realize. </p>	0.871

Elon Musk sold off a lot of Tesla stock in the days before Tesla recalled nearly a half million cars. If that’s not the hallmark of a hero, I don’t know what is.   Edit: *insider trading* autocorrected to *a hero*	<p>It seems to me you still don&#39;t understand how stocks work either. Admittedly, plenty of people <em>buying</em> stocks have the same misunderstanding which leads to many bad investments. Tesla <em>produces</em> things which have value. When you buy Tesla stock you own a portion of the capital and assets belonging to Tesla which are used to generate revenue. You are entitled to a portion of it&#39;s profits/retained earnings. If the price of a stock I bought drops I care only in so much as it represents a drop in the value of the company I own. If I own a company and the price drops because nobody else wants to buy it but it still produces goods and generates revenue and I feel it will continue to do so, I do not give a damn about the price. </p>	0.82

Mr Richie Rich is likely paying more than his fair share of income taxes (Given that your Tesla owning demographic (5%ers - 0.1%ers) are the most heavily taxed in the nation)</p>	0.804

What all of this indicates is that the assumptions your presumed likelihood of nonhuman intelligence responsible for UFOs is predicated on is itself excessively myopic. And presumes civilization and social structures too closely aligned with human expectations and we ourselves have experience with. Energy and material needs wouldn&#39;t change. But all other assumptions that align with planet based civilizations are beyond suspect. To the point of being even less likely that a nonhuman intelligence responsible for UFOs.</p>	0.865

Things in this universe tend to severely outrange and outspeed anything in the 40K universe. Because 40K would lose any interest if things happended on that realistic scale where you don't even see your opponents. 40K needs close ""looking in the white of the eyes"" engagements for its tone to shine but that kind of thing is when you think about it terribly stupid. 40K authors aren't really interested about what it means in terms of scale and physics to be able to travel through space. They know their setting is goofy and close range epic and that's all that is important here.	0.852

If we go around believing that The Borg cannot possibly beam through our shields because the Klingons and the Romulans can't...  Oh holy shit The Borg just beamed through our shields like they weren't there.  What we've created is not a *rule* but an *assumption*.  It isn't that the authors just decided to lazily give them that ability so that eggheaded fans can complain.  It is because what we thought to be a law of the universe can be shattered by someone or something with an even more advanced understanding of our shields than we do.  So the real rule isn't, ""its impossible to beam through shields"", the real rule is that the shields have weaknesses that were unanticipated and are currently unknown that can allow others to still gain entry.

Getting to Mars would allow him to establish a monopoly on Mars rocks or whatever, but maybe I&#39;m projecting Jeff Bezos&#39; desire to expand his empire and put workers into space to him (at least the water bottles his employees will be peeing in is in zero-gravity, so thanks I guess?). Either way, the point stands that these people don&#39;t care about any societal or collective good, they just care about themselves.</p>	0.85

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he’s going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of “richest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone”	So what you're doing is saying that the team below Musk did all the technical/manual work so Musk deserves none of the credit. This truly isn't fair to Musk or anyone who's started/managed the company. Supposedly he's been somewhat involved in the actual design of the rockets but for the sake of the argument, lets assume that he has 0 contribution. Musk's largest contributions aren't technical. That doesn't mean his contributions aren't significant or Meaningful.	0.887

That money didn't come from the employees at all. Look at Amazon: they don't even make a profit off of the operations that involve employees.	0.879

Tesla was very wealthy compared to an average person. The fact that he never became a billionaire had more to do with the fact that he had no interest in business and personal wealth. And not because people were not trying to pay him for his incredible inventions.</p>	0.864

For example, Elon Musk isn't an engineer and doesn't do any engineering work. The fact that you've called him a ""genius"" at engineering is almost entirely due to hype and personal branding, and in reality makes as little sense as saying that Jeff Bezos is the world's greatest server architect because he owns AWS. I'm not going to say Musk is bad at personal branding, but it's clearly and obviously the case that his skill at personal branding is getting him undue praise as an engineering genius and that accolades like ""real life Tony Stark"" are an extension of that branding."	0.863

You mentioned somewhere else that nobody makes it on their own and you are *100% correct.* But it's deeper than just their origins. You can overcome your origins, though most people stay exactly where they are born. Every successful business owner will claim that they built their business all on their own, but that is short-sighted and presumptuous. If they own a storefront - they didn't build the roads their customers drive on to get to their store. They didn't build the infrastructure that allows them to get their product on shelves. They didn't build the banking system that lets them accept payment. All of this infrastructure was built by society, by *us*. It is part of the deal you get to live in that society: You use this infrastructure, you get to do business, you pay taxes to help us maintain it. Every company and fortune out there was built on this infrastructure and used it before they could afford to pay back enough in taxes to no longer be subsidized by society.	0.862

When I was on vacation in the summertime visiting my nana and pop, various other family members in the uK as a adolescent - the sun Page 3 girl was quite the story to tell my friends when I got home.	It’s much easier to go calling everyone else racist then to actually do something. I raised money for the Equal Justice Initiative last summer in the wake of George Floyd. I didn’t just post a black square and pat myself of the back for being woke. I, like one of my favorite women in history (Elizabeth Pankhurst) believe in deeds not words. I do a lot of volunteer work, at my local homeless shelter, animal shelter, food pantry, women’s shelter, and other organizations. I play with the kids at a disadvantaged school in my city while their parents are taking English classes. I also enjoy working at this community farm located in the middle of a food desert (about 30 minutes south of where I live.) And yet, some woman on tiktok who doesn’t even know me attacked me for listening to jazz music. She said I am stealing from black culture. And she’s not even black. She’s also in her late twenties, whereas I’m only 17, so it was a little scary to be canceled by her. I blocked her and somehow she found my Instagram, and I blocked her again.	0.713

Men should sexualise women because that's what women are meant to be - sexy. The whole point of a woman is to attract a man so they can reproduce. How? By being sexy.	I'm sorry how is a man disrespectful for doing what a person wants? Women wants recognition that she's sexy, and men just acts on it.	0.888

She wants to be recognised as sexy, the man recognises her sexiness, then suddenly she doesn&#39;t want that. He did what she wants, but then he was blamed. Ironic, don&#39;t you think? </p>	0.873
Men should sexualise women because that's what women are meant to be - sexy. The whole point of a woman is to attract a man so they can reproduce. How? By being sexy.	Consider for example a very attractive young woman. Regardless of how vulnerable she may or may not be, her interactions with men are going to be filtered through a layer of sexual energy. Whether it's sinister or totally benign, men will alter their behaviour around her because of the feelings her sexuality can produce in them.	0.859
I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society). Sure, gender might be important to you, but what will that bring in the end. Ask yourself that.	<p>I feel like this is under-estimated when discussing attraction and intimacy between cis and trans people. It may not be true in all cases, but I&#39;d say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a <strong>subconscious</strong> role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don&#39;t think people are actively saying “I could never date someone who was infertile!” — rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it&#39;s true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it&#39;s rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it&#39;s immediately a given for trans women.</p>	0.862

I feel like I cant win perfectly no matter what so this works if not perfectly and it does make things easier so I admit I dont particularly want to stop. If its truly horrible to do and I can have my mind changed here I will but remembering as many pronouns and with whom they associate as I need to has gotten to still be a pain so that doesn&#39;t solve that issue especially  among people whom I otherwise am not around unless in a friend group while its harder for those I dont care for or particularly about much beyond being a fellow person. Family and close friends have not been a issue and have been great mostly about understanding my issues pronouncing..... But Its all to easy to look a ass when I accidentally mix them up outside those areas. Ive just found it easier to refer to them as they and them as its easier than remembering ___ goes by ____ and other coworker ___ goes by ___ and ___ while ___ goes by a similar pronoun to ___  its pronounced differently as ___ instead. And if you mix any up pronouns up with the wrong person after so long it&#39;s been all to easy to just be labeled a jerk and genderphobic even when Im trying....</p>	0.845

It's a little bit of an [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) issue, where the regulars are sick to death of seeing these anti-trans threads, but the people posting them are posting them for the first time. And they do lead to people being educated and changing their minds. So how do we balance the potential good of giving people opportunities to overcome their biases and misconceptions against the potential harm of giving people with no intention of changing their views chances to soapbox?	0.834

It is extremely painful for men, and we all have had the feeling of going up to a woman, who happens to have friends around, and they all laugh at you, as if they would ever date you.

I used to hear all the time that ""men are visual creatures"" and in general, I think that's true. But like... I'm super visual when it comes to sexual attraction. I've dated men and women of all different races, body types, intelligence levels. I was attracted to all of them for different reasons. And I wanted different things at different ages.	0.818

I&#39;ve been in America my whole life and I&#39;ve seen where the racism comes from. It&#39;s not just something flowing from the bottom up, and most white people flat out don&#39;t even realize how good they have it compared to other people not only globally but in America itself. We have this thing where we make all problems broad to seem as if they primarily affect white people, then the government primarily only helps white people. Happened with affirmative action, happens every year with various types of welfare (look up welfare spending in white areas vs black areas - it&#39;s a doozy).

So, you're saying that people are willing to throw away the rational arguments against racism if they know that other people are having racist thoughts that they suppress? To me this is an extremely dangerous situation. We keep the racism in check just by people that have racist thoughts pretending they don't have racist thoughts. We may end up in an explosive situation where a small openly racist sparkle triggers a huge number of people becoming openly racists. People who we didn't even know were racists.	0.9

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	The logical conclusion of your ""we need to be breaking down stereotypes"" logic is that ""the rules"" should be just as strictly enforced, except, opposite. Wearing women's clothes because you are a woman and want to dress like a woman is bad and reinforcing stereotypes. Presumably, just as much for cis- as well as trans women. So the only people who should dress like women are men, who ought to do it not to feel like women, but to feel no particular way at all, I guess. Therefore the only ""correct"" way to dress is as the opposite gender that you identify as, but not because you associate those items with the opposite gender, that would be bad."	0.92

Your worldview saying you can't call trans women women being a reason against trans women being women is circular reasoning, as it is you who is making the personal distinction of 'well this is what I think a woman is'. By understanding gender and queer theory, as defined in psychology and sociology, we can understand people and classify people in a much more productive way, as accepting trans people as the gender they identify with is beneficial to them. *And* having expectations of men and women on the lines of sex and gender is harmful from the start.

The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	<p>Also, isn&#39;t it capitalism that supports slavery? I think we both agree that sweatshops are basic child slavery? Under capitalism we simply agree to overlook sweatshops, because we don&#39;t want to pay too much for a tshirt.or a phone, or computer, or the cobalt in out batteries. Child labour, and sex trafficking are all at the hands of capitalism. It&#39;s all done to make more money.</p>	0.885

So especially in her early material that exaggeration didn't go anywhere, it's jackass levels of comedy, but with casually racist undertones.

I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.   I see no ideological framework where the use of the word cracker is acceptable whereas the use of other racial slurs are not.	I would be on your side that we tend to label a lot of things as racist when they shouldn't, though I do not believe this has has any impact on the very real racism, and if it has any, it would be negative as it would make closet racists less able to dogwhistle to other closet racists. I don't see how it would help in any way racism.	0.887

Unless there's hard evidence that they are racist, then admitting to it is clearly not in their best interest. For example, if someone on Twitter accused Jeff Bezos of being racist with no substantial proof, and Jeff Bezos replied ""Yeah, I am. Sorry about that! I'm trying to be less racist"" that would invite more controversy and scrutiny, not less. He's now lost the benefit of the doubt and has absolutely cemented in people's minds that he's a racist. There's no benefit for him there to have done that."	0.885

Your ""racism is prejudice plus power"" definition offers literally no linguistical advantage what-so-ever. What potential advantage it could offer vanishes when the word is actually used, because everyone who says racism refers to ""systemic"" abuse keep referring to individual forms of discrimination as racism. It's not that racism refers to ""systemic"" abuse, it's that you believe systemic abuse has to exist in order for someone to be a victim of racism. These are two very different points.	0.884

The problem emerges because people include ""structural"", or ""systematic"" in their definition of racism. If we follow this definition, we can't even say calling someone the N word is racism, because it isn't systematic, its just someone who insults people. That's obviously absurd."	0.884

I don't think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn't be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can't even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc."	0.883

If you don't want to live around African Americans, I digress, but that's not the issue. It's a simplification of the fact, for people to have their desire living preference, another group of people experienced discrimination. How is that ok? Secondly, I disagree with the ladder. As I said,I don't doubt there are racist black people, just as they're is definitely black people who want to preserve their culture from ""filthy racists"".The difference is there isn't a policy that says a white person cannot go to a school of predominantly African-Americans (nor should there be). Almost all of the individual's who represent African-Americans are not trying to instate a policy where white people are discriminated against because they don't want to mix culture.	0.879

The argument you're citing doesn't say that you should treat people differently just because they're of a different race, or all the time, it only says that putting a blanket ignore on race as a factor in every possible instance is racist because that is to also ignore the situations where being treated differently based on race is justified and correct."	0.877

There is no real evidence of objective or universal morality. How do I know someone doesn't just consider trans people to be exhibiting bad morality just because they are grossed out by trans people or insecure about their own gender/sexuality?

But these kinds of prejudices tend to have dog whistles. For example, someone calling Israel or Netanyahu 'bloodthirsty' will immediately set off alarm bells in Jews whereas most gentiles won't see anything weird about it. That's because blood libel--the myth that Jews steal Christian/Muslim children to drink their blood--has been used as an excuse to murder Jews and eject them from countries for well over a thousand years, and there are still people who believe it. (Seriously: I have been asked if I drink children's blood. Unironically.) Gentiles who don't know much about antisemitism won't pick up on stuff like that, but Jews most certainly will, so it's possible for a Jew to rightfully call something antisemitic and appear to an ignorant gentile to just be shutting down conversations.	0.812

You can’t change their mind because as they said, they don’t speak for all white people. This just a dude with hot take trying to get karma.	Are you stupid? Seriously, are you? Racial slurs are not merely mean things to call someone, they're so abhorrent because of their subtextual meaning. White people have never, will never, be subjugated on the basis of being ""fragile"". Me calling you fragile, while maybe hurting your feelings, isn't harkening for a time when society viewed you as inherently lesser. Me calling you fragile isn't a threat. Ask a black man their reaction when someone calls them the N-word, if it was anyone with any power, it was probably fear. You don't feel scared when I insult you, just annoyed.	0.89

I don&#39;t have a low opinion on you but I already know you&#39;re going to try to hit me with the &quot;white people are victims of white supremacy too and they don&#39;t know it!&quot; And I just don&#39;t agree and don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get you to agree white people have purposely tanked the social safety net in America of their own free will and not because billionaires brainwashed them. I&#39;ve been in America my whole life and I&#39;ve seen where the racism comes from. It&#39;s not just something flowing from the bottom up, and most white people flat out don&#39;t even realize how good they have it compared to other people not only globally but in America itself. We have this thing where we make all problems broad to seem as if they primarily affect white people, then the government primarily only helps white people. Happened with affirmative action, happens every year with various types of welfare (look up welfare spending in white areas vs black areas - it&#39;s a doozy).

They are extremely poorly targeted and most people who have received the covid checks have not needed the money. In general you&#39;d be better off spending more on enhanced unemployment benefits, healthcare, food, and housing. Comparatively some debt forgiveness is good because a lot of people are really deeply indebted which can weigh them down for years. I agree a huge issue with these large forgiveness plans is the doctor, lawyer, mba debt. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous when these folks complain about their 100k+ debt expecting the government to pay. However average undergraduate debt is over 30k and there are millions of people with college debt who never graduated and have no way to pay their debt. That&#39;s why targeted programs in the 10-30k debt forgiveness make a lot of sense.</p>	0.879

Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.  Common phrases like "men are trash" and "kill all men" indicate that many people view men as morally inferior people.  Discrimination against men is also accepted in Modern Western Society.  I have read very many stories of male victims of Domestic Violence being arrested rather then helped.  Male offenders get [60% more time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002) for the same crime.	What I see now as opposed to growing up in the 60s n 70s is redefining terms with what seems to be intended results. We talked about racism in the past as hatred based on skin color. It&#39;s easy to see that that&#39;s ridiculous especially since the men who fought and died in ww2 were of every race. It was a beautiful thing even. All peoples came together with others to defeat the philosophy of a master race. A proud moment in american history only to be muddied upon the end of actions and return to civilian life. A very sad moment. Racism still existed we didnt learn our lesson.	0.867

Secondly, in many other cases where people complain about systemic racism being the product of intentionality (like the police for example) they are referencing literal decades of scholarship on the subject.

I’m no expert on the science after this (but [this article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/) is a great intro if you want to learn more), so I’ll just say this: gender, even at the biological level isn’t binary, so why can’t the rest of it follow suit?	0.849

I don't give a shit that you don't give a shit, cause I don't care about being called transphobe anyway. We're talking about the logical conclusion of a radical interpretation of the phrase ""transwomen are women"". You just don't believe it as radically as others do, which is a good thing. but it doesn't mean it's a minority opinion. Transpeople have been saying this for years and I've seen it said by transfolk countless times on social media. Your problem is with them, not with me.	0.844

I can see why you defending this attitude on the grounds that discussion of sensitive topics can be abused by racists made OP cry &quot;conversational totalitarianism&quot;. Hyperbolic, I would say, but not wholly wrong. If we are all bound only to use the definitions that are decided by someone else, and we are not even allowed to talk about it until we agree, that sounds totalitarian to me. I’d agree with you that the above style interaction exhausts many well intentioned people, but argue that the best solution is to keep the academic terms in their proper context and extend the benefit of the doubt to people who may not know as much as you; especially if they are somebody you are willing to talk to in the first place. Language is a democratic system, and trying to police language to the extent described burns a lot of credibility for very little gain.

So the answer is no, which is exactly what I was expecting. As I was saying, regardless of your answer, the point is things can be irrational and unexplainable and still exist objectively.

I no longer wish to continue discussing anything with someone who would be blatantly intellectually dishonest and say such disgusting things may God have mercy on whatever remains of your soul.	Your argument is based on what's called ""moral relativity"" which is often identical in practice with ""moral nihilism"". Both in practice are extreme denials of any normative ethics. No law, no justice, no kindness, no virtue, no utility, no care, no good is supported by them. There is no ""ought"". You just do what you want for whatever reasons, none of which can be said to be better or worse than another. They're a reaction to suffering in which someone denies the existence or significance of causing or being a victim of suffering by numbing themself to moral injustice. Indifference is a painkiller, and an addictive one at that. If there is no basis of moral obligation then you can't be said to have failed. You don't have to work to help or save anyone ever. Everyone else's problems are of no consequence to you and yours. If everyone disagrees then nobody is right and so you can do whatever you want whenever you want to whoever you want and no-one will be able to tell you not to since their truth and your truth are totally irreconcilable. It's as if you live in a different subjective world from everyone else with nothing in common. This is the cruel and immature logic of moral relativism and moral nihilism. It is the logic of a foolish child just as surely as that of a sociopath. It's a tragedy waiting to happen. If you worship them they will eat you alive.	0.91

No, I'm not because they are both useless and have no definition outside of vague whispy definitions that only exist to prop up arguments.

But how does that make others phobic? It's like they're forcing us to say we see something we clearly can't see and it doesn't make sense why can't you just be proud of who and what you are and quit trying to make me believe that you're something else...🤷🏼‍♂️ I don't know it just seems pointless and over complicated to me"	0.915

Transgender people change their gender roles. However doing so, doesn't actually change their gender.The problem with making such an argument is that we fundamentally disagree. You rushing to the next stage of the argument which leads us back to square one. I don't agree with you that gender is what transgender people change because I don't agree that gender roles are what define gender. Even if we assume that you're referring to gender as gender roles, I don't even agree with what you consider as a gender role. For example, In what universe is sexual attraction a gender role? What about behavior towards others? While there are some cultural and social elements at play, there are also biological aspects that influence our behavior that we can't ignore.	0.915

I refer to myself as a transsexual man because transgender doesn't fit. I'm not changing my internal sense of self, aka my gender identity. I can't change that. What I can do is change my sex characteristics to match as closely as possible to my gender identity. If I'm being honest, I can't really talk about the other side's experience because I don't understand it. What I can say is that a lot of the comments, posts, discussions, etc that I see in the general trans community don't resonate with me as a transsexual dude."	0.914

The fact that I personally do believe myself that autism isn't an excuse for crappy behavior is one of the reasons I oppose using a trans person's pronouns.

If that’s not blaming women for HIS problems I don’t know what it is, and I’m not talking about obesity and men’s attitudes towards overweight women because frankly it’s an entire different topic. I’m not negating his personal experience, what I am negating is that he has the audacity to put it on anyone else but his own shitty attitude. And if you scroll through the thread the majority of women *do not* prefer tall men. And it’s less than 50% who actually do. It’s not the women’s fault they reject men, they are allowed and if they do so because of height, they are allowed. I didn’t say he had to enthusiastically accept rejection but he should go where he’s celebrated not tolerated, including height. And if he’s consistently looking for the reasons his height isn’t good enough, he will continue to find those reasons as to why it’s not good enough and then he’ll sit in his shit for life.

[Here's](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) a page (with a link to the original study) that shows 90% of women would reject a 5'4" guy for his height. [This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	<p>What I don&#39;t get and probably will never understand Is how science is showing that trans women who were considered males before transitioning only lose up to 40% of their muscular strength... Now this is science has proven this.... There are many other key features that also can&#39;t be converted to a female if male.... That is 100% science... What I don&#39;t understand is if one states that science in conversation they are branded some kind of phobic whatever.... </p>	0.815
This is obvious to me. Everyone here who disagrees is living in a fantasy world. When all the female records are taken by trans women another tune will sound.	These bannings include entire subs made for females and lesbians, exclusively. The subs that aren't banned have become trans roleplaying. r/twoxchromosomes, you will see a prime example.	0.847

You can&#39;t create a space for an underage audience where everything goes, because that will lead to the members being insulted/confronted with super uncomfortable content, and they wouldn&#39;t even have the possibilty to complain to anyone, because the mods would be like &#39;Oh well, he told you he wants to commit suicide if you don&#39;t call him, but let&#39;s not censor him I guess, of course he will not be banned.

So as a spineless business, reddit follows. You certainly can&#39;t imagine that reddit kept any big incel subreddit while justifying the other banned subs, or without having people heavily pressuring them into doing it with online campaigns that can damage reputation. Reddit doesn&#39;t want to be associated with a group that is socially blacklisted, I can understand why although I don&#39;t agree with the censorship</p>	0.893

Only reason I say that is we know that Twitter and Facebook have users who do the same if not more  but those sites are popular so they can just go oh what we had no idea. Here ill ban 5 people of now your mad at me for banning 5 people on the right ill ban 7 on the left just to make it look like I am not taking a side. Like that stuff is all in the moment what vibe does the person doing it feel and that I would say needs to be more clear on the rules. Just because just using the wall street bets stuff they got hit for going against terms on reddit and discord no evidence was given no siting what terms were broken and how.

It is a political decision to show that they are taking the 'side effects' seriously. Teens have no known added risks compared to any other menstrual women. Men basically have no risks at all. (Allergies and immune disorders non-withstanding)."	0.842
Why even have weight classes if this is the logic.   Excluding females from male sports and vice versa is not sexist,, its common sense.	Never going to happen, especially as long as the left has a monopoly on things especially on redefining words to their liking.  I mean if you tell white people they can't be subjected to racism but only prejudice that alone makes the word less impactful and powerful.  And as long as that view is held there will never be any sort of stigma around it.  To put it another way sexual assault or sexual violence is seen as being lesser than rape and doesn't hold nearly the same stigma as rape does.	0.833
Why even have weight classes if this is the logic.   Excluding females from male sports and vice versa is not sexist,, its common sense.	That doesn't have anything to do with a patriarchy or lack of one though. It's not like the system was designed by the losers of the competition, and it certainly doesn't mean that the least successful male must be above the most successful female.	0.833
Why even have weight classes if this is the logic.   Excluding females from male sports and vice versa is not sexist,, its common sense.	You might say no to that, and you would be right. Just as you are also right that you should not be able to take performance enhancing drugs to make yourself better at your game. But people don't become transgender to make themselves better at sport, so any alleged advantage is just as incidental as someone who have good nutrition.	0.831

Thank you for taking the time and effort to explain in great detail why his position falls apart.  Like you, I do know the answer to who holds the record you mention and where her performance falls in the range of cis women performances, the record for the next older age bracket is faster than hers and was set by a cis woman. Like you, I'm not exactly worried about trans women dominating sports. I'm worried about all the voices like the individual you were replying to causing trans women to be subjected to hyper scrutiny in an attempt to tear down our validity.	The panic of trans women in right wing media is a solution in search of a problem. You almost never hear them share such *profound concern* over women's sports when they ask for more pay, or are threatened by cut funding or institutional sexism, but when *hypothetical* trans villains are at play, all of a sudden it's priority number 1. Funny that."	0.882

If we didn&#39;t there would be no top tier female athletes, period. Olympic tier men are faster and stronger than olympic tier women... this is very easily demonstrated by looking at world records for running. When trans women who transitioned after puberty compete with cis women they are at a huge advantage as their performance is on par with cis men. It threatens to make the concept of &quot;women&#39;s sports&quot; meaningless and to discourage cis women from competing in sports altogether.</p>	0.88

Bill Watterson made an excellent cartoon, and he ended it early on his own terms without ever experiencing a dip in quality. He refused to sell out by plastering the character everywhere like Peanuts, Garfield, etc. But then some fan artist drew a picture of Calvin peeing on a Ford logo, and now that's probably the most famous depiction of the character. It's completely out of line with such a great character, but most people don't know better.

I see these Texas politicians begging for help as they&#39;re moral compass temporarily turning on because helping people is the right thing to do. Even if most the time these guys do the opposite.

Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	-You’re talking of “bias,” but you’re attempting to discredit “me” based on my education background and not my “points?” Come on… We’re not “finding any evidence” here.

The definition of rape and such has changed. If you’re saying through human history then you need to consider early humans that were more animalistic and sexual selection was a lot different. As we progressed through history, child brides and dowry weddings and stuff make it hard to define rape because those things were culturally accepted and women were forced to do it, some happily and some sadly, but it was culturally accepted. Consider lifespans change so marrying a fourteen year old in 1500 was a lot different from trying to marry one now. Society does change and therefore the definition of rape slightly changed. Hardcore rape (holding someone down and penetrating them) has always been rape, but is a twenty-year-old marrying a fourteen-year-old in 1660 statutory rape?	0.838

Hardcore rape (holding someone down and penetrating them) has always been rape, but is a twenty-year-old marrying a fourteen-year-old in 1660 statutory rape?	0.838
No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	Obviously there is more nuance here. PCOS, any androgen syndrome, etc. I'm boiling it down because I'm not getting into this again. I've basically written a research paper's worth of responses to others. But people are stuck on the ""biological male stealing my poor defenseless daughter's awards!"" When being biologically male isn't even the issue. Plus they won't be content with trans women being removed from sports anyway, they'll just go for medical rights, next, (hi there, Georgia) so you have to dismantle them fully and completely. In this argument, if there isn't a medical consensus (I don't think there is, I've never heard this before today) that hormones change your sex, (not APPARENT sex, which is different) you can't win against them.	0.838

OP you shouldn't have focused on MMA fighting specifically bc now people are only stating "include weight" classes as the main solution to this. This is obviously not applicable in most other sports (like in the context of track and field sports for instance) and sports where men have biologically advantages other than just weight. I agree with you so that's all I have to say.	You can say and make an argument about being overweight is bad but, don’t use BMI has your proof because it does not take body composition in to account at all and light exercise or a thicker lower half can put you into the obese classification."	0.834

I agree with you so that's all I have to say.	I would also argue that causing harm isn't the purpose of the sport.  I know this isn't possible within the laws of nature, but if you gave all fighters the option of immediately healing their opponent to 100% health at the end of the fight, I don't think many of them would decline. They are humans, and with the odd exception I don't think they would wish permanent harm on others. The purpose is proving physical superiority to themselves and others, while harm is an unfortunate byproduct"	0.832

After all, we don't chop off sections of people's legs for being born too tall to compete fairly, do we? Why should they have to take drugs to hamper their natural condition? But then the ban was reinstated. It's a very, very complicated issue, far beyond your pithy comment. And what you are leaving out is the context that those rules and bans are directly a result of the discussion of transgender athletes."	0.823
