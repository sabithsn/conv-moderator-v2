I think NAH.  You definitely did the right thing. Becoming homeless just so one day your sister can have a house is not practical.  However I kind of get how your sister feels? It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	<p>The solution is very delicate. It&#39;s very bad for you to give her even $1 in this way, it should be because you want to, not bcs she forces you to. It impacts your growing-up process. Second, she&#39;s still your mother and you should understand her wrong way of thinking. I cannot tell you do this or this because i don&#39;t know your mother and reasons and bg etc. I hope you got my point and good luck with her!</p>	0.871

It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	I really just would have felt bad if she really lived up to her comment on not raising the kids, they would have lost both parents only to move into a home where only one of their gsurdians wanted, cared for, and loved them, and the other despised them. I don&#39;t blame her, but it wouldn&#39;t make her any less of an AH for putting them through that. It&#39;s a moot point though as it won&#39;t happen anymore anyway.</p>	0.869

It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	If she had been out when your mother passed you would have been happy to have it go to her and in the horrible event your mother didn&#39;t accept her as a woman you would have still insisted it went to your older sister out of solidarity. However! through no fault of you, your mother, or your sister the timeline just didn&#39;t work out like that and the necklace WAS given to you and now you have a sentimental attachment to it. The relationship you had with your mother as eldest daughter is something that you are sorry she cant have experienced but having the necklace is not going to replace that lost potential relationship. (Because I have a feeling that may be what this is really about?)</p>	0.866

It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	<p>That girl basically thought you were supposed to just keep taking her bs, because yall were friends. She was not a good friend or roommate. . . Her actions lead to her being in whatever position she found herself in when you broke the lease. I know that cost you money. Did she offer to pay you back? No. Did she even look at what you stood to lose or the fact that your financial reputation and future renting capabilities could be seriously effected from her behavior? No. </p>	0.866

It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	<p>While it ultimately only affects your sister, your mom made it very clear that she wanted full responsibility of your sister‚Äôs college fund. That means fully responsibility. If your dad still wanted to donate then good for him, but he is in no way entitled to especially after the daughter basically walked out of his life. </p>	0.865

NTA. Wow!! You should report her to management. Her behaviour is shocking. Firstly why on earth would she assume you are single.

Secondly, her reaction makes no sense, what you did is in no way disrespectful.	<p>You know, all we have is her version of what her husband does, and we have to take that at face value.  I&#39;ve never been a fan of the trope where the husband let&#39;s the wife do all the shopping and presents and holiday-stuff, that&#39;s not what teamwork looks like to me, you know, at this point is just sexist enough to count as misogyny.

It was tactical and he was setting the precedent for the rest of your time living together. He wanted to break you down but he didn‚Äôt count on you having the backbone to leave.	He decided to take custody of his brother without consulting you. I understand why he felt he had to do it, but he shouldn't be surprised that you have misgivings about it since this came as a surprise to you. Backing out of the agreement is fine since he already changed the terms of the agreement. Plus you would be the primary babysitter, I'm guessing since he seems to work outside the home.	0.845

YTA. It would be different if your two daughters were younger but they‚Äôre more than capable of acting independently.

AITA for telling my husband that if he loves his mom more than me he should marry her?	0.889
Reminds me of the Op who told her co worker (Was it James?) Who is a widower that he should not be wearing his wedding band because it was "misleading". Awful and cruel. Poor guy I wish I could buy him some coffee and tell him how sorry I am for his loss.  That posr triggered me and is definately a nomination for AH of the year award.	<p>And now she thinks I‚Äôm the most awful dad ever because I don‚Äôt want to take her to the store she wants to go with. And here‚Äôs the crazy part. I texted my wife this story and she said: ‚Äúit is kind of rude. Why can‚Äôt you take them somewhere they will both like?‚Äù</p>	0.883

So it's bad that me and my husband want some time with our literally girl alone? I'm not risking my child getting sick. Covid cases are high in Maryland and my kids still actually go into school/ uni. 16 kids in my 17-year-olds school had covid .	<p>Okay, so a bit of background is needed. I (M, 25) had a beautiful baby girl, Emma, when I was a teenager. I was a foster kid and have no family. Emma‚Äôs mother passed away after giving birth. When I had her, I knew I wanted to give her the world. So fast forward to 7 years later, I own my own company, work a second job as a bookkeeper, and own multiple houses I rent out for passive income. We do very well for ourselves, Emma goes to a private academy that does half days so she‚Äôs in school 8-12:15 and the rest of day she‚Äôs with me. Emma is the light of my life and has inspired everything I do. So, the dilemma is that i recently started dating (ever since starting a business I‚Äôve had many prospects but refused to be serious) and I am seeing a wonderful woman, Annie, but we recently got in a disagreement that seems to be brought up again and again. She thinks that Emma and I are too close and Emma needs a mother, siblings, and I need time away. (Emma does have many friends, she‚Äôs social, has a play group, goes to sleepovers, and is in therapy and her therapist assured me that Emma is thriving) I kind of yelled at Annie and my friends have said I‚Äôm an asshole for not taking her advice and giving Emma distance and letting Annie and I have more private time. We do things together, the three of us have been on a few trips and small weekend getaways. I was planning another small vacation for the three of us as a surprise for Annie‚Äôs birthday and when I surprised her she was upset that I included child friendly activities for Emma and that Emma was going at all. She told me she won‚Äôt go if Emma is going. We both yelled and now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm an asshole but I‚Äôm also concerned that Annie isn‚Äôt wanting Emma in our picture. (We do have dates without Emma and day activities, but no getaways as I don‚Äôt feel good about leaving my Emma alone) Am I the asshole for this?</p>	0.843

I went back to school to complete my bachelor&#39;s degree while pregnant with number two, and graduated when second baby was 1.

Both my sons are childfree and I consider these kids my grandkids. Amelia, Emma, and Henry are amazing kids. They come over to help with chores, cook with me, and are very well behaved. Erica, however, is a nightmare. Even her mom admits to not being able to control her. She and I were never close and she used to only come to my house when I&#39;d invite the family over for dinner. Then I got my dog, Bentley. Erica fell in love with him and would ask to come see him every day. I allowed her to come when I was home for a while but she started ignoring my instructions with him so I started making excuses as to why she couldn&#39;t come over. Henry and the twins were still here for hours every day. </p>	0.836
Great, my kids are almost adults who go out like covid doesn't exist. My 19-year-old doesn't even have her vaccination. Stop comparing your kids that are not even teens to my almost adults who go everywhere.	<p>But this has to be it, they don‚Äôt know how to just be support staff, and they don‚Äôt view either of their adult children as adults (I‚Äôve seen this with SIL as well). I never realized it was a control issue. That explains so much of the last year (they went from supportive and loving to...ridiculous so fast when we said we would be isolating for baby‚Äôs safety, yes even from them).</p>	0.837

First of all I am glad that in all this mess the dads are competent at least. That is awsome and well done to both your dad and Bob for doing exactly what needs to bee done.  OP you are a child, a grown child, but you mom's kid, not your mom's servant or live in nanny. Your younger siblings should have never been your responsibility and it was extremely kind if you to devote so much time in raising them. But no OP, your mom should either have a nanny or at least pay you to professionally watch them. That's time taken out of your day, studies and productive time you could spend creatively and with friends as teens should do.  Not to mention how your mom puts her boyfriend over her own child, takes away her personal space and allows said boyfriend to massively overstep here. You've been civil and way more mature than your grown ass adult mother! You did the right thing and removed yourself from an unpleasant situation.   She decided to procreate about 10+ years since she had you and she should have been mothering her own kids instead of passing that role to her teenage daughter who should be out having fun with her friends being a "stupid" teenager with nit a care in the world. You should be allowed to do mistakes at this age, explore the world, sneak a ship of beer and find that to be the coolest thing you can do, being "sooo baaaaad".

You have been VERY generous with your siblings and their kids, and VERY sensitive to the situation--hence waiting to give the Switches until after the others had left. Your brother had no right to complain about ANYthing, no business commenting on YOUR gifts to YOUR kids you paid for YOURSELF and gave to them not even in his presence, and CERTAINLY no right to bring up the fact that the kids aren&#39;t biologically yours. He needs to take several seats and be grateful he has a generous brother like you.</p>	0.903
First of all I am glad that in all this mess the dads are competent at least. That is awsome and well done to both your dad and Bob for doing exactly what needs to bee done.  OP you are a child, a grown child, but you mom's kid, not your mom's servant or live in nanny. Your younger siblings should have never been your responsibility and it was extremely kind if you to devote so much time in raising them. But no OP, your mom should either have a nanny or at least pay you to professionally watch them. That's time taken out of your day, studies and productive time you could spend creatively and with friends as teens should do.  Not to mention how your mom puts her boyfriend over her own child, takes away her personal space and allows said boyfriend to massively overstep here. You've been civil and way more mature than your grown ass adult mother! You did the right thing and removed yourself from an unpleasant situation.   She decided to procreate about 10+ years since she had you and she should have been mothering her own kids instead of passing that role to her teenage daughter who should be out having fun with her friends being a "stupid" teenager with nit a care in the world. You should be allowed to do mistakes at this age, explore the world, sneak a ship of beer and find that to be the coolest thing you can do, being "sooo baaaaad".

You have a living bio-mom and stepmom isn‚Äôt taking her place.  Your dad should have been the one to explain to his wife that while it‚Äôs great to be involved and treat you with just as much love and interest (if that‚Äôs how stepmom sees you as a full-on member of the fam), that she is not a replacement mom but an added adult to the mix that also loves you and feels invested in you being healthy, well and successful.  Defining steps and boundaries in how you interact isn‚Äôt always easy.</p>	0.898

I get you don&#39;t agree, and I even think you&#39;re right. I think you&#39;d likely make a better parent for him then his parents. But you&#39;re not his parents, they are, and you need to realize that all of your access to Jake and your ability to be this friend to him is completely based on his parents being cool with that. So even if you don&#39;t care about undermining them at all, it&#39;s not wise on your part or in Jake&#39;s best interest long term. On top of that, Jake is 10, and when his parents are just being a bit unfair/strict but not abusive it&#39;s probably best that he does what they say rather then being encouraged by other adults to disobey them. Do you really think that&#39;s going to work out best for him? </p>	0.898

A dinner she didn't order because he ATE HERS !!!!!!!!, then asks her for the $10 for the dish he left her with, that she could not eat (she hated Cauliflower Rice).	But yesterday my mom told me I'm not allowed to bake desserts because my sister will see the rest of us eating and feel angry and resentful and she'd want to eat too. She's 5 years old and therefore loves junk food but it's obviously easier for her to abstain from eating it when it's not in front of her in the first place. My mom usually just buys her those organic sugar-free granola bars and cookies, and she told me that the only thing I'm allowed to bake is a plain cake recipe (tastes like cardboard) that she usually makes every weekend or so. We don't have the ingredients for artificial sweeteners or those complicated dairy-free recipes. And I can't make the same thing every week, the whole point of CAS is to do something new, and to take a challenge.	0.861

She&#39;s claiming it&#39;s your food tainting hers. This is nonsense. You told her the truth. I know that eggs are not refrigerated in many other countries because the USA requires all eggs to be washed and that can let bacteria into the shell unless they are chilled.

The reality is there are NAH. OP should be able to eat and cook the foods they enjoy and the BF should be able to live in an environment free from things he finds repulsive. The problem only comes in when one is forcing the other. They boyfriend is an asshole if he forbids the OP from doing it, the OP is an asshole if they do things they know make the BF repulsed (regardless if the rest of us feel those things are normal).	0.884

Congratulations on getting rid of that whole person.

He also doesn‚Äôt get to then expect you to pay for the food he stole from you, or the food he ordered to replace it.  At $10.00 that‚Äôs the cheapest couples etiquette lesson he‚Äôll ever get, always supposing he actually learns from it.

Awesome job on your journey so far! Stay in charge!	I always eat while I cook, both to taste my food in order to make adjustments (when it&#39;s safe) but also just the (safe) raw ingredients because I think look good, but I have the sense to not eat it all before it reaches my families plate, and I wouldn&#39;t lie about it either.

Couple years he came back, but a couple years for a kid is forever and the only father she knew took off through no fault of hers (or yours obviously) and I wouldn't be surprised if when he came back he wasn't the same ""father"" as before.	0.8

I feel that I am taking crazy pills, he is 21 years old and is marrying someone that cheated on him multiple times but I am the only godamn person seeing that is a massive red flag? How in the hell is the grandpa wrong for DNA testing his grandchild when his son is blind as a bat to a manipulator? And all these reddit weirdos are saying YTA? OP's son is going to be divorced in 5 years or less calling it now.	Hi, I'm an 18 year old male, when I was about 4 years old my dad started shooting heroin and decided to abandon our family (my mum, me and my 3 sibling). 99% of the time he doesn't even cross my mind but sometimes when I'm showering it will hit be like a tonne of bricks and I'll just breakdown crying, while contemplating how my life could've been different if he were in it, he tried to make contact when I was 16 but I refused and told my mum if I were to see him I would kill him, and I'm not sure if I'm the asshole as yes it was 12 years to late he still tried to be apart of my life. Because of the fact he left us and my mum's relationship after (which lasted from me been 11 until 15 years old) that ended with her bf leaving (1 really looked up to him and basically modelled my personality from his as he was the closest thing to a dad I had ever known) I now have trust issues and trouble connecting with people because I don't want to get hurt (It's so bad I stopped telling my mum I love her because she said it back and I just started crying one time so I guess I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not reaching out even if it was just for some closure for myself or if what I've done is right. I don't want to be mentally hurt by him again as I feel my connection and trust issues would fuck me up. Thanks	0.889

He did it with the thinking his son wasn't going to get the test. It is very possible his girlfriend would try to make him raise another man's bio kid since she is a known cheater. He is son is clearly a moron with no backbone who blindly trusts his girlfriend despite knowing she doesn't respect him hence the cheating.

NTA at all. Does he realize how common it is to do that?

She&#39;s my mom and she loves me. I love her too, but I can&#39;t handle someone who acts like a clingy girlfriend who I have nothing in common with. I don&#39;t have this problem with dad.

I say this with the utmost confidence, because I've dealt with parents like you before; they give no encouragement nor acknowledgement to their children for accomplishing things (whether they struggled or not) that the parents state the kid was/is ""supposed to do"", but they're damn quick to punish any and every error or mistake/misstep.  They look stupefied when their children get acceptance letters from colleges states or counties far from them or they find out their child has joined the military by a note left in a room that has been completely stripped because the kid secured their significant things elsewhere and tossed everything else.	0.866

ADHD is 100% not an excuse for any part of this.

I would tell your husband that perhaps he should speak to a therapist about his clear lack of empathy and consideration for other people‚Äôs feelings, because that‚Äôs some BS right there.</p>	0.866

She and the baby&#39;s father can figure out what to do. If neither are capable of raising a child then the child will be removed from her home. Be honest with her.

She makes almost $10/hr less than I do, and we had to finally have a conversation about it recently because she wanted to ""balance"" the percentages of our paychecks going into our shared household account--I'd put in $950 a month and she'd put in $750. What helped was talking bluntly about how she was valuing other input we were both making to the household--we were splitting the bills and such halfway, but I was spending much more on things like groceries or ""fun stuff"" (dining out, pizza night, etc.). I definitely think that if you're serious about each other, socking away the kind of money you are is respectable and shows a real commitment to a more peaceful golden years for you both. If she can't see that, then having a conversation about where she feels she's overpaying her share is going to be important going forward.	0.845

I (16 F) have just recently dropped out of college and Was lucky enough to score myself a minimum wage job in customer service. As soon as I had told my mum she immediately started talking about how I should be contributing rent each month (I agree) and since my father stopped paying child maintenance, she believes I should be paying the amount he was paying each month (¬£200) I thought that this was not a fair price, it turned into a huge argument. As soon as I had been payed this whole argument came back into discussion, I don‚Äôt like invading other peoples space so I bought a laptop and had started working in my room.

My mum has also pinpointed that she would like me to be paying for my own food as well. I also need to buy myself some necessities such as toiletries and clothing and that along with paying rent I think is absolutely ridiculous, I don‚Äôt like causing arguments with my mum so I did willingly pay the amount of money she requested last month, but this month I didn‚Äôt stay with my mum for the first week, so I had deducted ¬£50 from the rent. She did then tell me that because I didn‚Äôt stay with her for the first week that doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt need to pay The full ¬£200, I thought this was extremely unfair as I hadn‚Äôt even been in the house. I was upset because I am trying to save as much money as I can at the moment. Recently she has been very inconsiderate when I‚Äôm working, screaming at the top of the stairs, shouting at the children, Banging/ slamming doors (to the point of making the house shake), letting the kids in my room and letting them scream and shout at the top of the stairs, to the point where I had to go to them put the person on hold and tell them to please quiet down. She then goes on to tell me that I don‚Äôt help her and I don‚Äôt pay rent so I shouldn‚Äôt be telling them what to do. I however, think this is really unfair. May also note that she has threatened to kick me out multiple times due to the fact that I won‚Äôt be paying the ¬£50 of the week I wasn‚Äôt in, I don‚Äôt want to be in this toxic household anymore.

Usually work from home jobs make bank, so $10 HE bought the house. IDC if you're married, the home owner, is the home owner üòÇüòÇ. Anybody lucky enough to have the roof over their head after that, needs to shut the fuck up. Cause if he decides she's being too big of an asshole, she can enjoy a nice little 1 bedroom apartment after her ass hits grass divorced.	<p>I (16 F) have just recently dropped out of college and Was lucky enough to score myself a minimum wage job in customer service. As soon as I had told my mum she immediately started talking about how I should be contributing rent each month (I agree) and since my father stopped paying child maintenance, she believes I should be paying the amount he was paying each month (¬£200) I thought that this was not a fair price, it turned into a huge argument. As soon as I had been payed this whole argument came back into discussion, I don‚Äôt like invading other peoples space so I bought a laptop and had started working in my room.

NO. WHAT A DICK. I hope he matures before your daughter becomes " of age".  He knew it wasnt funny bc he already tried this with your family. Unfortunately, his family CLEARLY taught him his ways. Sorry. I think i would have lost it on my boys if they did that. What an ungrateful childish boy. To intentionally humiliate you is a huge"flashing neon RED flag" . Honestly if he keeps it up, I would be done.	<p>Your brother agreed to the &quot;adults only&quot; invitation, then disregarded it. This is unethical. It&#39;s unethical of the rest of the family to support this. Your dad shouldn&#39;t be angry with you, he should be upset with himself for not teaching your brother to keep his word. Raising a son who will be dishonest and manipulative towards his brother is a shameful thing.</p>	0.917

Which should not come as <em>any</em> kind of surprise to him, given that the last interaction you had with him <em>before</em> he needed your help involved him screwing you over in <em>your</em> time of need and then blowing you off about it.  He needs to drop the guilt trips and excuses now, and do whatever he&#39;d do to help his kid if he <em>didn&#39;t</em> have you around to pressure - assuming you can even trust his account of why he needs the money and where it&#39;s going, given that he hasn&#39;t exactly proven himself reliable or a good financial steward.  Tell him he can either leave you alone once and for all or deal with the lawyers right here and now, and let that be your last direct contact.  Enjoy the wedding.</p>	0.908

Anyone of any gender can glance briefly, without becoming a skeeze ball. However, I do think men tend to be more visual in their attraction to bodies. That&#39;s certainly not even close to an absolute rule, of course - merely, it just seems to happen more often to men.</p>	0.689

But I think you overstepped and violated your aunt and her family's choices. Even if they're wrong, your cousin still isn't your child. You should have passed the questions about what is sex and left it to your aunt and told your cousin to ask her mother about x and y. Knowing that it's natural would have been adequate to calm her down enough to wait for her mom.	<p>At this meeting you can ask about allergies and other medical conditions, house rules, and go over your rates. Any good parent should insist on meeting you first anyway...who just leaves a teenager they&#39;ve never met before alone with their kids? Think about that. I bet this lady would have also stayed out later than agreed and/or tried to stiff you in the end with a guilt trip about how you&#39;re charging too much. She&#39;s not worth your time.</p>	0.901

Legally, the judge said that Lexie is old enough to choose who she wants to stay with and barely talks/texts her mom. Now my ex is mad and accusing me of Parental Alienation. I swear I'm not and she knows that I've suggested therapy more than once, but Lexie said she doesn't want to do it. I feel like forcing Lexie to go when she's not ready will cause more problems then it will help as well as start pushing her away from me. Lexie is my first child and only girl and I'm really just winging it with teenage girl emotions so AITA for not making Lexie talk about her feelings or to her mom?	0.887

Take off the rose colored glasses and look at the situation objectively, girly. It almost sounds to me like the reason he got you pregnant was to piss her off and direct her anger at you instead of him. Pretty fucked up thing to do to the mother of your children in my opinion.

So does she find all his juvenile antics ""funny"" when they're directed at *other* people and just ""not funny"" when they're directed at *her*? She doesn't mention anything about it being 'dangerous' to her and their kid, just ""stressful"" and she was tired of him ""playing"" with them.

Telling her that her friendship means a lot is a little transparently untrue, because in fact you are annoyed with her and literally don't want to go to her birthday because you think she's self destructing.

However, her mom also said that I should never have given her a twin themed gift anyways, implying that it was totally clueless and put way too much pressure on the parents, i.e. that I should have thought this might happen, and if I was a woman I'd have thought twice.

It seems more than just ‚Äútime off‚Äù.  *Time off* is something she plans with her husband. *time off* very Monday morning that she hides from the husband is ridiculous.  The Monday appointment takes priority over the health and safety of a 5 year old - so it‚Äôs not ‚Äútime off‚Äù.

It‚Äôs important enough that her parents are helping her to do whatever activity it is and hide it from the husband.

And if this were an advice sub, I‚Äôd tell OP to do everything she can to support her brother while emotionally protecting her own child. It‚Äôs why I draw the distinction between this birthday and the ‚Äúphase‚Äù.  The exclusion of that baby has the impact of preventing her from making bonds with her family. So that‚Äôs a big no-go for me. A big family party for one year on a different day? That child isn‚Äôt going to care. She‚Äôs not going to look at photos one day and say, ‚ÄúYou celebrated my first birthday on Saturday and not Friday? How dare you!‚Äù  So in that instance, I don‚Äôt think it is a huge ask to move the party to a different day as it impacts the child not at all. However, future birthdays can‚Äôt be treated that way as she begins to understand birthdays.</p>	0.881

nah but you both sound kinda stupid (and i mean that in the best way) but its so easy to learn how to jump start a car. ask a mechanic to show you/ explain once and you're done. youtube is another great source.	The story: my cousins come up and immediately start riding the machines which is fine because we planned it. I teach them some basics and everything is going well. The smaller of the two (~10yo) decides they like the brand new, beautiful red machine. Again completely okay with everything. Eventually they start driving recklessly as new riders do and I ask them to be more careful so they don‚Äôt get hurt or damage the work I did. Right afterwards they narrowly miss a tree that would have totaled the machine and bumps into a tow behind sled. No serious damage was done but I asked my grandfather to either stop them from riding or have them switch to another snowmobile. He wouldn‚Äôt have it. Eventually we are packing up in a parking lot and the cousin takes off and starts goofing around. They hit a car and wedge the hood completely underneath the vehicle. My paint job is completely ruined but luckily the car isn‚Äôt damaged. My grandfather refuses to let me haul the snowmobile back to his shop for the 30 hours it would take me to dismantle, repair, sand, paint, clear, buff, and apply decals. Furthermore I contacted my uncle to tell him what happened and he expects ME to pay the $200 for decals if I want my work fixed. I currently feel betrayed and upset by my family. I love them to death but they all act entitled to destroy the snowmobiles that I want to keep nice. This one is currently ‚Äúowned‚Äù by my grandfather but we share it and keep it going.	0.796
nah but you both sound kinda stupid (and i mean that in the best way) but its so easy to learn how to jump start a car. ask a mechanic to show you/ explain once and you're done. youtube is another great source.	The story: my cousins come up and immediately start riding the machines which is fine because we planned it. I teach them some basics and everything is going well. The smaller of the two (~10yo) decides they like the brand new, beautiful red machine. Again completely okay with everything. Eventually they start driving recklessly as new riders do and I ask them to be more careful so they don‚Äôt get hurt or damage the work I did. Right afterwards they narrowly miss a tree that would have totaled the machine and bumps into a tow behind sled. No serious damage was done but I asked my grandfather to either stop them from riding or have them switch to another snowmobile. He wouldn‚Äôt have it.

All you&#39;ve done is alienate your child even more. You owe your daughter an explanation for your truly bizarre behavior and an apology for putting her in what was essential an no win situation for her.

Your post really gives the impression that you dismissed any mental health issues your daughter had growing up as being faked because she is just a drama queen.  You talk in circles having said twice that she had persistent behavioral problems in school (you even mentioned how embarrassing it was for you to have to explain to her counselors that you were doing your best, poor you.) but then go on to say that you never had her assessed by a mental health professional because you knew she would just lie and manipulate them.

This probably goes back to before when you were born, when your mother introduced your father into their lives.  If they didn't accept him, they were going to have a problem with any child of his, either a step-sibling or a half-sibling, whom they'd see as a rival for your mother's attention.

They should receive help when possible. Parents who shower one *adult* child with money when that child is already in a great career, making good money and debt free while their other adult child is struggling with debt because they gave her less money and didn't try harder to find better funding for her... well these are really shitty parents. In my opinion.	0.897

You gave your son an expensive gift, after he had trouble with the law no less, and decided not to give your daughter and equal gift because you didn&#39;t think she &quot;Earned it&quot;.

I think I'll be the asshole if I cut things off because I haven't even hinted at doing so yet and it would be out of the blue for them. It's much less consequential for me to do so, than it is for them to have this done to them.

I know a pastor who is in the military and he said that he had a marine in his office who had just gotten back from beating a man to death with his gun. But he was in the fetal position crying because his wife was leaving him. It's serious. And when coupled with ptsd, he could be a danger to himself or others. Your daughter is too young to understand that though, so obviously she is upset. But you can't wait when it comes to mental health. One day your daughter will be old enough to understand that part of it. But I don't think you were wrong. This could have made him stop going to therapy, you kept him from doing that.	<p>Well my own father saw the post and ‚Äúangry‚Äù reacted to it. My mom called me later and told me my dad was really hurt and stated that he really tried to be a good dad etc. and the post made him feel like I was saying he wasn‚Äôt a good father. I told my mom I didn‚Äôt want to change the post caption. My mother got really upset and told me I was going to give my dad a heart attack. I think I might be the asshole here because it is a little petty to refuse to change a caption for the sake of family harmony. So Reddit am I the asshole? </p>	0.908

Anyways I went to the hospital and picked up our kids. They were terrified, the younger one is on the spectrum and was a complete mess. The elder one has completely checked out. She tries to put a brave face but I heard her crying herself to sleep. I was discussing with my husband what to do. Our mother definitely cannot take her. I was thinking we would take them in, but my husband is completely against it. He doesn't want the burden of these traumatised kids and wants to call CPS. We got into a shouting match and he left, but not before he said some hurtful things about my sister. I even screamed I'd divorce him if he behaved like this. I went to check on my son and explain the situation, but he thinks I am out of line and if I do divorce dad he's choosing him. He doesn't want to live with crack babies. I can't even divorce my husband because I love him too much. He is the bread winner and I would have no income. The kids were asking questions about what would happen to them.

She has the audacity to blame you for her situation, caused only by her actions and intentional failure to comply with the agreement, and then wants to harm your reputation and ability to earn a living.   It wasn&#39;t like she ran out for an emergency or was on her way back and got into an accident that delayed her.  She just didn&#39;t plan or manage her time well and expects you to suffer the consequences.  Be sure to respond to her negative comments or feedback if you can that what transpired is solely due to her irresponsible noncompliant conduct.   Don&#39;t let her transfer blame to you since it seems she can&#39;t own up to her faults or responsibilities.</p>	0.912

This leds to a potential conflict, they earmarked the funds for college, now it wasn't used during the college education. So it has now grown to quite a big amount.

She gave up some genetic material, likely for money, maybe also out of the goodness of her heart. She did not carry you, she didn't experience morning sickness, sore boobs, stretch marks and the physical after affects of your birth. She hasn't cared for you for the last 17 years. I have dealt with infertility myself, so I know that bone deep ache to have a baby of your own and your body not wanting to cooperate. If I was your mother I would be heartbroken to hear you refer to a random person as ""kinda your mum too"" especially after all she had to go through to bring you into this world. Maybe ask your mom what she went through and how she felt going through all of this. It might it some things into perspective.	0.894

Lots of people come out of college with that much and it is very doable to pay it off. But your bigger problem is that your stepdaughter does not understand responsible money management and your wife does not seem inclined to teach her. Instead, she wants to take money from your son‚Äòs college fund to pay for her daughter‚Äôs luxury indulgences. It is interesting to me that this payment plan is being described as a bail out and not a loan. Because at 23 years old, any type of credit card help for purchasing nonessentials should be a loan.</p>	0.825

And regardless of your financial decision, don't cut her off as a person. She's someone you care about, yes? To the extent that you were willing to pay huge amounts of money before this, right? You can still love her even if you don't want to support her financially. The more alone and isolated she is, the worse the outcomes are going to be for everyone involved.

well if he was 40k in the whole the kid would have the money and probably wouldn't hate op.   op could fix this by having an honest talk with the daughter and committing to helping pay off the debt... not just cosigning so he's forced to if she blows her credit...	<p>And regardless of your financial decision, don&#39;t cut her off as a person. She&#39;s someone you care about, yes? To the extent that you were willing to pay huge amounts of money before this, right? You can still love her even if you don&#39;t want to support her financially. The more alone and isolated she is, the worse the outcomes are going to be for everyone involved.

This is the kind of thing that really requires a tax professional to address.</p>	0.82
yes... taking away a once in a lifetime event is never an appropriate punishment unless something egregious happened. not sticking up to bullies isn't what I consider egregious. it's not great and obviously behavior that needs correcting but it's also really common in teens in groups... they just need some course correcting... not taking away a once in a lifetime event from them that celebrates everything they have accomplished.   those mistakes don't negate the achievements...	I honestly don't have a huge issue with him seeing his kids, despite the restrictions, (please don't judge,) because it is his kids afterall. However, they will not come here to see him, because they claim to be worried about getting fined, but I think it's just a conviennent excuse to see dad on their turf, and not have to come here and see me and my kids. They don't seem to be all that worried about dad getting fined.	0.881

Just because you're 16, does not mean they get to force you into harmful situations. You are old enough to express your discomfort, and have. Along with this, they are very obviously aware that their is a disconnect and you are not being treated well, yet choose to ignore in hopes the problem will solve itself. They don't seem to give any care into talking to your half sisters to try and understand why they treat you badly, or defend you at all.	0.877

In actuality, the human brain does not work that way. When under enough stress, the importance of something does nothing to prevent you from forgetting it. Anyone who has ever forgotten their cellphone is capable of forgetting their child and putting them in danger. No one wants to believe it, no one wants to believe that it could happen to them, so they don't take any preventative measures against it.	0.876

I don‚Äôt understand his obsession and thinking. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, I should be loved for who I am, mistakes and all, if we‚Äôre to have a successful marriage. Instead I get a mixture of disappointment and disgusted looks.

my favorite part is all of them calling me a kid for reasonably noting that op's relationship with their daughter hangs in the balance over this.	<p>You and your partner need therapy and basic parenting classes. Love isn&#39;t about paying for her to do stuff, it&#39;s about showing her how appreciated and cared for she is and that she is an amazing special girl no matter what.
