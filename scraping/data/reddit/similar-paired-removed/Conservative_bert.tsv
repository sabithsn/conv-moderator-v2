Guys I can't keep up. We knew the virus wasn't real last year but now it's very real and deadly. Help please go Trumbo Brandon bad!	Your argument about the mutation of the virus etc is faulty because as of right now the information put out is far too politicized and is highly in question. Look at the total death count of the globe year after year and look at it now. It's on par.	0.859
When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.88
What can vaccines help something that isn't real please guys Trumbo knows best. Brandon says it's real I'm confused!	<p>We <em>know</em> the pandemic is real. We <em>know</em> that vaccines work. What doesn&#39;t help is people spreading misinformation about those facts though.</p>	0.829
Trumbo says don't listen to foochi or Brandon about fake virus but my church choir group is missing 9 people why Jesus trick me???	<p>No one is speaking about what&#39;s used to make two of the not-a-vaccine vaccines.

So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.	<p>If it isn&#39;t petulant to offer my perspective, may I? I feel like this subreddit downplays how prepared for assault these people were. Also, my three examples aren&#39;t the only people who have been charged.

You're right, it's not political. Why are we putting those struggling with a mental disorder on pedestals while shooting down those that speak the truth?

I will note that it follows that such an individual, or group of individuals, may lack the requisite ability to perceive said social critiques, and therefore may further misinterpret consternation as groundless persecution...

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p><em>The United States government shipped an average of approximately 100,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies per week across July and August. The Administration will increase the average weekly pace of shipments of free monoclonal antibody treatment to states by a further 50% in September, continuing to accelerate the federal government’s efforts to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 treatment. Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. As hospital systems experience increased COVID-19 cases, many have identified monoclonal antibody treatment as a key tool to improve health outcomes, prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on overburdened hospitals.</em></p>	0.876

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn’t tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous.

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	0.895

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	<p>Israeli breakthrough has also substantially changed especially when they actually study the population as a hole and not just healthcare workers.  Jerusalems hospital had a caseload of 72 patients - not a lot, but 72 hospitalization 85% of them were vaccinated and they have continued to see this trend.  4 days ago - of all the severe cases in Israel 324 total, 209 were fully vaccinated. So you are telling me they are not the ones spreading it - but are the cohort that is getting the worst symptoms at this time. The situation is fluid, just like this virus - which is why the statistics, Israel&#39;s game plan, and CDC changes its mind with the wind. Months ago they said Pfizer dropped transmission rate by 90% last week the CDC said it&#39;s as likely to spread and is showing the same viral load. The data is incomplete, its fluid,  and it&#39;s that simple. Cognitive dissonance is a thing whether you consider what I said to be a concise zinger or not.</p>	0.863

Everyone Omar is ISIS with lips! She’s a joke and in the end she has no power. Everyone is waking up to realizing Islam is a joke!

The Jews have had that land for thousands of years before Islam was even an idea…the whole religion is a joke…why is Jesus’s name mentioned more than Mohammed in the Koran? Exactly 25 times when Mohammed’s name is only mentioned 4 times…why is the only woman named in the Koran Mary the mother of Jesus….reading it makes it clear that plagiarism and hypocrisy were the motivations of the writers of the Koran…Mohamed couldn’t even read or write for crying out loud…give it time, Omar will be a cold fart in the wind	<p>The Trinity is a completely man made idea that is nowhere in the Bible.

Plus the lawyer just said he had performed community service. It sounds like he never offered proof, nor did the judge ask for it. I've seen the lawyers lie many times to get low bail.

How is Biden going home on the weekend worse than Trump's 100+ trips to Mar-a-Lago and other resorts he owns where visitor logs are not maintained? Which one sounds more corrupt?	<p>Trump apparently wrote off $2.2 million in property taxes for his family compound, “Seven Springs,” in Westchester County, N.Y., as a business expense. But the property has been a family home since Trump bought it in the mid 1990s. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have talked about spending their summers there, doing whatever Trump kids do. Even the Trump organization’s website lists Seven Springs as “a retreat for the Trump family.” Calling a home a “business” solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people “working from home” during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.</p>	0.799

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	<p>Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us. I’m also wondering if they’ll turn it into a yearly thing.</p>	0.845

*Donald J. Trump for President v.

Therefore, I grant Defendants' motions and dismiss Plaintiffs' action with prejudice."	<p>&quot;The Court asserted that Trump’s challenge to indefinitely confined voter ballots was “meritless” in this particular case.

Sorry for being impolite to traitors. No evidence of fraud, but I’m supposed to just trust this fishy gut feeling that trump supporters are getting.

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn’t between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups. Republicans on the establishment side hated Trump and the populist movement he represented just as much as any establishment liberal.   Because of that, the party affiliation of any judges who looked at cases (when they didn’t dismiss them on standing, as happened in the vast majority of cases) didn’t matter.	I'm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

Just give me some actual hard evidence. All I am seeing is people who were told the election was rigged, so they believed the election was rigged, and they will listen to anyone who says anything in defense of that, but they won’t listen to anyone who has anything to say against that. People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn’t change the outcome. For there to be some large scale conspiracy, they would have to get past the same people who have been volunteering their precious time for years just because they believe in the power of democracy.	<p>FACTS are most important right now, not bias.

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election. They vastly expanded the number of mail in ballots while decreasing the ability to verify they were sent in legally. In states that are decided by only a few thousand votes, that level of uncertainty is very disturbing.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots. If you couldn't or can't see and acknowledge that fact that was noted even before the election occurred, then your reaction to this issue is obviously based purely on the election results and your feelings about them.	0.859

Last Thursday I went to the funeral for my best friends father. He died from Covid because he was unvaccinated. He was unvaccinated becuase he listened to people like you.  Many people like myself have suffered greatly and lost loved ones at the hands of Covid. I can tell by your gross comments that you are lucky enough to not have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to Covid. Be better.	<p>Also, it&#39;s a scam? Tell that to the almost 3 million who have died globally and the almost 600k who have died in the US including my grandmother. I also contracted it from my Trump supporting, anti mask MIL who showed up unannounced on Xmas and gave my entire family covid. It was horrible. I&#39;m in good health and felt like I was dying. Almost went to the ER. I feel so bad for anyone who died from this disease. These people basically drowned and you&#39;re telling them it was a scam and you not wearing a mask is worth more than their lives. You are truly a horrible person. But that&#39;s alright, you&#39;ll get yours eventually. I&#39;m not a religious person but I believe that what goes around comes around and the outlook doesn&#39;t look so good for you.

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	You don't send a mail in ballot to just any random address because the person could've easily moved. Now you got a ballot floating around out there that anyone can just fill out. Of all the baseless claims y'all makes this is the most bizarre to me. Databases containing addresses go off of what's on your ID. Do you know how often those are updated? Also, why is it a bad thing to suggest if someone wants to vote, they should simply request a ballot? Like is it that difficult?	0.874

Just like the right wing media calls any democrat a socialist…. Dude the answer is not to double down on extremism, it’s to meet in the middle. Ever consider that the media doesn’t actually control people’s beliefs, but people just don’t like trumps politics and thought he did a poor job as president ? But yes, if the Republican nominee continues to push the big lie that the election was stolen , the swing voters and those in the middle will be turned off by that shit	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.91
The reason I say cult is because Trump supporters have proven time and time again that they are willing to believe anything trump tells them to believe. As far as changing voting laws, it’s kind of the legislators jobs to update and change laws. I don’t see anything wrong with voting through the mail , and yes Facebook is sketchy but I don’t remember that having anything to do with Democrats. Facebook sponsored the first Republican primary debate if I recall correctly.	<p>The context is obvious from the flow of the conversation. DoJ says they can&#39;t just overturn an election and Trump says he isn&#39;t asking for that.  He just wants a public statement to be made.  Right after discussing one of the voter fraud allegations that the DoJ said was possible.  The DoJ didn&#39;t just tell Trump that there was zero evidence of voter fraud.</p>	0.867

That didn’t happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies. Just face that your guy lost and he lost without honor because he’s a conman. Grow up and face reality	<p>Corporations only care about money, and Trump&#39;s realignment of the GOP voter base means the Democrats have significantly more of it. Trump brought a ton of new voters to the GOP but at the cost of educated suburban voters that didn&#39;t like his fiery rhetoric. Trump&#39;s new voter base is mostly rural and uneducated, two factors strongly correlated with lower income. This is why it seems like the left has so much influence on American companies now.

Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms. Turns out if you run a coordinated 4 year propaganda campaign to make someone into Hitler 2.0 and have all intelligence agencies feeding disinfo to fuel the flames the enthusiasm can be outsourced. Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes. Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government.

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	They also refuse to allow a page dedicated to Joe Biden scandals.. and if you go to the edit history and talk page for Barack Obama's page you'll see that they routinely undo any changes that add scandals to Obama's pa Wikipedia was once known for not allowing people to delete information just because  negatively reflected on a special interest group.. then Wikipedia became a Super PAC for the Democrat partyy and it's moderators spent all day trolling the site deleting anything that made Democrats look b	0.842

US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported.

LOL, their target audience isn’t smart enough to pick up on that though.	<p>But as a business, I think that just taking precautions to help people stay a little further apart and doing your best to prevent infection spread should be enough. I think alienating people on this basis is just unwise. I think that there’s been very few clusters (comparatively) proven to have originated in restaurants like this. If it originates in a restaurant, it’s because a massive party of people drinking and fucking in bathrooms spread while they danced and screamed in close proximity to each other.

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?  Since 2018 there has been 92 school shootings in the USA, that number would likely be higher too if a lot of learning wasn’t done remote due to covid.  We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok. Oddly 2020 had relatively few mass shootings, so gun control was mostly ignored in the news and debates.</p>	0.856

If less ppl die when they’re vaccinated as opposed to those that aren’t. Even trump said “ the vaccine works, those that are dying are mostly unvaccinated” like I just don’t get it lol u think because covid hasn’t magically disappeared then the vaccine doesn’t work? It was never a cure it’s just armor to white off being killed or hospitalized and it doesn’t stop spread which we always knew. Who told y’all this vaccine should magically stop all covid and spread of it or it doesn’t work	<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it. If you have it, you’re protected. It’s not 100% but you’re probably more likely to die of a lightning strike than die of a breakthrough case. So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way. If they get sick and die, that’s their problem, not yours. </p>	0.903
It’s only science when they say it’s science silly! Just like Joe Rogan isn’t a medical professional, so has no authority to render an opinion on treatment options, yet Oprah Winfrey who is also not a medical professional can render opinion on treatment options. Also Twitter-tards are authorized to override opinions of medical professionals that have more credentials than lord Fauci.	<p>The thing is, from a scientific perspective we have only a primitive understanding of life, let alone consciousness.  This is part science, part religion or philosophy.  Science can eventually come to a definitive answer or at least a consensus on most things.  It will never do so in any useful way on this topic.  Super difficult topic.  I am in support of your arbitrary line policy, because I don&#39;t think abolishing it entirely is possible from a political perspective.

No it wasn’t who ever said that? It’s supposed to stop deaths and hospitalizations and guess what it’s done? Covid isn’t going away because we didn’t stop it quick enough. Y’all are so uninformed yet so confident it’s scary	It&#39;s their own decision to get it but the risk is essentially null, and the more that don&#39;t get it the longer this goes on. I&#39;m tired of masks and mandates and restrictions too and they would go away if so many people weren&#39;t getting hospitalized for Covid. Which of course is WAY more likely to happen if you are unvaccinated. </p>	0.868
The vaccine was never told to stop the spread it stops u from dying as often which is great. Who convinced u a vaccine made in short notice was some magical injection? Cmon	<p>Not only is that vaccine the most cost effective choice, while also providing additional benefits even if you had <em>actually</em> been infected with covid. BILLIONS of people have received the vaccine without widespread complications. The materials used in the vaccine are incredibly pure 1) because it risks killing us if it isn&#39;t and 2) the process to develop it in a lab requires it to be.

The current Republicans are more likely to be supported by voters who don't know the history of the Civil War (hint:  the Southern states seceded over wanting to continue slavery).  Dixie flag and all that.    More concerning is why any elected official, of any party, would think it acceptable to proclaim registered American citizens not be allowed to vote because of what state they lived in previously?  That's the part to focus on  because it's unAmerican.	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.861

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.  The important point here though is that no elected official should tell registered American citizens that they can't vote -- a basic and fundamental American right -- just 'cause they came from this or that "blue" state. FFS that woman is an embarrassment.	<p>With how the current state of politics and how far seperated we&#39;ve become, there&#39;s just no way we&#39;re going to meet on some middle ground, for any issue.

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>When covid first entered the scene and many people said it didn&#39;t worry them because side-effects appeared mild, others chimed in to say that we have to be cautious because we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. Why doesn&#39;t this rationale also apply to the vaccines? You can&#39;t test for something that happens years down the road regardless of how quickly you give it emergency authorization.</p>	0.879

I did read it.   The article was referring to a poll. Doesn't a poll assume that you need to vote on a predefined list of options?   The Guardian didn't refer to a poll.

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.  Nuance breaks this sloppy meme into the shit that it is	In light of current narrative that the jab has basically no side effects (at least that are allowed to be talked about lest it lead to ""vaccine hesitancy""), It's hilarious to watch drug commercials and their inevitable list of horrific side effects that often include death and several other things much worse then the thing they purport to help symptoms of.	0.907

This seems like an overwhelmingly positive change. Why wouldn’t we want insurance companies to better be able to assess situations? This will allow police to more concretely arrest the right people.

We should be generous but firm. If you want to come here and work, great - there&#39;s nothing more American than having a dream and working for it.

I dont understand why people so concern with Ukraine all of a sudden. It's the poorest country in Europe by choice, corruption is the meaning of life over there.

Look at the gains of Poroshenko he multiplied his wealth 18 times during his 4 years presidency.  Let Putin take it back who cares	<p>I guess I’m just more fiscally conservative than most and look at Trump as a failure because he raised the national debt almost as much as Obama despite being in office for 4 less years.</p>	0.854

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm  That’s a link to a study finding 90% effectiveness of preventing infection. That’s some pretty good evidence (since 90% is way higher than other very effective vaccines in the past)  https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness  There’s a link to a cdc page that collects studies that show vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections and hospitalization	We've already seen that the natural asymptomatic rate is about 90%, and the natural survival rate is around 99.903%. Even if the booster shits they're calling vaccines did EVERYTHING they promised (and they don't , but IF), how many lives could they possibly be ""saving""?	0.828
Idk, 800,000 dead from Covid seems like a pretty good thing to be fearful about. But also many democrats are making the change to saying it may be time to just get it over with, since Omicron doesn’t seem like the biggest problem once you have it.	<p>Honestly, a few things I see here.  I think there are some conservatives who are going to stand up and say, my individual rights override your unconstitutional mandate.  There&#39;s also a large chunk of African Americans who are not getting vax&#39;ed.  You never hear about the latter.  You hear Biden blaming Trump supporters for not getting vax&#39;ed.  I believe the vax is highly effective at reducing the symptoms and severity of infection and very so-so at best at controlling the spread.  I also think overall, we have like 70% or so vax&#39;ed.  The un-vax&#39;ed are mostly young children and those with naturally acquired immunity.  The percentage of the population with COVID antibodies is likely very high, approaching 90%.</p>	0.835
There's no use comparing the current situation in Germany to current time USA, they'll keep holding onto their notion that owning guns will prevent anyone with a political or military background from seizing power like with Hitler.   I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past. We should be happy that we can actually step out of our home and not worry about some lunatic with a gun whenever we enter a store, bring our kids to school or being stopped on the road by a police officer.  I don't care whatever kind of response I get by an American by typing this, not if you're fine with the current situation in the USA and not passing gun laws. First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	<p>So, theoretically, if there was a large amount of crimes being committed on public transit by one particular group of individuals, possibly immigrants from a certain region, we are not allowed to know. We are not allowed to ask that community to improve or change. We <em>certainly</em> aren&#39;t allowed to think about restricting immigration to that community. That would all be racist, and we must accept everyone for any reason and welcome them into our melting pot, because even if you wave the flag of another country while burning an American flag, apparently you are still an American.</p>	0.849
Yeah I think I’d agree with you, but from the article the data is anonymous and is in a black box type of situation, so you still have control over it (just like you would any other piece of your property, until the police could take it in the course of an investigation, or you handed it over to aid them). So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it’s not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it’s built into the car.	<p>No really. In the darkest corner of your consciousness where no one can hear you scream, what did you think? Let me make it easier for you to admit that it was something along the lines of the second option.

The guy is studying to become a teacher - the school obviously has a vested interest in making sure they don’t give someone qualifications to be a teacher if he would also be discriminatory against some of his students, for something as simple and personal as their sexual orientation or gender expression.	Also, and I know I'm ranting at this point, I am tired of the argument that gen eds make you well rounded. They don't. You study for what you need to to get a decent grade and you move on and dump the info out. Unless you cared about literature, philosophy, creative writing, whatever, you weren't going to truly steep yourself in that path. I also don't need a professor to tell me how to read Meditations, or On Liberty, you can just do that yourself. The folks saying ""well you can talk to the teacher and the students about the subject and get new perspectives."" Yeah, I can also do that online for free on any forum that relates to that subject. Now if people wanna go STEM, I understand that. Access to labs and equipment is nice and having instructors who really understand how to use them/can instruct you on how to is nice, but even then there are plenty of YouTube videos out there. Honestly YouTube instructors helped me out more in EE than my professors did at times.	0.821
You’re right, and the school didn’t fully suspend him (something that headline fails to mention). But they’re taking steps that needed to be taken for someone trying to become a teacher. I’m fine with this.	<p>In guidance on how to address “noncompliant” students, <strong>the dean’s office does not list failing a student as one of the allowed consequences for a student refusing to wear a face mask properly</strong>. Faculty are instructed to report “egregious or repetitive non-compliant behavior” through the school’s proper channels.</p>	0.822

I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines. All of the doctors I saw on major media outlets when asked responded with either "we don't know" or "the data doesn't suggest that". Thats how scientist approach any subject. In fact, stating any of these points, or even their counter point as 100% certainty is irresponsible and without nuance. It is rare that anything is ever 100%	<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates. Logical contradictions are all over the place and most people don&#39;t notice or care, I find it really hard to describe the average person in that case as &quot;reasonable&quot;. They are brainwashed sheep.</p>	0.859

I got the first 2 vaxx and refuse any boosters until they are PROVEN to stop the spread. As of now there is 0 science that it stops or even slows the spread. I'll be fine with a 99.999% survival rate for people of my age with no dire health issues.  They can fire me at this point idgaf	Everyone will have an anecdotal story about someone they know being unvaccinated who never got a sniffle, and someone they know who got vaccinated that spontaneously combusted. On a macro scale though, with millions infected, even a 10% reduction in viral spread gives us all a better chance of being able to end the spread of covid and avoid deadlier strains.	0.81
Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	<p>I didn’t say you can’t spread the virus asymptotically. But there’s a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place. If viral load drops off quicker and your body clears the virus bc the vaccine kicks in, you’re contagious for a shorter amount of time and you’re not as likely to infect other people. </p>	0.904

““It doesn’t matter who is in the Oval Office, whether it’s President Trump, President Biden or some other Republican or Democrat. Either one of them would have been greeted by the higher prices we saw this year," De Haan said, reiterating the current price surge is a direct result of the pandemic upending supply and demand.”  This has been annoying me for so long. I get high gas prices are annoying, but this simply isn’t the fault of any President. Not a good thing, but also something apolitical, and it’s a bad look on conservatives that we’re so up in arms about it.	It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.

he was improperly trained and tested. the business that gave him the c.d.l is a license mill to fill the demands of an insufficiently staffed transportation sector. no one wants to drive anymore because of the high demand, long hours, and danger. so the jobs are being given to anyone desperate enough, without proper training. if you want to hold someone responsible it should be the people who are knowingly weaponizing the ignorant with tons of rolling steel.	TBH my 2nd thought (1st was ""wow, what a moron, that's blatant overreach, and are you trying to start a civil war you'll lose?"") was that man, this could be a boost to small employers. Everyone's already feeling the pinch trying to find employees, but large businesses often are having a tougher time probably due to HR/C-suite thinking they can get away with not raising wages to match competition. And the service at a lot of larger businesses is pure shit already, because often *no one* there gives a shit... there's no owner there to bust his ass, and the manager's sick & tired of being used as duct tape & bubble gum to patch together their lack of staffing.	0.889
The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you’ll get less sick, and you’re less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	>Evidence suggests the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission. **Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential to spread the virus to others, although at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.**	0.902
The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It’s not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it’s not a political problem. Get over yourself.	<p>Meanwhile California goes through rolling blackouts on a yearly basis which is somehow still republicans fault because &quot;climate change&quot; even though we have continued to reduce emissions both total and per capita as a country while watching world wide emissions rise from &quot;developing countries&quot; immune to all the of regulations we place on ourselves, essentially we NIMBY pollution to 3rd world countries and accomplish almost nothing for the environment other than making people feel good about &quot;doing something&quot;.</p>	0.844

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  “Among 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.”  So, there’s at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it’s symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	<p>I do think the matter of comorbity is being glossed over by most organisations: of the family members of mine who were diagnosed with covid, a vast majority of them were fine and had mild flu-like symptoms, and two with obvious comorbidities (tuberculosis and some manner of cardiac disease)  died very quickly after contracting it. It seems to me that the virus fast-tracks existing conditions which would have a strong chance of killing the person within a matter of years anyway. Most healthy people would probably be completely fine.</p>	0.841
If they have a legitimate reason for taking credit, or taking blame, then I’m not against someone, either party, taking credit. But the high gas prices right now are clearly not the fault of any political body (once again, the guy in the article).   Better than arguing over this, we could just choose to ignore the annoying political spinning everyone does. It’s annoying and isn’t going to influence any of us, people who are actually paying attention.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	One, the virus mutates because there is what's known as ""Leak By"". This is why there is a new Flu vaccine developed every year. The Flu vaccine does not ""kill"" the Flu virus, so it mutates. This is the same for the COVID  virus. If there was no Leak By, then the vaccine would kill the virus in a couple ""jabs"", and that would be it.	0.871

That's the education you're paying 100k a year for folks...	<p>And they still cant concede that their decisions at 18 or 19 were probably self serving and myopic while I KNEW 100% I would fuck college and debt up so i did construction and factory work for 3 years, paid for a semester of community college with cash, realized I didnt wanna be a metal shop boss, and ive been building for rich people ever since. Ive saved almost 100k in home repairs at this point and my network of tradespeople to count on is amazing.</p>	0.822

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>I never get the flu shot. I haven&#39;t had the flu since I was in a kid. I&#39;m not getting the covid vaccine either, I&#39;ve a higher chance of dying from the flu. The long term effect of mrna vaccine are not known. Seems like an easy decision on my part to not get it. The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.894

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>However, enforcement was a tricky subject. Any time a politician said we need to prosecute unregistered firearms hard and start throwing the book at them you would get pushback because that would disproportionately affect the black community. Historically, the government has found various ways to try to discourage minorities from legally owning guns in a way that rural whites never fully experienced, so there is some grounding there.</p>	0.847

> Four people were burned to death.  irrelevant unless this man intended that they should die by burning to death. such detail is intended to excite a thrust for retaliatory blood and anyone that acts on that information in that way would be more guilty of violence than the man in the truck.   in the heat of the moment, many people would try to run from the scene without even being aware of their actions including people you love and respect. if you don't understand that, i suggest you study psychology research circa urgent autonomic responses (fight, flight, or freeze). i would be more concerned if he showed no emotion, that would be a kind of indicator that he meant to do what he did and is likely to do so again. running is a sign that he knew he made a grave mistake and he feared the consequences. he's no saint but it doesn't seem to me that anyone is better off if he spends the rest of his life in prison.	<p>We murder people all the time.

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since. I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.

Everyone shrugged and didn&#39;t care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.</p>	0.919
Crazy how all those Fox News media members had direct access to the Trump Cabinet, but I guess MeDiA is only liberal in nature.	<p>I also don&#39;t think you can call the Biden coalition a populist movement. The average is better educated and richer than the average Trump voter. Plus populist movements like the Trump movement, at least in their rhetoric, do not ally themselves with big businesses. I&#39;d categorize the current movement within the Democratic party as a reactionary anti-populist movement. While Trumpism is pretty clearly an anti-establishment populist movement.</p>	0.823

Because the majority of the modern world is now vaccinated and the majority of vaccines occured nearly a year ago now. How is this hard to understand?

Boy you must be fun.	<p>I struggle to understand the difference between a covid vaccine and the one you got for chickenpox/shingles, tetanus and whatever else needed to be in elementary school.

Yeah but unlike most conservatives, she's vaccinated so you could've stopped there	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	0.799

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.893

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.

Why would you have *fixations* on women? Is it because you're only used to dealing with people online, and actual human contact is difficult for you?	Smartphones, with social media or without, are addictive and when used constantly are not healthy for the human psyche. We need to be engaged in something productive or else we get pretty depressed, and allowing a piece of technology to consume so much of your time will ultimately make you only feel good when you're using it. Social media exacerbates this because it tends to make people believe it counts for social interaction AND it teaches people to base their entire self worth on what peoples crudest opinions are of them. People, and this does not only apply to children, will post the fakest version of themselves online in hopes that they are recognized for it and if it is received poorly they take it personally and if it gets a lot of likes they still know that it wasn't a truthful representation of themselves so they begin to hate their true self because they aren't this image that they created.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...    Those irrational wokes are at it again!	<li>Move Overton window as far as possible to prime the argument and limit any foothold your opponent may have (shout your abortion, all guns should be banned, trans women are the same as XX women) </li>	0.805

The us army probably killed a similar number. And guns killed a lot more.As much as i hate to say it but these are numbers that just need to happen. We need to defend our country and woman need to defend themselves. Whether its with a gun or abortion this is just the way it is nowadays.  A lot more millions of people have died from war and gun violence. If abortion is a cause of death  then so is war because its preventable and a choice. You cant allow one and prevent the other and call them different.	<p>Here&#39;s a news flash: the people who want stricter gun control don&#39;t want it to oppress you, or enslave you, or anything like that. They&#39;ve already got you by the balls in every conceivable way. You think that because you have a gun they are afraid of you? The reason people push for gun control is to over time reduce the availability of guns (yes, even illegaly obtained ones) because America has a shitload of shooting deaths! </p>	0.869

But you realize if we outlawed abortions you would financially pay that bill via future welfare? What do you think happens to those babies? What do you think happens to them in 20-30 years? Seriously though, are you privileged? Is this what someone means when they say someone is privileged?  You want to outlaw abortion, and you don't like welfare funding?	<p>I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers. Being against tax payer dollars for potential mother&#39;s is why the left bashes the right over not caring about the baby after it&#39;s born. If you ban abortion there definitely should be outreach for mothers. Especially young ones.</p>	0.879

>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead. You endorse slavery with you purchases, tell me otherwise.	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise). Get rid of IDs  for voting because minorities are too stupid and poor to get an ID and etc. Democrat policies are always supported by &quot;minorities are stupid and poor.&quot; And somehow their the anti racists.</p>	0.88

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	So as conservatives, we absolutely hate it when anybody wants to tell us what to think, or what to say, or what to believe, but at the same time, we want to use the state to make such prescriptions for others when it comes to exercising certain functions of their body.	0.904

I'm a conservative but this is one issue I don't get involved in. I totally get why someone would have one but on the other hand I know it's morally wrong. I'm a man and feel it's 100% a women's choice because they are the ones carrying/raising the baby(if no dad is around).	<p>A position of reason and reasonable tolerance is the best counterargument against this sort of absurdity.  Let adult folks have these surgeries if they want to and doctors are willing; don’t ever pay for them with tax dollars, etc, but more obviously don’t do something really, profoundly dumb like put someone who, whatever “gender” they may claim is a fertile biological male human with a female bunkmate.

You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you? Don't be niave, over the better part of the last century the left has been corrupting every level of our society,  and they're for damn sure not going to show their rules to be voted away.    And violence most definitely IS the answer sometimes. Our rights and freedoms are worth killing to defend, otherwise there never would have been an American revolution. I refuse to lose America as its meant to be because some people are too cowardly to fight for what's worth fighting for. I'll die for those ideals. I swore an oath to the constitution(not to the government) and I still take it seriously. Wise up, evil is real and our enemies are among us.	<p>That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with.

I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even *had* covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don't know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don't know, but I'd assume she was unvaccinated.

Vaccine efficacy of less than 100% doesn't mean vaccines are failing.   The serious side effects and death linked directly to a vaccine are extremely rare and are being studied to future cases. They are nowhere near the frequency MTG claimed.   Roughly 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have died from covid.	We're in a pandemic and you're not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It's not ideal when anyone—much less a child—has to spend time in the ICU, but I don't think there's been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.	0.886

I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children.

Your mind has been poisoned with lies. You don't have natural immunity and tons of people on HermanCainAwards were previously infected with COVID at the start of this nonsense, and then die when they catch it again. Your a fool.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.909

When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.884

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	If the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized because it lessens symptoms, but affords minor protection against infection... what is the point? The entire argument for universal masking for the past year has been to prevent asymptomatic spread. If you still have a high likelihood of catching covid, but a lower propensity to have severe symptoms, the vaccine *encourages* asymptomatic spread.	0.906

Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	6. There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (""they were pulled from the market!"") and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off. They have wide authority to continue them in a crisis, which this definitely is, and it's only a net benefit for everyone.	0.87

Doesn't matter because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the far left. Therefore, it espouses far left policies. That's why I expect a Republican landslide this November.

This is the left's argument for any time someone brings up censorship they will say a private business has the right to run it however they want. I believe they know this is disingenuous but there's really no use arguing with leftists.	<p>For what exactly? They have the right to refuse service if they want, it&#39;s a private business. You don&#39;t have to agree with their choice, and can choose not to financially support their choice. It&#39;s a bit much to say they should be closed for that though.</p>	0.87
>This is the left's argument for any time someone brings up censorship they will say a private business has the right to run it however they want.  That is the rights argument as well isnt it?

Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they’re good at what they do? That is literally socialism. If you don’t like social media, just don’t use it. The free market will correct itself as long as people stop enabling it. It’s your fault as a consumer, not the company’s fault.   If you got this far, I hope you can see how ridiculous some of the takes on this sub are. As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	<p>No. No, screw that. It is the responsibility of the private sector to attract customers by making a better product. The only intervention it makes sense for the government to make is to institute a universal charging standard since that would discourage monopolistic practices. Other than that they should get out of the way and let the free market work. They won&#39;t, of course, because the government is bloated and dysfunctional... but they <em>ought</em> to.</p>	0.89

Did you support the cancelation of the Dixie Chicks in the early 2000's by Republicans?

Did you support or oppose the cancel culture campaigns of the "Moral majority" under the Falwell's?	<p>Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	cancel culture is forced on us, by using measures to manipulate emotion regardless of ideology. considering personalized advertisements and posts in general on online posts, at best i would have seen maybe two articles from smaller news sources, within a span of a day for most topics of such nature that lean towards my political views. i couldn’t give a damn less about cancel culture yet for whatever reason, they find any which way to push their narrative whether it be a movie scene/ad or a video game collab. the difference is that this isn’t forced into your normal day to day life, meaning you’d never see politics in a child’s video game, and yes that has happened.	0.846

He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines.

All we were ever going to be left with was partisan conspiracies.	<p>In all seriousness though, i think the Fauci angle (which obviously isnt 100% fact yet) just further proves that the election was rigged.

Yes, one of the old republican protectionists that gave us the Great Depression, not the President who opened up markets and gave us the greatest economic boom since…after the great depression.	<p>Trump is absolutely <strong>not</strong> an exception. He had a lot of talk about bringing back manufacturing, and even had moderate success, but passing the tax bill, the only real major act of his presidency, was an absolute, undeniable betrayal of the working class and the greatest gift to the mega-wealthy they could have possibly hoped for.

It is generally considered a perk of the job that you can park your car wherever and whenever you like in the city with no consequence, contributing massively to the cities congestion. With city employees its bad enough, but when cops do it in their cruisers it creates a sense among the public that cops think they are above the law. It&#39;s a terrible look.</p>	0.793

unfortunately Regan didn’t have a good solution to the problem of increasing national debt, due to social security and other government handouts and benefits. and he had to even rack up the debt more because of star wars program. The problem with the nation is far more than just joe biden and the recent 30 years of government. think about it. why did we get into this much debt to begin with?	<p>Your right the government has money, we also have trillions of debt, with an administration that added over 6 trillion well within 100 days, and wants to add another war, which would push this country even further into debt. Pretty sure the government is living outside its means. Which means we should probably pay off some of that debt before allowing at least 18,000+ foreign country kids in our system. You don’t buy a car if the payments are way outside your ability to pay and then go have more kids right? Does that make any sense fiscally?</p>	0.859

Biggity makes a valid point. A key word in your response is “mostly”.  Another is “suspicious”.

That’s not how it is supposed to work, no matter what your beliefs or values. Order and rule of law are the basis of our democracy and civil society, and without that, it all eventually falls apart.	<p>Couldn’t agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn’t matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns. If not, then we just become another failed authoritarian state with no freedom.

My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn’t fascistic.   There is a long history of countries - including the US - requiring foreigners who are entering a sovereign nation - to present medical records, including proof of vaccination.   It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you’re keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	<p>EDIT: Forgot to add this, but I understand the argument about already having gotten COVID, but the CDC and doctors and other medical experts have all said that getting vaccinated is still recommended for those who have had COVID. Do you trust your gut instinct that you don’t need the vaccine more than the medical experts?</p>	0.815
https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-data-vaccinated-people-do-not-carry-covid-19-2021-3?op=1  > During an MSNBC interview with Rachel Maddow on Monday, Walensky said: "Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick, and that it's not just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real-world data."  I’d like to agree with you, but earlier this year there were hundreds of articles touting this information. The narrative changes everyday sadly.

Some of these people are gonna take so many their skin color is gonna start resembling a Mountain Dew color.	<p>I wouldn&#39;t really say it&#39;s mild for everyone though. I have a VERY strong immune system and I get sick maybe once every 2-3 years. So the fact that it knocked me on my ass like it did surprised me.

Could Biden (not defending him, I think he’s a clown) have meant that the federal government lacks the police power to mandate masking/social distancing/vaccines at the state level?

Uh no — liberal peruser here and me and all of my liberal friendie friends want shit to be back to normal. I am annoyed as f*ck that I am still dealing with this BS after almost 2 years.   And it’s not the government faking shit. People are still being hospitalized and dying — but, strangely, it’s the weirdos who refuse vaccines! They’re the ones dying!   If you guys were actually conservative... drawing on the root meaning of the word... you would be risk averse and recognize that your chance of vaccine issues is minuscule in comparison to the aggregate affect of non-vaccinated people filling the hospitals, necessitating further mandate, etc.     [If I’m removed from this sub, it’s clear evidence that conservatives actually love censorship, when it’s convenient. Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]	Deaths have been on a decline for a long time now, and whether that's from the vaccines or from less virulent strains of the virus, facts are facts and this pandemic has been winding down for quite a while.

I don’t know how…but it’s time to fight against the fucked up censorship from places like Facebook and Twitter. Their accusations of misinformation and lies are fucking bullshit and they know it. These piece of shit platforms are one of the two propaganda arms of the DNC (the other being the liberal media) and I’m getting sick of their bullshit.	<p>The issue is sometimes those repercussions take the form of censorship, which is contrary to the open and free discussion required in a civil society.

He's just trying to hold on to his precious advertising deals and protect himself from the woke mob canceling him. Which is pretty pathetic given he's calling for a level playing field when men are calling themselves women so they can cheat their way to easy wins over biological women.	Regardless, the double standard is ludicrous. The overcorrection of legitimate social issues has turned into a witch hunt against straight white men. It’s almost laughable tbh, it’s like yeah, there are social issues that stem from the system as a whole, but people fail to realize that it’s a rich vs poor issue, because of the emotional attachment that the media takes and spins, which captivates the infatuation of self pity by these types of people, and instead of bettering themselves, it’s easier to create a scapegoat and blame someone else for their short comings in life.	0.851
A level playing field would be a new division, men, women and trans leagues.	<p>No. Gender roles are clearly not static. They have changed dramatically over time and vary with geography. Compare gender roles now for just straight men and women to those in the 90s, to the 60s, to the 20s, to the 1820s, to the 1720s, to the 1620s to ancient Greece, to ancient china, to tribal societies (some of which are matriarchies).

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	<p>You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. It&#39;s not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as &quot;left wing&quot; as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant. It stinks of YouTube political commentary, which is oftentimes just laymen ranting.</p>	0.85
You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before. But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself. Or even better find a way that nobody has to wait that long that these things are necessary.	Even better, realize that abortion already isn’t a federal issue of any significance and will not be for at least a decade. No one in the federal government wants to change a damn thing about the status quo here - they profit too much from it. Blue team gets much of its vote from single-issue pro choice folks; red team gets much of its vote from single-issue anti-abortion folks. They win or lose largely on that issue, and getting rid of it would mean voters might actually pay attention to other things. And SCOTUS probably prays every night to keep abortion shit off their docket.	0.856

Yeah the reason for the rioting is kind of important lol. One was manufactured outraged the other wasn't.

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat. But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	<p>But I want you to understand that the culture that has risen in minority neighborhoods is destructive, and has been for decades. For the first time in a long time we&#39;re seeing fathers return to black neighborhoods and with them comes a small opportunity for prosperity in these neighborhoods, with that gang violence and drug use will go down. The government can&#39;t do that for them, they&#39;ve tried and tried again, but it doesn&#39;t work. Black and Hispanic people are seeing the failed streak of democrats and considering joining us.

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	<p>I get that generational poverty is a thing. I get that black people are more likely to be impacted by that because of the past. What I don’t get is why I, someone who had absolutely nothing to do with it, should be on the hook for it. Equity policies that address that issue seek to do nothing but punish me for things I didn’t do, with the goal of making life better for people that didn’t experience those things. </p>	0.853

They went after Trader Joe’s for their advertising and names on products, Trader Joe’s said no we’re not removing the names and that was it.

I was just pointing out that Democrats were once the more Conservative party, while at their inception Republicans were the more progressive party. I don’t think 100 years ago the south was a bastion of progressive thinking. Democrats just matched up better with a more conservative way of thinking at the time. I think politicians on both sides are mostly self serving garbage today, but this post doesn’t paint the full picture of the political landscape during those times.	<p>Hmm that’s weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes.

>I agree with Buchanan that the Ukraine isn’t worth fighting a shooting war with Russia over  Ukraine didn't need our help before we took their nukes away and promised them that we'd protect them in exchange. You're fine with us going back on our promises to protect a country that had the means to protect itself until we took it away? How does that look to all our allies?  Look up the Budapest Memorandum	Trump warned Putin that he was going to bomb Assad's army cause he wouldn't quit gassing his people. He made it clear that it didn't matter to him that Putin was supporting Assad. He just understandably warned Russia since they had some of their army there and Trump didn't want to start a war with Russia over it.	0.863

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.  Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.	<p>If you’d like me to take anything you say seriously, provide some sources to back up your claims. Otherwise crawl back to the hole from which you came.

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	<p>Anyway, this is another example how the name of an organization is not what is its mission (like &quot;freedom fighter&quot; means the opposite). The NAACP has an agenda and it is not the advancement of Colored People. It is the advancement of socialism and the end of the nuclear family.  That is why they won&#39;t touch Hunter, it does not advance that agenda.  As for colored people, they have not been advanced in 50 years (this is according to the NAACP).</p>	0.855

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery but was not an abolitionist in the sense of the abolition movement that was growing in the north.</p>	0.842

A real quick Google search will do you good. Trump visited The Hermitage on March 15, 2017. Gave a speech and laid flowers on Jackson's grave.

You're right in pointing this out. It is, however, the least bad choice in a situation of many bad choices. We accept that their ballots will be inherently less secure because we think the people who have volunteered to fight in our military should not be disenfranchised. It is a tolerable compromise to ensure that Americans who are often quite literally on the other side of the planet have a say in their government. However, if you're an able bodied person in Altoona, Pennsylvania, you can go to a fucking polling place.	<p>Of course its appealing if you are proposing a world with no crime, lower taxes on most things and while all safety nets are increasing.

If you want to debate material causes of the direct war you can point to slavery or tariffs. I'm making a deeper point though.

Read Albion's Seed.	<p>All those slave holders were beaten in a war by the north And Americans today are descendants from that system.

Just from the information I've seknife scene the boasters seem to be much more dangerous than the actual vaccine was originally, And that could be just potentially because it's now your 3rd shot of a MRNA.  And I understand not everyone can just quit their job, But you need to quit your job. You bought yourself sometime with your booster shot fine find another fucking job.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.851

But that&#39;s not happening. If there were fraud we would have 100% uncovered it in this last election. But we didn&#39;t.

So that’s a valid reason to “complain” that maybe something needs to change in a 250 year old system that’s clearly not working anymore.	<p>This bill is essentially &quot;take most of the shit we got away with last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, everything that conservatives are pissed off over, and make it law.&quot; People wonder why the rift in this country is growing wider and wider? It&#39;s because politicians only push policy that helps their party and their voters, not the entire constituency.

1. It doesn't exist, meaning it's just socialism. That's my point.  2. Learn some reading comprehension. You failed to actually understand my comment and brought up something I never claimed. And fyi if you can't be democrat and socialist at the same time you can't have Democratic socialism. 3. Lol "it's a whole other thing" just admit you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them. We have one of THE most progressive tax systems in the world which by definition is socialist (taking more from some to provide benefits to all). If you want to talk about implementing a non socialist flat tax system I'm al ears. Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth. Not shared ownership (which is either socialism or communism)	<p>And the interesting thing, given that this is a Conservative subreddit, is that it&#39;s a socialist idea. That people aren&#39;t allowed to vote with their money, or decide for themselves, but that the government is to tell me that I&#39;m not even allowed to choose a business which requires vaccination. That is far from the land of the free, and it&#39;s scary how fast people tout socialist ideas as soon as it&#39;s even remotely near what they want in that specific question.</p>	0.847

none of that is true, its always been about republicans introducing bills that make it harder for minorities to vote. They for some reason always choose ids that less minorities have.

The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable. Yet...I'm still nervous about November.	<p>We game him his chance and he blew it. I wanted for him to be successful and I even approved of several things he did. It was when times got tough where he cracked under pressure though.

I don't like the law. Absolutely should not have passed in the "bipartisan infrastructure bill." I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all. The technology has to be developed and deemed viable before it takes effect anyway, and if not by a certain date, an explanation as to why it's unfeasible has to be given.     Louis Rossmann did a good job explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg)     Just because we understand the lunacy of the left doesn't mean we should be careless in our criticism of them. Pursue excellence.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

If I were you I’d go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents.

First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights’ worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?”	<p>I was really hoping to have a valid debate with someone that might have some useful insight, but all you have done is insult, bring zero valid points to the debate, and be a hypocrite.

can you read? it says they choose ids that minorities dont have (texas allows weapon permits but not student id, NC didnt allow public assistance and state employee IDs predominantly held by black people) so they can lower votes, because when more people vote republicans lose since their ideals are unpopular. in the last 3 Republican presidential terms they won the popular vote once, in bushes second term.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren't wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.	0.851
Yes, you keep telling yourself that. Last I checked, it wasn't Republicans who were stepping down, signaling they weren't selling rejection.

It's the Democrats in a panic because they know what's coming. I hope your feelings are tougher than you put on, I sense a lot of disappointment in your future. Remember, elections have consequences. 😂😂😂	<p>Then again, maybe in a roundabout way this is good for the democrats. Because the other side of the coin is that trump being a considerable influence on the right isn’t really good for the right as a whole.

North Carolina didnt recognize public assistance and state employee IDs for voting  which were predominantly held by black people, those voter ID laws were deemed unconstitutional by NC judges saying   > The law "was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,"	But in all seriousness, do many of the liberals not realize that racism can go either way? And them sensoring white, Mexican, or Asian just because it's black history month is insanity!

1) I don’t know anything about but I’d be very surprised if dems are less willing to spend on domestic energy than reps  2) I’m not entirely convinced is a huge problem especially with the labor shortage  3) I absolutely understand your perspective but I also understand wanting more accountability and training for a group that holds as much power over our communities as police do.

So the point is totally moot.  And from what I can tell, a student ID looks much easier to forge than a LTC card.	Your whole argument is based on the idea that if people look or act differently than what you consider “American”, they must be here illegally. Perhaps you’ve never left your tiny backwoods town, and never made it past high school, but here’s a free tip for you: this is a very diverse country. Americans “normal” actions and looks come within a very wide range. It just takes a little more culture and a little less bigotry to see it.	0.776

State employees would obviously require valid government ID to be hired, so again, that's a moot point.	<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates.

They don’t.  Each state ran its own audits and went through various gauntlets of bullshit lawsuits.   Those things you don’t seem interested in reading.   That’s what mystifies me about the side arguing this fiction.

You either believe in the rule of law or you don’t.  That used to be a pillar of conservatism.    Seems pretty fluid these days.   Trump has totally broken peoples brains.   Damn shame too.	You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn't be further from the truth. It's not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as ""left wing"" as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant.

Why are we still reporting daily cases, why are events being cancelled, and why are people frantically searching for Covid tests? If you feel sick, stay home for a few days and you'll get better. Why is this still being handled like the plague?	<p>I never get the flu shot. I haven&#39;t had the flu since I was in a kid. I&#39;m not getting the covid vaccine either, I&#39;ve a higher chance of dying from the flu. The long term effect of mrna vaccine are not known. Seems like an easy decision on my part to not get it. The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.881

I 100% want free and fair elections. But here is my problem: when the local county observers, poll workers, Dominion, multiple Secretaries of State, trial courts, district courts, appellate courts, state and federal Supreme Courts, CISA, and DOJ, many of which were in the GOP or appointed by Trump himself, all say there was no fraud, and Donald Trump and friends are the *only* people still claiming fraud, I'm very likely not to believe there to be fraud.	0.863

The right has always claimed those labels, which I think are absolutely meaningless. I don’t think unwavering patriotism is a virtue, it’s just jingoism.

Okay, let’s get everyone healthcare. Let’s get everyone fed and housed. Let’s get everyone educated.  “We just haven't become radicalized.”  Extremely debatable based on a lot of polling recently. What percentage of the right believes in Q or some conspiracy about pedophilic baby-eating dems? What percent believe the election was stolen?	So, to the point of CURRENT systemic racism - my argument is that the current SYSTEM, in and of itself, is not racist and therefore not in need of major reform, as it was in the 50's and 60's, simply because historical injustices are still having effects on people, they are.

Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	<p>Your argument that there shouldn’t be an investigation into the Capitol because there wasn’t one for the riots is simply illogical . Republicans in Congress have literally said that both of these situations are the results of Antifa and BLM , therefor there is no legitimate reason to not investigate and prove that.</p>	0.901
We just don’t see it, or hear it, because we don’t talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say “the leftists” or “the democrats”, not the looters.   Just like democrats say “the republicans that stormed the capitol”. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say “hey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b”. It’s disgusting that we as a people have so little say, or are ignored in what our views our. Currently, we HAVE to match what our leaders say.	<p>Your argument that there shouldn’t be an investigation into the Capitol because there wasn’t one for the riots is simply illogical .

Yeah this isn’t even going to go anywhere. You can’t even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don’t agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that’s all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says “go home”, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don’t stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to. And I’m not saying with guns, but with common sense before all this shit happens.	<p>Ironic you moan about people &quot;not reading past the headline&quot; when you clearly didn&#39;t read any bit of the article yourself. It actively disproves this ridiculous claim that Trump organized it since the violence started long before any calls to action and none of those calls to action contained any calls to violence.</p>	0.86

I mean yea, I fully support any gun ownership as long as gun laws are super strict. Preferably some training for anything bigger than some pistols but mainly a register of what guns are where, crackdowns on loophole selling etc. Stricter laws the bigger the gun gets but not things like financial restrictions or time based, it still has to be possible to get guns if you really want something bigger.	<p>Not to mention the gun community already has self regulation. Any firearms vender can deny you a sale for any reason they deem fit. This just makes it easier to get in, show you know how to handle and take care of a firearm, and get access to resources needed to continue to do so. The second amendment is a MASSIVE responsibility. Rights dont exist just to exist, nearly all of them come with a personal responsibility. Firearms require a lot of dedication.</p>	0.857
Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	<li><p>Amnesty would secure a permanent Democrat majority for the next generation. This would help RINO&#39;s because the last thing they want is to be in power (unless they&#39;re at the head of the table) you see what most of these congressional Republicans really want is to collect donations and bitch about things they cannot control or really do anything about. That&#39;s why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this &quot;They&#39;re the <em>real</em> racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if <em>we</em> did that?

How are gun laws "strict" if you could buy one with something you could gook up in Photoshop in 3 minutes?       The people who voted for Cuomo killed more people than anyone ever has with a firearm.  I think we need strict voter control.	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok.

Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I’m general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it’s a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it’s a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it’s a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics? Politicians vote with their wallet.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren't wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.	0.89
So on that same side, do you think there were no republicans that utilized the rioting and looting for their own benefit? Or exacerbated it?   Again, those people that were at the capitol and looters are not democrats or republicans. They’re anarchists. They’re terrorists. And they’re people that do not know how to handle situations rationally. They follow a herd and nothing can change their mind.	> Just because a group of his die-hard supporters had no organized and cohesive goal and ended up vandalizing their country's capitol for fun doesn't mean it's something that should be encouraged...	0.885
I expect gun sellers to verify with the university that you are who you are. The strict part is like an easy to check register for guns for law enforcement basically nanny state when it comes to guns while still being feasible to get them.

I do bot support taking away guns from people, and im sorry if I gave you that impression in my comments. What I want in regards to guns is for better training on safe gun storage for owners, and regulations that prevent unstable people from obtaining firearms. But just to reiterrate: I don’t want to take your guns.	0.838

You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	The following nights their response to the protests felt like overcompensating for the night of the riot. Peaceful marches would get boxed in and tear gassed, etc. These tactics would have been nice to deal with the looters but were unnecessary for the marches. They realized that they were basically fanning the flames at this point and backed off, rightfully in my opinion. Whether you agree with that move or not, they did not need federal assistance either way, and the offer just felt like political showmanship by Trump saying he could swoop into this Democrat city and save the day.	0.864

I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	<p>I do want to make it clear that I have always supported 50 state audits after elections.

Because it’s a super easy thing to criticize even for a Republican, but none of you will. Talk ill about the politicians who did nothing, aren’t cooperating, or are arguing against it.   Democrat leaders could have done so much more when it came to saying “hey don’t loot and riot”. I criticize the Democratic Party all the time, but I rarely hear republicans doing the same to their party.	I’ve never met a republican who wants to get rid of that pesky black vote, and yet if you listen to democrats, you’d think every one of us is clamoring to disenfranchise anyone with dark skin.  No, we just want secure elections.

Why do you assume that I’m for defunding, and also why do you think defunding means removal of officers? Why do you think that all democrats have the same view point? We don’t.  It’s about reallocation with a TERRIBLE branding behind it. If it were to say “reallocate funds to help out in situations that do not need guns, and pay officers a larger amount after they go through more rigorous training.” I am 100% for reforming the police, and “Reform the Police” would have been a much better way to explain it.	<p>Otherwise everything you said is spot on sir. Defunding the police isn’t the right move, re-determining what the current funds go to, is the step we need to take. My opinion? Guarantee a reasonable salary, and stop giving the police military grade equipment. Paired with better training this could literally solve a majority of our problems with the police.</p>	0.873

The only reason I still have my job is my company accepted my religious exemption. They made me re-write it three times but gave it to me.    I was pissed.

Voting definitely sucks in some states.  Waiting in line for hours does suppress votes.  But that’s up to the states to fix it, not the federal government.  It’s simply not in their enumerated powers to regulate voting.  And since the 2020 election was the most fair election ever, what’s the issue?	<p>But all of this is moot if one side cheats and then frustrates a review, because the period from election day to confirmation is far too short. The most important thing is very serious jail sentences for anyone fucking with the election. If the election was really spiked, then right now justice cannot be served because nothing allows Trump and Pence to take office. If Senate and House votes were also spiked, then control of both chambers might also be wrong - it&#39;s a giant mess.</p>	0.877

Unions will help all of us. But you r/conservative fucks are to stupid to realize it.	I dislike AOC’s policies, I like Trump’s policies, and i treat everyone based on their actions. After the “trumpist register” she suggested some months ago, i cannot respect her. I’m from a former communist, and i know very well how those things work. But lately she has changed for the better, and i hope keeps improving. While i don’t think Trump is “presidential”, i think he is a better president than the liberals and the media make him out to be. I disliked him at first, but after seeing what the left did to him i respect how he managed to deal with them. I still cannot understand how people can be so stupid to call him extreme right, nazi, dictator, fascist and whatever shit they pulled out a movie. 4 years people have yelled that he is not their president. Everywhere i saw there was “orange man bad”. I mean come on, that’s some childish way to deal with politics. I won’t comment on Cruz becaus i don’t know much about him.	0.825

If a white homeowner kills a white intruder is it a racial based killing? Of course not. So it’s a false equivalence to say that a white police officer targeting a black person because of their genetics is the same as “black on black crime”	<p>We of course had the Narragansetts and the Mohegans team up with the English to completely annihilate the Pequot Trible. There literally is no Pequot Tribe. The people who made a fraudulent claim on the flimsiest of evidence to be Pequots in order to open a bingo hall and later a casino were actually white people. The dark-skinned people brought in later on are ethnically black people with a small amount of Narragansett in them. So ultimately, the descendants of those who committed genocide against the Pequot tribe are now operating a casino in their name.

His claim is in response to republicans changing local election laws in certain places. Whether you agree with him or not, he is saying that the election will be different because some laws have changed since 2020.   Also- nobody has ever suggested there was 0 voter fraud from either side of the aisle. There has been many cases of voter fraud that were identified and prosecuted, but not anything close to enough to change the outcome of even a small local election.	<p>The problem is that election laws <em>were not</em> legally modified in 2020.  In 2020, many state and local officials <em>ignored</em> election laws to accommodate covid.  This is the key point where the Republican argument wins.  For example, Texas law is explicit in disallowing drive-through voting for most people.  Some Texas counties did it anyway.</p>	0.882

Says the guy with a biological upper-hand since he doesn’t produce lactic acid (makes you sore) like the rest of his competitors.	But since the vaccines don't prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there's likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren't being noticed because they don't have a reason to get tested.

A ton of registered democrat voters were registered to addresses that can't possibly exist, proven on video on the LwC show.

It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.

Lol, don’t worry, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden he just got 81 million “votes” from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you’ll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they’ll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don’t see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the “worst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics” even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you’re a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you’re constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	You make it illegal for them to be as you would like to say gifted these huge amounts of cash and my bet is the politicians would lose their minds and weed out plenty of crooked politicians but if we also make it law that politicians had to be audited &amp; provide clarity of income before taking office and every year in office, my bet is very few crooked politicians would run for political office &amp; the crooks already in office would abdicate office before an audit of their finances which would put them in jail.	0.836
2019: economy looked great. Trump was holding speeches in large stadiums. The best democrat candidates were Biden, Pete and Kamala. Trump looked like he’d win 2020.  2020: Democrats turn a flu into a catastrophic pandemic. Introduce “election reforms” in battleground states. Engage in mass election fraud.  2021: Biden is president and Kamala is VP.  What’s the moral of the story? Don’t count your chickens before the eggs hatch. Republicans are incredible dumb fucks.	<p>People will blame corporate Democrats for pretending to pass the “progressive” agenda but scuttling it at the last moment.  However, I blame White House incompetence.  Everything this particular administration attempts ends up like rotten meat that fell behind a freezer.  And they then blame Trump.  CNN and MSNBC try to help the administration out by calling everyone white supremacists even when race isn’t involved.

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately. I’m a conservative leaning independent and I think a lot of the Covid stuff is bs, but this was full of bullshit dude.

We had an armed insurrection take place in our Capitol, in which multiple people died and there is evidence that more were in imminent danger. Our politicians, especially vocal ones on the left, have a very good reason to be afraid of the far right, which has moved from vocal opposition to violent opposition.

Couple of things here, the FBI can't do anything until someone breaks the law. You can look at the Orlando public shooting for evidence of that, the FBI investigates all threats of terrorism no matter how big or how small domestic or not. So they have to investigate these people to determine if they actually pose a threat. All I see in this article is pandering to the conservative audience.	<p>Current laws acknowledge that police need the benefit of the doubt legally in order to do their job. Progressives want to start jailing cops any time they make a mistake, and for some bewildering reason ppl in this thread are now anti-police and want these democrat DAs to go after cops and jail them for mistakes too. What&#39;s next, maybe we should just defund and disband all the police depts like progressives want after all? Who cares about surging crime! That&#39;s the logical next step because very few cops would perform the job anyways under the new liability that we are now suggesting they should burden. Already critical police shortage and surging crime rates, yet apparently even some conservatives now jumping on the anti-cop bandwagon trying to strip all of their legal protection and open them up to being jailed for honest mistakes.</p>	0.858

The vaccine has killed more people than the “current strain” don’t buy into the BS if you do their will always be a new strain	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so.

And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.864

Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	<p>Biden might not be Trump in his mannerisms, but he also gets a lot of help from the media to ignore the fact that he&#39;s really NOT a nice person. I mean for goodness sake there are plenty of times where he blew up on reporters and voters for asking questions he didn&#39;t like, where he said he wished he could punch Trump in the face, &quot;race shamed&quot; black people for even thinking about not voting for him, etc... the guy is no peach either.	0.93
Holy crap boys. I get it if you don’t want to get vaccinated I support your freedom to choose, but picking and choosing the data like the author did in this article is junk science.  From the article the author pasted in this article: Boosted vs unvaccinated isn’t even close. Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000. That’s somewhere between 3 times and 15 times the risk of death to be unvaccinated.   This data doesn’t show what the author is trying to distort it to show.	<p>That being said the Covid vaccine isn&#39;t without small chances of side affects they even make you wait 15 mins because of some of the reactions you could have. The point is that the vaccine is less dangerous then the virus. That being said I don&#39;t support any type of forced vaccine legislation even having got it myself.</p>	0.872

There has never been a sterilizing vaccine. Not even smallpox was sterilizing for all ppl, and certainly didn't last for a lifetime.   Instead it takes a good enough vaccine, taken by enough people, combined with other measures, to suppress the spread of a disease (what we did with snallpox). Until Omicron, the mRNA vaccines were good enough for that and they still provide protection against Omicron.	Children that do not have cancer, or some other immuno-compromising condition have NO place getting this vaccine.  It will help in almost NO way to give it to young healthy kids.  99.999% of children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms, or extremely mild symptoms.  My kids had COVID-19 and you'd never have known it.  Runny noses and slightly less energy for 18 hours for them.  That was it.

My issue with your comment is that it seems to be intended, like the article itself, to make light of, and to trivialize, the violent attack on the US Capitol Building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of a presidential election.  An attack that was egged on by blatant disinformation spread by the sitting president himself and his clique of loyalists within the Republican Party, such as Ted Cruz.

There are always trade offs. A man that spent more time nurturing would end up neglecting their child because men were the ones who had to put food on the table relative to the women.  A caveman child would starve to death if it had to rely on small game and gathered food that their mothers could help provide. And a child would starve if a man didn&#39;t defend their hunting lands for competition from other tribes. After food and security was secured a man could spend time nurturing but it was not his primary objective relative to women. </p>	0.816

Such shortsightedness. Many children are born into circumstances that are absolutely not appropriate. Ignoring the obvious (rape etc.), it makes absolutely zero sense to compel a woman to carry to term. You might have a point of America actually gave a shit about children’s welfare beyond this argument, but you’re severely lacking in any kind of appropriate support for mothers, childcare provisions, accessible healthcare etc.  Be against abortion by all means, but it’s an absolute joke to call it genocide.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.  To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.  Now maybe a society comes about that there&#39;s no point in maintaining an &quot;unwanted life&quot; but that gets really screwy and it goes against human nature in that in nature you needed more people generally due to strong death rates in the natural world.</p>	0.896

It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you’d look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.	So while I’m morally opposed to late term abortion unless the health of the mother is at risk I’m pretty meh about it in the first trimester.  It definitely gets murkier in cases where you have a completely non viable fetus.	0.89
Where did I say it was acceptable? You act like I’m glad she got shot. But you don’t willing try to climb through a window with armed guards in the damn capital and then expect people to act surprised you got shot. You think that cop knew her intentions outside of what her actions showed? Try doing the same thing in my house and you’ll get shot all the same.	<p>Realistically I would bet nothing woulda happened to AOC or any other politician even if the rioters got close. Those morons didn’t know what they were doing besides making a scene. They weren’t out for literal blood. And don’t quote the cop that got killed with the fire extinguisher, I’m well aware. But that was one person being a bigger scumbag than the rest. If blood was on everyone’s minds there woulda been a way worse outcome. They coulda kicked down AOCs office door with her in it and she more than likely woulda been fine.</p>	0.844
Right, so by you’re logic you’re quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can’t support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it’s acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It’s the ‘parents responsibility’ to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they’ll suddenly ‘get it’ and do a good job… but they’re not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	<p>All it comes down to is does someone think developing humans deserve the same rights as birthed humans. For instance: I think almost everyone would agree it is not morally permissible to kill a developing human the day before its birth. But the baby is still attached to the woman at that point. So the fact that the baby is attached to the woman is not what makes it okay to kill the child. </p>	0.843
I said it wasn’t perfect. But downvote away pussy.	<p>So yeah.... go take your outrage, misinformation, and ignorance somewhere else.</p>	0.807
So I’m presuming you support policies that help mothers/fathers provide the best possible car for the child once it is born? I presume you’d fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves? Or is it some binary thing of “alive or dead” where quality of that life means fuck all?  If you fully support the above, then we may disagree but I could see your stance. If you’re of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you’re not pro life at all, you’re pro control and don’t care about welfare of the child at all.	<p>Either way - good news.

Half of women who get an abortion were actively using some form of birth control (condoms, hormonal regulation, etc.) when they got pregnant.  Over half already have already had at least one birth prior.

Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	<p>With abortions, people who should not be parents such as women who’s baby father walked out, are poor, or don’t have the proper support systems are advocating for abortions but the conservatives are blocking that. If people had access to abortions then maybe these kids won’t have to be born into societies where becoming a menace is their only option. </p>	0.869

You turned form talking about **children** having babies to calling them **women** super quick. No sweetie, we’re still talking about CHILDREN HAVING CHILDREN.

Especially after their rape as resulted in a pregnancy they have no right to terminate? Alright buddy.	<p>Therefore in my eyes, abortion should be legal to everyone up to the end of the first trimester.

So if a woman lives in a state where abortion is legal but doesn’t get an abortion, that child is not entitled to any support? How very pro life of you.	<p>Nope. Everyone has the inalienable(or natural) right to life,  and abortion violates that right.

The Bible gives instructions on how to perform an abortion and at no point states that it should be banned.

And we have freedom of religion. I have the right to not believe someone else’s religion.

 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	<p>Wait, he didn&#39;t that that, did he? He supported laws, didn&#39;t he? Being proud of America and our incredibly beneficial aggregate effect on the world is a good thing. But we still have laws, and breaking them make you a criminal.</p>	0.801

I can't do anything about an entire group of people who think I'm a bigot for thinking kids and teens shouldn't medically transition, kids should socially transition if gender dysphoria persists past 16 and it started at a young age, and that being LGBT is becoming a trend.

His policies had greatly harmed the Iranian regime, its terrorist infrastructure, its nuclear ambitions, and its local authoritarianism. If that had been kept up, it was only a matter of time before the regime would have submitted to global pressure and/or been overthrown domestically. But just like Obama, Biden is now throwing the Ayatollah a lifeline and they’re going to use that to ramp up terrorism, ramp up their nuclear program, and quash their domestic moderate opposition movements.</p>	0.88
Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	What the parent comment doesn’t mention about #2 is that the government should issues ID’s that qualify people to vote.

I also do not believe you understand what that article is saying...insurance companies are still paying for your cost of care which is the bulk of cost. They&#39;re just no longer paying for the copays and fees you would pay if you were sick with anything else besides covid. I do realize that &quot;deep financial debt&quot; is relative to an individual, but hospital fees and copays are typically one time charges in the 10s-100s of dollars. If you&#39;re really that financially strapped, hospitals will often work with you for either eliminations, reductions or non-interest payment plans,</p>	0.777

Let’s not forget many poor single mothers that seek abortions can’t see a way to afford the pregnancy itself. Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	Yep. Millions went for art and garbage that isn't beneficiary to the majority of society. That's why most tradesmen are conservative dudes that didn't go to college and are able to pay their debts easily.

It's the kids that went for political science and other relatively useless forms of education that think it is predatory. When you take out thousands and drop out or go for useless majors and can't get a job, who's fault is that? Definitely not private lenders.

I didn't graduate, got a trade cert and have a great credit score, a nice, cheap house and am on my way to retirement now all before 30.

Yes folks, Its a race to the bottom. Both parties suck now.  According to the Gallup Poll in 2018  "President Donald Trump's job approval rating averaged 38.4% during his    first year in office -- slightly more than 10 percentage points lower    than any other elected president's first-year average. Bill Clinton is    the only other president who was below 50% in his first year. All others    were 57% or higher, with six of the 10 presidents elected since World    War II averaging 60% or better in their first year."  &#x200B;  Sad isn't it. Lets get some real LEADERS in office, not these clowns.	That is the OLD Trump which NOONE remembers.

You're woefully misinformed (yet again) so I'm going to help you here:  Did the jab stop people from getting the virus 100%?  Clearly not hill person. Great work. I'm proud of you.  The problem that you're too fucking stupid to realize is that it absolutely diminished a person's ability to get it by a significant factor.  So when you ask questions like that, the answer is YES.

Did it work or didn't it!?   Things can be in the gray area, hill person. The vaccine can prevent a ton of people from getting it all but not everyone and still be a great vaccine.

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	<p>So has heart disease and cancer.  The primary age groups of war deaths is 18-30, with a total over 660,000 for all of our wars. Covid deaths for that same age group is 11,677.  660,000&gt;11,677.  I imagine if 60+ year olds fought all of our wars the death rate for those would be much higher as well.

Is it extremely small compared to the one life?  My math is back of napkin, but there's \~300 million people in the US, so to "balance" the 100% of 1 you only need \~0.0000000003%(1/300,000,000). And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	A few things about that. The mortality in those over 80 is close to 90% (although probably old numbers). So ignore those people. The rest of the us populace is fine right? Well 70+ % are overweight or obese, which is an extremely compounding risk factor for a number of reasons. So ignore those people right? Add all of the other chronic conditions that exist in the us and you're left with a small percent of the population that actually doesn't have risk factors for covid. And guess what? **it's a virus that we have (had) a vaccine for. ** It's miraculous that we could have developed it so quickly, but that's what happens when there's money to be made (capitalism) and the whole human populace is facing the same challenge.	0.847
Those other humans involved have the option to take the vaccine, which has been proven to reduce hospitalizations. They have the abiltiy to take steps are needed so that they are protected personally. If they decide to wear a mask? Fine. If they decide to get vaccinated? Fine.  A baby inside the womb does not have that liberty. They are at the complete mercy of the mother.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers. Being against tax payer dollars for potential mother's is why the left bashes the right over not caring about the baby after it's born. If you ban abortion there definitely should be outreach for mothers. Especially young ones.	0.864

So what...the 5 million who died from COVID aren't significant enough?  Roe happened in 1973. It's been 49 years. That means on average we see 1.29 million deaths per year from abortions.  COVID has been around for 2 years and we've seen 5m deaths.  That's 2.5m per year.  You're going to get the vaccine now, right?	<p>Pfizer&#39;s own docs...which won&#39;t be fully released thru the FDA for 5 fn decades state that over 1,200 died in the first 2 months of testing alone. Plus another 158,000+ adverse events including 25,000 neurological issues.</p>	0.89
Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us.

It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane. Let me guess, you’d welcome treating the common flu like we currently treat COVID, right?</p>	0.902
Sure, but I hope everyone in this sub at least understands the value of getting protected. Dying by covid is an awful way to go out, and I don't think anyone here in this sub wants a go fund me under your name in case of an unexpected tragedy.	<p>Trust me if I were at ground zero contaminated with the world&#39;s deadliest virus then I would absolutely want someone to make sure I don&#39;t leave and give it to others. That doesn&#39;t mean that if someone tries to barricade me in my own home I won&#39;t start a dumb fight.</p>	0.859

Nope. Are you claiming all those 5 million were from unvaccinated? How about the fact that there have been more deaths since Biden took over as there was when Trump was President, and Biden has had the vaccine with over half the United States  vaccinated? The vaccine is really having an effect isn’t it?	<p>Now let’s say the cases have fallen to 500 per day due to vaccinations. Let’s say ANOTHER 250 people test positive. This gives a 50% breakthrough rate. However, we’ve <strong>already</strong> had a 99.5% reduction in cases due to vaccines (100,000 down to 250). The breakthrough rate is the same, but total cases have plummeted.</p>	0.843
Wow, it’s sad how these conservatives are choosing to downvote a comment about children needing hearts.  But abortion should be stopped right?  Also, shouldn’t provide support for those forced new mothers. /s	<p>With abortions, people who should not be parents such as women who’s baby father walked out, are poor, or don’t have the proper support systems are advocating for abortions but the conservatives are blocking that. If people had access to abortions then maybe these kids won’t have to be born into societies where becoming a menace is their only option. </p>	0.894
Unfortunately, I don’t think hospitals are going to deny people, even if they are stupid, selfish, and unreasonable.  They don’t even kick them out for assaulting medical staff.	<p>Nobody is a public health hazard, if you have the vaccine then why are you terrified of people who don’t? You’re protected so stay in your own fucking lane, it is not my or anyone else’s responsibility to make you feel safe by taking some drug that they may not necessarily want to take.</p>	0.854
First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	<p>Why would I, me not you dumbass, get this vaccine when I have more of a chance for adverse side effects than I do from getting sick from COVID?</p>	0.84
In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption. This is the result of the confluence of these two facts.  There is no lack of a free market here, and there is no lack of private ownership. This corporation is working *within* the system here. This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	<p>However, I agree with you that corporations should not have the same constitutional rights as real people. Given the loss of individual share-holders and their replacement by mutual funds (to say nothing of the institutional investors--banks, BlackRock, etc.) they are more able to do as they please because most retail investors have lost their voices because it is the fund managers that have the right to speak. People own shares of the fund, not technically shares of companies that the fund owns.</p>	0.845
The issue that I have is that your choice does effect others.  For each surge that we had, our hospitals were clogged full of unvaccinated people.  We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.     As a physician I know that the current vaccine is still highly effective in keeping people from hospitalization and death.  Hopefully this will give us time for the production of the more effective medication.	<p>COVID numbers are definitely effecting treatment outcomes of even non COVID conditions at the moment. I would definitely suggest to anyone to look at the vaccine which reduces mortality significantly and can help unclog the system. Everyone thinks they will be fine without it until they are not, and it is almost entirely the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised who end up taking up beds in critical care. Ask a physician to address any concerns if you have them.</p>	0.889
I do think they have somewhat of a point. For example, the trend of people not vaccinating their children in recent years has brought about small outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, etc.	But that argument falls down when people who are vaccinated against measles mumps and rubella don't contract them from exposure....	0.823
Slavery isn't bad, the justice system punishing black people worse for the same crime is not bad, all white juries clearing people of lynching and so on are not bad? CRT is the discussion of anti black bias in the justice system and that happens to be the domain of us whiteys.  How is learning about our justice system and where it has failed the citizens a bad thing unless you think that black people deserve worse treatment?	<p>To talk how racist things are against black people turns them into victims, which is in of itself racist because black people should be treated the same as white people and not be labeled. Who wants to be a victim and for people to feel sorry for them? That&#39;s not a good thing and you could even look at that as a way to secretly keep black people down, since outright racism from before the civil rights era isn&#39;t possible anymore. These white, social justice warrior, liberals are the actual oppressors of black people by labeling them as victims.</p>	0.873
You can still get the virus from those who are vaccinated. What part of this FACT do people not understand? 🙄	I’m telling you, lots of Covid is being spread amongst the vaccinated with their “freedom” under the false / fauci pretense they are protected against covid.	0.823
I agree about the tried and true vaccines. I do not understand the anti-vax stand on this at all. But COVID is a different case altogether. Just like the flu, there is really no true vaccine to eradicate it. The shot should be a choice and not mandated or forced.	<p>That makes absolutely no sense to me in the terms that you are talking about. Side with caution <em>and</em> take the vaccine? You would rather take a brand new unproven vaccine with unknown possible long-term side effects <em>and</em> still have a chance to get Covid and still suffer side effects from that, although (supposedly) less than what you would get if you weren&#39;t vaccinated than to take your chances of never getting Covid at all and never having to deal with any side effects from either?</p>	0.908

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They’ll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape. Not to mention,   > Domestic violence is more common than any other health problem among women during pregnancy.   https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy  I sincerely hope I don’t get banned for posting this link. I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.	<p>But if you even suggest they stop using abortion as birth control, and maybe practice safe sex, that’s a gigantic issue and infringes on their rights as a woman. I mean there were at least a dozen girls at my high school that had <em>multiple</em> abortions. It’s fine you wanna have unprotected sex, do your thing, but don’t get upset when I call you a murderer as you kill an infant with a heartbeat.</p>	0.841

Yes, why would somebody blame Trump for helping to try to overturn an election when he told people that the election was rigged and falsely claiming that Mike Pence could overturn the election on 1/6 if he just ignored the will of the voters. /s He was literally the one who brought them there by pedaling bullshit. According to testimony he actually intended to go to the capital and didn't because the Secret Service told him they wouldn't be able to protect him. He only managed his "we love you. stand down" bullshit after a great deal of pressuring by others including his daughter and he still wasn't the one to request reinforcements. Arrest the traitor and move on. He is an entitled piece of shit with zero emotional intelligence.	The reality is, former President Donald J. Trump filed a lawsuit accusing Mary L. Trump, The New York Times and three of its reporters of conspiring in an “insidious plot” to **improperly obtain his confidential tax records** and exploit their use in news articles and a book.

I don’t condone what occurred, and those who entered the Capital should absolutely be charged with the appropriate charges, but it doesn’t seem like an attack. It seems like a protest that got out of hand combined with a lack of preparation (and likely dismissive projections) by the DC Metropolitan Police, Capital Police, and local authorities. An ‘attack’ implies that planning and/or leadership went into planning the specific action of entering the capital, for which there is no proof.	0.85

You know it is possible to multi-task.  Maybe thats tough for you though.    Sounds like you have the playback down.  Deflect, deflect, deflect.	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government.

Well if your grandma made the pipe bombs, then she should be arrested and the situation should be investigate why so many trumpers have been found inside past police barriers.    Every BLM that damaged a building should also be held accountable.  See how easy that was.  Everyone should be held accountable for their actions.  Instead you deflect, deflect, deflect.  I'll let the Minneapolis police and Minneapolis politicians handle their city.  I want federal investigations on what happens in federal buildings.  Stop with the "but antifa/blm"  you sound like a child	<p>Here is the deal, you know this, but the vast majority of the people being held without bail and those that have been indicted or charged did break windows, assault police or smear shit on walls. ALL of these offenses constitute crimes and the offenders should be punished. But cut the crap with your deep concern about these crimes. I actually had to add assaulting police because you didn&#39;t mention it. Probably because you support police being assaulted. You also laughably support police shooting protesters, but only if they are Trump supporters. Prove me wrong.</p>	0.824

It took forever to actually get a response for the problem and the President of the United States wasn't ever even who called for reinforcements. Apparently getting him to provide his half-assed message to tell his own followers to leave the capital was its own project that required a great deal of pressure. This shouldn't need to be said, but just because somebody acts like a dictator doesn't mean they're a rolemodel.	DC's imperial actions post-USSR have no clear, material goal & offer no benefit to the American people. Their directed by foreign (e.g. Israeli/AIPAC or Saudi) money & merely profit construction firms (e.g. Haliburton). You cannot impose liberal democracy on a people who have no history (nor desire) for it at the point of a gun - and even if you could, American democracy is crumbling away alongside our infrastructure, healthcare, & education every year.	0.873
Name another US prez that publicly insisted to his base that an election was “fake” and “rigged”.  That right there to me is a huge red flag. I don’t understand why you don’t see that as particularly heinous. Yeah, that in and of itself is, admittedly, not direct evidence for the claim of insurrection, but it certainly lays the groundwork.   Does the damage that rhetoric caused to the foundation of our democracy not concern you?	<p>Even if it was more, there’s a big difference between people believing that an election is rigged and an election actually being rigged.

The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.'

It is clear that the Democrats knew that there would be an explosive situation outside the Electoral College as early as March of 2020. It is now indisputable that the Capitol Police and National Guard were told not to do their jobs by effectively being issued “stand down” orders.&quot;</p>	0.858

Let’s be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what “side” they’re on. So don’t try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I’m not.   But you’re trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn’t be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn’t clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to “protest” a “stolen” election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	I would say though that both sides would benefit from shunning their extremists. The right should be disgusted with the neo nazis and the anti democracy factions that appear. The left should be disgusted with the property destroying and hate fuelled ""protesters"" on their side. I think we fall victim to understanding where those extremes came from, and start to defend them, but we shouldn't defend disgusting behavior.	0.9
This is great..  glad I didn't vote for Hillary.  What does this have to do with the January 6th attack?	on your side. So if you could just straighten this out for me: because they failed to do that on the 2020 census, what have been the repercussions of that?</p>	0.77

This is true.  There are almost no African Americans in Ukraine.  So you automatically know the murder rate is lower there.

First of all, things are already chaos, you can thank Trump and his cronies for that.  Second, I couldn’t notice your lack of defense for Trump’s quote of “if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.” Care to perform your mental gymnastics for me to justify that one? Just curious.	<p>For the record, I&#39;m not a fan of Trump, though I do like how much he upset people.

Well the last investigation concluded in December 2016, and had the same results of the others.    Also, I dont doubt the benghazi info in the link you posted, but judicial watch is just as bad as msnbc for information.	But he isn't crazy. That wasn't a long term solution. The long game is.

I see the similarity you’re trying (and failing IMO) to make. A closed fist is not a verbal statement, from the commander and chief and no less, to “fight like hell”.	I’m not OP, and I asked for clarity from you about YOUR claims. I wanted a source from you to use to refuse other people’s claims, but obviously you’re no help. You don’t what to provide a source, fine, but make no mistake, you’re making claims too. You’re no better than him in refusing to back them up with sources.	0.789
This is literally part of the findings of the 1/6th committee. Getting Trump to tell his supporters to leave the capital was a big ask that was at best half-assed. You can call it sourceless conjecture all you want, but that just means you made no effort to identify the source.	<p>But to me, there are no qualities or stances of Biden that I voted *for*. I think anyone who voted for the Iraq war should be ousted from American politics forever. But what I think is not the world we live in. And I was at a place where I wanted to express my outward disapproval of Trump, more so than an affirmative vote for anyone else.</p>	0.878
The link the previous guy posted said the VP elect was at the dnc headquarters where the bombs were found.

Why are you adamant on protecting such a scum bag? I can tell you right now that if Biden said half the things Trump had I would also be calling to have him locked up, too.  I think you know that you backed the wrong pony here and, in the typical American fashion, are just digging in your heels harder rather than admit you might have been wrong.	<p>The ACLU seems to have made this statement more to defend the voice of certain groups than to defend the voices of all, but I can give them credit where it&#39;s due.

This is a bad bill and sad to see such support in the comments.  Paternity can't be proven at conception. So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.  This is going to be abused to hell and back, with seemingly no course for action for when the wrong man is held accountable.   A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.

You do know that your body doesn't know why it's producing the injected spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine, right? This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	<p>That&#39;s actually untrue. The vaccines have demonstrated significant decrease in symptomatic cases and hospitalisations from covid. No vaccine prevents anyone from catching a virus. They train your body to develop antibodies.

A lot of people had to eat local wildlife to survive the famines caused by Mao's Great Leap Forward, the modernisation of predominantly rural China.

I don't understand the title of this post. How is it that pro choice is equivalent to pro-life about one person.

1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.

Now maybe a society comes about that there&#39;s no point in maintaining an &quot;unwanted life&quot; but that gets really screwy and it goes against human nature in that in nature you needed more people generally due to strong death rates in the natural world.</p>	0.879
That's sad. I've been wearing Carhartt for ten years. But I can take a hoodie off, can't undo an experimental injection.	<p>I learned about SCD in athletes aged 10-30 my first year of medical school, well before the pandemic mind you all. It’s the number one cause of death in that age group for athletes. <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.91.5.1596"">Has been since at least 1995.</a> Where was the concern for this then?

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn't be further from the truth. It's not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as ""left wing"" as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant. It stinks of YouTube political commentary, which is oftentimes just laymen ranting.	0.879

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.  Plain and simple.	<p>The question of morality and whether you are pro choice or pro life really just comes down to whether or not you believe that abortion is murder.  Everyone views murder as bad.  Pro choice people just don&#39;t see abortion as murder, at least not before the point of viability.  You&#39;d be hard pressed to find anyone on either side of the aisle who is okay with late term abortions of perfectly healthy and uncomplicated pregnancies.</p>	0.86

"concerns about election security"  We can all go back and listen to the claims made by Trump and his legal team. These weren't just concerns.

They have companies like Amway.  Medical marijuana industry wants more lax FDA regulation than Big Pharma gets.  Their issue is not with weed but with the herbal supplement and vitamin market, giving weed products FDA medical labels without the years of research to back them.

> At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.  None of this was behind closed doors. Most of it was index fund ETFs which I was told was supposed to be the only allowable investment by this sub, and the rest of it was after the completely public bill text was unsurprisingly passed.  What a bullshit hit piece. It's talking about the ROI on 6 individual trades not his actual portfolio.  > But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%.  The S&P ETFs he bought way out performed this purchase by nearly double. After BA opted for private funding rather than the offered public funding.  What exactly did he do wrong and should be outlawed? Not including that he filed the disclosure extremely late, obviously.

Answer:👇  Sadly, it’s the West that’s been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia’s doorstep.  Putin hasn’t been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It’s been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What’s happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‘RESPONDED’ by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets’ military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America’s nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn’t having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn’t fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we’re a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.👇  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	<p>Europe would not be invaded. Do you think if US withdrew then Russia with it&#39;s janky army would launch an attack on Europe with UK and France being nuclear powers?

Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	<p>But we don&#39;t think that these laws are about security, because what they protect against just doesn&#39;t happen regularly and can be detected in other ways. This whole song and dance is bullshit to sneak in a poll tax. Republican governors will pass stuff like this and then close down all but one DMV location within bus range of a major city. Georgia just closed voting on weekends... when many Black people just so happen to vote. It&#39;s infuriating, and it says to me that you folks aren&#39;t arguing in good faith. You&#39;re passing laws to help you keep power despite the will of the majority of the people. You&#39;re breaking democracy. It&#39;s un-American. If your ideas are better then convince people, don&#39;t try to keep Black people from voting.</p>	0.853

I might care about this if the vaccine worked. All it does now is basically help you get less sick, like a complicated form of Tylenol. Doesn't stop the spread, doesn't stop you getting sick. The sheer uselessness of the vaccine in the face of omicron really sort of ended the whole mandate globally imo. Only the most fanatical leftists still cling to it. Previously vaccine-authoritative governments like UK and Israel have all but abandoned it.	<p>There is a CHANCE that the vaccine may help.  But in cases like with my uncle, being fully vaccinated did nothing. He still died from it. So if you feel you need the help then that&#39;s good but we need to stop acting like this vaccine is this amazing thing.

Voter ID is a #1 way to get that mostly done. Annual or Bi-annual purging of voter rolls to remove old or incorrect data would also be helpful. And for sure, IN PERSON VOTING ONLY, both early and on Election Day. That’s DAY, not 2 and 3 days later. And for God’s sake, no mail in voting except by request with proof of who you are and only for a couple of specific reasons (out of the country, etc)</p>	0.812

You have a bunch of obviously fit women with women’s bodies racing against what is obviously a dude, cock, balls, and all.

You say that they “don’t do ANYTHING” to stop the spread of a virus.  That in itself is just amazingly ignorant of basic physics. This is Kindergarten physics on the level of object permanence. Truly amazing. A face shield is better than Nothing. A paper towel stapled to your face is better than NOTHING. You need to think about the words you use. Words like “anything” and “nothing” have precise definitions and i encourage you to hit up your local library and check out a dictionary.   Are N-95 masks better than standard surgical masks? Absolutely, but if I sneeze into the air, those droplets and aerosols are going everywhere. If I wear a mask, the spread is heavily reduced. You know what would also add a layer of protection against the escaped droplets and aerosols? Social distancing.

I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even <em>had</em> covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don&#39;t know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d assume she was unvaccinated. So that&#39;s 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50. </p>	0.81

Some of the most left leaning people I know will listen to it and actively defend it, portraying it as some kind of sexual liberation (specifically, with the dance associated with the genre, which is basically just grinding). I suppose that makes sense within the context, but how do you justify the lyrics? Some of the most widely revered tracks are <em>insanely dirty</em> and hell, one of the dirtiest duos here just sold out their concert in PR’s largest venue. It’s crazy.</p>	0.711

Yes, and it was accurate at the time, with the original covid strain.

This actually makes sense because I have always thought that Jan 21st 2023 Biden is removed from office or steps down on his own.  That way whoever is VP would be able to run 2 more times for a total of 10 years, but then they picked Harris as the VP who is super unlikeable.  But if they put Harris in the Supreme Court then they can get anyone else as VP and then President in 2023.  It is all working out.	<p>Still would not surprise me if Harris becomes President due to the cognitive inability of Joe Biden by mid terms so she can fulfill a full 10 years. The media is beginning their campaign now, after propping up Biden for all of 2020, to set out that agenda. Slander Biden&#39;s cognitive state, grounds to remove him from office for being unfit.

We shouldn't do any interviews.... And that mod in the video basically said well I'm still going to do the interview with fox...hence the video... And when the community said... Why did you do the interview we voted on not to do any interviews and you sent the worst person to represent us the way they spoke dressed and gave anti work a bad name  The mods in the subreddit decided to ban everyone who spoke about it with the reason being trolls, right wingers, left wingers, brigadiers, and transphobes .... Soo much so that the community started making other subreddits because of this... And to protect themselves and not lose anyone else... They privated the sub to themselves.... Now no one can get in... Or do any changes	They also refuse to allow a page dedicated to Joe Biden scandals.. and if you go to the edit history and talk page for Barack Obama's page you'll see that they routinely undo any changes that add scandals to Obama's pa Wikipedia was once known for not allowing people to delete information just because  negatively reflected on a special interest group.. then Wikipedia became a Super PAC for the Democrat partyy and it's moderators spent all day trolling the site deleting anything that made Democrats look b	0.858

Thats alot different that Mitch Mcconell saying that he wont consent to anyone that Dems appoint.	<p>The hassle of it all, the precedent you set for all future engagement with election audits, being annoyed with the AZ state legislature and wanting to stick it to them because you can, there’s no compelling force behind a subpoena from a state legislative body, the election happened six months ago, the chance something small is wrong that people turn into something big—I can probably think of more reasons if I tried, but I think of it the same way as my default setting is saying no to unnecessary searches by law enforcement.

https://redd.it/sdbaff Here is someone trying to talk to the one who did the interview and she happily says she doesn't care about the community because she is doing politics.. or something like that i don't understand her reasoning....

I salute Tulsi as a principled person who is at least arguing from good faith and is willing to respect and accurately characterize her political opponents.	0.817
The truth that’s too difficult for you to swallow is that her voters are the reason the country is in decline along with Trump voters being the reason our country is in decline. We have horrible leaders because we have horrible systems. We have horrible systems because we’re too busy destroying ourselves than uniting ourselves to create a clear and concise consensus on reforming our painfully obviously broken systems.	The problem with shitty Democrat policies is if one state refuses them, that state will do very well and make the others look foolish. Desantis did this with lockdowns and school closures, which threw off their plans across the country as other states followed suit. The Democrats are still reeling from that, which is why their policy messages seem so confused right now.	0.901

Wait. He has a job. Just because it’s not 40 hrs a week why is he a lazy socialist? If he can support himself, which I wish Jesse would have asked, what is wrong with that? Yeah there are people on there who don’t want to work and be supported but the idea is to. work at a job that is not soul crushing and that you can support yourself on. The name “anti work” is misleading. They are more anti traditional work roles and don’t want to feel like they are being taken advantage of. I don’t think anything is wrong with that logic if they can support themselves.	THEY get to keep their jobs with salary. THEY are rarely held accountable for their poor decision making. And THEY end up playing politics and not admitting they were wrong because they need to be seen as a good leader. We are not involved with local politics enough to do anything about it.

Funny that's what the dog walker Doreen said. And he works 25 hours a week and isn't sure that's not to much.   Your concerns are legitimate in a few scenarios, however they took those talkings points and used them as a spearhead to accomplish the goal of not working at all or barely at all while screaming for more free shit. So in a way, the people shouting for more worker protections, have damaged the image of that argument more than any other group.	<p>For the “making more while unemployed..” I do understand the frustration. Even agree, however I think that’s more on Target/minimum wage(s) being shit or stagnant in most places for a decade or more. Doesn’t have to be from 7 -&gt; 15 right away but I think its time to talk about <strong>and do something about it.</strong> So at the bare minimum we aren’t sitting here wondering why welfare makes as much as a job.

Making baseless claims of voter fraud, filing law suits with no evidence, asking the Georgia Secretary of State to find a certain number of votes, encouraging your base to “fight” on jan 6, this is what attempting to steal an election looks like. Other republicans are now refusing to concede even when they loose by large margins. Yup definitely the Democrats trying to rig and steal elections. Bunch of stupid sons of bitches you are.	If democrats refuse to let you call ANYONE, every republican needs to shout from the rafters that they’re denying the president the right to call witnesses in his own defense. Nows the time to drag this out as long as possible, thereby pushing Biden’s adgenda into summer/fall and maybe even 2022 before negotiations are done. It will be fun to watch Lindsay Grahm and Ted Cruz bleed Democrat’s support down to nothing as they fail to get a conviction or move on policy issues, then tour the country helping house candidates argue the democrats wasted a year impeaching a private citizen in an unfair process.	0.895

Free healthcare isn't a far left ideology but ok. Plenty of regular left leaning counties have it.  Even England has it.

Most illegals do not pay state/federal taxes, as they work undocumented, under-the-table labor but still get the benefit of state provided services such as police, fire and EMS, roads and other infrastructure, which would be fine, but it also means that they can freely vote for more government spending and they will remain mostly unaffected (directly) by such action, meaning taxpayers and citizens foot the bill for more spending that they didn't vote for.

This country will never get out of debt. So many presidents rack it up in their tenure, and voters hate being taxed.  I live in Minnesota and I can't tell you how many people lose their minds over the fact that there's a surplus here. We generally have pretty good infrastructure, pretty good schools, and our local government takes issues seriously. Yet people lose their minds over the fact that things aren't at an exact zero sum on the budget.	Now Norway is far from a perfect utopia like a lot of redditors try to make it look, but it baffles me that USA and Norway can have such similar social and government structures, yet so many people in the states are scared by the slightest tax increase, even when the small increase causes large personal savings in the long run. Why so many go against their own interest? (Less student loan, no health insurance deductible, reducing economic desperation causing fewer crimes, etc).	0.858
Yes if we are speaking in the exact literal sense, you don’t need any money to survive. But we are intelligent people who can understand nuance and can infer that survive in this case actually means quality of life within an economic system that needs all participants thriving to be sustainable	<p>And participants in capitalism do have the option for their effort to be rewarded predictably. Most jobs have predictable pay. Entrepreneurship is obviously more of an all-or-nothing, but that&#39;s an entirely optional venture.

Alot of us felt the same way, we like to work but employment is out of control. Unfair wages, lying firing. A new home cost 300K, yet an office job with a degree will net 45k a year something is wrong	But I agree with some of it. Retail is a brutal job sometimes and is very frustrating. Target has provided 30 days of leave for those with comorbidities and extended leaves for those with Covid. One person was even told to stay out of state with pay and a small per diem when she caught it while at her parents. They have been very generous with the covid part. Unfortunately, it is retail and people will always feel unsafe and violated with the pandemic.	0.845

It used to be extremely anti job, then people started posting about how they actually wanted fair compensation for working, like actually getting a livable wage among many other things like having a safe work environment, which would increase staff happiness and productivity. So the sub transformed into that. Since the mod that did the interview was one of the original creators, they represented the anti job part, not fair compensation part, which is only a very small percentage of the community, and made 1.6 million people who actually just want unions in their workplaces look like lazy assholes who want do nothing but laze around.   On a side note, the interviewer was pretty demeaning, laughing during an interview is... not very professional.	<p>Minimum wage, like welfare, does not help people escape poverty. It just shackles them to it. Despite all the bad businesses that would screw over their employees, there are plenty (an abundance of small to medium businesses) that actually value employees as an investment that grows over time, as they train them internally and promote from within. These companies DO exist, and theyre more common than you believe. </p>	0.884

Off topic of that sub, but most subs on reddit are run by morons. I've been banned from like 4 or 5 for the most trivial reasons.  buildapcsales because morons misunderstood my title and said I was trolling by telling them how to get a gpu from b&h.  fantasybaseball because I dared say ozuna was innocent until proven guilty.  sportsbook because people didn't like my questions, which were totally on topic of the sub.  news because I said the pfizer ceo said the original vaccine was only beneficial in a limtied way and that twitter removed the vid when someone tweeted it.  I think 1 or 2 others also. And usually they don't even bother telling me how I broke any rule.	<p>I’ll agree that the virus was lied about and politicized from the start. Trump lied about the severity of the virus and said it would magically go away, he peddled ineffective drugs and harmful home remedies, and blamed everyone else he could. He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines. Everyone here says that the reason the US had so much trouble containing the outbreak is because of our land borders, and this is 100x more of an issue with state borders, except those can’t be locked down</p>	0.885
I'm sure they'll find a qualified candidate who fits that description. Diversity and inclusion is important.   I always thought stating it that way was kind of bad optics though.

You can't seriously tell me you believe they can't find a black woman as qualified for the job as Scalia, Roberts, Kennedy etc, right?	<p>You must be categorically incapable of functioning in life if this is what you&#39;ve understood people to be saying. Literally nobody contends that 100% of black people either don&#39;t tip or undertip.

I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court." Biden especially at his age probably has his cabinet taking the reigns moreso than others.  Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.  Unless of course you are saying that simply because he's a democrat, in which case I would ask that you try to be a little more open minded, as the dismissal of others simply due to political affiliation isn't really helping anyone.	Biden replied: ""No, well, I've gotta get the votes. I gotta get the votes. That's why — you know, the one thing that I — I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends even occasionally say, 'Well, if you can't get the votes, by executive order you're going to do something.' Things you can't do by executive order unless you're a dictator. We're a democracy. We need consensus.""	0.835

I would hope that everything else should be assumed with a supreme court candidate.

So are you so am I right in that the message is  "if you want free healthcare, you'll get communism instead and you won't get what you want" or something similar?  Really the fact that the person's face is angry makes the comic even more of a mess. Unless the intent is to day "you'll turn on it too," but the asking of the question it makes them sound like they're still hoping for it.   The face, doesn't match the stereotype and the comment, which makes me feel like this is poorly executed, unless I'm completely missing something here.	<p>They also say they’re economists and then they go into not liking his policies regarding the virus.

I mean... they support people being forced to take medicine they don't need. They loudly cheer when the unvaccinated die from Covid. They wish all the unvaccinated would die from Covid.   &#x200B;  That's... that's exactly what happened to the Jews. Being blamed for spreading a disease? [The Nazis did it.](https://www.jta.org/archive/typhoid-is-endemic-jewish-disease-nazis-say-in-issuing-warsaw-ghetto-rules) Being forced to take vaccinations? [The Nazis did it.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-medical-experiments)  > At the German concentration camps of Sachsenhausen, Dachau, Natzweiler, Buchenwald, and Neuengamme, scientists used camp inmates to test ***immunization compounds and antibodies for the prevention and treatment of contagious diseases***, including malaria, typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever, and infectious hepatitis.  It's really not that much of a stretch, tbh.	<p>Having said that, get vaccinated.   This is Trump&#39;s vaccine, and seeing red states suffer from Covid leaps is ridiculous.

I don't believe this trash response necessarily exposes BLM to be communist/sympathizers, I believe it just further highlights how single-minded they are.

Well sure, it wasn't a universal security measure , it was a deterrent against assassination plots.  The idea was that Obama could be managed, but Biden would be so bad that anyone considering a move against Obama would think twice.  Lone wolf crackpots are obviously different.  Picking the worst candidate from the field as your running mate is a pretty effective way of discouraging people from moving against you, either politically or lethally.  Very few people talk about this sort of think in 100% absolutes.  You should probably keep that in mind when reading posts.	People love to pick one of the two extremes; either it's super dangerous and we should all be scared of it or you're going to die! or, it's nothing special and we should just ignore it--it'll go away. The reality is that both of those need to meet in the middle. It's not a deadly virus (expected 0.038-0.009% mortality rate, but it can and does kill those who are immunocompromised (the old and immune system weak).

Go ahead, downvote this, but I'm a  member of this sub and Anti Work. If people want to go on strike or complain about their shitty work conditions they should be free to do so (America is a free country isn't that the point of America?). The real problem in the country is corporate communism, paying Elon 7k a car, billions to shitty corrupt banks, endless wars, etc etc etc.   &#x200B;  If you think that a bunch of inraged taco bell employees are the problem you are either the owner of that franchise or delusional.	If we went the way you suggest here, auto manufacturing and the cars they make (which you seem to love) would have gone bankrupt in America and we’d be buying all our vehicles from somewhere else. The government stepped in and footed the bill. The closest we’ve come to unrestricted capitalism was arguably the industrial era, and we had to go and break up monopolies and introduce restrictions. When we look at ex soviet bloc countries, that have little to no economic policy and almost no rules in place, they are total shitholes. Then of course theres the hypocrisy of “oh don’t restrict companies” and then big tech comes along and Republicans (the traditional free market folks - not to assume you are one) want to break em up and apply a myriad of rules on them.	0.871

I urge more conservatives to do the same, and just go fucking rogue at this point. Don’t feel compelled to vote for these cocksuckers just because they have a (R) next to their name. Especially that eyepatch wearing Warhawk fuck-stain Crenshaw. Jesus Christ, I can’t believe these people. This is why I continue to say democracy fucking blows. A simple stroke of a pen, and just the right amount of “Yay’s” can effect you in ways you don’t agree with, but you have to because now it’s law. How about you eat my un-wiped ass from the front?</p>	0.82

Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare. Life expectancy in Denmark is 80.8 years and achieves an infant mortality rate of 3.2 per 1k births. Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.  So yes. Let's be more like Denmark.	<p>2-3% need hospital beds. That’s 8 million people at least. The US has 80,000 ICU beds, so even if only 10% of them need ICU, we are lacking by a factor of 100 patients to one bed. </p>	0.83

How am I supposed to ever be right if no one can explain to me why I&#39;m wrong?</p>	0.786
I read this whole thread waiting for someone to state these important obvious facts.    You’re the only one that did.  Everyone here is acting like they were able to reopen without putting in the work.   They listened to their public health experts and then got vaccinated when it became available.   Huge difference there.  Yeah, if we had our shit together and had a functional public health system we could be just like Denmark.   Instead we’ll continue to decimate our hospitals and kill thousands every day, mostly from one specific unvaccinated political cohort.  Big brains in this sub.	I personally think that likely you are seeing the worst of the worst in terms of Covid, and that skews your outlook, even understandably, but when you take the whole of the population, it appears to me that the ""abuse of the healthcare system"" occurred when they started the panic, and added to it by doing all the ""great"" things we've heard of including running PCR tests at CT higher than 35 (and that's already high- and why I never take ""cases,"" into consideration) calling everyone who has died ""with"" covid as being killed ""BY"" covid, and thirdly (keeping the list short, but incomplete) failing utterly to divide the hospitalization and death statistics up by age range in news available to the general public, and subjecting young people to the preventative measures suffered by the old, completely unnecessarily.	0.876

Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.  If they're dead then we're super-mega-dead.	<li>While I&#39;m employed my health insurance is incredible for myself and my family. Easily affordable and manageable. My whole family is only $1200 a year with 2000 out of pocket max. Estimates for Universal Healthcare is WAY more PER PERSON. So my take home goes WAY down to subsidize others who probably don&#39;t contribute anything to the system. That&#39;s fucked up. </li>	0.863

Alright dick I will. Their executive leadership is incredibly different. Mary Barra has been incredible for them leading them to innovate further and they are at the front foot of the ev movement. They are finding new and creative ways to make money, for example developing their IT structure to innovate software within and sell that software as well. In 2008 and even until the early 2010s they were incredibly stagnant but now they are doing all the can to keep up and get ahead.	<p>I’d encourage you to apply for jobs you’d want to do even if you feel like you’re not qualified. I own my own business and some of my best hires over the years have been ambitious people who were otherwise completely unqualified for the position I hired them for.</p>	0.787
Yup, Scotland is very similar. I just traveled to both and God bless the USA but man anytime I get an opportunity to head over to Europe I jump on it. Edinburgh is a beautiful city, safe, very very clean compared to many US cities. People are reasonable, vaccinated, wear masks inside when have to, but bars, clubs, restaurants all open to full capacity. It's almost as if the universal healthcare system works when it's designed right....am I a conservative? Yes. Do I want to be on a ventilator? No. Do I feel extremely at risk? No. Does mRNA edit your genes and make you a government Democrat robot? Also no. Lol , it's not that hard people .	Now, having said that and establishing I'm not just a fanboy of one particular side, the Vaccine DOES actually work.  It protects fairly well against COVID breakthroughs (particularly Moderna) and even if you do get a breakthrough your case will likely peak at a cold or a mild flu.  People should choose to get the vaccine but I honestly don't care if you don't.  It's a free country.	0.754

Would we not be critical if this was r/leftists and they were say, I don’t know, making outlandish comments about wishing Trump was inside a building that collapsed, or on a beach hit by a tsunami?   Not only that but that’s exactly the type of things that happen that give ammunition to political opponents	<p>So let’s return to the intent of the original comment, the one I made an intentionally provocative response to.  My issue with your comment is that it seems to be intended, like the article itself, to make light of, and to trivialize, the violent attack on the US Capitol Building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of a presidential election.  An attack that was egged on by blatant disinformation spread by the sitting president himself and his clique of loyalists within the Republican Party, such as Ted Cruz.  An attack which resulted in the loss of several human lives, for those brain dead enough to think it was some big fucking joke.</p>	0.82

Italy's healthcare system is similar to theirs.

The only reason that stopped is Germany invaded Poland which didn&#39;t sit well with the American people.</p>	0.686

It is going into a few pockets mainly. This is the problem with how our system works. We permit companies to bid on projects and then the government selects a winner and pays them the agreed contract rate. We end up with companies charging millions of dollars to do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work, and then, we run out of money before we can possibly maintain everything properly.	The usd is worth what? 1% of what it was at its inception due to the governments response to every previous crisis, central bank policy attempting to kick the can down the road and make budget balancing the next administration (or the next generations) problem.   The artificial suppression of rates allowing the value of investments to outpace growth, so as to make money for the rich while leaving your middle and lower classes poorer each year.	0.85
Here's a video of McConnel saying they are holding back the nomination to give the people a voice in the decision of the nominee  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuY6FyP-qDk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuY6FyP-qDk)  And Biden did say similar, I'll give you that, but ultimately the republicans got their way. If they truly cared about the will of the people, which is what they primarily argued, then they would have waited two months to see how the presidency turned out. But they didn't and appointed someone who was unqualified because she was younger and very conservative in her views, and they knew Trump was rather unfavorable as the election drew closer.	<p>But the political climate has shifted alot since then. I would bet in the past 2 years, approval from the CDC has gone up on the left and down on the right. I will again bet, it you took a poll, people on the right would vote to remove funding from the CDC and the left would add funding. With that assumtion, I&#39;m going to make a further leap and say they will be looking to pander to the side thag approves of them. Don&#39;t piss off the people keeping you around. Also, stay in the good graces of the current administration...</p>	0.837

Expect act 77 was passed by general assembly and signed into law and not by executive fiat as you say. And it expanded and protected voting rights, not narrowed them like a poll tax would. Doesn’t the ideal democratic republic have every single eligible cast a vote. By your own argument every elected official in the Jim Crow south was elected fraudulently given that those election laws were later deemed unconstitutional.   And all this is ignoring the fact that this ruling will likely be overturned in time and the law probably will stand.	<p>I’ve never met a republican who wants to get rid of that pesky black vote, and yet if you listen to democrats, you’d think every one of us is clamoring to disenfranchise anyone with dark skin.  No, we just want secure elections. And since your voters do too, the only possible reason you have to oppose common sense measures like Voter ID is that you personally benefit from the current system. </p>	0.854

According to [this website](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/) only 64% of the population has received both vaccines.  And even if it were 75%, 5% of the us is like 16Million people. That’s over twice as much as the entire population of Denmark.   So with all that being said, I do think that the 5% would make a difference, even if everyone in the US was making a wholehearted attempt to follow guidelines, which we know isn’t true even with the fully vaccinated and boosted people.	<p>Population under 19 per wiki is ~3.5 million and this was beer math so pardon if I misspoke, but 5 out of 3.5mil is the 0.00014 number, we can make the arguement that not all of this population has been infected, but unless only 1% of those under the age of 18 have been exposed, then you are still more likely to go to the hospital with a heart condition due to the vaccine than die of covid.</p>	0.863
Ok, just pointing this out... this law was pass in 2019 by a Republican legislature, and signed by a Democratic governor... and a good number of the conservative state legislators who voted in favor of the bill ~2 1/2 years ago have turned on it... so this is not the clap that you think it is...	<p>The problem is that election laws <em>were not</em> legally modified in 2020.  In 2020, many state and local officials <em>ignored</em> election laws to accommodate covid.  This is the key point where the Republican argument wins.  For example, Texas law is explicit in disallowing drive-through voting for most people.  Some Texas counties did it anyway.</p>	0.847

Do you honestly think people are going to get one vaccine and not the other? We both know that extra 5% won’t matter to you. Then you will start whining about why the other 20% didn’t get it even though in the real world it is impossible to ever vaccinate 100% of the population	Children that do not have cancer, or some other immuno-compromising condition have NO place getting this vaccine.  It will help in almost NO way to give it to young healthy kids.  99.999% of children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms, or extremely mild symptoms.  My kids had COVID-19 and you'd never have known it.  Runny noses and slightly less energy for 18 hours for them.  That was it.  There is GREATER RISK giving them this vaccine than there is any benefit.	0.864
The entire reaction of every individual makes a difference.  Every single American who couldn’t stomach a mild inconvenience makes a difference.   That’s how collective action works.   We’re only as strong as our weakest links.    They all publicly self-identified.  Every single act of basic mitigation became a marker of political identity.   The cake was baked at that point yes.	<p>So yeah, this should be a massive concern for every American, and the fact that people are numb to it is evidence that tyrants have won half the battle already.</p>	0.81

Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few. He also expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. These are all things that all Republicans and even many Democrats vehemently attack.      Eisenhower was not an outlier among Republicans. Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards. These are all things we now deem "liberal," or "socialist," but they were widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike only a couple of decades ago.	<p>Trump had an amazing economy. <strong>Everybody</strong> does better in a good economy.

You are mixing two different stories.     There was a pipe burst @ 6am in the morning, it was taken care of in a couple of hours.     @ 11pm opening the envelopes stopped, which observers are supposed to be there for.  Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.  Zero impact on races. Look at the fraudulent elector scam with forged documents, getting zero news coverage by right-leaning news sources.	For example, the left has spent the last six months saying that the 2022 elections are fraudulent *in advance* because they can no longer drop a truckload of ballots off in a small, unmonitored box in the middle of the night.	0.838

Your first four paragraphs apply equally to folk on the right.   Politics is largely a construct of the leadership class designed to keep everyone else entrapped in an “us vs them” war while the leaders control things.   Look at Trump, he’s changed his political affiliation five times since 1987 and only went republican in 2012.   People at the top don’t care about left vs right, they just want the people below them to care.	<p>I get your point and I don&#39;t have too much of an issue with the tax cuts, republicans had control of senate and white house and they will always lobby for corporations. But we were already bailing them out with spending, why also give them tax cuts? Anyways, we will suffer the economic consequences of that decision in the coming years and I guarantee republicans are going to blame the biden administration when it was something he inherited.

Biden had some foreign experience that Obama lacked, but he was also generally known for his gaffes.   Biden wasn't even on the short list to be Obama's VP.  That's tells you right there he wasn't chosen because he was the best or obvious pick.  And Biden didn't expect it either.     This was all rewritten in the media over the following years to try and recast the Biden pick as the obvious choice and shore up both Obama and Biden.   If you read stories from the last few years, they tell a different story from these written in 2008:  https://www.wkyufm.org/post/obamas-potential-vp-shortlist#stream/0  https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=5615823&page=1	Now let's look at the article. The article picks up this 54,259 number and reports it as ""shocking"" but generally acknowledges that this number is not meaningful. But oh the headline: ""Wisconsin 2020 Election Investigation Finds More Illegal Votes Were Cast Than Biden's Margin of Victory"".  The law firm absolutely did not find that there were this many ""illegal"" votes. They have a section that addresses illegal voting actually, titled ""We found limited instances in which ineligible persons voted or attempted tocast ballots"". Note that they say that people ""attempted"" to vote? They note that 300 people attempted to vote illegally. All but 132 of these were rejected by state officials. 130 of these votes were registered to people whose address were PO Boxes which I guess is illegal in Wisconsin and 2 were from people may be dead.	0.843

Sure you can, you just have to be willing to pay the price when some lib puke DA calls it an accusation instead of a rape and charges you for defending the girl from an ongoing criminal sexual assault.     "At the time of his death, Quintanilla had an arrest warrant out for continuous sexual abuse of a different child and assault family violence, police said."	<p>Here is the deal, you know this, but the vast majority of the people being held without bail and those that have been indicted or charged did break windows, assault police or smear shit on walls. ALL of these offenses constitute crimes and the offenders should be punished. But cut the crap with your deep concern about these crimes.

As a society have acknowledged the fact that males have high testosterone levels,  and women have low levels.  This leads to different mindsets around sex. Generally women want a commitment and love when have sex. Men are just happy to have sex.  Since girl students are not going to get commitment and love we see that they have been taken advantage of.  The boy student got sex so good for him.  If the male student were younger that would be different.  I'm not saying it is ok,  but that is why people respond the way they do.	<p>we should accept the poor suffering transsexual instead of picking on something he can’t control.

Let me clarify my stance.  I think gerrymandering should be illegal.  Voting districts Should be based on population and should not be drawn by either party.  I would perfer the popular vote as I believe each person should have an equal voice.	<p>But in any case, are you saying that when this law is passed, <em>no eligible voters</em> will be turned away? Do you think we can do this with absolutely zero collateral damage, or do you not care about the wrongfully disenfranchised, or is not allowing these people to vote your goal? Look at Democratic voting reform proposals and they all seek universal enfranchisement. If you can guarantee that you can probably get whatever security measures you want. </p>	0.84
This, trans raping girls in bathrooms, and trans taking over women’s sports were predictable consequences of the breakdown in definitions of traditional marriage and sexuality but it was dismissed by those who thought love is always the answer.	<p>Yes there are a myriad of types of contraception. But even that isn&#39;t cut and dry. Doctors continuously deny woman the ability to chose to have their tubes tied. So even if a woman knows she doesn&#39;t want kids she still has to meet some fairly arbitrary prerequisites. Usually a certain age, plus a certain number of kids. We often don&#39;t allow women this choice. She can just abstain from sex for how ever long a doctor requires, but sex is one of the better parts of life, seems cruel to require absentia from it.</p>	0.822
But conservative lawmakers and judges have fought against legislation to end gerrymandering. Where the posts about the maps in red states?  Unless… it didn’t matter then?	<p>As for the political side of this, if you&#39;re going to argue that conservatives are working against the rights of businesses then you haven&#39;t been watching the news. Ron DeSantis is pushing laws that don&#39;t allow private companies to require vaccines while getting widespread conservative support. It&#39;s simply not up for debate that conservatives today care more about being outraged at the liberals than actually having principles. This isn&#39;t the same movement my parents were a part of. I don&#39;t even know what you can call a movement that screams about gun rights and then froths at the mouth to support a gun confiscation proponent like Trump.</p>	0.817
Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with an adult male having sex with a 13 year old female. *If the female is of reproductive age, and is willing, its just nature.*   Chimps, our closest relative, often give birth to their first baby at the age of 13-14, orangutans are generally 13-15. They have a similar life expectancy to us, if we ignore modern medicine. We have decided as a culture that this is not allowed, and there are good reasons for it, and I am in no way advocating for sex with minors. To say however that it is fundamentally wrong is just incorrect.	<p>The current, and somewhat recent, veneration of abortion as a moral virtue and the outright denial of the humanity of the baby has erased the ability to have an actual conversation on the subject, intentionally so. Our understanding of fetal development allows babies born as early as 22 weeks to be fully viable. We can now literally see into the womb and see a tiny human with its own digestive system, with eyes that move, its gender, or it reacting to the sound of the parents voice. Advancements in technology allow us to see that a baby in the 2nd trimester isn&#39;t &quot;just a clump of cells&quot;.</p>	0.822

In the year 2022, yes there is. It's the Republican Party, more specifically the libertarian/constitutionalist faction. They are ones advocating for school choice, police & criminal justice reform, more economic liberty, and a cultural shift back towards intact nuclear families. All things that Black Americans would draw crucial advantages from, even more so than other Americans.  > even voted against MLK, Jr. Day being recognized  So you base your voting decisions on the distant past. Okay. Where exactly do you draw the line? 2010? 1980? Surely somewhere after 1965, right? After all, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party, **and** the pro-Jim Crow party? So how come you don't eschew them for past misdeeds?  I'd argue that the Republican Party has an imperfect, yet infinitely better track record at how the treat Black Americans than the Democrats.

I joined in the Coast Guard and had to be up to date with my vaccines. In fact it is required every year to be up to date. If they can't comply with a direct order for the safety of their unit, community, and themselves then why serve?  Why is the COVID vaccine the hill you die on as opposed to all the other vaccines?	<p>Now let me address you second argument. Yes, doctors and nurses have been tackling covid-19 for over a year now with a vaccine and have gotten by. They didn’t have a choice. Whether for better or worse, they were forced to treat patients  infected with a deadly virus, risking bringing it home with them or spreading it to others in public (becuase PPE’s are not 100% perfect). Now that they have the option to take the vaccine, they have the opportunity to continue delivering patient care in a manner that is SAFER for themselves, their family, other non-covid-19 patients they also see in the hospital. Not taking the vaccine presents an inherent risk to spreading the virus to other people that might not be able to get fully vaccinated or cannot reap the benefits of the vaccine (immunocompromised, cofactors with lung health, age). So with doctors and nurses who are refusing to get the vaccine, not only are they refuting the very science they spent years studying, but they are now also putting others at risk. That is a direct conflict with their responsibilities as health care providers. If you can avoid putting other people at risk but you choose not to for personal reasons, goodbye. Go find another hospital to work at.</p>	0.845
So the negative economic Indicators occurring under Biden don’t count since he didn’t cause covid, right? Or does your little far right pea brain struggle with consistency?   Remember when you traitors were crying about results coming in after midnight during the election? As if it wasn’t Republicans who passed laws that forbid the counting of mail in ballots until after midnight? Really highlights how fucking stupid yous all are.	It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.	0.879

No blame, exactly, since this is a “both sides” thing. But literally all of the anti-gerrymandering legislation and lawsuits have been created by Democrats and fought against by Republicans. So this must be what Republicans gambled on and wanted.

Don’t be outraged by something that has been planned for and accepted by the GOP.	<li><p>Amnesty would secure a permanent Democrat majority for the next generation.

That&#39;s why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this &quot;They&#39;re the <em>real</em> racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if <em>we</em> did that?

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country.

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all.

It is actually a very Christian thing.  - the song is demonizing war and war mongers.  Jesus would be a fan.	<p>John Cooper hits the nail on the head. They are using the church to project blatantly anti-Christian beliefs. They use confusing terms solely so they can destroy anyone that steps even the tiniest out of line. They use terms like &#39;anti-racist&#39; to advance their agenda. You obviously aren&#39;t racist, so you believe this way. You don&#39;t? Well then, you are racist. So therefore you feel obligated to go along with their beliefs. They talk a lot, but yet don&#39;t actually do anything. </p>	0.824

Aight I’m convinced you’re a troll because after looking at even a bit of your profile you’re not Christian at all, but I’ll humor you. All of the members of Sabbath grew up and remain religious, mostly part of the Anglican Church, but their lead lyricist, Geezer Butler, is catholic. Any religious person who listens to them can see that in their lyrics and know that their “dark” persona, is just a persona, not sac religious or anti-god. Educate yourself	<p>Like I don&#39;t condemn people for being religious, and there&#39;s 0 evidence for theology and its validity compared to the numerous papers and decades of research on transgender individuals.  I am to respect their views despite them being based in no actual evidence and often not even based on the Bible they claim to source their views from. Instead they impose their views upon me instead of acknowledging the reality for how it is, and call me a sinner and attempt to legislate my rights away for the sole reason of me being different. That&#39;s legislating against liberty and individuality of Americans and we can&#39;t let government do such things and harm vulnerable individuals in a free and just society.</p>	0.841

I'm just going to post this here, in case anyone hasn't had a chance to read it:  https://canada-unity.com/mou/  These are the demands from the convoy leaders.  To summarize, it doesn't say "remove COVID restrictions" or "remove vaccine mandates". It says "because of COVID restrictions, hand over control of the federal government to the convoy's leadership".  Edit: Downvote all you want. Convoy supporters can keep burying your heads in the sand, but that doesn't change the fact that you're being played.	As far as Covid-19, you are absolutely free to believe as you wish; just don't push those beliefs off on me, because while I'll agree that social distancing may help, hand washing may help, but masks do nothing but collect bacteria (go to cdc.gov and run a chart on the most heavily masked states and those that don't mask at all and you will see through Covid Hospitalizations and Deaths why I say that.

But the say that the parties swapped because of racism is ridiculous. They swapped because of a handful of issues such as small government and pro-life, but racism is not one of them. The South turned from Democrat to Republican in the 90s as the older racist Democrat politicians that fought against civil rights finally died out and were replaced.	0.86

Lol no.  Having the coolest insults and writing style since 4th grade recess doesn't make a chad.    If you want to pick a conservative role model, aim higher.  Trump is the equivalent of shooting yourself in the leg trying to unholster.	In the next at least 2 years but maybe even 4 or 8, Mitch is going to be the most important lump of 'no' in America. And for him to say 'no' to Joe Biden over and over again he is going to need to run a tight ship with no excess baggage. Purely as political gamesmanship, hitting Trump on the way out cost him and Republicans next to nothing but gives them quite a bit.	0.831
What are you going on about? The guys gone. For reasons other than the protest. They didn't see him getting the job done, so they voted to replace him. If the liberals would follow suit maybe we wouldn't be as fucked as we are. Although, one will just replace the other I suppose. No winning with this liberal government.	But at the same time, I don't think he's the best way forward. The majority of people who voted for Biden, just didn't like Trump. If we can choose someone like DeSantis, or someone who isn't so controversial, that will be the best way forward for the country. If we can unite the country in conservative ways, that's the choice I'd go with.	0.851

#fakenews....ITN news ran fake stories about Serbia.  They manufactured consent to bomb Serbia.  They pretend that firefights between KLA and Serbs were genocide rather than combat.  Same thing with fake gas attacks in Syria.  Media lies.	So let’s return to the intent of the original comment, the one I made an intentionally provocative response to.  My issue with your comment is that it seems to be intended, like the article itself, to make light of, and to trivialize, the violent attack on the US Capitol Building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of a presidential election.  An attack that was egged on by blatant disinformation spread by the sitting president himself and his clique of loyalists within the Republican Party, such as Ted Cruz.  An attack which resulted in the loss of several human lives, for those brain dead enough to think it was some big fucking joke.	0.808

That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	<p>Abortion is not a religious issue any more than any other crime is. I&#39;m not religious and I am extremely anti abortion. We have no scientific evidence of when human life begins. Until we are 100% certain that the thing consuming nutrients and reproducing cells is not a living creature, <em>we shouldn&#39;t be killing them by the millions.</em></p>	0.915

Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.	<p>Since you are concerned with 41,000 deaths a year from 2nd hand smoke then why wouldn’t you be for Covid? CDC records for the past two years show in excess of 200K deaths due to Covid or presumed Covid. If we assume a conservative number out of those are real and use, say, only 30% out of that then we still have a higher death rate than 2nd hand smoke. So again, if you are indeed concerned with 2nd hand smoke, then why wouldn’t you be concerned about Covid? </p>	0.868
I think its a very small percentage of nurses who actually quit or got fired to avoid taking the vaccine.

I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	It is something that shouldn’t be a problem.

Based on Haynes v US (1968, US Supreme Court) a felon/prohibited possessor can’t be required to register a firearm as that would violate his 5th amendment right against self-incrimination.

I don't make money from the vaccine in any capacity. My concern about this is a pharmacist for my patients and my pay doesn't go up or down a single cent with sales from medication.  It's honestly insulting that you think my concern for people suffering from the vaccine is from monetary gain and not from genuine concern.	But since the vaccines don't prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there's likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren't being noticed because they don't have a reason to get tested. They don't have symptoms to test for. So even if they're positive and contribute to spreading covid as much as an unvaccinated person, they haven't had any reason to believe they were sick.	0.864

i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence. If you are being bullied and stand up for yourself , you get in trouble.

It's literally in the first sentence of the article:  > OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said bringing in the military to deal with protesters who have gridlocked downtown Ottawa is not on the table, and is not something his government would agree to quickly if a request is made.	I don’t condone what occurred, and those who entered the Capital should absolutely be charged with the appropriate charges, but it doesn’t seem like an attack. It seems like a protest that got out of hand combined with a lack of preparation (and likely dismissive projections) by the DC Metropolitan Police, Capital Police, and local authorities. An ‘attack’ implies that planning and/or leadership went into planning the specific action of entering the capital, for which there is no proof.	0.808

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take “global perspectives,” which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn’t have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who’s a minority or has a “unique world view” (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I’m mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn’t speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it’s a threat - including stuff like “global perspectives” classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn’t have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn’t need any video/audio evidence of it and I’m a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	She wasn’t asked whether she stands by her comments **because** they were “anti-communist”. To me (having only read the article and watched the 2 minute video), it seems like the question was brought up specifically in regards to how her comments would effect her relationship with her future opponent, who is from China.	0.798

They are.. i own a glock 17 gen 5 moa and it came with 3 magazines that hold up to 16 rounds each . Which is kinda to low in my opinion.  I looked it up and you can get 50 round drum mags for glocks…  Thing is not that democrats care about our safety, it takes more than one shot to put down a potential threat.  Say some one breaks into my home with the intent to harm my family , if i manage to not miss my first few shots due to adrenaline dump and i hit my target, unless its a headshot then one or two hits wont always stop a person… this is why you hear from the left that “so and so cop shot a guy 7 to 8 times” well thats because they keep shooting till the threat is neutralized.  People who don’t own guns i think do not understand that one bullet is not enough to stop a threat. And im willing to bet part of that is thanks to movies.	<p>Now I&#39;ve watched about 500 videos of police shootings over the past few months (not an exaggeration).  The conclusion I think is extremely obvious is this:  Police shootings are almost always technically justified.  But in most cases they are also avoidable.  Oftentimes the police put themselves in a position where they are foced to use their guns becayse they&#39;ve ran out of other options.  Most people shot by police are armed with sharp edged weapons or some kind of club.  And most shootings happen in a location where the suspect does not present an immediate threat to anybody (other than the police).  My advice, if they were to ask it, would be that the police keep their distance as much as possible, until better less-lethal measures can be employed, or until mental health pros can arrive on scene.  Another thing they could do is to stay in their cars, where a suspect armed with the weaopns I mentioned cannot pose a serious threat to them.  They could even try using their cars to knock the suspect over, the goal being to disarm in the process.</p>	0.818

America is in need of a witch hunt and the prosecution of people whose ideas aren’t in line with laissez-faire capitalism and the unabated exploitation of working people?   I really don’t understand—what do you think a communist in America looks like? Some stereotype of a Russian or Chinese person who is obviously a sleeper agent or spy?  Silencing your freedom of speech does not equal communism. Authoritarianism is not communism.	By communism they don't mean communism, because they don't know what it is. What they actually mean historically is bolshevism, the right-wing precursor to totalitarianism that developed in the Soviet Union. The US had a major attack on labor earlier in the last century and anti-labor oriented US business and political interests attacked supporters of labor/workers as being communists by associating people advocating for more democracy, better labor standards, equality, unions as advocates for the brutality of the Russian state, and wanting to bring that to America.	0.887

Page 23 paraphrased to:  &#x200B;  In particular, vaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, the envelope of the virus, which is a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people. In the long term, the vaccinated are far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein, even if they have already been infected and cured once or more.    The unvaccinated, on the other hand, will gain lasting (if not permanent) immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being naturally infected with it even once.	<p>That&#39;s actually untrue. The vaccines have demonstrated significant decrease in symptomatic cases and hospitalisations from covid. No vaccine prevents anyone from catching a virus. They train your body to develop antibodies.

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   “You only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.” Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let’s be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao’s China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	<p>And well, the way I see it, &quot;The government is not stifling your speech, Twitter is.&quot; is a clear cut argument against capitalism.

So you're all cool if I stop here by with left leaning opinions? I'm not going to get insta-banned?  Awesome.  Let's see...  Tax cuts for the wealthy are bad for the economy. Capitalist business owners who pay workers less than the value of what they produce are leeches mooching off of poorer people who create the actual value. Abortion wouldn't be as common if "pro-life" advocates instead advocated for universal health care, universal free access to birth control, and sex education in every school, but if Republican politicians actually supported that they'd lose single-issue voters so it will never happen. The Republican Party has no real platform and has completely succumb to Trumpism which is little more than a cult of personality around a failed elitist millionaire who doesn't care about anyone who isn't currently kissing his ass. Critical Race Theory hasn't ever been taught in elementary schools. Banning books you disagree with isn't going to stop your kid from eventually realizing they're gay or transgender if that's who they really are and you not accepting them as they are makes you the freak, not them.   Is that enough for a ban, mods? Muh free speech!	We would spend less on healthcare as a nation and have better outcomes with a public plan economic study after study has proven.

The responses to your question fog up what he ACTUALLY said.  He talked about the badness of whiteness for the vast majority of the podcast.   That whites are genetically incapable of sympathy and such.  That is NOT why he was fired from his job.  He was talking to an ex-member of Public Enemy ("Professor Griff")...who was in full agreement.  Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).   One bonus of free speech is that it allows us to identify these fools, too.... otherwise, they hide their true feelings.	<p>Set your straw man down please sir.

Something that has bothered me since becoming a parent is this:  Gotta watch everything you but on the baby from sunscreen to fabrics because they're system is so new and sensitive they could have reactions. Same with medicine. There are stuff like all natural drops and Tylenol that isn't recommended until so many months in.  But, let me shot em up 32 (I can't remember the actual number but I'm probably not far off) times in their first year with a chemical cocktail.  All my kids are fully immunized but I just think it's odd the level of inconsistency. Couldn't we wait a bit? Maybe a year or two? We already have herd immunity and likelihood of infection at their age is so low.  I dunno, it just smells like a dock in here.	<p>I wouldn&#39;t really say it&#39;s mild for everyone though. I have a VERY strong immune system and I get sick maybe once every 2-3 years. So the fact that it knocked me on my ass like it did surprised me. I cancelled all my Christmas plans because some of my family members are unvaccinated and there is no doubt in my mind that if I were to attend, they would catch it.</p>	0.88
I don’t take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being “retarded” ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I’m proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity. I do wish you the best in life.	<p>The only people saying the unvaxxed aren’t welcome are doomers like you. The average person literally does not give a shit about this anymore. They either got the vaccine, and moved on with their lives, or don’t want to get it because they understand the risks and are okay with them. Last year I’d go into a store without a mask and some people would bat an eye, but not anymore. After I got the vaccine I’ve basically lived my life as if this never happened, and quite frankly before getting the vaccine I wasn’t worried about this for more than a few weeks. Nobody in my family took any precautions, aside from just sanitizing things like shopping carts before handling them, and my parents are not only old, but also both have bad immune systems, and even they didn’t give a damn about this.</p>	0.854
Lia Thomas is a biological male and the definition of misogyny is "prejudice against females" and Lia Thomas is easily eliminating females competitively with extreme prejudice therefore "she" and "her" supporters are misogynists.	<p>Regardless, the double standard is ludicrous. The overcorrection of legitimate social issues has turned into a witch hunt against straight white men. It’s almost laughable tbh, it’s like yeah, there are social issues that stem from the system as a whole, but people fail to realize that it’s a rich vs poor issue, because of the emotional attachment that the media takes and spins, which captivates the infatuation of self pity by these types of people, and instead of bettering themselves, it’s easier to create a scapegoat and blame someone else for their short comings in life. </p>	0.842
The Olympic as a whole is a joke. You don’t even have to compete for your own country anymore. The Chinese team is hockey team is made up of Americans, Canadians and a Russian.   Why would I support something making millions of dollars for the country that let a virus escape their lab, not ask for help, blamed Americans for starting, and shut down the world for two years.	<p>So no. If the previous administration did targeted lockdowns, and followed that up with recurring payment to citizens, like every other developed nation did, we wouldn&#39;t be where we are today. But the failure to take care of the citizens is now being used as an argument against the whole thing. Other countries, like canada, did lockdowns and sent everyone $2k a month. Wonder why the richest country in the world couldn&#39;t manage that.</p>	0.842
Nothing will change until women on these teams simply walk away from it.  Obviously it's easier said than done, but as long as they compete with biological men, then biological men will play (and dominate) with women.	<p>This is not because they do not know the value of human life. Far from it. These social media users know full well the sanctity of life, but they truly believe that the deaths are worth it in order to remove Republicans from positions of power.

So what I don't understand is why is it always the males thinking they are women and compete against real women yet you don't (or rarely) see it the other way around?	<p>That&#39;s like saying men aren&#39;t supposed to have emotions when women clearly are more emotional and shouldn&#39;t try to suppress that tendency to be more like men.  So no, this has nothing to do with men not being nurturing. They obviously can be nurturing, but women are clearly more driven by emotions and that&#39;s what makes them better equipped to focus more of their attention on nurturing than being breadwinners.</p>	0.796

And while I think his mind will be fine, I think the man should just rest and enjoy his retirement. The man spent decades working long hours. His cumulative time spent sleeping over the course of his life is probably lower than that of many people half his age. He&#39;s in his 70s. He was cheated out of a second term, even setting aside the questionable election results. (The Democrat weaponization of COVID was very much real (in terms of the fear, not a bioweapon, so shut up lefties) and that all gets used as fake talking points to pretend his policies led to many of the issues we saw, ignoring the glaringly obvious context of a pandemic.) He should just live out his days in a less stressful manner. Play a kingmaker role, enjoy Florida&#39;s sunny weather. Take it easy. Enjoy his golden years.</p>	0.748

The wikipedia for trans athletes lists a number of ftm athletes. But only three have competed against men. A college swimmer, a boxer who has had one professional fight as a man, and an olympic duathalon.  Realistically even giving a buttload of testosterone is not going to bridge the gap of a female body vs a male body.   But we also see more men who think they are women, it's a very recent change for so many teen girls to think they are boys, and I believe they also make up the biggest percentage of people who detransition.	<p>Case in point. You argue that men have always competed against men. If you switch from sport to acting you see a completely different dichotomy. In ancient Greece women were forbidden from acting and only males could play the role of women?  This continued throughout Europe during Elizabethan times. There was no competition. You can argue that a man can act as a female better than a female acting as a female.  But he could never act as an XY because he would fail the basic test required to pass in the first place.</p>	0.772

This is why the Chinese call us baizuo.

All that hard work to make women’s sports viable gone down the tubes in the name of insisting that transwomen are really truly women.	<p>Even that isn&#39;t true equality because she gets power over life and death and I just get power over finances, but it&#39;s still closer to equality than the shit show we have now where women get the best of both worlds and men get jack shit.</p>	0.794

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband’s current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn’t still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband’s tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.	I agree with you on Trump's spending, however I don't think Biden will be better. So on that front I just don't see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump doesn't have the personality I want.

I think the democrats and the CCP are in bed actually. The stuff they push at it’s core is neo-Marxist ideology that bases the oppressor oppressed dichotomy on race and identity instead of by wealth and power like soviets.

I’m not willing to take that chance.	<p>As for most dems wanting a blend - at least in the internet arguments I see and pushes from the media, I don’t see that being the case at all. I’m sure the common democrat is that way, but that’s not how the party is skewing. You can’t have the best aspects of capitalism when there’s a constant push for “equity” the way that it is defined today.

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	1. Amnesty would secure a permanent Democrat majority for the next generation. This would help RINO's because the last thing they want is to be in power (unless they're at the head of the table) you see what most of these congressional Republicans really want is to collect donations and bitch about things they cannot control or really do anything about. That's why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this ""They're the *real* racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if *we* did that?

Again, what lack of confidence? What you see is backed up by research and it's the reason why you haven't listed a single example of a major shift in recommendations yet.   The only thing you can talk is about is masks, which at first weren't recommended due to fear of shortages for medical personnel. Guidelines change, get used to it.	Scientific research is really hard to value because ideally, you avoid ever having to know how much you lost. So for example with the invention of antibiotics we can’t know how many lives were saved so we can’t begin to assign a value to it. So really, science should be one of those areas where we don’t expect to turn a profit and monetary “losses” should be weighed in different terms than, say, a manufacturing business.</p>	0.866

There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why?

If you see a group of 10 people, and 1 of them is dressed like a nazi and no one is kicking that person out, or telling them to at the very least fuck off, there is a group of 10 nazis.

And FYI the city police have estimated the rally to be between 7,000 and 15,000 protesters at its peak. While that is the first ten of thousands, it is not tens of thousands.

>Trump is getting awfully close to joining Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams in the Sore Election Losers Club.  regardless of the issues with the election, trump whined constantly about it when he clearly lost  i hate biden as much as anybody, but if we want to win back power from the left we have to look at how trump's behavior and attitude put a ton of people off. and look at the left. they can't govern for shit. they have control of everything, are doing what they said they would do, and people absolutely hate their guts for it. all the next guy needs to do is say "we can't run your life better than you can" and stop forcing people to do things and taking their money. enough people in the middle will flock back over and they will lose power. how you end up with another idiot in office is by refusing to look at why trump lost, which is that his style is polarizing and extremely easy for the left to raise support against	<p>Trump was depicted very badly by the media which was partially why he lost. However, he did himself no favor tweeting garbage and saying nonsense. I still remember that first debate with Biden. That turned off a lot of independents voter right off the bat, and him being sick with Covid allowed Biden to opt out of one of the three debates. Biden literally sat in his basement and did not campaign. The Dems would absolutely LOVE to run against Trump.

That's what is sad in our age. Revolution like the ones we can read in our history book can't never happen again. So there's no scenario in which we can take up arms and win - the result would be the total opposite. It will expedite our descent into fascism for the next couple of centuries, just like it happened in history, with the First Representative Democracy spreaded and upheld by Ancient Greece and the Roman Republic. Their democracy lasted for almost as long as ours now, couple of centuries, before falling into totalitarism because of social and economical issues that plagued the world at that time. It is the cycle of life and I can't see how it is possible to escape it.	<p>But it stunned me how many were waiting for amnesty and how prevalent that discussion was.

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	<p>We should raise awarness to get that changed though. idk how, but i guess an okay way to start is just to keep bringing it up every time someoje brings up the 2nd amendment. Both should be amended, no amendments are untouchable, Thomas Jefferson was right (except for all his racism lol, mainly on that the constitution should be looked at for revision every 20 years or so).</p>	0.784

A little off topic but governments of the world have literally murdered millions. Why suddenly do they care about saving EVERY single person with a vaccine that does literally nothing.

Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	<p>HIPAA protects you from that business then sharing your vaccination status with others.

Additional data The Blaze received from Renz showed: a 269% increase in myocardial infarction, 291% increase in Bell’s palsy, 156% increase in congenital malformations of military members' children, 471% increase in female infertility, and 467% increase in pulmonary embolisms.	<p>So has heart disease and cancer.

I happen to be conservative myself, but I have a general disagreement with a lot of Republicans. For instance, I think Regan was the opposite of conservative with his financial policymaking: he implemented untested policies while a top banker whispered in his ear. I do believe that many conservatives mean well and want to defend their freedoms, but the conservative leaders for the past 50 years have been snake oil salesmen.	While I am more centrist than conservative, I respect that some people hold conservative views and I like(d) some conservative politicians (like McCain) and I absolutely see why it seems like good idea to big part of population. What I don't agree with is PiS: They aren't only conservative, they slide to authoritarianism which I think nobody on this sub really agrees (freedom of speech and stuff, you know).	0.836

“Obvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities”  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.  Conservatives want a strong leader who will do what’s right for the country without engaging in inflammatory, childish attacks and furthering the divide in this country. We need a presidential candidate who can have honor, dignity, and class. Trump unfortunately does not possess those qualities and never will.   Yes I voted for him in 2020. No I will not vote for him again.	<p>&quot;I told you so&quot; aside, this is a serious issue and the reason he skipped around the subject before the election is because the left and the right <em>both</em> would feel concern by the idea. Why? Because if Biden can do it, a [theoretical] future Trump administration can. </p>	0.874
You wanna hear some real stupidity? People commenting things like “stupidity knows no bounds” in a conservative sub when you’ll go to a dem sub and see the exact same comments there. If you picked 10 random comments in both subs and got rid of the obvious words that’d give it away, no one would be able to accurately say which sub the comments came from because they’re all the same comments.   C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb” C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb”  Back and forth forever and ever.   Politics are fucking stupid.   Another thing that drives me nuts is when I see “they’re hypocrites!” I see the same comment in both subs. And the funny thing is THEY’RE BOTH RIGHT AT ALL TIMES BUT NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHEN THEY DO IT! “Well, we’re being hypocrites right now because they’re hypocrites” but they were hypocrites because the other side was hypocritical and so on forever and ever and ever.   It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don’t actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	<p>I have conservative beliefs, but that’s about as far as it goes.

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.

Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated. The government should be responsible for allowing a cost-free path to the middle class, because:  1. That increases the country's worker output 2. Increases tax revenue 3. Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth. If we keep going this route, people will need to be housed by their jobs, and that's just the start of it. We're quickly approaching the endgame here.	<p>Secondly taxes reduce inflationary pressures by removing currency from circulation. Let&#39;s say the government wanted to hire some workers to increase the size of the military, but there were no unemployed workers left to do so. If the government wanted to hire some workers from the private sector, it would have to outbid the private sector wages. That could drive inflation. Instead, the government could levy taxes on the private sector, to cause unemployment, or reduce wages, thereby freeing workers to hire for the military at a non-inflationary price.</p>	0.909
Science says better masks work better not that masks don't work.	<p>Vaccines work, but these aren’t normal vaccines. It’s mRNA therapy that does more harm than the actual thing it’s supposed to prevent.

Sooooo you just want the same thing we have now. Which sucks. Healthcare costs are huge because administrative fat cats take a huge chunk of the change. And they do that while doing very little themselves. Literally welfare kings. And you're fighting for them, which makes me very sad. I know a few international doctors, and I ask them the reality of US healthcare, and they back up this claim - a lot of our healthcare costs go to millionaire administrative folks that would rather pull the plug on someone without insurance than help them out.	<p>They are, of course, sadly mistaken.

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	<p>Most of these neo-Marxist morons are just made that universities and community colleges aren&#39;t free. I agree, we need some education reform, but people bitching about student loan debt have nobody to blame but themselves.</p>	0.882
I keep talking to people saying the same thing about federal politicians being corrupt. Of course they're corrupt, people don't pay attention to elections. Our government structure is relatively good, and our representation is relatively fair, so we have the ability to elect good politicians. But a lot of people just don't care, which is one issue. Another issue is too much corporate money in politics, obviously.  And it sounds like your solution is to burn it all down and start new... How about we start electing good politicians that pass policies we want like universal health care?	<p>Why the government pushes it so hard? Do you actually think they care about public health?

What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water. The healthier they, the more they can work. And citizens who know their government has their backs are more likely to be happy, and provide more output.   That said, I'd probably just model it after Canada's or Germany's system. They have proven to be robust, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.	<p>When in reality, we don&#39;t want to be governed. The less control the government has on my life, the happier and healthier I am. Simple as that. What we really need to do, is put it to a vote. Statewide or national vote. But bring up a package that simply redefines medical costs. Puts a reasonable cap on medical equipment, tests, medicines, and insurance. Don&#39;t base it on your level of income, but base it on a national average of income. Then average the cost of insurance to that. Medium household income is $65k a year, insurance should be 2-3 hundred a month based on that. Cap it at 250.</p>	0.838

The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious.

According to his old profile Dave Zegarac is a far left, violent, extremist associated with antifa types.   https://web.archive.org/web/20210905065814/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave\_Zegarac   "His song lyrics deal primarily with anarchist politics.\[3\] Zegarac is an outspoken vegan and long time Anti-racist activist." -- antifa terrorist they should edit this to be.   Seems like he is just like the racist terrorist that killed kids at the christmas parade last year in Waukesha and the racist terrorist in Charlottesville a few years ago.   The far left needs to start calling out these people or they are all extremists and racists by association -- following the standards of discourse set by Trudeau, Singh and the CBC.   Typical example of the left being far out of control and turning to violence and terror over and over again. When is the RCMP going to start investigating these far left extremist domestic terror groups?	<p>The Democrats have embraced rabid antisemites like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the party has looked the other way as antisemitism has skyrocketed in Democrat-run cities like NYC, the DNC funds Jew-hating organizations like the UNHRC and UNRWA, there’s talk about appointing another rabid antisemite in the Biden administration (Matt Duss), and of course, the Democrat party has spent the past decade working to give nuclear weapons to a regime that explicitly denies the Holocaust and wants to commit a second Holocaust.</p>	0.85

It's not full communist, the citizens pay into these systems usually at a graduated rate depending on age. And citizens should get teeth cleanings and doctor's checkups, because it costs less overall when preemptive maintenance is done. And if offered free, it is even more convincing to do it. Government should be there to push citizens in the right direction to get the most efficiency out of them, which involves responsibility over health, because individuals are pretty terrible at maintaining their own health. The US is filled with fat fucks that don't realize they're usually the ones that put the most strain and expenses on our healthcare.

While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	<p>Hmm that’s weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes.

Much better than forcing them to work by tying healthcare to work, right? Generally speaking, government policies are made with citizen efficiency in mind, and that's very true for our current situation. Except it's worse than my suggestion. Forcing productivity out of citizens using fear is no way to govern. Currently a person's savings can completely deplete due to a freak health accident. That's inhumane, not right, and needs to be protected against.	<p>When you lose the truth what&#39;s left? I&#39;m very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn&#39;t work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven&#39;t gotten vaccinated, but those who haven&#39;t still wear masks. They&#39;re irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.</p>	0.879

Maybe I should rephrase this: the government sponsored a program that loaners promised would guarantee success to a lot of vulnerable people, and is causing a significant portion of younger generations to have a much lower percentage of wealth.

We are paying the consequences of poor policymaking of our elders, not because of some uneducated kids.	You were the one who mentioned that our government is in debt and said taxing the rich more would help the government, implying that it would help alleviate some of our debt.

I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.	<p>Worst case scenarios aren’t happening because we are doing a good job in mitigating spread, and a great job in vaccine development and roll out.</p>	0.848

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	So, these steel industry advocates are arguing that they should benefit against the interests of a vast majority of Americans.  This is why democrats want the tariffs gone, a tiny minority of people are benefitting from them.  Other countries don't pay the bill, American companies and consumers do.	0.885

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.  It will act the way it does, and the results will follow.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.913

 The study contained multiple methodological flaws that call the reliability of its conclusions into question.

This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.   And idk what you mean by massively devaluing college degrees... Just by forgiving loans doesn't mean the education is worth any less.	<p>Now they lie to the audience. Suppress information. They lied to and tricked the least knowledgeable voting group in the country with emotional warfare. They don&#39;t use facts. They can&#39;t even define the systematic racism they proclaim. They can&#39;t define &quot;white rage&quot; they just throw it out there like an emotional grenade and inexperienced people take it as the truth. The young people trust them. They told people they were going to pay off their student loans lol. They lied about that and it was an obvious lie but young people are too inexperienced to know that.

The CDC says the Covid survival rate of the vaccinated is 99.99%. They also say the death rate of the unvaccinated is 25x higher. What’s 25x.01. So the unvaccinated survival rate is 99.75%. If we look at total cases and do the math from the Covid deaths.  It comes out to a death rate of 1.6%. Israel the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world is hitting record numbers of Covid. 80% of hospitalized cases of Covid have been obese people. 86% of Covid deaths had underlying health issues such as cancer,pneumonia, respiratory problems. If you’re young and healthy there is no point.   So let’s take away 86% of people who died with serious underlying health issues you’ll  end with 561,218 so 652,480 a 561,218 you get 91,262 as total deaths. So if you’re healthy  you have a death rate of .23%. Let’s also not forget a mass majority of Covid deaths are 55+ in age. Simply math.</p>	0.813

Meanwhile if you were to add up the total amount of deaths through religion, whether it's being a martyr to being persecuted for your religion, it adds up to ~200 million. So by your logic all religion- whether it be Christianity, Catholicism, Islamic, and all other religions are terrible to the point that if you mention God or have a cross on your wall it's akin to heiling Hitler and hanging a swastika on your wall.   We can add up how many people have died for or been killed by America over the course of two world wars in the name of preserving our American capitalistic values and freedoms and guess what that number would be? 100 million. So now again, with your logic, American Capitalistism also falls under the category of being classified as a bad word.

Wait, I think I get it now. I'm sorry it took me awhile but I definitely thought about your comment so much more than you did.  The most logical reading of it is that you're tacitly admitting that you agree with me, that Biden isn't to blame for an increase in police deaths, but you're going to just say he is anyway because you're salty over some 24 hour news channel wagging a finger at your daddy tromp for being a stupid toe about COVID.  You have some seriously crossed wires, my guy. You just saw some words (covid, Biden, deaths) and blurted out some reactionary nonsense that was a total self dunk.	I love pretty much everything Trump did policy wise but he was a dumpster fire outside of that. He couldn’t help but put his foot in his mouth anytime any kind of good news came out, giving his detractors an easy way to change the narrative. While he’s good at it implementing conservative policies, he’s awful at explaining the conservative position. He doesn’t know many of the figures and facts so he misstates them, giving the media something to focus on besides the undeniable results. He acts like a child in debates and comes off exactly as democrats want him to.	0.848

My username is a description of me.     When I buy foundation, it sometimes oxidizes and turns orange. So I tell people I have an orange complexion.  &#x200B;  I cry when upset, so I sometimes call myself a crybaby.  &#x200B;  **I'm** the orange crybaby.  Hope this helps!	<p>In the past, you might signal your faith by wearing a cross; today, you write “they/them” on your twitter bio. There is Holy Writ and a Clerical Class of writers, activists and politicians, who will welcome your donation of money or votes. There are also Heretics who must be cancelled (including a number of Sixties feminists for whom this stuff seems a trifle barmy) and Demons to be exorcised or cancelled.

You admitted that your question was prompted by my username. You clearly have no idea who my username is referring to, so I figured I'd clarify. If you think me being orange and crying often means I may support Biden, believe that. If you don't, that's fine too. But I don't like your hostility, so I'm not answering anything for you. Lmao	<p>I’m not OP, and I asked for clarity from you about YOUR claims. I wanted a source from you to use to refuse other people’s claims, but obviously you’re no help. You don’t what to provide a source, fine, but make no mistake, you’re making claims too. You’re no better than him in refusing to back them up with sources.</p>	0.866

Exactly.  &#x200B;  You admitted that you thought my name was a hit on Trump.  I clarified because I *knew* who you thought my username was about. That's why I explained to you that it was *not* a hit on Trump and was instead a description of myself.      If you admit that you asked because you thought my name was about Trump, and I responded clarifying that it **wasn't** about Trump, how is my response deflection?   When to deflect means to change the topic but I stayed on the topic of my username (the topic you brought up)...  Take your time boo.	<p>But I&#39;m asking where Trump included the condition that the allegations be proven true. It doesn&#39;t seem implied by his statement.</p>	0.81
Well you started your comment by bringing up my username, so of course I'm going to address that.     If you ask someone a question *solely* because of what you ***think*** their name means, but your belief of what their name means is inaccurate, your question is no longer valid because the assumption that prompted it is not valid.   &#x200B;  At least... that's *my* take on it. If you disagree with my take, that's fine! It's America and you're free to disagree with whatever you want. You can't change the meaning of deflect though, so you may want to find a new favorite word.	<p>I would counter that your argument is low class since I can give valid reasons and criticisms to an open border policy, while all you can do is take the former directors words out of context to imply that I&#39;m a bad person for being concerned about the policy, without even explaining what a reasonable quota actually is!!</p>	0.821

>Now who doesn't know how they generate revenue?  You, dipshit. Because you've consistently missed EVERY single factor here while babbling about subscriptions; which would be one thing if you were correct, but you weren't even correct about THAT. He retains 11 million listeners per episode. Spotify now has a metric they can measure value to as opposed to just "People like music". ONE GUY keeps 11 million people paying 10 bucks a month. He paid for himself in under a month.  Then you have the free accounts, who have to listen to ads, but still listen to Rogan. Do I need to explain advertising dollars to you? Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game. Joe Rogan, from all conceivable angles, is literally spotifys most valuable asset.  Meanwhile, you're talking about fucking subscriptions amd doubling down on trying to say a **market share valuation doesnt mean anything** like you know a THING of what you're talking about.  Fucking goon.	<p>Except you don&#39;t get more than you pay in. It&#39;s literally impossible when half the populous doesn&#39;t pay in (unless you pay in zero). If you&#39;re healthy 95% of the time (like me) then it&#39;s just a waste of money. You also brought up it increasing your 401k before. You would get exponentially more by taking that money that&#39;s taxed and investing it yourself. There is literally no evidence suggesting you&#39;d make that money back.</p>	0.848

A. Listeners are not subscribers.  Since you're so fixated on their revenue...where they get most of their revenue are from ads, not subscribers.    B.  You said they got 5 Billion in revenue from announcing him.  They did not.  Market valuation is not revenue.  I didn't say market share valuation means nothing.  Not even remotely close did I say that.  I said that's not 5 Billion in revenue...because it isn't.   C. Spotify has been in the podcast game for a very long time.  Their biggest leap actually happened when they grabbed The Ringer.  D. You getting angry over you misunderstanding the difference between market valuation and revenue is not only funny, but proves the point I was making.   Once again...I'm not saying losing Rogan would be good for them. I'm saying it wouldn't be this massive hit a certain brand of people, such as yourself, would believe it is.	<p>Facebook didn&#39;t donated much but if you look at the project they did to get bide elected and spent close to half q billion on it.</p>	0.83

I wouldn't because I'm not.  The money he brings in vs. What he generates for them would be a small blow to lose especially given what they paid.  They're obviously not gonna drop him, but people who don't understand even basic things like the difference between a market valuation and revenue really wouldn't understand why it wouldn't be a massive hit.	I have. That feeling sucks, even if you're financially more secure than you're roommate to be taken for a ride like that.

I been said that I didn't like your hostility and wasn't going to answer any questions asked by someone being overly hostile towards me.  I felt like you asked it as if you were entitled to an answer, and I didn't like that.  In the future, asking "do you support Biden" would've been digested much more easily and would've gotten you the answer you wanted. Tact is key.	Guess what? I might be fairly conservative, but I'm not going to straight up ignore an argument that is being presented to me. That's what indoctrinated people do. I have actually thought about what they are saying, but because they are narcissistic and generally awful, they aren't going to present an alternative view.

For players whose teams don’t really have a chance at a medal (USA, Canada, Russia, and maybe Finland and Sweden), that’s a huge risk (plus the risk of injury) for very little gain. The NHL is trying to further dissuade participation by not paying players quarantined in China.

Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	<p>Yes there are a myriad of types of contraception. But even that isn&#39;t cut and dry. Doctors continuously deny woman the ability to chose to have their tubes tied. So even if a woman knows she doesn&#39;t want kids she still has to meet some fairly arbitrary prerequisites. Usually a certain age, plus a certain number of kids. We often don&#39;t allow women this choice. She can just abstain from sex for how ever long a doctor requires, but sex is one of the better parts of life, seems cruel to require absentia from it.</p>	0.846

There’s also a difference between “spouting left bullshit” and general decency, responsibility, and respect. Advocating for diversity, advocating for environmental friendliness, advocating for equal rights is not a sided issue, it’s general human decency.	<p>And participants in capitalism do have the option for their effort to be rewarded predictably.

Lmfaoooooo and they say conservatives can't be funny!  Did daddy Dolan pass you a secret note with that hot tip written on it?  Please dear christ tell me you don't actually believe that a cop who is ambushed and murdered in cold blood is added to the list of covid deaths.   Do you hear yourself?  How would that work in the courts when they want to try the murder suspect?   If there's one thing cops love it's the chance to be seen as a victim.

They negotiated themselves into lower pay.   Their initial contract offer was the same as the men's. They renegotiated it to have a lower bonus for winning but a higher guarantee. They also negotiated non-monetary benefits into the contract which was offset by a lower cash payout.

Just got over being sick with covid despite being vaccinated. My unvaccinated wife was not significantly more sick.  Leftoids: stop fucking pushing this nonsense. This vaccine WILL NOT eradicate covid, nor will the next one, or the next after that. The only thing it will do is keep *some* people out of the hospital who might have a severe case. You can still get it, you can still spread it, you can still die from it. Stop buying this bullshit that unvaccinated people are a threat and are standing against this fantastical "end of covid" fantasy you have.	<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it. If you have it, you’re protected. It’s not 100% but you’re probably more likely to die of a lightning strike than die of a breakthrough case. So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way. If they get sick and die, that’s their problem, not yours. </p>	0.908

I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	<p>A position of reason and reasonable tolerance is the best counterargument against this sort of absurdity.  Let adult folks have these surgeries if they want to and doctors are willing; don’t ever pay for them with tax dollars, etc, but more obviously don’t do something really, profoundly dumb like put someone who, whatever “gender” they may claim is a fertile biological male human with a female bunkmate.

The judge has been entirely even handed thus far, compromising with both sides and granting motions to each in kind.

In a perfect world, jurors go home and never read the news or talk about current events with loved ones and friends. In our world, they will see this go viral online, and again, the judge just basically gave the green light to Rittenhouse defense.	0.859
Yes. I recently watched an interview of this trans (f-m) Ugandan LGBTQ advocate who faced off against a baffled moderator and a local pastor. The pastor sounded like a condescending,  hostile nutjob while the activist, who explained she was just advocating for "human rights," was so polite and patient that she started to made so much sense. I had to stop and remind myself that just because she seems like a very nice, decent person and just because the pastor is a total maniac, that doesn't mean she represents the right side of the debate. It almost got me.	<p>Like I don&#39;t condemn people for being religious, and there&#39;s 0 evidence for theology and its validity compared to the numerous papers and decades of research on transgender individuals.  I am to respect their views despite them being based in no actual evidence and often not even based on the Bible they claim to source their views from. Instead they impose their views upon me instead of acknowledging the reality for how it is, and call me a sinner and attempt to legislate my rights away for the sole reason of me being different. That&#39;s legislating against liberty and individuality of Americans and we can&#39;t let government do such things and harm vulnerable individuals in a free and just society.</p>	0.823

The alleged &quot;genocide&quot; I would clarify doesn&#39;t actually involve killing. Not even the far fetched sources report mass killings.

I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..   Some of the toughest, kindest family oriented people.  One woman legally got into the United States left her children in Honduras and for the next 8 years saved every fucking penny she could raising 60k and getting her children into the states just so they could work in motels cleaning up after people that have no respect, accuse them of being illegal.   I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump... Is a criminal that has admitted multiple times he wants to fuck his daughter, he lies, he belittles everyone, he doesn't pay his taxes, he's stuck up... Does that man look like someone who's bled red for his country... This is the mother fucker who built a casino called it the Taj Mahal Trump and went bankrupt his daddy had to bail him out. He has terrible ideas when it comes to investment. Remember this.. He's doesn't give a fuck about anyone. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION... HE LIKES YOUR FUCKING MONEY.   Wake up.   Joe Biden is gross to, he's boring and old and gets nothing done. Our political system is failing on BOTH sides.   The dems and reps of this country need to stop fighting each other and figure it out. The whole world is watching us and laughing. We are getting dicked.   The fuck are you worrying about a wall for... Look at the inside of your country. It's falling apart, people are working they're asses off for nothing, poor health and a population and next generation of lost and confused kids because we can't grow the fuck up.

If you'd actually read any of the studies or releases about the side effects, you'd know that the incidence was not statistically significantly higher than an unvaccinated population.

You’re 100% correct. All my experiences with Central American immigrants have been positive. The vast majority of them are hard working family people.

Actually the saddest part is how many foreigners come here to live and love America. You can walk down the street and for the most part not have to worry about being bombed, shot at, kidnapped etc..

Some of those people come here and are so fucking happy to be working shitty jobs that people don't want to do.. For close to nothing. They save that money and open small businesses like taco trucks, housecleaning services, landscaping services.. You know shit middle and upper class Americans love for cheap but quality.

Anyone want to ask how the Europeans let themselves in?	<p>I really think that inflation isn&#39;t just a negative side effect of left-wing politics, it&#39;s a feature. They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don&#39;t know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we&#39;re too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.</p>	0.836

Can we make punching people who offend us legal again?  I'm even talking equality between the sexes. No kids, but no weight limit.  Between punching Nazis (which I agree with) and punching racists (also, hard agree) and now punching unvaccinated, and all the other expressions of aggression and dissatisfaction.   Just make it legal.  Surely the progressives would vote on something that allows them to express their frustrations.  Some might say that this would devolve the world back to 'might is right,' where only the strongest and most violent can speak their opinion while anyone weaker lives in fear and submission.  But let's not listen to all that.	I, of course, am not a fascist, but my opinion about myself is irrelevant to Antifa.  Fascists have every right to speech, publishing their ideas, and peacefully assembling to protest as I do.  ***I do not support Nazis and Communists, but the price of freedom is that they must have it too.  Antifa denies these rights to their enemies, and by disagreeing you too become their enemy.***  Think of the slogan ""punch a Nazi.""  Who counts as a Nazi?  When did it become ok to punch people?	0.858
No one because they all fucking suck and you guys know it. Instead stop allowing shitty people to run your country demand better candidates.   Joe Biden only won because people couldn't handle another year of Trump. All the people came out to vote under one common goal.. No more Trump. His groupies couldn't handle that and did what daddy said tried to storm the Capitol.   Personally think that was just a test.. See what the American people would do.. Which was nothing! People should be more upset. This man is walking free, we have known criminals running the world... People are like eeeeh I'd rather fight over skin color and who has control of who's genitals. This shit with Trump isn't over.. The fireworks are just beginning. Believe that.   Fucking sad.	It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.	0.924
> Instead stop allowing shitty people to run your country demand better candidates.  No disagreements from me.

Which is crazy we have all of this information and have seen success in other countries under different political systems... It's beyond me why we can't experiment better. We desperately need better, more transparent and honest education in America. That's what's hurting people the most. It hurts my life everyday..   Because really this is getting bad. We have got to stop babying people but also learn how to debate and talking to each other without it turning into finger pointing and bashing.   Idk.. I don't expect utopia but people should be able to work together. Even if you don't agree.   I just can't believe how okay everyone is with being robbed blind by political and corporate greed.. Especially people who support Trump. That dude don't even have to pretend.. He's just a bad person and people love him.	<p>Also, how fucking elitist is that comment. Our education system has been getting more and more funding (1) yet our education system keeps failing our students (2). So obviously they do not know what they are doing, the &quot;educators&quot;.

I agree. I think we’ve all just become bored because for the most part our lives are pretty simple and mostly good. So now we just bicker and fight out of sheer boredom.

Agreed.  >I just can't believe how okay everyone is with being robbed blind by political and corporate greed.. Especially people who support Trump. That dude don't even have to pretend.. He's just a bad person and people love him.  I consider him to be an ass, but significantly better at that job than Biden or Obama (personally). However, give me a candidate whose not an asshole and whose policies resonate with me, I'll vote for them regardless of party.	I agree with you on Trump's spending, however I don't think Biden will be better. So on that front I just don't see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump doesn't have the personality I want. Then again I actually care very, very little about politicians and their personas.

The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.   Screw that.  So yes, the masks are harmful.	<p>Businesses can and have enforced dress codes, no smoking policy, kicked people out for swearing, or smelling like shit, or being too drunk.

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	**Restaurant:** You live and die by reviews these days.

There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (""they were pulled from the market!"") and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off.

It’s year 2 of the pandemic and y’all are still talking about the masks…  Even prior to COVID, in Asian countries, it was totally normal to wear masks whenever one gets sick (called “caring for others”, look it up). Y’all bunch of pussies complaining about trivial shit like masks in the middle of pandemic.  COVID really shows where your priorities are. If something is not impacting YOU directly you don’t give a fuck, even if it’s such a minor inconvenience…. To such an aggressively dumb extent that it became your political identification.   I mean how difficult is it to wear a mask without making it into overly complicated conspiracy ridden problem? Why are you such pussies? I thought you were the gun loving “tough” people. Man you won’t last a second in an actual combat, cuz you will run out of breath or it will be too cold for your feet or some other dumb shit.   Has any “conservative” on this sub travelled outside of US? Or at least outside of your village? Or do you get your understand of the outside world from Fox News?	<p>That being said, politicians can get lost if they think there’s going to be a new normal, where we have this dystopian Covid drama for much longer. Health experts already are saying this virus is going to become endemic like the flu, and nobody bats an eye about the flu even though iirc the flu is deadlier. We all just accept it as part of life and proceed about life as normal- instead of causing so much economic damage over a virus that you can just get vaccinated against.</p>	0.848

I'd report you for promoting violence but apparently what he did isn't considered a violent crime.	As far as legally, I don’t believe Kyle should be convicted. I do not believe that he went out that night intending to cause someone physical or bodily harm. He was being attacked, felt his life was in danger, and responded accordingly. So as far as legal status, he should fall under self defense.	0.85

It’s funny because I feel the same about sending Conservatives over to China to get a taste of what authoritarianism is like. Maybe they’ll stop calling for the destruction of the Democrats when they see what it’s like to live under one party. Wishful thinking though.	In the end, the people should decide for themselves. It strikes me as very overbearing and paternalistic to just come in and decree that this and that province should be independent, when a majority of people actually living there would probably gladly vote to remain in China, when push comes to shove. It would be like a Chinese person just musing about coming in and ""granting"" independence to Texas and California without actually considering the wider cultural and economic implications.	0.843

Freedom of speech means Joe Rogan can legally express any opinion that he wants to. But it doesn't mean that private companies should be forced to work with him if they decide that he hurts their image in some way. It *does* mean that other people are free to express *their* opinion about him and the things he says.  If conservatives didn't make "bring born a certain way" or "not dying" political, then politics wouldn't get dragged into everything nearly as much.	<p>Now I also believe in the freedom to choose, so if you and your family feel more comfortable getting the shot-by all means, but the information being pedaled by mainstream media and government isnt equipping the public to make an educated decision. Other countries have stated that there are other ways to treat covid effectively-why aren’t they being talked about? The agenda goes further than protecting us</p>	0.867

It's not about the children it's about who they interact with in their lives.	<p>Also, to answer your question: we don&#39;t mandate diets and exercise because a) that&#39;s authoritarian and ridiculous and b) being fat isn&#39;t contagious and has 0 effect on other people around you. Highly contagious diseases do, and they are very easily preventable through encouraging, and eventually mandating, vaccines. See: every other contagious disease we&#39;ve nearly eradicated.</p>	0.86

Unfortunately, since 2016, too big a chunk of conservatives care more about hating democrats than anything else. Including consistency and the truth.	Biden screwed up so bad moderate dems and liberals will even for for Trump now. They won’t vote for other republican candidates because they are democrats. They will vote for Trump because even all the bad things that stick to Trump, the one thing that people really equate to Trump is the economy. So people will want that.	0.843
She actually is misrepresenting what happened.   From what I understand, she was pregnant when shooting the AT&T commercials and her acting was so bad the baby just killed itself to get out of there.	<p>I also have a story about the state of the baby the other way though. I knew a woman whose son&#39;s wife was pregnant. The doctor found that both of them had some disorder in their family history, tested them and found that they both had the gene. So suggested that they test the baby&#39;s DNA in utero. That baby died <em>because of the test</em>. Let me be clear, the test was not positive, and they chose to terminate, the test killed the baby. Some years later they were pregnant again and did not do the test and the baby did not have the disorder, but they would have loved the baby all the same if it had.</p>	0.864

Dunno, I was in Minneapolis last week and the city's infrastructure seemed pretty intact. None of the buildings on Nicolette were demolished, smoking ruins. In fact, the whole of the downtown core was pretty much humming along.  I didn't see any burn marks or damage to anything on Nicolette or Hennepin Avenues downtown.  And which Portland? I live in Portland, Maine and there's no damage to the city here. No burnt out buildings, etc.  If you mean Portland, Oregon. My MIL lives there and I just talked to her last night. There was no mention of apocalyptic hellscape, no fires, no destruction.  So.. I'm kinda skeptical, yes.	<p>I was at these protests for days at a time this summer.

So like, one building constitutes a whole city?  I just don’t see the apocalyptic hellscape.   At some point, the narrative has to come back to reality.   Trump lost. Pence was right. 1/6 was domestic terrorism.	I don’t condone what occurred, and those who entered the Capital should absolutely be charged with the appropriate charges, but it doesn’t seem like an attack. It seems like a protest that got out of hand combined with a lack of preparation (and likely dismissive projections) by the DC Metropolitan Police, Capital Police, and local authorities. An ‘attack’ implies that planning and/or leadership went into planning the specific action of entering the capital, for which there is no proof.	0.821

The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb 😁😁😁  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am 😈 Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.	<p>Exodus 21:22-25, here we have a disagreement about translation. The old translation which was taught for well over a thousand years was &quot;miscarriage&quot; not &quot;premature birth&quot;. That translation came about in the mid 1800s as best I&#39;ve been able find. Which would indicate that if a miscarriage is caused, but no further harm comes to the mother, then a fine, according to the husband, shall be imposed by a judge. If, however, the woman dies as a result of the miscarriage, then the man shall be put to death. This is interesting because the Syrian, Hittite, and Babylonian code in the area all had nearly the exact same passage, but required a fetus for a fetus. Those codes existed before the Mosaic Code was written, so a lack of that clarification seems fairly important. </p>	0.781

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years. It's a shame, because I don't see it turning around this time.	<p>Current laws acknowledge that police need the benefit of the doubt legally in order to do their job. Progressives want to start jailing cops any time they make a mistake, and for some bewildering reason ppl in this thread are now anti-police and want these democrat DAs to go after cops and jail them for mistakes too. What&#39;s next, maybe we should just defund and disband all the police depts like progressives want after all? Who cares about surging crime! That&#39;s the logical next step because very few cops would perform the job anyways under the new liability that we are now suggesting they should burden. Already critical police shortage and surging crime rates, yet apparently even some conservatives now jumping on the anti-cop bandwagon trying to strip all of their legal protection and open them up to being jailed for honest mistakes.</p>	0.889

Perfect example of how the left thinks.   The COVID vaccines were rushed in development and marketing. A typical 5-10 year research and development process was compressed into 1 year.

The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	<p>I wonder if this is because these vaccines give protection against specifically the Spike protein that does the binding to the ACE2 receptors -- it drives evolution in a direction for this virus to develop adaptations by mutations in regions of the genome that are not the Spike protein, leading to a high propensity for a mutation to develop that evades protection. If these vaccines are specifically designed to target that particular protein they can later down the line be non-effective. I am unsure if these effects for protection waning are because of the evolutionary issue I just posited above or because they really do wear off in the body. </p>	0.85

Another issue is not aspirating. If they inject into the vein you're at a much higher risk of Vaccine related heart conditions.

But there’s a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place. If viral load drops off quicker and your body clears the virus bc the vaccine kicks in, you’re contagious for a shorter amount of time and you’re not as likely to infect other people. </p>	0.864

I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don’t know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn’t tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don’t think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that’s not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don’t know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It’s also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we’ve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn’t be. This is concerning. Perhaps something similar is happening with the heart too, but so far I haven’t seen it.	Alright, so now your company wants you to get a vaccine, the original problem here. Well, as I've shown, testing can't guarantee that you had covid, you don't know if you had covid, and there's a good chance you're part of the 70% that has risk factors for covid.	0.826

Certainly won’t trust you on this.  You do realize that monoclonal antibodies is more experimental than the vaccine right?  If you are afraid of the vaccine then you should be afraid of monoclonal antibodies for the same reason.  But of course you just parrot whatever the alt media tells you to say.	<p>When you lose the truth what&#39;s left? I&#39;m very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn&#39;t work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven&#39;t gotten vaccinated, but those who haven&#39;t still wear masks. They&#39;re irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.</p>	0.892

So literally your entire statement was wrong.	<p>A zygote, embryo or foetus is as far as we are concerned little different to an unfertilized egg in a moral sense, it&#39;s experience (or lack thereof) is the same if it is aborted as if it were never conceived. So just as you might say you would never intentionally conceive a Downs syndrome child (ie through selective IVF), we can also say that we wouldn&#39;t want to continue with a pregnancy if tragically we found out that the foetus had the condition. If you stop seeing a foetus as a person and instead a person-under-construction that hasn&#39;t been switched on yet, the pro choice position becomes easy to understand.</p>	0.873

Reminds me of when the Ukrainian government banned helmets in early 2014, just before the revolution. Within days, tens of thousands of people joined the protests with construction helmets, bike helmets, pots on their heads, etc. To make a mockery of the government. We saw how that turned out. Freedom wins every time.  Tyrannical governments making arbitrary laws like this wake up the masses. And soon everyone will be out there with gas cans. Freedom prevails!	Remember about 4 months ago when protesting wasn't supposed to be peaceful? When there should be uprising all over the country? The massive crowds of black bloc calling for revolution, remember that?

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.	Liberals judge the book by it's cover. ""Undocumented immigrants that live in the city get to vote, too."" They don't open that book that shows all of the flaws of this logic. It's one of the main problems that liberals have to overcome to recognize that the Democratic party is full of two-faced pieces of shit. Don't get me wrong, politicians from all sides of the aisle are the same, but Democrats and other leftists generally do not think about the consequences of irresponsible fiscal, cultural and political choices. On the surface, all left-leaning policy is well-intentioned, but sadly most politicians use those ""feel good"" talking points to convince people to do things to achieve different goals, such as more control, ballot harvesting, more taxation (therefore more spending on contractors that give kickbacks to politicians).	0.826

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	<p>And while Anarchists rioted on inaugeration day, as they had in many inaugerations before, you would be very hard pressed to find rhetoric that Russia stole the election, therefore we riot among those Anarchists. We can tie direct Trump tweets and theories to people in the Capitol building. Those Anarchists did not prevent any votes or procedures from happenning either.	0.874

So if BLM rioters are criminals and everyone also associated with them are also just as guilty does that mean you also consider January 6th rioters just as bad and all the people "cheering them on" would also be bad people too right?

> expert  *J. Alex Halderman professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where he is also director of the Center for Computer Security & Society.*  *After the 2016 United States presidential election, computer scientists, including Halderman, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly, while Clinton won New Hampshire and Maine narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome.*  *On 21 June 2017, Halderman testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.The hearing, titled "Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election" focused on the federal government's role in safeguarding U.S. elections from outside interference.*  *Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Halderman stated that a software glitch during the unofficial vote tally was not caused by fraud, but rather by human error...*  ...*and said the conspiracy theory that a supercomputer was used to switch votes from Trump to Biden was "nonsense".*	We also know that the FBI was aware in 2016 that the entire Russia narrative originated inside the Clinton campaign.

I could wake up tomorrow, change nothing about my beliefs and put on a big, bright shirt that says, ""I'm a conservative and I love big government"".

The media picks up a story hoping to spread this message that white people are committing acts of violence at significantly higher rates only to quickly drop the story when it is found to be a Muslim Extremist or some other extremist group. They don’t even have the mental maturity to apologize and learn from their mistakes.

There's only 1 norwegian country and it's Norway, dumbass, the word you were looking for is scandinavian.

You are just claiming the US healthcare is terrible with no evidence whatsoever. The US absolutely isn't LAST lmfao. If they're last in maybe some specific thing I can believe that, but at least have an idea of what you're even claiming. Are you talking about OECD countries? Then in some areas we are last yes. But we are also the lowest cancer mortality rate in that list, and one of the best at preventative procedures, visits, and vaccination. We have a big obesity problem in this country which causes us to be lower on many things such as life expectancy too. So our healthcare is not terrible by any stretch, although it's not as efficient and isn't as easily accessible. Ignoring all that though, our healthcare system still has undeniably created most of the medical advancements in the past many decades which even allow countries to improve their healthcare to this point. That's just a fact. Where do you think all the new medicines and treatments come from? The US pulls more than its weight in drug/treatment research costs, and if other countries would share that burden then we'd all be better off in the long term	0.764

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	<p>Even so, im not certain how adding onto what so many people believe is a big problem helps. What kind of logic sits behind the decision to fear monger the hell out of Covid while also letting in so many unvaccinated illegals?</p>	0.823
Yep, screw the immunocompromised of the world, they don't need to go outside again.  What's more important, that they live or that a millionaire with a little prick is able to avoid a little prick?	<p>I think you don&#39;t know what you are talking about.

The liberals are infiltrating the GOP to bring it down from the INSIDE to make Republicans LOOK stupid but actually they're the good guys and Trump will ride an eagle and save America from the gays and the foreigners to a better oil filled, gun toting future!!! YEEEEHAAAAAWWWWW MAGA!!!!!!!! #JESUSSAVES	<p>Trump is an icon and set the GOP on the right path. He exposed the RINOs and the democrats for who they are, but he can&#39;t win in the current political climate against Biden unless things get really, really bad (gas rationing for example). Trump can beat Kamala because she is more despised than Hillary, but that&#39;s about it. DeSantis is the future and a far more polished politician. He understands who the GOP wants, but also knows how to avoid some of Trump&#39;s least likeable qualities, which is essential for voters in the rust belt.</p>	0.864
A small percentage with no power can still be a threat.  Big picture, they don't have the power to make a real difference.  Small picture, they're terrorizing people who have nothing to do with the decisions being made. If they were sitting on parliament hill not disrupting everyone else's lives, I guarantee there would be way less resistance.  Personally, I wouldn't care if they weren't blocking a border or terrorizing people who didn't make the decision.	Moreover, anything against Free Speech is something bad. You do not show the World that the other person is wrong by shutting them down, making them not able to speak to any audience, you let them tell their part, and you make sure to destroy them with arguments in a CIVIL DEBATE.

Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	For example, dems should be outraged at the bill stuffing that happened with the Covid bill. That is dirty politics. Republicans should be outraged at the trump administration dismantling previous administrations accomplishments, that sets us on a course to never progress.	0.917

Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease.
