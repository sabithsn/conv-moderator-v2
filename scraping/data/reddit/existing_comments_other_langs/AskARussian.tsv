And this also does not negate the fact that Putin is an asshole who has sat on his throne and is simply terrorizing the people making life in Russia more and more difficult every day, and thanks to his friends that they also sit in the government.	1641546818.0	hrm6kt6	t3_rxuo0f	t3_rxuo0f	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxuo0f/some_people_think_putin_is_secretly_the/hrm6kt6/
9pbfx36r	Commentary.  The first picture shows Alexander II who, on one side, pushed a number of liberal reforms and, most importantly, abolished the serfdom (the respective manifesto is depicted), but on the other side still relied on the security forces to fight the revolutionaries (symbolized by the officer behind him). Below, there's a peasant frustrated over the half-hearted reform. Below, the emperor is blown up in his carriage is blown up by the Narodnaya Volya revolutionaries.   The second picture is based on the photo that is in the page 449 of the book. It's a 1924 production of Byron's *Sardanapalus*, with scenery by V. A. Schuko.   The third pic is about the events of the reign of Nicholas I: the suppression of the Decembrists' Revolt in 1825, Pushkin and his death in duel, increase of police control and repressions in the country.  The fourth one is obviously about the crash of the empire in 1917 and the building of a new industrial state by 1932. On the left, it's DneproGES hydroelectic plant; on the right some new factory.	1641547034.0	hrm6uvg	t3_rxzrog	t1_hrm5hym	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxzrog/what_is_written_in_pencil_on_these_russian_prints/hrm6uvg/

t3gvp	Russian language is mostly uniform.  There are some regionalisms that we learn about in school.  For example, in Moscow the curb is called бордюр, and in Saint Petersburg поребрик, here in Kazan I heard both, although поребрик more often.  The entrance to residential building in Saint Petersburg are called парадная, while both in Moscow and here in Kazan it's подъезд.  A market in Kazan is often called базар (loaned from Tatar language), alongside рынок, while in the rest of Russia it's just рынок. Also we use айда (let's go), which is also a loan from Tatar language, alongside general пойдёмте.  The differences in word usage are too small to be unintelligible however, or even noticeable in most conversations. Also what the regionalisms are is often known alongside more general variants.  I've heard of there being accents, like differences in unstressed "о" vowel reduction (both unstressed "о" and unstressed "а" should sound the same is what we are taught in school). Old people in northern villages not reducing unstressed "о" (окание). Or Moscowites reducing unstressed "о" so much, that it's practically like stressed "а" (акание). The former I've never heard of in person, only in movies set in villages pre mid 20th century perhaps. The latter I thought was a myth (Moscow news anchors don't do it), before I met someone who moved from Moscow to Kazan. He indeed does the "акание". But those differences also don't prevent understanding.  There are also accents for those for whom Russian is second language, but they don't count as dialects.	1641547902.0	hrm7zj7	t3_rxkaot	t3_rxkaot	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxkaot/are_russian_dialects_very_different_from_each/hrm7zj7/

Most of all drank alcohol at the geological and geographical faculty. Students at the mechanics and mathematics department also drank. But the percentage of those who drank a lot and often was small relative to those who drank rarely and little. Most of them consumed alcohol only on holidays or for some special occasion.	1641547964.0	hrm82dv	t3_rxuhf0	t3_rxuhf0	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxuhf0/how_big_is_drinking_culture_in_russia_among_the/hrm82dv/

16y5v7	Build my first MtG hand back in 2006 while was on RPG convent in Blagovesthchengs (administrative center of Amur Oblast) and bring this new wind in Yakutia (Nerungri town). As far as I know there is still local tournaments in Yakutsk city, Ekaterinburg and Blagovesthchengs. Some smallest local town also have those for today. Back to back with MtG or Matiga (plow, slang name for the game) was Berserk (russian ccg), both have huge history in many cities of Russia, but mostly local, national-wide tournaments doesn't happened as far as I know.  Since it was rather tricky to get new cards in Russian we oftenly use Magic: The Gathering pc game (1997) because it has deckbuilding and ability to add new cards, when Arena appear our rpg club was already dismissed and many of us spread across the country - I'm living in Saint-Petersburg right now for example, and sadly, we lost any contact to each other.   But what for the best memories - I do believe it was our local Nerungri MtG tournament, it was rather small but heart warming - such unity and cheer spirit. We print some ads and buy several boosters as a winner prizes.   [https://imgur.com/iJMS6on](https://imgur.com/iJMS6on)  We also eventually made our own MtG custom deck with our own LARP club history and print it out, only one exemplar but it still exist I do believe.  Here some of our own cards for example:  [https://imgur.com/NuiHsM3](https://imgur.com/NuiHsM3)  [https://imgur.com/7E9XneL](https://imgur.com/7E9XneL)  It was in the year of 2007 as I recall -) Well, that was one patch of a memory lane, thank you -)  Nowadays mine black deck mostly collecting dust on a book shelf, but I know there is some tournaments in our city. Not goin to enter any I think, all I do today is DnD-style ttrpg as a token to gratitude to past events, but I do find most of joy in those even today -)	1641549898.0	hrmajsh	t3_rxouzy	t3_rxouzy	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxouzy/who_plays_magic_the_gathering_in_russia/hrmajsh/

The question should be - "why they not lead to something else like violent government overthrown"?   Because:   1) there is lack of wealthy external forces with will to fund them, less NCO, less "opposition" etc.  2) in case protests went slightly violent the amount of force used by riot police is not limited by any "free world media", they have carte blanche for basically everything, charge on horses into the crowd, use water cannons in negative temperature, set dogs on protesters, use of "non lethal" weapons.	1641551406.0	hrmci6y	t3_rxf506	t1_hrj0hqi	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxf506/your_opinions_on_kazakh_protests/hrmci6y/
3g1jmfsq	Because why would you need to violently overthrow the government when you have honest elections every 4 years and a system of checks and balances, where the government is limited by courts, courts by laws and so on?  Russia has been funding subversive activities in the west for a while, just as it has been funding a really large propaganda television of RT, this is well documented. Its failure in achieving what it believes to be routine results of just giving money to some NGO only displays that the world doesn't work the way it thinks it does.  Opposition forces are way bigger in the west than in Russia, too, there is free press, there are opposition parties - which also time from time change the government. Peacefully. Only the democratic system is able to reconcile opposing forces, so by adhering to rules enabling change of power by consent of citizens they don't need to be resolving their differences through Novichok or Molotovs.	1641551994.0	hrmd9uv	t3_rxf506	t1_hrmci6y	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxf506/your_opinions_on_kazakh_protests/hrmd9uv/

epvrh47d	Everyone has read Lord of the Flies, right? Kazakhstan's protesters are the same children. Any kind of protesters.    Aggression and propensity for destruction are in the human blood. When the crowd does not meet resistance, all the baser nature of man comes out. And then people start smashing shop windows, burning houses and cars.    I don't think anyone planned all this in advance. Perhaps, as the situation evolved, some forces joined the protest as fighters. But most of the destruction was done by ordinary people in Kazakhstan, who are on adrenaline.   It's silly to talk about the involvement of some external forces. There were no leaders, there was no organization. It's just that the fatigue people have accumulated over the years has finally found a way out and swept through the country like a hurricane.	1641553904.0	hrmftng	t3_rxf506	t3_rxf506	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxf506/your_opinions_on_kazakh_protests/hrmftng/
3g1jmfsq	>address this question to Ukraine. There is many many countries in the world with this properties who still somehow able to get violent government overthrown.  This happened in Ukraine only once. The government was violently overthrown in 2014 because it was breaching the rules of the democratic procedures. To have democratic elections, it is not possible to be [beating up people engaging in peaceful assembly, or disappearing people, or beating up journalists printing their free speech](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-activists-automaidan/25241507.html). Because, aside from everything else, like value of personal dignity or rights of humans, you are then also disrupting free exchange of ideas and preventing people from organizing themselves as free citizens to win the election. Either the rules are defended, or the one responsible becomes a dictator.  &#x200B;  >In case of Europe it's more or less herbivore policies between elites, based on informal rules.  If you look at top level politics in Europe, you will find them competetive. They are only "herbivore" in as far as they are made by agreement of everyone to adhere to democratic elections. But could anyone tell the result of German elections, or how Brexit referendum will go? The difference between Czech government winning or losing, and Babiš potentially going to jail for fraud, has been only a couple percents of votes. It's not possible to somehow directively engineer with precision that kind of margin of public decision.  &#x200B;  >ну-ну. системные только. а не те которые бегают по посольствам иностранных государств или вещают из этих государств в твиттере.  Well, what does "systemic" mean here? Systemic parties in Russia are made to enable and toe Putin's line, never endanger him in elections, never create any kind of legal problems, and simply do nothing to oust him from power. But as I pointed out, power in Europe changes. "Systemic" in Europe means at most adhering to democratic rules and then yes, most European opposition parties are "Systemic", they can't be planting bombs, but within the system vast changes are possible - they can oust the prime minister, leave EU and NATO and decide that Covid doesn't exist.  That said, there is also opposition which does actually visit Russian embassies, and there is a kind of "anti-systemic" opposition supported by Russia. But once more, just giving a bunch of hooligans some money and telling people all kinds of propaganda from RT isn't what makes a revolution happen.	1641554311.0	hrmgdt0	t3_rxf506	t1_hrmf6hu	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxf506/your_opinions_on_kazakh_protests/hrmgdt0/

142hyxz7	Nope. He was mentioned only because journalists always attribute the wealth of his friends to him. But there are no evidence that he somehow uses their money.   An unprecedented leak of documents shows how this money has made members of Putin’s close circle fabulously wealthy.  “Though the president’s name does not appear in any of the records, the data reveals a pattern – his friends have earned millions from deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage.”    https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore  Journalists always do this. I really don’t know why. Maybe they want to get more attention with Putin’s name, maybe they have other reasons. But I’m 100% sure, they don’t have any real evidence besides their closeness to Putin. As an example there is a very recent case with Abramovich. British journalist wrote a book, where she claimed that Abramovich bought Chelsea on Putin’s order. He sued her, she lost.   https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/roman-abramovich-settles-libel-claim-over-putin-biography	1641564566.0	hrmyiyj	t3_rxuo0f	t1_hrlz7ab	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxuo0f/some_people_think_putin_is_secretly_the/hrmyiyj/

Most likely it will be more than in US given that you have to pay about 40% of your employes net salary as their income tax and dues. Corporate tax is 20%, VAT is 20% (may be returned after you paid it). Companies also pay realty and transport tax and may pay a lot of different ones.  For residents income tax is 13%, 15% for 5mil+ income  For non-residents 30%.

avgpx	You are going to get a lot of idiotic advice ITT because Russians who have a business to run don't waste time answering questions of brainwashed and/or delusional people (I don't mean you, I mean the usual crowd here).  First of all, there is a treaty on double taxation between Russia and the US, so you should not normally pay Russian taxes on income that was taxed in the US.  Ask a professional about this.  Or ask an American expat who is in Russia now.  There are forums where they hang out.  13% is for personal income.  And only for tax residents.  Non-residents are taxed 30%.  You need to be inside Russia for 183 days in the last consecutive 365 days to become a resident.  Residents who make serious money (by Russian standards) are taxed 15%.  Bank interest over 42000 roubles per year is taxed too.  But all this is for personal income only.  If you have a business, it's a totally different story.  If you register as an "individual businessman" (it's a term, you can still hire people, but you are not incorporated, and all your personal assets can be seized if your "company" owes money), you pay 15% on revenue or 6% on income.  There are tax breaks for some specific fields of business that in practice allow not paying taxes for the first two years, but the list of such fields is short and region-specific.  The money that is in your business account is already yours, you don't have to pay any personal taxes if you use it.  If you incorporate, your personal assets are shielded, but the tax situation is slightly different.  The main tax can be the same, 6% or 15%, but there will be other taxes and fees now.  A corporation is scrutinized much more.  You will need to pay yourself a salary, and it will be taxed as personal income (13%, 15%, 30%).  You cannot use other corporation money as your own.  There are no tax breaks for hiring people.  You actually need to pay their taxes too.  In addition to the 13% income tax that you withhold, you pay for their medical insurance and social security.  If you transfer money from abroad into your account, it's not taxed (except the tax on excessive bank interest I mentioned).  But if your single transaction is over 600,000 roubles, it will trigger a compliance check.  It can go completely transparent to you, or they (the bank) can freeze your account and ask to explain the source of the money ("explaining" means providing paper proofs, words mean nothing in Russia).  Another good way to get your account frozen is to get a large incoming transfer and then withdraw a sizeable amount in cash or make many outgoing small transfers &mdash; these are signs of money laundering.  In such cases, many banks will just close your account and offer to give you your money back only if you pay them a 20% nuisance fee (the first part because you just gave them a legal reason to do that, and the second part because fuck you, 20% is more than they can earn from you over the years anyway, and they don't need your business anymore, plus money launderers do not go to court that often).  You'll also get blacklisted and will have problems opening accounts in other banks.  As for opening a business in Russia with 100 employees: remember that in Russia it's impossible to fire a person who shows up for work on time and sober.  They can be completely incompetent, they can just stop working and play games all day, they can literally piss on your table &mdash; you cannot fire them.  Because the law gives a list of reasons for termination and says in the end, "This list is exhaustive".  And pissing on your table or playing games is not on the list.  Skipping work is.  Being drunk is.  And that's about it.  If you fire someone for pissing on your table, they will wait for two months and sue you.  The case will drag for six months.  Then the court will order you to hire that person back and pay them their salary for eight months.  They'll come back and piss on your table again.  If you wonder how it works in actual Russian businesses: everybody gets minimal wage in their contract, the rest is "bonuses".  When you want to fire someone, you offer them to resign.  If they refuse, you remove the bonuses (which by itself can result in a civil case that you will lose) and start harassing them: move their table into a closet, piss on it, and force other employees to stop talking to this person.  Are you ready to do this?  The bottom line is, your bank transfers have nothing to do with taxes, you will not be taxed.  Your income in the US should be taxed in the US only.  Opening a business with dozens of employees in Russia is a good way to lose faith in humanity.	1641570138.0	hrncfpq	t3_ry90h9	t3_ry90h9	/r/AskARussian/comments/ry90h9/foreigner_and_taxes_russia/hrncfpq/

t564j	There isn't a similar "campus culture" or "college town" culture like the US has. I don't have a big pool of experience with this but when my husband was a university student in Russia he spent every waking hour studying for extremely intense exams. There was no time for partying. I guess maybe some of his classmates did as celebrations at the end of passing classes and exams but he did not partake. He spent his free time learning English and working on other skills. That said he's not some boring, wet blanket. He likes beer and drinking with close friends and it's more about socializing and enjoying company than getting drunk. Obviously this is just my experience around him but it seems nothing like US college culture from what I saw. Russian university exams are also vastly different from the US so it's not surprising that the culture on campuses differs a lot.	1641570716.0	hrne0hf	t3_rxuhf0	t3_rxuhf0	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxuhf0/how_big_is_drinking_culture_in_russia_among_the/hrne0hf/

avgpx	This looks like a generic country house of a wealthy peasant.  Not even of a land owner.  Not a city house (city outskirts at best).  That's why it likely has no significance.  It may indeed be something like a childhood house of Tolstoy, Putin, Rasputin, or whoever else, but it's not recognizable as such to an average Russian.  You can see yourself that the house lacks any specific features, and once again: to me, a native Russian, it looks like a simple village house.  Ordinary peasants did not build in two levels.  Those who did well, did.  Land owners had much fancier architecture.  Big cities could not afford a wooden two-level house anywhere in the main area.	1641571327.0	hrnfp5r	t3_rya74h	t3_rya74h	/r/AskARussian/comments/rya74h/is_the_building_on_the_print_famous/hrnfp5r/

However, when I was graduating from my MSc. 6 years later, most of the students were not drinking as much. These days, freshmen drink even less. 2.

If you bypass block via vpn for example... well, I see no risk too. Only if you download some forbidden content, child porn, pirated soft, illegal video, you could get into a trouble if authorities find it on your hard drive. But you could be accused for this particular crimes, not for visiting a site. And you should do something really stupid to attract attention of the police. There is no common practice to watch over user computers countrywide.  The same thing if you go to darknet. You will be accused for buying drugs (for example), not for visiting the site.

As I mentioned, I have 4 different businesses in different industries but the one that I would be moving here is a luxury lifestyle concierge based on offering one of a kind and rare experiences,  even the location that is back home we have a lot of Russian clients so it actually makes sense to have a location here as well, we offer a lot of perks based on  performance only surly people would be strongly motivated to work hard and earn their bonuses. I will surly have to look into this area a lot more.   Thanks for the details on the taxing, I will add these to my notes and research that a little more for when I seek professional advice on all this.

Anyway, one way or another, it was largely the same reasons.  >Countries are wealthy not because they have democracy but they can afford "democracy" because they're wealthy. But why they're wealthy? Westerners know the answer deeply inside. Because they loot and genocide the rest of the world for a few centuries.  Most of former Soviet Bloc, countries like Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, - are richer than Russia, and they haven't made their wealth since 1990 but looting America. They are democracies. They weren't very rich to start with. But their economy is able to work well. Because it's impossible for a single kleptocrat to impose economic inefficiencies on them to line his pockets, but also because if you have citizens governing themselves, they govern themselves more effectively.	1641574091.0	hrnndgs	t3_rxf506	t1_hrmss43	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxf506/your_opinions_on_kazakh_protests/hrnndgs/

9pbfx36r	Orlova-Mochalova is a double last name. There is no strict rule on why it is double, but in the past there were many noble families with double last names. Famous examples are Rimsky-Korsakov, Musin-Pushkin, Sukhovo-Kobylin... In most cases, the second part was added to indicate a certain branch of a large noble family.  Picture 1 is an illustration for Pushkin's *Tale of Tsar Saltan*, and the quote is from there: "Пушки с пристани палят. Кораблю пристать велят" - "Cannons are firing from the pier. Commanding the ship to dock".  Picture 2 is accompanied by a description: "Orlova-Mochalova M. N. (1900-1958). Illustration for A. S. Pushkin's *Tale of the Dead Princess and the Seven Kings.* 1953. Xylography. Author's print." Inscription on the back states the same but adds: "9,0x8,0", "Exhibition of women painters of Leningrad. Catalogue. Leningrad, 1961" and in the bottom "Gift of E. N. Pomerantseva. 12.05.1966"  Picture 3 is an illustration for Pushkin's *Tale of the Golden Cockerel,* picture 4 is for T*ale of Tsar Saltan* again, the rest of the descriptions are practically the same as for picture 2.  Judging by the professionally done descriptions, I suspect these prints were stolen from a museum.

avgpx	How do you plan to define "a decent level of work" on paper?  If you manage to put specific numbers in the contract, then maybe.  That's another professional you need to consult.  In general, you will need to spell everything out.  How people should dress for work, how clean they should be, etc.  If you plan to use it for firing later.  If it's not in the contract, you cannot then say in court that it's common sense.  Dirty clothes are not a reason to fire someone in the luxury lifestyle concierge service.  But then, Russia survives somehow, right?  So, the system works, it's just a different system.  And remember that you cannot do anything to pregnant women.  You cannot fire them.  And the maternity leave is three years.  You have to reserve their seat for them.  Which is why young women are not hired at all at places where people actually need to work.  If such a company hires them, they will immediately get a gazillion of applicants (they get different benefits if give birth when employed) who get hired and next day bring you a doctor's note saying that they are pregnant.  Now you need to give them special conditions.  Then they take a maternity leave, 70 days before the birth, three years after birth.  You can hire someone to fill their position, but only temporary.  In three years this woman comes back, and you have to fire the temp.  She works for a week and brings you another note, she is pregnant again.  Another three years.  And so on.  If you hire young women in principle, eventually all your positions become temporary and normal people don't want to fill them because they can be fired any time that mother decides to come back for day.  And if you put the actual salary in the contract instead of the minimal wage, you will be the target of all preggos in the region.	1641575888.0	hrnsdo6	t3_ry90h9	t1_hrnjt8n	/r/AskARussian/comments/ry90h9/foreigner_and_taxes_russia/hrnsdo6/

i9gc6zc	I would like to believe that you're right for obvious reasons. Call me paranoid if you wish, I just track some changes and it seems like something is sus.  Now look at the OP. As per her legend, she'd moved from Ukraine and always considered herself Russian. Somehow, she thinks Tatars or Bashkirs or any other predominantly Muslim ethnicity do not deserve to be Russians, despite living here their whole life, but she does, along with some other ethnicities and nations she approves.  She did not get much of approval here, which is a relief, but what if her goal was to just plant the seed, the idea?  When somebody says some illegal shit, I can't help but wonder if this is a clever way of trolling and sparking some unnecessary division among us. I mean, did she even take a look at the map of our country?  I am not an ethnic Russian, so this hits too close to home. I am an atheist, but my culture is still a part of my identity, and nothing prevents me and my ethnic Russian friends and colleagues from sharing and admiring our cultures together. That is how it should be.  A lot of my relatives are Muslims, and imo in case of Muslims better watch out for radicalization.  It is dangerous and predominantly Muslim ethnicities can overlook the danger, i.e. recognize the danger too late.	1641576742.0	hrnurkl	t3_rxceto	t1_hrnmpqo	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxceto/are_you_worried_about_the_future_of_russia_and/hrnurkl/

А рядом у нас Апражка    (Апраксин двор, сукарынок) и ремонтируют здание, соответсвенно, ещё есть    грузины, абхазцы и армяне. И все они ходят затавариваться едой в этот    магазин. А я постоянно становлюсь свидетелем того, как все эти браться    ругаются между собой и продавцами, когда, например, в очереди стоят друг    за другом армянин-строитель (очень плохо говорит по русски),    абхазец-асфальтоукладчик (ещё хуже говорит по русски) и грузин-торговец    (великолепно говорит по русски с ацким акцентом). А обслуживает их    айзербайжанец-продацец (русский на среднем уровне).    Происходит это примерно так: Армянин-строитель долго смотрит на    айзербайжанца-продавца и говорит:    \- Слюш, эти, ватэта, вотки, хароший?    Продавец искренне не понимает, я кстати, сзади стою, тоже не очень    догоняю. Продавец удивляется:    \- Шито?    \- Ватета хароший?    \- Шито?    \- Э-э-э, ты чо?

Афальтоукладчик с прояснённым лицом, улыбаясь:    \- Бла-бла-бла, сама хуй, бла-бла-бла, пезда! (пауза, потом радостно)    Мудак!    Строитель одухотворённо поворачивается к продавцу и выпаливает:    \- Сам хуйпезда. Ти мудак!    Продацец искромётно парирует:    \- Э-э-э, шито?    Стоящий передо мной грузин-торговец не выдерживает и, жестикулируя,    разруливает ситуацию:    \- Слюшай, заибали, а? Мне тут утром стоять, да? Ти будешь хуй, ти пезда,    ти мудак. Этому дай вотка харощий, а ти нахуй, патом вазмёщ, адин хуй,    как палавой орган нипанимаешь па руски. Мине винбилидан.    Продавец вопросительно:    \- Шито?

6ed0xx	> can't I put something in writing for the employees to sign stating that they are required to accomplish a decent level of work ? Which would then allow me to hire and fire as needed?  You can, and almost everyone does, but you can't fire him for first time breaking it unless it was serious break of safety rules. For simply breaking instruction or say being late to work you issue disciplinary reprimand. It's legal procedure, quite simple. If worker having reprimand makes another break of instuction, you can legally fire him. Reprimand clears out after a year. So workers sueing employers is really rare and usually means that employers fucked up when they hired said worker. On other hand, it might be hard to fire worker, that comes to work, does everything required of him but just not very effective, that's why say sales persons are almost exclusively work on low basic wage and % of sales.	1641580793.0	hro66ju	t3_ry90h9	t1_hrnjt8n	/r/AskARussian/comments/ry90h9/foreigner_and_taxes_russia/hro66ju/

I don't think anyone is saying it will go badly, more that it's just a whole new can of worms when you deal with another country's labor laws (and then you being a foreigner on top of that.) Being a foreigner running the business could also open you up to scrutiny from authorities and scammers (people wanting to take advantage of you not knowing the ropes.)   How is your Russian language? If not fluent, you might want to consider hiring a professional translator as well. I wouldn't rely on friends, better to get someone you sign a contract with, that way if someone makes a mistake, you can hold them accountable. In the rare case you ended up in court, a court-appointed translator would be provided but they're not usually that great and probably better to have someone you trust/have an established relationship with.  You can ask your tax pro and lawyer about [СНИЛС](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNILS_(Russia)) (Russian social security program basically) because if you are working/running a business in Russia, you need that, even as a foreigner.	1641582699.0	hrobexf	t3_ry90h9	t1_hro50sv	/r/AskARussian/comments/ry90h9/foreigner_and_taxes_russia/hrobexf/

Не понравилось им почему-то работать в прекрасной системе РБ, дома говорят можно подлевачить и заработать больше. Но главное там есть свобода и демократия и нету фашизма, когда хватают на улице и сажают за носки или волосы неправильного цвета и пыток в тюрьме нет. Менты не убивают людей по беспределу, а потом сажают за то, что сказал правду или шьют друзьям убитого дело по наркоте просто за правду.  Для украинца славить Бандеру вполне нормально, т.к. он действительно боролся за независимость Украины. Народ в каждой стране сам себе выбирает героев. Его славят не за то, что он с немцами сотрудничал или что вам там не нравится, а за то, что отдал жизнь за Украину. Россияне тоже каких-то непонятных нам персонажей славят, Минин/Пожарский, ну и пох, ваше дело.

cz3m2wwe	My Russian is good, I think I'm saying that I wouldn't just open a business and not figure it out especially since I take more of a hands of approach and don't really care for the day to day dealings of a business like I once did. I would mostly likely hire a team of professionals while getting a close friend involved in the mix as I'm a firm believer in the old saying the "devil you know" I would much rather get screwed over by a friend than by a stranger.   I also unlike my friends suggestion wouldn't move the current business but just open a branch of it tentatively, in the end it fails I dust myself off and it keep moving. Over all I try to be keep a positive outlook on these things generally I'm a very easy going person. I built 4 businesses in 4 different industries that spread across 5 different countries all   in my earlier twenties with this same attudide, I think Russia is no different form any other country. If I play by the rules and but my best foot forward it should work out alright.  I think,  I asked here for general information so that when I go to professionals I have a few points of interest.

l6v2byz	Catholics did not just "switch" to new calendar, they, along with a lot of other countries had been using it, and Julian calendar before it for quite a while. Russia had need using several variations of Byzantian calendar up to 1700, and adopted Julian calendar when significant part if Europe was already using Grigorian.   Given that we were generally behind the schedule, and that the Georgian calendar was announced by communist government, it seems obvious that such inertial entity as the church was not eager to accept it.    Also I speculate that Orthodox churches were not interested in new calendars for one more reason - Catholic churches have open altar room and are designed to provide a certain quality light on the days of major holidays and messes, as dates of holidays became inconsistent with positions of stellar bodies it got quite obvious to them, especially if we speak of sophisticated architecture of certain western churches. In orthodox churches altar room is walled out and they use more artificial light, so nobody cares how the sunlight is shed upon the ceremonies.	1641584120.0	hrofa63	t3_ryeq77	t3_ryeq77	/r/AskARussian/comments/ryeq77/can_anyone_explain_in_detail_why_russian_orthodox/hrofa63/
bp3ja67r	The advice they give you here is very unprofessional. For example, pregnant women are paid by the employer, but at the expense of the state fund to which he previously deducted funds. So-called social taxes. If you have less contributions, then the fund still owes you these funds and you will not make contributions to it in the future until the debt is exhausted.   The tax system in Russia is not terrible at all. Over the years, it has become very logical and understandable. I would say loyal enough. I advise you to get a partner from Russian friends and it is desirable that he already had at least some business.

The Germans are now a political and economic nation built from the remnants of the Third Reich in their government, because at least a third of German politicians in West Germany are former politicians of the Third Reich who got their place only because they were not communists and are ready to fight them, plus for cooperating with Western powers, which does not negate the fact of their ties with bills that directly or indirectly related to genocides in the East. Modern Germany exists from this core of people, is in an absolutely hostile military bloc for us and encourages Russophobic governments in the east, what kind of cooperation can there be in all moral frameworks with this degeneration of the Third Reich?

My name is Muslim-sounding. I am partly stuck with it, partly too stubborn, because I don't think people have the right to be biased against me or any other person upon hearing a Muslim name.  Besides, culture does not equal religion, even if they influence each other. If you dig into it, Islam has a set of rules leading to erasure of the original culture of people who follow it, like not allowing translations from Arabic leads to language contamination, not allowing animal and people drawings leads to loss of art, etc. It's healthy to admire culture without bringing religion into it.	1641585936.0	hrok6yo	t3_rxceto	t1_hro9mjw	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxceto/are_you_worried_about_the_future_of_russia_and/hrok6yo/

t3gvp	Just to add to your comment.  Byzantine calendar was a modification of Julian calendar and counted days in the same way as Julian, just start of the year was on 1st of September, and the 1st year in it was the supposed date of creation, 5509 B.C.  Today is 25th of December 7530 in Byzantine calendar is also 25th of December 2021 in Julian, so I guess Russian Orthodox Church had less to object in that the date for them functionally did not move like with the switch to Gregorian.  Byzantine calendar was used since 988 (both in Byzantine Empire and Kievan Rus'), and up to the end of existence of the former and 1700 for the latter. 988 is the same year as Christianisation of Rus', so it's basically since the existence of Russian Orthodox Church they celebrated religious holidays on specific days and were not eager to move them 14 days earlier when communist government announced it in 1918.	1641588998.0	hroseg3	t3_ryeq77	t1_hrofa63	/r/AskARussian/comments/ryeq77/can_anyone_explain_in_detail_why_russian_orthodox/hroseg3/
4mjrqia	> what was the old Julian calendar  It doesn't fully account for the difference in the time it takes the Earth to rotate around the Sun. Gregorian calendar on the other hand makes years ending in 00 leap years only if the year is evenly divided by 400 (so, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, while 1700, 1800 and 1900 weren't).  P.S.

3mlo6bye	In my opinion, Putin should have left back in 2008.  He had to leave behind a stable system of checks and balances.  He should have gone down in history as the founding father of the nation, and generally a good guy.  Most likely, this system would be subordinated to a group of oligarchs, as happened in America with its Senatorial lobbying for laws.  However, no one could accuse us of being authoritarian.  Now there is no political competition.  The government is degrading.  The manipulation of public opinion is rude.  I would like a more subtle game if the government wants to manipulate me, and this rudeness is just offensive.  Putin himself has driven himself into a corner from which he will be carried out dead, and his empire will be divided by his heirs, or he will be removed from power, as he himself pushed the Yeltsin family.  But this is highly unlikely.	1641591602.0	hrozb4p	t3_rx6o67	t3_rx6o67	/r/AskARussian/comments/rx6o67/what_do_you_guys_really_think_of_putin/hrozb4p/

Not just "rough" sex, but a real rape and other forms of unwilling sex. For example, this word is often used in threats of sexual violence.  And in Russian culture, such things are not considered attractive. On the other hand, if your husband is far from Russian culture, you can use this word too.

Sometimes it gets really confusing. Latin letters are everywhere in Russia and Russian speaking countries, so you might have no idea which alphabet it is. Does HATE means ‘hate’ or is it ‘нате’ (‘natye’ as ‘take that’)? Was this pack signed ‘Hukumka’or was it ‘Никитка’ (Nikitka)?

I believe it's not the girl but her father who needs the diploma, and the girl is not really ready for it.	1641987956.0	hsc5jvv	t3_s1xjko	t3_s1xjko	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1xjko/what_do_you_think_about_alisa_teplyakovas_case/hsc5jvv/

1sb1fdto	Please be careful, if you look like everyone but do not speak a language or speak it bad - people may think it's a prank and make them angry :( I highly recommend you to keep your passport everytime when you are outside and prepare a kind of emergency contact to Russian native who can explain what do you need to doctor or policeman if needed.  Regarding the initial question - there is no way to learn Russian fast and good, it's a complicated language and even foreigners who live here 10-15 years still sounds a little strange for natives. I would recommend you to start with simple useful things like "I want to buy...", "Where is..." And so on. I'm not sure about Kazakhstan, in Russia (outside the biggest cities) you can literally stay hungry and homeless if you do not speak Russian even a bit.	1641991036.0	hscaadb	t3_s21chp	t3_s21chp	/r/AskARussian/comments/s21chp/how_can_i_learn_your_language/hscaadb/

8fzpbt29	Ну так выебать и означает "половой акт особой жёсткости", и чаще всего применяется именно при, как вы говорите, "dirty talk". Термин "изнасилование" же, больше похож на холодный английский криминологический термин "homicide". Кстати, пример можно было и получше взять, например "Её выебали на вписке", где конкретно Её изнасиловали, однако, такого исхода следовало ожидать, так что чаще всего, это происходит намеренно. Да и последние два примера не сколько про половой акт, сколько метафоры, сравнивающие то или иное действие с жёсткой ёблей.	1642002097.0	hscy74j	t3_s235zx	t1_hscuiu1	/r/AskARussian/comments/s235zx/teach_me_some_dirty_talk_in_russian/hscy74j/

9v2hcztb	As mentioned above - I think the fact is that you paid for the order in front of your friends without asking it.    Perhaps he has some kind of complexes about money and the relationship to money to his family. On dates, it's customary to pay for a girl during courtship if she's okay with it (although it's perfectly okay to split the bill, especially if your partner isn't wealthy than you). In a relationship, the one who can afford is already paying. In any case, you'd better decide this question ahead of time for the future. If this is extremely important for him, then there is nothing wrong with it, the main thing is that he does not force you to do what you do not like.	1642002745.0	hsczux7	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsczux7/

8fzpbt29	It's a thing that comes from parenting. Russian men are taught as willing servants to women, basically. It's considered an honor to pay for your fiance. The worst part about it is that a man will be bullied for not paying for his woman, and not by women, but by men. It's actually baffling to me. Fortunately with time it reduces in our society.  I guess your boyfriend is a good man, but he's got one of the worst cases of brainwash, if he considers it offensive and makes a scandal like that. Although I guess the effect amplifies if it's done in front of his friends.   I think that efforts in a relationship must be equal, and you should talk to him about that, and tell him about your efforts to understand this problem, show him this post, I'll leave a message specifically for him. It might seem rude, but it's honest advice.  А теперь блять, если ты это читаешь, то не устраивай хуй пойми что из-за такой хуйни,  у тебя замечательная и любящая девушка, которая может заплатить за себя и за тебя, а не шлюха, которая хочет на тебе нажиться. Её нужно беречь. Да ты хоть знаешь, как сложно найти такую женщину, которая готова будет заплатить за всех, вместо того, чтобы паразитировать на мужчине?! "Кто я для тебя?" Пойми, что она пытается заплатить, потому что она любит тебя, поэтому не будь долбоебом и прими тот факт, что она так проявляет свою любовь и наконец прими тот факт, что сейчас не XIX век, снохачества больше нет, женщина равна с мужчиной, и может позволить себе заплатить за обоих. Ещё бы написал, особенно про "Я тебе не американец", но смысл уже понятен. Этим сообщением я не хочу тебя оскорбить, я лишь хочу тебя вразумить.

And no I can't ask my friend (long story). 🥱	1642003738.0	hsd2fjy	t3_s297vx	t1_hscz0qh	/r/AskARussian/comments/s297vx/hey_im_from_europe_and_im_looking_for_someone/hsd2fjy/

117a6e	Russia has no de jure claim over Ukraine.  International law is based on several principles, among which are territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. Each country has de jure borders that cannot be changed by force (ex injuria jus non oritur). If these de jure borders align exactly with de facto borders, it's fine. If something violated them, the country is free to use military force and restore its territorial integrity. No country is free to annex anything outside its de jure borders.  Example: Georgia has a de jure claim to Abkhazia, because Abkhazia lies within Georgia's de jure borders. Georgia can use force to take over Abkhazia while staying within the limits of international law (though Russia will object because Abkhazia is a Russian protectorate). But Russia has no de jure claim over Ukraine, because it lies outside Russia's de jure borders, and so it is not possible for Russia to conquer Ukraine and get away with that.  De jure borders form on the principle of uti possidetis: newly formed countries use their previous internal borders as de jure borders when they are formed. Russia and Ukraine left the USSR together, so their former internal border is now their de jure border. The only way to gain a de jure claim to Ukraine is to restore Soviet rule and prove that Russia and Ukraine left the Union illegally and aren't legitimate states.	1642004484.0	hsd4dfq	t3_s1sfm9	t3_s1sfm9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/hsd4dfq/

But when we just started, it would be weird AF, for me if woman pay, I think it's ok if she pays nothing wrong with it, but I can't get over it somehow.

b3z20xw3	These are just psychological traps that have become a custom, there is even a proverb "Кто девушку ужинает, тот её и танцует" (Whoever eats a girl, dances her).  This allows some men, having paid for a girl, to claim a personal relationship, and girls to deceive men for money.  If he asks the question 'who am I to you?' and pretends to be offended, while not trying to negotiate and explain with you, then my advice to you is to break off relations with him, because from your description it turns out that he is inclined to throw tantrums, and it is better not to deal with such people.	1642004635.0	hsd4rrb	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsd4rrb/

Despite book being weak, lacks message(arguably) and lacks logic(definetely) - still you have to notice that Preobrazhenskiy and Sharikov are of similar kind, that's why one is the creation of another. And people quoting the professor seem not to understand that they are closer to Sharikov when they do so.  Or maybe you just read skipping lines, i don't know. Could happen if "Ha-ha, commies bad (grandfather said that they stole his galosha:)), something bad about commies - i support, U-S-A, U-S-A, pew-pew".

req9ll5	It is also tradition for men to pay for women here.  However, the progressiveness of the last decade or two has led to the norm of women paying 50/50, *if they choose*. It is still expected of a man to pay, unless the woman expresses that she wishes to split the bill.  In this case, I agree that it is an unhealthy relationship dynamic to get aggressive about it. However, it is still important that he is able to express himself and communicate his belief. If no agreement can be made, then perhaps the relationship won’t work out.	1642006521.0	hsd9rvg	t3_s28erw	t1_hscv7qn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsd9rvg/

People who hate communism aren’t into the caste system… we still believe that one can change their social standing etc through work, education, luck etc… it’s just that Bulgakov for better or for worse saw what communism does to people, worse animal instincts coming right out of humans…   You have to remember that Bulgakov was NOT an anti-communist too, he was Stalin’s pet playwright so the fact that this came out is actually pretty amazing	1642007652.0	hsdcs61	t3_ry73se	t1_hsd8civ	/r/AskARussian/comments/ry73se/what_films_does_the_russian_intelligentsia_watch/hsdcs61/

I teach Russian at the college level in the USA and our first semester course covers all of the most important basic concepts such as the case system and verb aspect. We also focus a lot on learning from context to prepare students for going abroad.  If you don't have time for that, then the suggestion to find a tutor is also good. If you're at a big university,  contact the world languages or Russian department and see if they know any tutors. A lot of times there will be grad students or community members  who tutor for extra cash. Barring that, Skype tutoring is also good. But try to find someone who can and will work with you on grammar. Once you have a basic grasp of that, it's much much easier to get around in Russian, even if your vocabulary is limited.	1642010714.0	hsdl2o3	t3_s21chp	t3_s21chp	/r/AskARussian/comments/s21chp/how_can_i_learn_your_language/hsdl2o3/

8z7fs9qb	Usually, if two friends go out for dinner, it's expected that everyone pays  for themselves, if you go as a couple, a man is expected to pay for both. So my guess - he was feeling insecure, like by trying to split the bill, you are trying to put a distance, thus "what am I to you." BUT he was absolutely in the wrong for starting an argument about that. First, he should have considered cultural differences and could calmly talk to you if it made him uncomfortable. Second, "I'm not like your American men"? not like what exactly? Sounds demeaning and condescending >:-( I hope it was said in the heat of the argument, and he apologized later on.   I, personally, can't see any problem with splitting the bill, but if it makes him feel bad, talk to him, maybe taking turns paying is better, that way you and him pay not for yourself, but for you as a unit, a couple, and it would be better. He should understand that you are coming from a good place and just trying to take care of him.	1642011371.0	hsdmupz	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsdmupz/
4f17xlql	Yo dude, had a look at the Nordstream thing. One handy picture was - https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/pm9o6u/nordstream_2_pipeline_completed_russia_picks/  I can't understand why there is any contention at the moment. From the news I am reading Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine, and the US/NATO is expecting this, and trying to avoid it.  During these talks Russia has said they want a guarantee that no missiles etc will be built near them.  Which is expected, naturally, as any nation/person would want that safety.  Conversely, any nation wants the capabilities to quell any potential threat, naturally.   What I am not understanding, is if they do not get that garuantee (which they won't) what will happen?  By what I am reading nothing is happening, its all another big talking point in the media to get everyone rallied up about something else.  On the nordstream thing, I can't see why the NS2 being political is of note. If Russia wants another pipeline then so what? I can't totally see it being used to lessen the fees they pay to Ukraine. But again, so what? It's perfectly within their right to do this.  I can't see any country in this whole debacle comprising another's sovereignty in a real way. I suppose if Russia invades Ukraine this will be a real issue and everyone wants to avoid that.	1642011466.0	hsdn3px	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdjak1	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hsdn3px/

They typically have a number of (mainstream) Russian beers, including the famous 9% Baltika 9!   I went back to Russia for the first time in 9 years a couple of summers ago and the craft brewery scene has taken off. The IPAs were IMHO underwhelming compared to American, but the breweries I frequented excelled in sour styles (including sour IPAs) and dark beers like stouts. The sours made with Russian botanicals were especially great. But my experience is limited to the small city where I was staying and the occasional bottles from Moscow and St. Petersburg I found at the store. Hopefully others here can give you better advice about specific breweries to check out!	1642011724.0	hsdnsyr	t3_s10kon	t1_hsbu5hc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s10kon/i_am_planning_a_big_three_to_four_week_stint_in/hsdnsyr/

ajnku	Putin's demands aren't just "don't build missiles". It's Putin demanding that no new countries are admitted to NATO. You know... a set of demands that sound very much like Eastern European countries are just his or American pawns.  There is already an agreement from 1997 between NATO and Russia that covers missiles and nuclear weapon dislocation... that also talks about how sovereign nations are free to choose their method of protecting themselves, including joining NATO.  Nord Stream is now a purely political blackmail tool for Putin. Gazprom is literally loosing billions on failing to deliver gas to European markets and Putin said in the last week of December, that Gazprom will not increase deliveries unless NS2 is approved. Deliveries to EU have dropped 18% since 2019.  And since when does Russian government agency have a right to build in Germany or Denmark?	1642012913.0	hsdr038	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdn3px	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hsdr038/

3mfm3s6r	Yes it is our custom in Russia, that when a man dates a girl, he pays for her.  If you like the guy and want to keep the good relationship, I advise you to let him pay for you during the date.  Let me explain how it works. If a man and a woman date each other - it may lead them to getting married and raise a children. It is not necessary, but there is a chance.  And, while being pregnant, giving birth, and babysitting, a woman probably will not be working for some period of time, and will rely on man for sustenance. Again, it is not necessary, but there is a chance. It is a custom for russian girls to spend 1,5-3 years at home, dedicatind herself to babysitting.  Therefore, when a man dates a girl and pays for her small necessities - he symbolically shows her that he is ready, both mentally and finanсially, for a such development. I must press, that this is not a direct invitation, it is just a sign of readiness for a further development. Look at that as a light flirting.  Now, knowing that, lets imagine, what symbolises the woman's desire for splitting the bill?  It is a sign that woman openly rejects such flirting. It is like you said to him "I see that you are ready to care for me, and I do not need your care, because I do not see you as a romantic interest not in the slightest". Of cource, any russian man would not be happy to hear that.  I hope, that helps you clear misunderstanding. Wish you both best of luck.	1642013575.0	hsdssbw	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsdssbw/

4f17xlql	But Germany did initially agree to this pipeline. And from what I can see the reason Germany rescinded is because they want a Switzerland based company to switch to Germany based (in line with German regulations).    Are we saying the gas from Russia is a god given right? Or that they are sovereign state and can do what they like?   On the border issue and the demands, it still doesn't feel that big a deal. Russia can ask for it, and we can say no.   Again, if Russia invades Ukraine that will be mental, but that isn't happening.  Fron what I'm seeing people are panicking Russia will stop supplying EU gas. Well, unfortunately we have been stupid enough to overly rely on one source, and the outcome is as expected tbh.	1642014037.0	hsdu0r3	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdr038	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hsdu0r3/

2vpi4sp6	Even if he's not fully genuinely conservative about man&woman relationships, *if his friends share this conservative outlook*, a woman paying for her man on a date can be percieved kinda humiliating, making him look *as if it's him who is a girl on a date here*, or *feel inadequate as a man*, particulary in therms of not being able to provide for his woman, or looking dependant on the woman (when a conservative outlook supposes the woman to be dependant on man).  Now, I personally don't agree with such an outlook, and I'd split the bill equally at any occasion. But most of Russian men and women get some bits of this old mentality through their parents, or their social circle. The time changes, and it's getting less of a thing now, though, you shouldn't think that this is some Russian thing. It's and old mentlity thing. US is just bit ahead in some aspects of gender relationships, so it might feel "American" to let the woman pay, especially since he's in a foreign enviroment, he might be instinctivly clinging to his old ways that he percieves as "Russian".	1642014499.0	hsdv8re	t3_s28erw	t1_hsdfx3j	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsdv8re/

17epbz	Fun fact that it was and is still widely used for corruption (crime). A few years back government introduced the centralized web services to perform government procurements. Consider that 80% of russian economy is government, so those procurements are a hugest pile of money.   So now each government agency (including regional ones, including education, medicine, everything) has to setup a bidding lot on that site, looking for any business to fulfill it. The site had a nice search there, so business could look for bids which it could fulfill based on search keywords.   But how can one introduce corruption here? In the description of the lot you can replace russian Cyrillic letters with Latin. So "компьютер" becomes "кoмпьютер", looks similar, but actually two different инеу combinations for computer, so this breaks search. Random business will not find that lot, but you can share a link with someone who will return a part of the fee.  Obvious fraud and corruption, but was not punished by law and was very widely spread.	1642015718.0	hsdygzz	t3_s1jxka	t3_s1jxka	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1jxka/do_russians_misuse_the_latin_alphabet_for/hsdygzz/

7h7ycf33	When a user transmits several propaganda phrases at once, it's not a matter of discussion, it becomes arguing about tricks. Each of these phrases is based on some artificial beliefs which, in turn, were produced to explain common lies. For instance, there are only 2 variants: people are totally happy with each and every government and president, or there are Americans who hire protesters (or there are Europeans, or Japanese, or aliens). No protest can be directly caused by the president's inner politics. This can be only terrorists from US special services. Also, each country has its interest which includes consequent ruining of another countries. You can not be interested in international trade and collaboration and in scientific researches. USA needs Ukraine and Russia to be destroyed or become weak and poor. Why? That's important myth from Soviet ideology which is used by Russian propaganda. Only Cold War and only nuke bombs. So when the president on Ukraine talked about integration with Europe and then told it's not possible and then talked about it again, people who wanted to live in Europe and be more independent from Russia went to peaceful protest meetings. Then there were police shooting protesters, Molotov cocktails and so on. Of course in this point it was a matter of some interest of USA and Europe, but much more so of Russian president. He is obsessed with false imperial politics and strongly dislikes any government in post-Soviet countries which he can't control. Also there were some business questions about oil and gas. When Ukraine became more independent and more democratic, the Russian president needed to punish it in revenge. He occupied Crimea and started war on Ukrainian territory. Now Russian propaganda say that Crimea “came home” and that war is just between Ukrainian people. The question why Russian president thinks he should control post-Soviet countries can't be discussed. His ratings become lower and lower slowly in the past years, so he thinks about short war to raise his popularity before the elections. He doesn't know any other methods and don't consider allowing anyone else to become president. He will steal elections and fake its results for sure via electronic votes and all that methods that we obviously see on the 2021 elections and in pat years, and the main question is if he will add 15% to his results, or more than 40%. If you think it's none of a difference, look at protests in Belarus. So this hybrid informational autocracy with elements of tyranny mainly produces a pretty picture for press and people => no honest elections, no massive protests, no real politics should be seen, just fake picture. Just fake news.  I could somewhat simplified the situation, but this is closer to what we have.	1642015792.0	hsdyo2j	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdjxkb	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hsdyo2j/
3m72gmdg	>I felt bad for him because he always pays  From a (generalized and simplified) Russian perspective, it's a bit like feeling bad for someone for having to pay taxes, fares, or rent. I can understand the principled objection to the implied gender power dynamic this creates, but—rightly or wrongly, from a man's perspective those are usually theoretical things of no immediate relevance.  So when a woman offers to split the bill, or pay all of it herself, here's a (deliberately very un-date-like) analogy of how it plays out on our end.  &#x200B;  TAX OFFICE CLERK: *(going over your declaration)* Ummm.... do you *have* to declare the money you made selling apples from your garden?  YOU: Y...yes? I mean, it's an income tax and that was an income? Isn't that the whole point?  TOC: Yes, but... you sold them at the town market. It's not like there's a paper trail. You could save money, you know.  YOU:  Well, uh, I guess I could. What's in it for you, though?  TOC: You see... people have been making too much money lately from selling their homegrown produce. If this goes on, our region could lose its farmer subsidies.  YOU: That's a big hypothetical.  TOC: Well, if you like, it also makes the region look kinda backward and that's unfair. We have two successful IT startups, and 20 percent of our electricity is green. But that isn't the sort of thing people acknowledge. When the annual reports come in, we're gonna be "that place with the homegrown produce".  YOU: So you're saying that as a good citizen, I should become a tax evader?  TOC: Like I said, you'd save money.  YOU: People know I sell apples at the market.   TOC: *(sardonically)* And they're all big fans of the tax office?  YOU: No, of course not. They keep ranting how the rates are daylight robbery and everything. But—but—the few people who've suggested not reporting our fruit and vegetable sales are getting those looks. It's just so, I dunno, *cheap.* Cutting taxes is for sleazy corporate suits.  TOC: Well well. Speaking of sleazy. Far be it from me to suggest that you're using the lack of a paper trail to launder money—I'm sure a thorough audit will show that it's a perfectly honest side income—but, you understand, it's weeks' worth of extra paperwork and hassle that none of us want. When we could just pretend the apples never existed.  YOU: You just like to make it complicated, don't you.  TOC: Oh. You don't like complicated things. How typical of someone who sells apples at the town market.	1642015816.0	hsdyqhp	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsdyqhp/
ajnku	Russian gas isn't a "god given right".  However reality of it is that Putin uses this gas as a political tool.   Gazprom is not business, it's politics. We should treat it as such.  What that means is that Gazprom will do things that make no business sense, like not supplying Europe with gas when gas prices are astronomical = loosing out on high profits for Gazprom, and Russia.  There's a long list of people who are to blame for dependence - most of them are ignorant western businessmen and politicians.  As for Putin's ultimatum, you should read the full text before saying "doesn't feel like a big deal". It was such a big deal, that even Finland had to tell GTFO to Russia. And, thankfully, the Baltic states will block any NATO-Russia agreement that would sacrifice any security guarantees for us.	1642016217.0	hsdzosp	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdu0r3	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hsdzosp/

9vflik3r	**I will give you three perspectives on paying for dates**  **Conservative:** it is a man’s duty to care for, provide for, and protect their woman. Paying for dates falls under providing. Splitting the bill does not allow him to show he will provide for you, signifies you are not seriously interested in him, or both  **Liberal:** times have changed, men and women are more or less equal, and we must continue taking steps towards equality. Both men and women are equally capable of earning money and are therefore equally capable of paying for a date. A man paying for a woman’s date is sexist of him and shows the women is willing to accept financial control from a man; a strong independent woman pays for her own half  **Radical:** men and women are fundamentally different. Women have far more to lose (low chance of orgasm, risk of STDs, potential pregnancy) in sexual relationships. On top of this, society is dominated by men and women are routinely oppressed  A man must display that he will provide value to your life rather than exploit you. Paying for dates is one way to display that, especially when society financially favors men (men pay >>> women pay, # of men leaders >>> # of women leaders, women pay $$$ for cosmetics, body body care, etc)  Like conservatism, not paying for dates does not allow him to display his value to you, signifies you are not interested, or both  **How this relates to Russians and your situation**  Russia has both strong elements of conservatism (since forever) and radicalism (Soviet Union) from its past. This colors your boyfriend’s worldview  America, on the other hand, is a liberal society. While we are split politically, but businesses and the media solidly endorse liberalism. So this colors your worldview  I hope this offers new perspectives to you and helps guide your decision, whatever it may be.

7e6ne1cg	3.) **The shelling of Tskhinvali by the Georgian armed forces during the night of 7 to 8 August 2008** **marked the beginning of the large-scale armed conflict in Georgia**...  ...  14.) Open hostilities began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008.    **Operations started with a massive Georgian artillery attack.**   ...  16.) The Mission is not in a position to consider as sufficiently substantiated the    Georgian claim concerning a large-scale Russian military incursion into South Ossetia before 8 August 2008.   ...  19.) **There is the question of whether the use of force by Georgia in South Ossetia, beginning with the shelling of Tskhinvali during the night of 7/8 August 2008, was justifiable under international law. It was not.** Georgia had acknowledged that the prohibition of the use of force was applicable to its conflict in South Ossetia in specific legally binding international documents, such as the Sochi Agreement of 1992 or the 1996 Memorandum on Measures to Provide Security and Strengthen Mutual Trust between the Sides in the Georgian-South Ossetian Conflict. Even if it were assumed that Georgia was repelling an attack, e.g. in response to South Ossetian attacks against Georgian populated villages in the region, according to international law, its armed response would have to be both necessary and proportional. **It is not possible to accept that the shelling of Tskhinvali during much of the night with GRAD multiple rocket launchers (MRLS) and heavy artillery would satisfy the requirements of having been necessary and proportionate in order to defend those villages. It follows from the illegal character of the Georgian military assault that South Ossetian defensive action in response did conform to international law in terms of legitimate self-defence**...  ...  20.) At least as far as the initial phase of the conflict is concerned, an additional legal question **is whether the Georgian** **use of force against Russian peacekeeping forces on Georgian territory, i.e. in South Ossetia, might have been justified**. **Again the answer is in the negative**. There was no ongoing armed attack by Russia before the start of the Georgian operation. Georgian claims of a large-scale presence of Russian armed forces in South Ossetia prior to the Georgian offensive on 7/8 August could not be substantiated by the Mission. It could also not be verified that Russia was on the verge of such a major attack, in spite of certain elements and equipment having been made readily available.    There is also no evidence to support any claims that Russian peacekeeping units in South Ossetia were in flagrant breach of their obligations under relevant international agreements such as the Sochi Agreement and thus may have forfeited their international legal status.    **Consequently, the use of force by Georgia against Russian peacekeeping forces in Tskhinvali in the night of 7/8 August 2008 was contrary to international law**.   ...  21.) When considering the legality of Russian military force against Georgia, the    answer needs to be differentiated. The Russian reaction to the Georgian attack can be divided into two phases: first, the immediate reaction in order to defend Russian peacekeepers, and second, the invasion of Georgia by Russian armed forces reaching far beyond the administrative boundary of South Ossetia. In the first instance, there seems to be little doubt that if the Russian peacekeepers were attacked, Russia had the right to defend them using military means proportionate to the attack. **Hence the Russian use of force for defensive purposes during the first phase of the conflict would be legal**...  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30\_09\_09\_iiffmgc\_report.pdf](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30_09_09_iiffmgc_report.pdf)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  So, I have highlighted the key points of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission report on the Conflict in Georgia.  Despite a bunch of other BS, they couldn't ignore the facts:  1. Georgia attacked first,   2. Georgia deliberately killed civilians in South Ossetia and illegally attacked Russian peacekeepers.   3. Russia had every right to a military response in these circumstances.   4. The military response followed after Georgia violated international law and committed a war crime.   5. Then there are pathetic attempts to accuse Russia that the response was excessive. However, this does not negate the FACTS: Georgia was the aggressor, which received a tough response, which excludes further attempts to resolve the issue by force from Georgia. Exactly what we do with every aggressor throughout history: we beat the shit out of them.	1642020759.0	hsebv5f	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdx2l9	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hsebv5f/

I will say, my program is not super difficult, especially compared to what I expected coming from the US.  You are not able to work after graduation unless you find a company to sponsor a work visa for you. On a student visa you can only work part time, and it's only good for a year and only while you're a student (or for just 90 days with more renewals, depending on what your program qualifies you for).	1642024095.0	hsekzcp	t3_s0so6y	t1_hsc9olb	/r/AskARussian/comments/s0so6y/can_i_ask_some_of_the_students_in_russia_some/hsekzcp/

5jy241z4	It's more of a male pride thing, but yes it's also very very cultural too, it's not really limited to Russians either, plenty of men in America insist on paying, including me. By having you pay for him he feels emasculated because he prides himself on things like that.   I used to get mad about that too because I grew up with a bunch of Russians until one day I just realized that paying for things is hardly what makes a man a man, but to be honest it still bugs me a little too, but I wouldn't let it ruin my day if someone pays for me. Especially because some of the girls I've dated made twice as much as me lol.	1642024371.0	hselq1n	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hselq1n/

t564j	Forget Dugin. I don't get the obsession with this guy. Nobody in Russia takes him seriously, no one. He's not even Noam Chomsky levels, he's like a joke parody of what a "public intellectual" is.  I don't know about audio books but Sean's Russia Blog is interesting. He often covers a huge variety of topics about Russia, including geopolitics. Here's an episode he did with Andrei Tsygankov, who is a member of Russian think tank the Valdai Discussion Club, thus could be an interesting listen: [https://srbpodcast.org/2021/06/04/the-us-russia-rivalry/](https://srbpodcast.org/2021/06/04/the-us-russia-rivalry/)	1642024975.0	hsenbcg	t3_s2gx0l	t1_hsegc7j	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2gx0l/whats_a_book_on_the_general_russian_geopolitical/hsenbcg/

78fhtpuy	First of all, what you described is slavery. No, no man on earth has enough money to get a slave. What you described has nothing remotely equivalent to what men are providing for. Second of all, women aren’t owing men anything if they pay for some dates. Lol. It’s just a courtship. Just a thing. Same as holding a door. If you think you owe something to a man that pays for your dinner — you should reevaluate your self esteem and self worth. Third of all, if man actually trully invests in woman — covers life expenses, buys house, car, vacations, etc then surely there is some implication that woman will try to birth him a kid. But that’s about it. You aren’t slave. It’s just males job to provide food and housing, and woman’s job to birth a child. Period. If you think you owe him to be a slave then again you should reevaluate your self worth.

avgpx	>If you're walking past the corner of Madison Avenue and Fifty-fifth Street between one and three in the afternoon, take the trouble to tip back your head and look up – at the unwashed windows of the black Hotel Winslow. There on the topmost, sixteenth floor, on the center-most of the hotel's three balconies, I sit half naked. Usually I am eating shchi and at the same time working on my tan, I'm a great sun lover. Shchi, or sauerkraut soup, is my usual fare; I eat pot after pot of it, day after day, and eat almost nothing else. The spoon I eat the shchi with is wooden and was brought from Russia. It is decorated with flowers of scarlet, gold, and black.  >The surrounding office buildings gawk at me with their smoky glass walls, with the thousand eyes of the clerks, secretaries, and managers. A nearly, sometimes entirely naked man, eating shchi from a pot. They don't know it's shchi, though. What they see is that every other day, on a hot plate there on the balcony, a man cooks a huge steaming pot of something barbaric. At one time I also ate chicken, but then I stopped. There are five advantages to shchi: (1) It's very cheap, two or three dollars a pot, and a pot is enough for two days! (2) It doesn't spoil out of the refrigerator, even in very hot weather. (3) It's quick to make, only an hour and a half. (4) It can and should be eaten cold. (5) There's no better food for summer, because it's tart.  >I choke and gobble, naked on the balcony. I'm not ashamed before those unknown people in the offices or their eyes. Sometimes I also have with me, hanging on a nail driven into the window frame, a small green battery transistor given to me by Alyoshka Slavkov, a poet who plans to become a Jesuit. I enliven the taking of shchi with music. My preference is a Spanish station. I'm not inhibited. I am often to be found bare-assed in my shallow little room, my member pale against the background of the rest of my body, and I do not give a damn whether they see me or don't, the clerks, secretaries, and managers. I'd rather they did see me. They're probably used to me by now, and perhaps they miss me on days when I don't crawl out on my balcony. I suppose they call me "that crazy across the way."  >My little room is four paces long and three paces wide. On the walls, covering the marks left by previous occupants, there hang: a large portrait of Mao Tse-tung, an object of horror to all the people who drop by to see me; a portrait of Patricia Hearst; my own photograph against a background of icons and a brick wall, with me holding a thick volume, perhaps a dictionary or a Bible, and wearing a 114-patch blazer tailored by me, Limonov, monster out of the past; a portrait of Andre Breton, founder of the surrealist school, which portrait I have carried with me for many years, and which Andre Breton is usually unknown to those who come to see me; a call to support gay rights; other posters, among them one for Workers Party candidates; paintings by my friend the artist Khachaturian; numerous lesser papers. At the head of my bed is the poster "For Your Freedom and Ours," left from a demonstration in front of the New York Times. Completing the wall decor are two shelves of books. Mainly poetry.  >I think it's clear to you by now what a character I am, even though I forgot to introduce myself. I started running on without announcing who I was; I forgot. Overjoyed at the opportunity to drown you in my voice at last, I got carried away and never announced whose voice it was. My fault, forgive me, we'll straighten it out right now.  >I am on welfare. I live at your expense, you pay taxes and I don't do a fucking thing. Twice a month I go to the clean, spacious welfare office at 1515 Broadway and receive my checks. I consider myself to be scum, the dregs of society, I have no shame or conscience, therefore my conscience doesn't bother me and I don't plan to look for work, I want to receive your money to the end of my days. And my name is Edichka, "Eddie-baby."	1642026352.0	hsequnw	t3_s2gx0l	t3_s2gx0l	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2gx0l/whats_a_book_on_the_general_russian_geopolitical/hsequnw/

cw3jl62t	Да, начни с фильмов и сериалов, которые ты уже смотрел на английском и примерно понимаешь/помнишь что они говорят. Можно сначала пересматривать любимые фильмы по несколько раз, потом перейти на новые. И начни не с русских субтитров, а с английских, так тебе сначала будет легче понимать о чем говорят. Потом уже перейди на русском. And good luck with translating our text. Start writing in Russian, even it’s bad. Write in Russian, use online translator to convert in English, so you could see what you did wrong, then rewrite in Russian again :)	1642031036.0	hsf2hfg	t3_s2aipq	t1_hsdbtfm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2aipq/i_want_to_get_better_at_russian_language/hsf2hfg/

72jn9	I think Dugin's "4th Theory" framework isn't really accurate, but his beard game's on-point!  My short understanding of Russia, is that although there's definitely some things to criticize about Russia's geopolitical actions, Russia is generally a good influence geopolitically; Russia is very important, because they're basically the only opposition to the Satanic globalism of the E.U. And as for Putin, his brave opposition to the LGBTQ agenda, regardless of the attacks, is hard to find in ANY world leader these days.  It shows the kind of integrity Putin has, and makes me think most of the suspicions and conspiracy theories surrounding him could not possibly be true.	1642031744.0	hsf45wx	t3_s2gx0l	t1_hseqqox	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2gx0l/whats_a_book_on_the_general_russian_geopolitical/hsf45wx/

That instead of digging question and analyzing things (in this case in book) you've scratched the surface for easy answers and misinterpreted half of story you rely on?

Maybe people carrying hundreds of others aren't that educated and competent as, i donno, Ivanka Trump? :)  Or maybe everyone living in slums in Mumbai are just too lazy, too stupid to compete in personal qualities with some smokers in US?   Or, as you say, it's about luck?  And what is luck then? If you are born in top 0,1% family you have 90% for success, if you are born in bottom 50% you have 0,00001% for equal success?   Nice, very fair and efficient, don't you find it somehow connected with the mess we have around?   >it’s just that Bulgakov for better or for worse saw what communism does to people  Do we discuss the world on how Bulgakov saw it from his personal and political sides?

Where I draw the line is when you start talking about my relatives (grandfather) or me. You don’t know me. And Bolsheviks did kill both of my grandfathers which I did leak somewhere on Reddit so yes I am fucken sensitive about it…. Feel free to insult my ideas though…  Let’s talk about people who hate communism… it’s a lot of people and they don’t have to be the ones actually benefiting from “capitalism”.  I find it interesting that you used hunter biden or Ivanka trump as an example of a useless person… you do know that there are tons and tons of people who are much richer than US politicians whose children are also useless, right?  It’s funny because children of politicians is the socialist example of unfairness… in capitalism it’s heirs of entrepreneurs…  Anyways, I am happy to respond to you but we are sort of all over the place - do you want to analyze bulgakov or argue fairness of capitalist society?

But ask him to compromise some time. When it’s just the two of you, you take him out. Just explain that you understand his stance and respect his cultural beliefs, but at the same time you have your own. He is a knight, but you aren’t a damsel in distress.

2ui8j7ot	I’m an American and have a good amount of experience in Russian speaking countries. How long have you been there? Have you been paying attention to the culture there? You embarrassed him pretty good. You made him look weak. His friends are wondering if you are the boss in the relationship. You’re not in America and depending what part of russia you are in feminism isn’t that accepted. The further away from moscow the less popular it is.   I’m not trying to bash you though it may seem like it to you. It’s just that Americans tend to go to places and say, “I’m an American and I’m here.” Rather than observe and integrate into the local culture. I’ve seen it too many times.   There was a guy and a dinner and he decided to pick up the bill. He commented “wow this is so cheap.” That ended his early dating relationship with the woman he was with. No one wants to be looked down upon. And in some ways, your move made it seem like you looked down upon him to others that were there. Like I said you embarrassed him.	1642050831.0	hsg8roj	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsg8roj/

zgyfq	Вот тут то ты и спалился. Все нео-нацисские группировки в России с хотя-бы маленьким намёком на политическое влияние разгромлены (впрочем, как и либеральные, но это другой вопрос). Казаки, блэт, с каких пор нацики? Если уж сравнивать, они гораздо ближе к антифа. С началом 2000 когда фа и антифа стенка-на-стенку друг друга ходили даже сравнивать нечего. Футбольные фанаты это отдельный разговор и в общем-то сильным нациками мог похвастаться разве что Спартак. И то в свои лучшие годы. Внезапно, даже пересекался с упоротыми в бобби дэззлере (знаковый паб, для тех кто в теме в Москве). Сидят, вспоминают лучшие годы. Про остальных даже как-то стыдно упоминать, лол. И самое главное тут они не ходят по залам суда, не врываются в мэрии, не пикетируют под белым домом. Как бы да, они есть, как и во всех странах бывшего соц блока на волне подъёма национализма в 90х, но блин, на Украине на два порядка эта проблема стоит острее. И каждый прозападный лидер Украины начинал с ними заигрывать. Напоминаю, что у них до сих пор жив и бодрствует сайт Миротворец! Это ли не показатель лицемерности. Ну и что за него получила Украина? Лёгкое атата?   Сенцов - убийца. Тут я даже не знаю, что сказать. Ну не верите и не верите. Ваше право. Желаю познакомься поближе с этим молодым человеком а ещё лучше пойти на ютубе его посмотреть. Посмотрим, сколько выдержите этот поток сознания.   Акт Магницкого не имеет никакого отношения к Крыму. Это персональные санкции за нарушение прав человека, и чего-то я не вижу чтобы кто-то эти санкции в отношении отдельно взятых упоротых граждан Украины применял. И кто тут опозорился? Что, тот же Геращенко за свой ублюдочный миротворец не достоин хотя-бы осуждения?  Насчёт критики Украины в западных СМИ. Моя выборка не абсолютная и цифр у меня нет, но более менее критичная инфа есть от немецкой прессы, из того, что я читал. Англоязычные масс медиа   радикально позитивны к Украине. Если в 14 году ещё более менее взвешенная подача с обоих сторон конфликта была от того же Островского, то сейчас это бравые украинские военные 8 лет воюющие с российскими войсками (sic!), когда последнее крупное сражение было в 2015. Вал пиздежа, перепечатка инфы с помоек типа инфонапалма. Ну серьёзно. Испанское радио или французские карикатуры даже близко не могут приблизится по влиянию к bbc world.

zfe8s	We don't care really. As someone said here already almost 200 nationalities live on the territory of Russia and the only things that limit marriages between them are religion and distance. At the same time, the sample size of black women in Russia is so small that there is almost nothing to talk about really.    There are a lot of "carnival kids" which are mostly kids of Russian mothers and black fathers who came to visit or study and then left (happened a lot in USSR days, still happens now). But I'm not sure that they count as black coz they are Russian.	1642057365.0	hsgjbh2	t3_s2pogr	t3_s2pogr	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2pogr/q_do_you_russian_men_find_blk_women_attractive/hsgjbh2/

ms6e8	What I've learned from my life is that you never respond "it's not for sale". Even if you need something you own, that simply makes the price higher.  Calculation should be made - how much Russia invested in region; how much it was planning to profit from it in, say, 20 years. Sakhalin is rich with oil and gas. So, maybe price can start with 50 trillion dollars? In gold or similar stuff, obviously.	1642058356.0	hsgkpng	t3_s2pwn1	t3_s2pwn1	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2pwn1/if_japan_offered_2_trillion_dollars_for_sakhalin/hsgkpng/

Guy: Why’s this monkey so expensive? Man: It can talk, go ask it yourself Guy: Hey, monkey, can you really talk? Monkey: Of course  The guy gets impressed and buys this monkey. After a week he realizes that this monkey can only say “Of course”. He decided to deceive someone else. He goes to the market and puts x3 price on it. Another guy comes to him: Guy 2: Why’s this monkey so expensive? Guy: It knows where the treasure chest is buried. Also it can speak, you can ask it yourself Guy 2: Hey, monkey, do you really know about buried treasure chest? Monkey: Of course So that guy bought a monkey and went to the forest. Guy 2: Hey, monkey, should we go there? Monkey: Of course So they went a bit farther. Guy 2: Hey, monkey, this is the spot? Monkey: Of course The guy starts digging. Guy 2: Hey, monkey, should I dig deeper? Monkey: Of course So he dug more. Guy 2: Hey, monkey, the treasure chest is here?

Тем же занимались и после школы, когда кто-то приносил мяч и мы ходили играть в другие дворы или же просто устраивали дружеские драки, чтобы узнать кто сильнее. А если были деньги (10руб), можно было целый час играть в компьютерных клубах. Ещё родители были достаточно молоды...

nlo2r	It doesn't matter to me at all. For most of the Russian people, it won't be a problem, but you as a black woman will definitely look exotic for them, as one doesn't see many black people in Russia.  So all the usual things connected with that will apply - you will get much more attention, not always pleasant. You will definitely also get more attention from fetishists and other kinds of strange people too, so be ready for that.   And yeah there are some Russians who are xenophobic to anyone who doesn't look like them. It's much less common in big cities and more common in smaller towns or villages. But generally, there is not enough tension regarding black people in society, so I don't think it would be a problem.	1642067970.0	hsgwuoh	t3_s2pogr	t3_s2pogr	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2pogr/q_do_you_russian_men_find_blk_women_attractive/hsgwuoh/

3bws32m3	Мультики Jetix и Nickelodeon. Джимми Нейтрон, ох уж эти детки, Элайза которая разговаривает с животными... Эти все по-моему гендерно-нейтральные. Для девочек был шикарный мульт Тотали спайс, ещё Witch чародейки, позже Winx был невероятно популярен, но многие его ненавидели. Мало кто оставался нетйрально настроенным.    Мобильные телефоны без сенсорных экранов, но с блютуз, очень маленькой памятью и парочкой джава игр. ЗМЕЙКА!!!   Первые сенсорные телефоны, когда сенсоры были ещё не ёмкостные, а реагировали на давление, и надо было буквально выдавливать экран, чтобы эта дура сработала (ещё были стилусы).   Предандроидные Nokia на базе ОС Symbian  Интернет без вездесущей цензуры, и ненависти к хохлам, или со стороны Хохлов. (Не в обиду Украинцам, хохол здесь чисто стилистический выбор, я вас в жизни так не называю)  А также терпимое, и даже местами приятное телевидение без ТАКОГО объёма ненависти. Легковесные юмористические сериалы на ТНТ и СТС, которые тогда только выходили и были новыми.   Эпидемия папликов с мамами ВК, и вообще зарождение и взрыв всех этих мемов, Troll face, Me Gusta, мемы про Чака Норриса...	1642068128.0	hsgx1im	t3_s2tsix	t3_s2tsix	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2tsix/пожалуйста_помогите_собрать_список_вещей_по/hsgx1im/
qyfly	Фишки, в том числе металлические (можно было найти в пачках Cheetos). Как правило, с покемонами, но были и другие какие-то. Переводные наклейки в жвачках, изображавшие татуировки. Держались недолго, но этого хватало, чтобы похвастаться перед пацанами во дворе. Слайдеры Nokia, в моём замкадье считавшиеся верхом престижа. У меня такого никогда не было, а так хотелось… Сухарики «Три корочки» и «Емеля» — тогда ещё с симпатичными упаковками, а не как сейчас. Жвачки Turbo и безымянные сладкие палочки в виде сигарет, умело игравшие на желании почувствовать себя настоящим взрослым. И, конечно, Биониклы! Я родился не в двухтысячных, но общероссийские тренды имеют привычку задерживаться в моём захолустье лет на пять дольше необходимого, поэтому всё перечисленное помню отлично.

fcqdhz9r	What I'll say is an unpopular opinion, but it seems pretty reasonable for me.   The whole Russia-Ukraine thing is about Putin's rating here, in Russia. The whole time of Putin's presidency (And Medvedev's too, he's just Putin's puppet) I hear same story from media - "US is an enemy, NATO is an enemy, everyone who says otherwise is an American spy". Many people believe this, as you can see above.   Putin is trying to switch people's focus from his poor inner policies to his poor outer policies, demonising EU and US in every way possible. Thanks to most Russians being racist and homophobic (not without media's help), he is successful at that. He succeeded in 2013-2014, annexing Crimea, so people were crying "Крым наш" in extase. Now he's trying to intimidate US and EU leaders showing off military power, and scare his own people with war, so nothing will be in the way of reelecting him in 2024.   Will he actually attack? No, that's suicide for him. Maybe little provocations to keep situation hot, and whole world hating us, so media could keep saying "look, everyone is against us, only Putin can save us".      Also, amount of fake news here is overwhelming. Sometimes it's obviously fake, but many still believe in this BS.	1642071725.0	hsh1jf5	t3_s1sfm9	t3_s1sfm9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/hsh1jf5/

It screams I need the (insert race) stamp of approval, I never see white people coming and asking does (insert race) like white people, like just stop it already. Some people are not gonna like you and some will.   Just like any other races of people and to be frank if it appears so rare that you gotta ask put two and two together and go from there.   Most of the answers you get won't even be genuine there are a few types of people who answer these questions.  1. Glad to discuss how they hate race mixing etc. 2. Never seen a black person views it as some other world experience to potentially bang a black chick. 3. Never seen a black person you are like a strange animal to them. 4. Would never but won't say for fear of down votes. 5. Doesn't even know for themselves unless they are in the moment. 6. Thinks black girls are some tv character etc.  In the end you make it weird by assigning race to it men date attractive women who fit their individual taste.  After covid book a trip to Russia and interact with the populace and draw your assumptions from that.

dyyr1qnv	I know quite some black man during the Soviet Union who married Russian woman and left the country with them after its collapse. In the Soviet Union there were times of influxes of people from Communist countries in Africa who came to work or study in the USSR. I also heard from some Russian woman that they like tall black men.   For your question tho, I personally didn't see many black woman which I found really attractive, but there are some really attractive ones which I also have seen for sure. In general what goes for woman of any kind of ethnicity is also attractive in a black woman: good figure, good looking hair, good looking face. Personally I don't like the kind of short and curly hair black woman often have but this might just be my own preference ,some other people may  disagree.   I don't have any reservations about black woman about their personality. And after all what matters the most is the personality, isn't it?	1642073394.0	hsh3qmg	t3_s2pogr	t3_s2pogr	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2pogr/q_do_you_russian_men_find_blk_women_attractive/hsh3qmg/

a5ndygns	It's true that autoritarism isn't well seen in western countries. I read that Russia is like 130th on the corruption index. For comparison, Canada is 10th and I still can't trust government, can't even imagine how you feel in this level. Having power for too long is not going to help.  What I notice in democracies, in Canada more precisely, is the fact that they seem to always turn around. Parties change, removing what the predecessor did in an infinite loop that go nowhere. The good point is that we can vote then out, but usually to put other incompetents at the head...  You could definitely be self sustained with all your resources, but I think you still need more residents. Your country is huge, like mine. Population are getting older, young people don't have time and resources to make a lot of children. We have a huge problem with that here.   I thought your president had a vision of self development for Russia, but I also think that this takes lot of time to achieve when you've been relying on other like we are. Mondialisation killed our self sustainability. In Canada, we lost a lot of manufacturing plants and with manpower shortage, this won't going better.   Well, hope my answer isn't too messy, English isn't my main language. 😅	1642074988.0	hsh605c	t3_s1sfm9	t1_hsgqha2	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/hsh605c/

Or do you plan to race bait your own children?   Your whole entailed behaviour is the very reason some people have issues when dealing with black people. You come on a public forum and asked a race baiting question and then you pop off when you don't get the answers you want to hear.   It's always okay for black people to say and do whatever they want right? Can't be racist right?

Though in some cases that attention was more so derived from  me being exotic to them, I had a very active dating life there and there were a lot of really good experiences.   That said, in smaller areas ( places that weren't bigger cities like Moscow and St. Petes) it was very different.

1d2xslo	I'm not Russian, but this kind of mentality is present in my country as well and I imagine it's even more pronounced the further east you go. I would just like to add that this is partly also about his image in front of other people. A man who doesn't pay for his girlfriend, open the door for her, carry her stuff etc. may look bad in front of a lot of the other people. I'll let anyone make their own conclusion about this, but I guess that my point is that not all men necessarily feel like they want to or should have to do all this stuff, but they do feel like they kind of have to do it to maintain their face in front of others. So, OP, if you really want to be nice to your boyfriend, just let him do all this stuff and if you want to have a conversation about it, save it for when you're at home, not in front of other people.	1642079948.0	hshea2v	t3_s28erw	t1_hscungq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hshea2v/

Useless to say that our vaccinal efforts didn't paid well... Feels like their drastic measures are useless and extremely hard for economy.

6n2veewj	Russian girls dreamed about foreigners in 1990-s  - first half of 2000-s. Since that time life became better, people, especially in large cities, became richer, so now most of russian girls when they realy decide to make a family - looking for man, who earn enough to provide normal life conditions for her and future children. Of course, this is not the absolute rule, a lot of pairs fall in love at school, university and then together make their lives, careers and heartfire. So, there is no necessity of being foreigner. You just must be hopeful man,  able to feed a family, and not an asshole. That is all.  About beauty standarts - we have HUNDREDS ethnic groups in Russia, nation is VERY mixed and you can find absolutely any type of appearance to your liking.	1642084049.0	hshmtvr	t3_s2zo4v	t1_hshksvo	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2zo4v/russian_girls/hshmtvr/

I've belonged to several ethnic and nationalistic communities due to my diverse background, and I've been either demonized or glorified depending on the things I'd said or done.   I seriously condemn people that orbit Russian communities, and take it as a duty upon themselves to be senile falcons, that look for any opening or vulnerability to swoop in and start trouble or cause endless quarrels.   Every community contains enough diversity (both in thought and background) to entertain itself without excess clownery. Also you need to acknowledge that the dominant ideology is what drives the masses, if you feel like you're being left out, then you're probably walking against the current.	1642085213.0	hshphrp	t3_s2gf6b	t3_s2gf6b	/r/AskARussian/comments/s2gf6b/why_does_r_russia_seems_to_have_this_0_tolerance/hshphrp/

hwp3hyyb	I am a Russian woman of age 44, so even Sovjet times, I was always prepared to myself. Especially on the first date. Cause it gives you certain freedom, not to feel obliged, if the date failed and you didn't like a man. I think most of men at least expect the suggestion to split the bill from a woman, cause it is sort of a sign she is not taking him for a wallet and taking him for granted. But you say you've been dating for several months, and he probably made it clear a long time ago that he doesn't want you to pay when you are with him. Actually, that is a sign he is taking you seriously, that you are his woman and he wants to supply for you, for you as his couple. But I always made clear to my partners that paying for me, doesn't mean buying me, that I will always work and have my own income to put my share in our budget as a couple. You know your boyfriend better. Try to explain that giving is also important for relations as accepting gifts. That it is important for you to share with him. If you become a family, in healty modern relationship there will be a common budget. Women,saying that his salary is our salary and my salary is only mine, are considered golddiggers even in Russia with all our knight traditions.	1642088518.0	hshxnhl	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hshxnhl/

My country ALREADY covered more than 10% of it's gas needs with “cheeper gas from the US” in order to “brake it's dependence on Gasprom”, but in reality this just ended up being six times more expensive and completely inefficient because as it turns out several ships traversing more than 1/4 of the world globe make a steady and constant supply flow to cover the needs of one whole country.  It was so inefficient in fact that that at end we just gave up and sided “alternative gas contract” with Azerbaijan.	1642088556.0	hshxr24	t3_rzlhld	t1_hsdrhla	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hshxr24/

There are professional voice actors who voice individual top actors. For example, Sergei Burunov is now the official voice of Leonardo DiCaprio, while he himself has become a famous actor in Russian cinema.  Also, not all popular streaming services make their own Russian voice acting or are legally available in Russia. For example, no Disney and The Mandalorian you can only watch as a pirate.	1642187385.0	hsnybq4	t3_s3s7qt	t1_hsmn195	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3s7qt/why_are_unofficial_voiceover_dubbing_озвучка/hsnybq4/

8i0zr2ug	This has been known for quite some time. History develops in a spiral and some historical periods "rhyme" with similar historical periods in past historical cycles.  In this context - Russia is - Ancient Rome, Europe - Ancient Greece, USA - Carthage.  Over time, Europe will become the so-called "cultural province" of Rome.  In ancient Rome, this is the name of Greece conquered by Rome.  There are too many analogies to deny them. For example, Ancient Greece, taking advantage of technology, colonized almost the entire known world of those times. But then, weakening, she easily fell into the arms of Rome.  Ancient Rome used all the technological and cultural developments of the ancient Greeks and was very similar to Greece (architecture, philosophy, literature, etc.), but was never part of Greece, and even used Greek educated slaves as teachers for young patricians, just like Russian nobles used French and German mentors for their children. And this is only part of a much larger number of analogies. For example, the Greeks in Rome were considered perverts, just like Europeans are now seen in Russia. And so on and so forth.  Carthage, of course, will disappear. Any trading republic, such as Carthage or the USA, is short-lived. At best, it will be modified to a complete change.	1642188101.0	hso06pp	t3_s3vw00	t3_s3vw00	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3vw00/russia_vs_usa_rivalry_parallels_with_sparta_vs/hso06pp/

8sxjw6kt	The US would struggle in a conventional war with Russia. American military experience has been limited to exporting conflict abroad. Americans haven’t had a taste of war on their soil since their White House got burnt down. If we are to talk conventional war, not even total war. I would love to see the pink hair they/ them brigade take up arms.   That being said. Both sides, even without a nuclear arsenal taken into account, have enough fire power for this conflict to decimate their populations. So this theoretical armchair generalism is pointless, since it’s very very very very very unlikely that outright war will happen.	1642188872.0	hso26nq	t3_s3xrm1	t1_hsnwra4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3xrm1/how_does_russian_people_feel_about_the/hso26nq/

d46odrqz	>I think Maths might help reassure you about the demographic situation. Let's say the aforementioned biracial couple had a child. This mixed race child would need to have children with either dark skinned or mixed race people otherwise, their children will be even lighter. Within three generations it would be near impossible to not recognise the person as European.  Firstly, there is more to race than just skin tone. Skin darkness or lightness isn’t the only feature that makes Africans, Europeans and Asians look different to one another. A mixed race child can have a fair skin tone, but his nose, lips, facial bone structure, hair texture, calf shape, etc. could still look clearly African. Google light-skinned biracial people. You can still clearly tell that they are mixed despite being light, because of their other features.  Secondly, You are not accounting for perpetual mass immigration. Sure, today no-whites in Europe might number less than 40 million in total, but by the end of the century it could be HUNDREDS of MILLIONS.  It is true that if a half black half white person has a child with a fully white person, that their child will be only 25% African and will look have various European features… but you are NOT accounting for the fact that ethnic Europeans are only 10% of the global population currently. 9 in 10 people on the planet are not European and do not look European. By the end of the century, by the year 2100, fully European people could be as little as 3-5% of the global population. 5% CANNOT mix into the other 95% and still retain their appearance. What will happen is that in the distant future, mixed race people will increasingly marry into pure non-white/non-European people and their children will have increasingly smaller European ancestry. That European ancestry will keep shrinking until it vanishes and no future people look remotely European. Some light hair or eyes might linger for a while but eventually they will also disappaer.  That’s why no Europeans today look like Africans. Because over thousands of years those African appearances got buried too far away. However, the extinction of white European looking people and our appearance will happen much faster.  >Furthermore, even if they decided to only have children with dark or mixed race people, the sheer quantity of Europeans here and trickle of immigration will not make a significant dent.  Again, you are not accounting for perpetual immigration. Look at the attitude of people on r/europe. There are thousands of morons who SUPPORT open borders or some other form of continuous non-white immigration. They are opposed to closing Europe completely to non-white immigration. So the number of Africans and Asians in Europe will continue to rise and the number of Europeans will keep decreasing because of low birthrates and race mixing.	1642191495.0	hso913u	t3_rx99qx	t1_hrh1fby	/r/AskARussian/comments/rx99qx/which_websites_are_banned_in_russia/hso913u/

NATO should fulfill Russian demands or face consequences. Russia is not going to invade Ukraine.  So basically propaganda is trying to justify _something_, but it's not clear what it's going to be.

2cpox0re	Once in Turkey in an all inclusive restaurant, in the year of 2011 or 2012 i was hearing people on the neighbouring table speaking a language that sounded like Russian - same intonations and sounds, though i wasn't hearing the exact words. It has to be mentioned that 80% of the guests were Russians, so i just subconsciously assumed they were Russians, so i asked for salt because there wasn't any salt in our table. The guy that i addressed to just went silent, and didn't event turn his head. I repeated my question a little louder so that he and his friends heard me for sure, but again the guys were looking at him, and he wasn't responding. I was confused and mumbled some excuses in English when a girl that was sitting there just passed me the salt. I thanked her and used the salt, listening closely to which language they were talking and they continued to speak Ukrainian.  So i think that's the story you wanted to hear	1642192251.0	hsob075	t3_s402cm	t3_s402cm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsob075/
kevpn	The US not having conventional war domestically is pretty deliberate though. It’s why the US is heavily invested in its navy, reconnaissance, border, etc. Asymmetric or terror is more likely than a full scale ground war. Feel like if a ground war took place it would take place in a proxy nation in Europe.  The pink hair point is kind of dumb - plenty of Americans aren’t that and if you’re arguing “well what if it landed in a random city or something”, on average they’re incredibly well armed.	1642192351.0	hsob98i	t3_s3xrm1	t1_hso26nq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3xrm1/how_does_russian_people_feel_about_the/hsob98i/

Russians have two choices; 1) Keep Putins dictatorship and his wanting to make Russia more like the old soviet, hence moving even more away from democracy, unilateral relationships and an even larger poor population. 2) Asassinate Putin and move towards becoming a more prosper and democratic(not democratic now) country. For the greater benefit of all mankind, including russians.  I have intelligence that suggests that the latter option is the only realistic one.

Just return Russia to a status of Wall Street playground where they will earn their private jets and villas keeping the interest rates sky high, and the local minion "investors" will earn their used Lamborghinis by working for the latter.  To be clear: foreign investment are welcome under the first-world rate, no more. Otherwise it's the same vicious circle of poverty and "grow to pay" shit.

kxccq44	Both Russians and Ukrainians are heirs of Ancient Rus.   The continuity of the Russians, in my opinion, is straighter. I am considering culture. Pre-Mongol ancient Rus is part of historical memory, part of Russian mythology.   There are epics. Several cycles of epics are known. The epics of the "Kiev cycle" are so called because ancient Kiev appears there. They were found in the north of Russia.   As far as I know, the core of the cultural mythology of Ukrainians is more recent: Polish oppression and the Cossacks.   And when you think about Russia and Ukraine.

apfhssjw	No...  In actuality, America resembles both Athens AND Sparta.  1) America imposes financial/natural resource tributes from its allies in return for military aid and defense. Just like Sparta. America also forces its allies to pay the cost of its military conquest by the dollar standard.  2) America prints it's own money and funds mercenaries like ISIS. Equivalent to Athens constantly minting new silver coins because they had access to mineral mines, allowing them to fund mercenaries, build ships, and pay the population.   3) America is an empire. It puts puppet oligarchs in countries they conquer militarily and/or financially. Think of Pinochet from Chile, dictatorships in Honduras, as well as other Latin American countries. This is similar to Sparta AND Athens. Athens regularly put their neighboring allies into debt because they controlled the currency.	1642196163.0	hsol606	t3_s3vw00	t3_s3vw00	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3vw00/russia_vs_usa_rivalry_parallels_with_sparta_vs/hsol606/

Like Carthage vs Rome, Britain vs Germany, Britain vs Russia etc.  The thing is usually Sea Power can't really beat Land Power in a real war one on one, but they have a lot of tricks in their disposal to mess with a Land Power in other ways. To do the "containment" strategy. Because if they just leave a Land Power alone, the Land Power would naturally dominate. Because they sit around the lands that actually matter. Unlike a Sea Power sitting on distant lands behind the seas that matter less.

nyr4w	Лучше исправить — чтобы во всех документах было одинаково и не возникло проблем в самый неожиданный момент.  Федеральный закон №53 «О государственном языке РФ» от 2005 года гласит, что во всех официальных документах использование буквы «ё» в именах собственных обязательно, поэтому если в паспорте будет «ё», то можно смело требовать во всех остальных местах, чтобы её тоже проставляли. А если в паспорте её нет... интересно, вообще, какой документ в таком случае можно считать первичным. Свидетельство о рождении? Как, короче, доказать, что это именно ошибка в паспорте, и не проходить через всю официальную процедуру смены имени/фамилии?	1642196425.0	hsolu63	t3_s404h3	t1_hso8pga	/r/AskARussian/comments/s404h3/ё_или_е/hsolu63/

7pascwg1	Erenburg's poem is relatively unknown, but his [article](http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/PAPERS/HISTORY/ERENBURG/KILLHIM.HTM) is incredibly influential. It contains the following words:  Убей немца! - это просит старуха-мать. Убей немца! - это молит тебя дитя. Убей немца! - это кричит родная земля. Не промахнись. Не пропусти. Убей!  There's also a slightly earlier Simonov's [poem](https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:%D0%A3%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE.jpg#mw-jump-to-license), which contains:  >Так убей же немца, чтоб он,  >А не ты, на земле лежал.  This poem has been edited post-war because Simonov didn't want to advocate killing anyone, so he changed the title and replaced all mentions of Germans with fascists.	1642197387.0	hsooa5v	t3_s3z7oy	t1_hso3qvs	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hsooa5v/

1wjouls5	Hello. As far as I can say, Putin would love to invade Ukraine, annex eastern Ukraine and making puppet state from the rest. Europe will buy gas anyway and sanctions will just devolve ruble (Putin's friends will have records of profits from oil selling)  Only if USA and Europe in the face of Germany will add sanctions against Putin's friends he will not invade Ukraine.  That is a very great piece of cake that he wants badly.   About placing Russian troops on Venezuela and Cuba: that is really funny: USA don't want Russia to have military in America, but gladly will send US troops to Finland and Ukraine and to baltic states.   As far I can see that is realistic scenario and noone will really help Ukraine.	1642197885.0	hsopjjs	t3_s3ouc4	t3_s3ouc4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hsopjjs/

zgyfq	Пара бтг для вторжения и оккупации? Серьёзно? У нас что, интенсивные полёты российских бпла вдоль границ, усиление огневого контакта вдоль линии соприкосновения, для вскрытия огневых точек противника, выход флота на боевое патрулирование вдоль берегов Украины, выдвижение на передовые рубежи, создание оперативных складов ГСМ и боеприпасов вдоль границы, постоянные совещания по линии Беларусь-Москва, усиление действий разведки и контр-разведки в приграничных территориях? Я могу целый день перечислять. Тем более, что никто не будет вторгаться на Украину без первого выстрела с их стороны. Вы вообще представляете себе, что значить подготовить для удара заявленную 100 000 группировку из ВСЕХ родов войск для единого удара? Это не учитывая того, что по самым оптимистичным оценкам, для выдвижения до условной линии Днепра с последующим удержанием территории в позитивном сценарии требуется 350 (!) тысяч человек, и это не мои расчёты, а наших западных коллег (последний раз видел эту цифру на warontherocks года 2 назад, если мне не изменяет память).  Мобилизация отдельных БТГ связана с тем, чтобы отбить желание Украинской стороны устроить "маленькую победоносную войну". Никто не воспринимает Украину не всерьёз. Это было заметно хотя-бы по Иловайску и Дебальцево. Поэтому в предполагаемом вам сценарии вторжения фигурируют либо генералы-идиоты с российской стороны верующие в лёгкую победу малой кровью. Либо генералы-идоты с украинской (ну, и натовской), потому что они до сих пор не объявили частичную мобилизацию, не перебрасывают всю имеющуюся технику и персонал к предполагаемому театру военных действий, не ныкают остатки флота в натовских портах, не проводят учения ГОиЧС в приграничных с Россией областях, и вообще, ведут себя так, как будто добробаты - это неуязвимые сверхлюди на боевых мехах из 23 столетия.

cmh58y3l	Yes, a couple of years ago while travelling through Ukraine I ran into this a lot. Some people were really offended when I spoke Russian/didn't understand Ukrainian, but in most cases when I said "oh sorry, I don't know Ukrainian, I am from Estonia actually" they immediately changed the tone and we had very friendly conversations, but only after they realized this wasn't some political stance and I am just a foreigner.   There was one woman though who really despised me speaking only Russian - I was carpooling and all the passengers were chatting, but this one woman just refused to speak Russian and actively shut me out of the conversation and always changed it to Ukrainian and the driver clearly felt bad and tried to include me in the topic and spoke Russian to me. She was super hostile to me. This is so weird to me, because 10 years ago Ukrainians didn't do that, we were all русские, no matter which post soviet country you were from.   In Lviv there were some younger people who genuinely didn't understand Russian and we had to communicate in English.	1642199852.0	hsouefn	t3_s402cm	t3_s402cm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsouefn/

e5ht6zo2	Yes, China is a potential challenge. We shall see in time how things develop, although there is more than China in the picture. India, with huge energy needs etc and good relationship with Russia for example, in that timeframe also possible emerging countries in the south as well (unless Anglos fuck them up again that is). I think the world will very soon be multipolar.( Not unipolar like it is now or dipolar like it was in the cold war.)  I do not think China will pose a significant military threat however. They are certainly more formidable than Europe, but Russia has and will have even more deterrents at it's disposal. A conventional war, no matter who wins, would be extremely costly and destructive, possibly allowing the west to become dominant again,  which neither China or Russia want.  As for importers of Russian oil and gas, I don't know. If Russia does infact become isolated and fully self sufficient, I think exports of resources will become less and less important.   Also sanctions in 2021 do not mean no deal with the west can ever be made again.	1642200859.0	hsowunh	t3_s3ouc4	t1_hsourt4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hsowunh/
fdsfqvw	Dude we are currently fighting battles in like 7-8 countries at any given point, and that's just what's being REPORTED, nevermind the African shadow wars we participate in, or any sort of other conflicts we fight in the name of "terrorism". Most of the current enemies we fight - ISIS, the Taliban, etc. Were literally created and funded BY US. And still year after year the only bipartisan issue our politicians come together to tackle is continuing to boost a military budget to wage war on some terrorist group we propped up 30 years ago to fight communism - because it makes everyone at the table rich.

I once met a Ukrainian girl and asked her if she could help me with my Russian. She responded by saying that she could indeed help me with Russian, but she was not down for it because her country was being attacked by Russia and she had made the decision to not speak the language anymore.

3du8jurt	You should also consider the fact that Ukraine has always been "divided" into at least two factions: east and west. The more you come closer to Russian border the more pro-russian the people live there. And the contrary situation if you move to Poland side for example. Secondly, life in Ukraine is still worse than life in Russia. Crimea was taken by Russia when Ukraine was in very bad shape (you know, coup d'état), but if you consider how much money was put into peninsula (and a lot of *good friends* got pieces of this pie) the quality of life there increased significantly. Donbass region wasn't so lucky. Who knows why it wasn't taken by Russia, I think Crimea scenario would work as good as at peninsula.   >but why is there so much anti-Russia propaganda? do you have any idea?

26um0b7u	It remains only to find out where 27 million corpses of Soviet citizens came from.   Yes, very touching, only this story is worthless because for the most part, the Germans behaved like real rabid animals. The Germans turned people into fertilizer. The Germans made thermal insulation layers for submarines from the hair of captured women. The Germans shot mothers together with their children, and then buried them in pits. The Germans liked to be photographed for memory next to the corpses of Soviet citizens. Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya had her breasts cut off (also for memory).  *"... Ulyana Gromova was hung by her hair, a five-pointed star was cut out on her back, her chest was cut off, her body was cauterized with a hot iron and salt was sprinkled on the wounds, put on a hot stove. The torture continued for a long time and mercilessly, but she was silent..."*  *"Lida Androsova, 18 years old, was extracted without an eye, an ear, an arm, with a rope around her neck, which strongly cut into the body. Baked blood is visible on the neck"*  *"Nikolai Zhukov was taken out of the mine without a tongue, without a foot and without fingertips."*  *"Maya Peglivanova was arrested. Like all her comrades, the girl was subjected to the cruelest tortures, but she did not answer the executioners a word, remained faithful to her oath to the end...*   *The interpreter Reyband told his mother that during the interrogation Maya confessed that she was a partisan, and proudly threw words of curse and contempt in the face of the executioners. Maya was tortured. His chest was cut off, his legs were broken...*   *Maya's corpse is disfigured: her breasts are cut off, her legs are broken. All outerwear is removed."*  *"A. E. Dubrovina was executed among other Young Guards. The executioners shot her in the leg and inflicted several stab wounds, after which they beat her to death with butts. The girl's disfigured body was dumped into the pit of mine No. 5."*  &#x200B;  I can go on indefinitely.	1642206946.0	hspaz16	t3_s3z7oy	t1_hsokpg9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hspaz16/

Ukraine is a separate country, we have our own language, and we have too many reasons to hate Russia which often tries to use "repressions agains Russian-speaking citizens". People understand Russian language and usually can speak it, but expecting that they switch from Ukrainian for you is major mistake. Thinking that problem is with nationalists is also mistake, there are genuine reasons to hate almost everything connected from Russia. If you won't respect this you won't get positive attention. If you know that a person speaks 3 languages (Russian, Ukrainian, English) and considers themselves Ukrainian, speaking Russian isn't good idea, English is better if Ukrainian not possible.  It also would be great idea to learn what's happening here in Ukraine and why most of population really don't like current Russia, starting from Soviet occupation and Holodomor.	1642207561.0	hspccdt	t3_s402cm	t3_s402cm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hspccdt/

540c586m	Russia has already attacked Ukraine. On New Year's Eve. No? Not attacked? Lied? Is it reasonable to believe now who lied yesterday? "it's not difficult to deceive me, I'm glad to be deceived myself!"?     And now the main thing. It is important for all of you to understand that the "red line" in Ukraine for Russia is not in Putin's head. Or the group of oligarchs that surround him. The "red line" on the events in Ukraine takes place in the internal political situation in the country. Between the position of the people of the country. And the position of the ruling class, which the people STILL consider to have the right to power.   As it is not difficult to guess in such a situation, "targeted" sanctions against the ruling class do not work, because the ruling class is a hostage of the internal political situation in Russia.   Sanctions against the country that lead to a decrease in the standard of living of the population do not work because the population understands perfectly well who is to blame for what is happening.   And the internal political "red line" is coming even closer to the ruling class. Forcing him to act more and more harshly in foreign policy.     Second. It's simply none of your business. Where and how troops are located on our territory is a sovereign matter of the state.   The third. During YOUR. Unprovoked aggression in Iraq. Ended AFTER the FACT with the destruction of the country, the economy of the people and culture. And many thousands of victims among the civilian population. The forces of the so-called "good and democracy" amounted to more than two million people. To a country with a population ten million less than lives in Ukraine. Don't you think that a hundred thousand is at least twenty times less than two million? And someone is lying about the motives of the Russian Federation, wishful thinking.	1642207960.0	hspd8mv	t3_s43pb2	t3_s43pb2	/r/AskARussian/comments/s43pb2/why_mass_forces_along_ukraine/hspd8mv/

I don't think they are as hospitable as Russian people, some seem a bit ignorant especially if it comes to topics about Russia, politics and culture. Some Germans can also be really stubborn. But in general they are not bad people.   Many old people (not that old to serve in WW2) but people after that remember East Germany and how they had good connections to East Germany and East German people. Some Germans also remember the times of East Germany and have nostalgia where there was peace and friendship between Russian people. The least East Germans to those I talked to view those times as bad times.	1642208318.0	hspe0yp	t3_s3z7oy	t3_s3z7oy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hspe0yp/

3lekku9h	initially there were three brothers, Lyakh, Czech and Rus, they quarreled, and they scattered in different directions. since then, we don't like each other.  at the beginning of our state administration, there was a habit of hiring princes and their warriors. (Alexander Nevsky, Prince of Novgorod, he was hired and fired several times, lol).  actually Rurik from this series. apparently, the people were satisfied, he was successful, and he fussed, called himself a Slav (more precisely, his son and grandson), they turned out to be even more successful, took Kiev, and was like that.  many cities (the situation somewhat resembled ancient Greece and early France with its dukes at the same time) were on the territory of present-day Ukraine and present-day Russia, and all this is ancient Russia.  since Poland was strong then, and the Mongols suddenly attacked us, Poland, don't be a fool, took the western cities for herself.  time passes, the territories of Ukraine are back with us, and there is already something in between Poles and Russians, Ruset is starting again, but the language lives for a long time (then we had 10 children born in families, because it is difficult to live only in two, and there is a lot of space).  residents of those regions called themselves Ukrainians (solely because of their place of residence (translated as from the edge of the country), such as Bretons, or Champagnes, or like I am a Ural)  and in the 20th century, during the First World War, with the German offensive during our revolutions (yes, we had a fun year then), the country began to fall apart a little. and actually the Germans allocated territories, and called it a new country.  after that, already under the USSR, they were given a republic in order to have more votes in the UN, and in general, the development of republics within it took place under the USSR. at the same time, Ukraine added territories (and Crimea) to make it look more solid (Russia has so many territories, they counted then, and still one country).  after the collapse of the country, Ukraine began its own path for the first time (while it is rolling in the ass, but by itself).  something like that. we consider ourselves Russians, from that ancient Russia, and Rurik was with us, a successful prince. Are we Vikings? no.	1642209128.0	hspfsro	t3_s3q5i3	t1_hsmdktv	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3q5i3/are_russians_or_ukrainians_heirs_of_the_rus_do/hspfsro/

Let's be honest, the brutality that the USSR faced during World War II was unprecedented. The Germans' hands are up to their elbows in the blood of Soviet people and they will never wash off from this. If Germany itself had faced such a thing, it would not have forgiven anything and would have remembered it for hundreds of years. I am one of those people who have not forgotten anything and have not forgiven the Germans, I don't care about all that sugary shit about peace, love and so on. I don't give a fuck about German football, Ramstein, fucking beer, cars and other shit. All this is not worth 27 million corpses. Precisely because we are able to forget and forgive such things, Europe and America do not respect us, do not consider our opinion and treat us like shit.	1642209446.0	hspghp4	t3_s3z7oy	t3_s3z7oy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hspghp4/

Protesting in Russia is a good way to go missing.  It’s this simple, annexing a portion of a country is a hostile act and people have a right to be concerned. No country has a right to annex a portion of another country.

Both countries was heavily industrialized even before they become US allies.  > merica is a country of free trade  They were. Free trade is good when you're on top of the trade chain. When you're not - sanctions, tariffs, taxes. China now is country of free trade.  > China on the other hand will ban any business that doesn't hand over 50% of its stuff to some Chinese guy  America will not? Most of word's companies listed on NYSE or have office in USA. They're not too different, US just had possibility to not force it. Free trade benefit for those who're on top of the food chain, independent but developing countries should impose tariffs on different sectors to have a chance to catch up. Cuckold countries who submit themselves to US (or China) will open their markets for "free trade" and gave up their business to international (read US or China) capital.	1642214510.0	hsprjcl	t3_s3ouc4	t1_hsnx0xz	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hsprjcl/

Notice that many of them appear in Biden friendly outlets like the New York Times or CNN rather that right leaning news outlets like Fox News.    Did you hear the story about Russia supposedly planning a false flag operation? It’s a CNN story and is based on what they call a “US official”. It looks like a strategic leak to me as do many of these stories.     They’re trying to scare the public but also trying to intimidate Russian officials make them think they’re being watched. For example New York Times story recently disclosed that our spy planes are watching Russian troops. Some of these leaks are likely intended to send a message.	1642219835.0	hsq2hqp	t3_s3ouc4	t1_hsmjuod	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hsq2hqp/

hwp3hyyb	Being half German origin born and living in USSR/Russia, I felt some weird attitude twice in my life, when I was a girl after history lessons at school, I felt not well with my German surname, but there was no abuse or bullying me in sovjet school of 1980s. Second time is nowadays being an English teacher at school, after discussing WWII with kids, I was asked whose side my family supported. I answered humanity side. But mainly Russians are very forgiving people, which often considered as a weakness, but it is Orthodox christianity that deep in mentality.  Been to Germany many times, cause my grandparents moved to Bayern 1995 from Kazakhstan. My grandma told that she faced some issues from locals not happy about immigrants even if they are Folksdeutsche. I wonder what they say now about all that millions of immigrants that are culturally different. Younger generation looks more global and internationally thinking now.   That is why when I am asked why didn't I move to Germany, I answer I don't want to be a second sort human. Germans do despise other nations, they just hide it very well. The feeling of superiority and exceptionalism is actually typical to anglo-saxon culture, that led to nazism and is really seen in politics of EU and US now. Who are you to lecture us? That is why Russia lost its temper and started putting red lines.	1642225199.0	hsqcgzg	t3_s3z7oy	t3_s3z7oy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hsqcgzg/

1sb1fdto	There was three major ways to have a taxi before Uber and Yandex apps. 1. You call a taxi service via the phone, speak where you are and destination, hear a price and estimated awaiting time and confirm your order. Then go to car, pay in cash, ride and give a recipe if you do need it. 2. You can catch a car (taxi or private driver) on the parking near any airport, railroad station, etc. Here you don't need to wait, but you must have a good negotiations skill to have a fair price. There was (and still exist) a lot of cheaters. 3. Raised hand (no thumb like hitchhiker, just hand ) on the sidewalk was a sign you need a ride. Random car from the traffic stops next to you, you speak the destination, driver speak a price, if you have a deal - you go in the car, if not - he drives away, you try to stop a next one. 1st and partly 2nd was a chance to have an official taxi, with legal permission and maybe even yellow (or white or red - depends on brand) with taxi signs. 2nd and 3rd is for illegal unemployed drivers on the regular cars. Usually this kind of driver called Бомбила (Bombila, like a Bomb) and ride around the city trying to find a passenger is Бомбить (Bombit' , to bomb).  I don't know why, but lot of people call the driver like "Начальник", "Командир" or "Шеф" (boss, commander, chief).  So, the typical dialog ten years ago might be like this : Ivan rise his hand and a old rust Lada stops immediately:  - Where we go? - driver asked  - Nevsky 72  - 300 rubles   - Let's go, chief	1642225556.0	hsqd3kf	t3_s4bjkj	t3_s4bjkj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4bjkj/before_ubers_how_common_were_taxis_in_st/hsqd3kf/

ms6e8	> Is it to gain domestic popularity for the government?  We heard and continue to hear about it only from the western media. They say satellite photos are proof, but I'm no expert, I can't say if it is scheduled or not, if it is happening in other sites or not. The fact that places in hundreds km away from Ukraine are considered makes whole thing suspicious.  If Putin indeed amasses troops, why? Well, first thing that comes to mind is that there was a rumor of possible attack on separatist region from Ukraine in last May to give an excuse to stop NS2. Back then Russia indeed conducted military exercises in southwestern regions which tempered the ardor of Ukraine. It might be similar case now.  Another thing is recent threat of deploying troops in Venezuela and Cuba. Maybe this clash around Ukraine is simply serving a justification to take the game to other side. "If you say Ukraine is free to join NATO, why Latin and South American states can't decide for themselves too?"  Western media keeps underestimating Putin even after all these 20 years. His judo background converted into geopolitical skill quite well, and KGB experience taught him to keep his plans secret from everyone.	1642231098.0	hsqlowe	t3_s43pb2	t3_s43pb2	/r/AskARussian/comments/s43pb2/why_mass_forces_along_ukraine/hsqlowe/

h4i7fzp2	I hear you, and fully agree that no country has a right to annex a portion of another country! However you ignored the key part: "vox populi" - be brave enough to ask people of Crimea on their opinion and accept the fact that people of Crimea want to be with Russian Federation. Of course, if you are really interested in understanding the real situation rather than in spreading propaganda.   Note that there has been plenty of protests in Russian Federation since 2014 in Moscow, Khabarovsk, St. Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and ... NONE in Crimea.   If you are so concerned with the Crimea self-determination, spend some time to learn the history of Crimea. That would help to understand the roots of crimean desire to be with Russia and to eliminate irrelevant terms like "annexation".   The fact of life is that it was "vox populi" and self-determination of Crimean people.	1642231390.0	hsqm4k5	t3_s3ouc4	t1_hspqho9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hsqm4k5/

And unless there is some international agreement that limits troop positioning, they are free to do as they want. In case someone forgot, there is a civil war in Ukraine. While a ceasefire is in effect,  it is constantly broken (some redditors have nerve to brag about it).    Most of Ukrainian army is massed within few hundred miles from Russian border, btw.

Or for European countries to be afraid of Russia and buy weapons. Russia is not going to invade Ukraine. Ukraine is preparing a military invasion of the Donbas. Its invasion can launch a large-scale war, it will not seem enough to Europe. Now all countries have a lot of problems: a pandemic, high inflation and others. The economy of all countries is under attack. Do they believe in Europe and the USA that Russia is crazy? The troops on the borders of Russia are standing to protect our country. Do you want no one at the borders? I am 100% sure that then Ukraine will attempt a military takeover of Crimea! And it is impossible to leave borders without protection!

Despite all of the hardships, it seemed to me that Ivan Denisovich had a good day. This realization changed my perspective on life.  The number of choices that Ivan made in the course of his day were astounding. Even in a labor camp, he was able in small ways to influence his surroundings, his world. It made me realize that even at their worst, things aren't so bad, and one can get used to hardship.  Did anyone else feel this way, or am I the only one?

And they said yeah. But IRL a couple of times I'd order something in tentative Russian and get only Ukrainian back which I didn't understand - and if I replied in Russian again, only Ukrainian back. However half of the time people switched to Russian no problem.	1642236728.0	hsqtemk	t3_s402cm	t3_s402cm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsqtemk/

The US is working against Russian interests around the globe - say, just recently two Su-35 sales, to Indonesia and to Egypt, fell through because of American diplomatic blackmail.

2cpox0re	>what the latter means? Can I read it somewhere?  Yeah, you may read it [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating) and more about credit ratings. In short, the richer is the country, the cheaper it may borrow money  >How did you come to those conclusions about him? What exactly is he advocating that would lead to second world rates  He and his friends say that in order Russia to grow it has to borrow. The trap is if you borrow *before* you has already grown, you are considered risky and the money is expensive for you. Automatically, to pay the higher rates, you have to conduct more risky business. It is a common knowledge that the higher is the risk, the higher is the possible reward, i don't have a single link to provide you to prove this point. Eventually the country has to grow only for all the surplus to be paid to the lenders.  What to read? I don't know.

2qoida0p	>I'm not sure that's true for younger people, maybe they understand because of similarities but where would they learn to speak it?  Among themselves.   Speaking of myself - i'm originally from a village (central ukraine), people there spoke a local dialect and within the family we still speak that dialect. But among other people we speak Russian, because it's at least a language of international communication in post-soviet area. I've never studied russian language anywhere - my school had only ukrainain, english and german languages available to study but all the kids and most of the teachers spoke russian among themselves (except the lessons - lessons were conduct mostly in ukrainian).   The second important part is TV - which was the main source of media content and it was at least 50% in russian (on ukrainain TV channels) and we also had access to Russian TV channels (which were 100% in Russian) which were more popular at least in my family since they had better shows and better quality in general.   The third - literature, which was mainly in Russian language all the way.    Not because it was forbidden to print books in Ukrainian - but rather because books in russian are (still) much more popular.    With such amount of exposure to Russian language it's almost impossible not to learn at least to understand it. Only if you live in closed, remote community where all the people speak their dialect only you may have problems with speaking Russian properly but it easily fixes if a person moves to a city and lives there at least for a few months.  Speaking of western parts - it varies, especially literally on the Ukrainian border where other ethnicities live in communities (hungarians or poles for example) - but i'm quite sure it applies to them as well, however the amount of speakers is much lower.	1642238812.0	hsqw3qm	t3_s402cm	t1_hsqt2b9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsqw3qm/

He allows his friends to siphon money to offshores while raising taxes for the people.

He lets elites have any property and families living in Europe, USA, and other "enemy" countries, while independent journalists are all marked "foreign agent" without any proof, just because they dare to criticise government.

Ну нету такого напряжения сил сейчас. Пару составов с техникой туда сюда гоняют. Ну не считать же фотографии полевого лагеря в 200-300 км от границы остриём копья. Внезапно, бронетехнику до рубежа атаки нужно ещё доставить. По ж/д или грузовиками. Она своим ходом по своей территории не поедет. У Украины просто нет оружия, которое может дотянуться дальше, чем на 120 км от границы.  Это если стрелять на максимальную дальность "точкой". Нет никакого смысла держать людей и технику на таком удалении. Это явно не развёртывание для вторжения. Ни из Донецка, ни из Луганска, ни рядом с границей таких фото нет. В приграничных областях никакой настораживающей активности нет. Вдоль линии соприкосновения все как обычно. Ну нет просто никаких косвенных признаков, что что-то готовится. Озвученная цифра в 100 тыс. человек это уровень крупнейших учений, которые проводила Россия. К которым готовятся по пол года. Ни на профильных форумах, ни в военных tg каналах, ни в соц сетях нет фоток с километровыми колоннами техники, глухо.	1642241158.0	hsqz6ld	t3_s3ouc4	t1_hsqkrl1	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hsqz6ld/

781aojp3	I hate him a lot.    I’ve watched many shows with him and I can’t really stand him.    There were number of series on До///дь TV channel, where they were discussing many different topics of Russia’s internal policy mostly. Guriev words were “In modern Russia there is not enough public space for discussion of future of Russia. We should hear different opinions and talk about different topics more”.    In the whole number of series NO ONE of the invited people argued with Guriev. They just repeat each others thoughts and nothing else. That’s how public space for discussion looks in Guriev eyes. He simply invited only those, who would agree with everything he has to say.    One of the invited guests was Sergei Medvedev.    In 2011 Medvedev said “Arctic should be taken away from Russia”. It caused a scandal. Basically his whole fucking message was so Russophobic that it just blows my mind. So here is my point: Guriev definitely knew about Medvedev’s retarded Russophobic mind, but it still invited him. Quite enough for me.    There are also many things where his hypocrisy simply crushes my ability to listen, but reasons for my hate are these two, which I always remember first about him.	1642243332.0	hsr21t9	t3_s3zxoj	t3_s3zxoj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3zxoj/how_does_an_average_raskarussian_feel_about/hsr21t9/

8sxjw6kt	How is United States being surrounded by water deliberate 😂  We’re living in a world of underwater intercontinental nuclear torpedoes. Super sonic ICBMs. 5th Gen+ fighter jets and air defence systems that can target 15+ targets before visible range. There have been simulations done with potential war games with Russia. Do you know what the average life span was for 50% of infantry? 27 hours . We’re discussing something truly horrible and very improbable here, but the bottom line is, fuck the navy and fuck any technical parameter you can muster. The sheer megaton yield that both countries posses would still wipe the planet twice over.   Oh and the fact that the US has at least two trans generals more than Russia is kinda an important point. You’re expecting these people to make a strategic decision about deployment of troops, yet there’s clear evidence of them struggling to make a strategic decision about their gender. Us military is busy hiring diversity officers that earn 100k USD to make marketing material cartoon about a little girl that has two mums and wants to be a pilot. Have you considered that maybe a large part of the population is simply too passive to be enlisted vs another large part of the population is so painfully left wing that they would rather see your country rulesd under authoritarianism?	1642244445.0	hsr3jin	t3_s3xrm1	t1_hsob98i	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3xrm1/how_does_russian_people_feel_about_the/hsr3jin/

Then I'd leave the town and head to the Serpukhov.  At 50 km I would find myself somewhere it the forest near "Sharapov Hunt" place, in 20 km from Serpukhov, beautiful nature places. An then I'll take a train and go home.  How do I know this all? I've traveled that direction on bike and after 70 km reached Serpukhov and Oka river.

5qr8qa7m	Long story short: let’s fire half of government bureaucrats and police because they are “ineffective and corrupt”, creating huge army of unemployed people, cancel taxes for small businesses (and maybe for medium-sized, but I don’t remember now) and raise minimum wage and pensions. This three points alone is already enough to ruin our country. You want to spend more money on one hand while collecting less taxes on the other. And simultaneously having literally millions of former government employees who won’t be able to fit into the new system due to either lack of in-demand skills or, what’s worse, repressions against “former Putins lackeys”. This plan is pure catastrophe.	1642245830.0	hsr5e5u	t3_s3zxoj	t1_hsqrv34	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3zxoj/how_does_an_average_raskarussian_feel_about/hsr5e5u/

781aojp3	Увидел, что ты русский, вроде бы.  Может быть, сам он и не русофоб, но зачем тогда якшаться с русофобными пидарасами?   Смотрел его выпуск с Навальным? Где он жалуется на то, что "в Москве я был лицом кавказской национальности" и что же делать, чтобы "такие люди, как я" не чувствовали себя людьми второго сорта. Ох уж воистину эти бедные кавказцы и ксенофобные москвичи.  Так кавказцы себя плохо в Москве чувствуют, ужас!  &#x200B;  P.S. я не пытаюсь тут пустить пыль в глаза, что у нас нет в стране ксенофобии, но когда вот  слышишь подобное заявление становится очень мерзко. Ксенофобия есть, но только основа у неё не "Вот есть мы тут высшие, и они - дикари", а куда глубже, чем якобы притеснение одной группы. Если начать глубокого анализировать кто кого и где притесняет, то многие жалующиеся на притеснение ахнут.   И в определенной степени повторюсь: Гуриев не глуп, не слеп и не глух, чтобы не замечать определённые вещи. Вот за эти попытки надеть на себя овечью шкуру я его очень не сильно НЕ ЛЮБЛЮ.

You have no problem holding modern day Germany accountable for Nazi atrocities, but are not willing to hold Russia accountable for atrocities of USSR. Unless you are saying that USSR didn't commit atrocities...  Personally I think that neither modern day Russians, nor Germans are personally responsible for atrocities, unless you can accept that the concept of guilty by association is a thing.	1642249221.0	hsra410	t3_s3z7oy	t1_hsr7x9g	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hsra410/

7pascwg1	Before Uber-like apps taxis were somewhat of an "elite" mode of transport because of their high prices. I don't think an official taxi would take an order of less than 500 rubles in 2011, while it's common to make ~100 ruble short distance rides today (not adjusted for inflation).  Also, the drivers, especially the younger or migrant ones, would often ask the passenger, how to get to their destination, even in the age when navigation apps were available (well, smartphones and data were a bit pricier those days).  Since the industry was very fragmented (you had to pick from dozens of taxi companies to call and order a taxi), in a big city like St-Petersburg there was a considerable wait for the taxi to arrive (~20-30 minutes).  I was surprised when visiting Togliatti in 2012, a driver would show up in less than 10 minutes (usually more like 5) and the cost would rarely exceed 150 rubles even for longer trips. And all this with traditional booking by phone.	1642250972.0	hsrcsrn	t3_s4bjkj	t3_s4bjkj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4bjkj/before_ubers_how_common_were_taxis_in_st/hsrcsrn/

rg5rw	To clarify - "девочка" is usually a kid. However in some situations (e.g. in some group of women collegues) it's normal to call each other "девочки" between adults. But it is sort of ironical flavour.   There are some other cases when "девочка" is acceptable for an adult (including offensive ones). But in formal talk you don't do that.  And I don't thing there are cases to call a pre-teen kid "девушка" - unless, again, ironically (like "young lady").	1642252533.0	hsrfgey	t3_s4iyhr	t1_hsr93eb	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4iyhr/hello_i_have_a_question_i_put_in_translation_girl/hsrfgey/

(And hiring a cab from Murmansk to go to Teriberka is well worth it!)   On the Golden Ring, Rostov Veliky is underrated, and there’s a hotel inside the city’s main kremlin that is sparse on amenities but super interesting to stay in.

But expecting the same from Russia isn’t realistic and won’t be for a long time. At least I’ve never stumbled upon any serious analysis showing otherwise.

2cpox0re	The trick is not to bury ourselves before trying. We haven't even tried a single time! Are we having capitalism right now? Hell no! This is feudalism 2.0. Were we experiencing Russian capitalism in 1913 with all the plants belonging to anybody but the Russians? I bet the young capitalism was swept away so easily because capitalists just evacuated to Sweden or whatever.  Time to try already to self govern. I bet the process of achieving the desired level will be as rewarding and inspiring, when everybody is able to test their abilities to engineer something new and resort to being a hired employee, having the government to watch for the balance of interests of businessmen and workers using the independent courts and the parliament that is not a puppet of the executive...   I say, what we have now has started in 1993. Weren't we dreaming for the western type capitalism in the late 1980-s and early 1990's? Were even the Communists admitting that the planned economy weren't working? The people watched the USSR falling and doing little about that, because they were dreaming: okay, let's try capitalism. How silly we were, how easily we were deceived by those street magicians that called themselves "democrats" and their overseas friends!	1642259184.0	hsrszx9	t3_s3zxoj	t1_hsrpoex	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3zxoj/how_does_an_average_raskarussian_feel_about/hsrszx9/

2cpox0re	Я думаю так: капитализму трудно существовать без государства, поскольку полиция и другие органы государства защищают собственность. Государству (обычному, у которого нет централизованных нефтегазовых или там алмазных доходов, как у всяких африканских диктаторов) трудно существовать без опоры на большую массу людей. В конце концов десять человек всегда набьют морду одному, сколько бы бумажек-денег у того ни было. Поэтому капиталисты способствуют созданию государства, опирающегося на народ, чтобы это государство не развалилось и он, толстосум, не пострадал. (Исторически капиталисты освобождали государство от власти феодалов, вручая власть "простолюдинам". Сначала пытались с помощью имущественных цензов вручить государство только самим себе, но под страхом социалистической революции решили, все-таки, не злить народ!) Если каждый из людей уверен, что его иногда спрашивают на выборах, какую политику он хочет, тогда соглашается подчиняться тем правилам, которые устанавливают выборные органы. И если он верит, что большинство проголосовало за правило, согласно которым мы не запрещаем своим согражданам владеть средствами производства, с условием, что богатеи не пожирают детей и не гноят рабочих в бараках при 18-часовом рабочем дне, то простой человек будет поддерживать такое государство - как же, он же сам согласился, или его соотечественники согласились с такими правилами -  и преступников будет осуждать как маргиналов, а не тайно поддерживать в пику власть имущим...  блин, примерно такая политическая философия. это ж от Локка, Гоббса идет еще, а главное, вроде как работает на Западе кое-как. С тех пор, как Союз наз развалился, ихние капиталисты, конечно, начали терять берега, ну а мы-то тут причем. Мы-то сделаем нормально =)	1642260286.0	hsrvj4d	t3_s3zxoj	t1_hsrs8h8	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3zxoj/how_does_an_average_raskarussian_feel_about/hsrvj4d/

Talking about secrets in Russia- yes, you’re going to have problems. Even on a stage of investigation one could be treated as being convicted. And this could happen not only with people having access to real secrets. Compiling open source information or even counting how many tanks have passed on a train through some station could be investigated a espionage and act of treason. There was a woman in Russia who called her relatives in Ukraine somewhere around 2014 and told them that troops were moving to the direction of Ukraine and she was arrested for that (not sure if convicted).	1642263677.0	hss3qi6	t3_s3ouc4	t1_hsrzy3s	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3ouc4/what_is_the_current_narrative_in_russia_regarding/hss3qi6/

26um0b7u	These are not just a few examples, this is all that you could squeeze out of yourself. Deportation cannot under any circumstances be compared with direct genocide, rape, torture and murder of millions of people. Comparing such things and putting them in a row is a cheap trick and a substitution of concepts. I myself am a descendant of deported Estonians. My great-grandmother Adelia Rastas was deported to the Murmansk region when the war began, she became a member of a partisan detachment and fought against the Fins and the Germans.  The Katyn shooting is one of the reasons why Poles do not like Russians. They did not forgive or forget anything, as required by, for example, from the Russians in relation to the Germans. Katyn was a kind of response to Poland to how they, in turn, dealt with Soviet prisoners taken prisoner during the Polish-Soviet War of the 1919-1920s.    **From the note of the NKID of the RSFSR to the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Charge d'affaires of the Polish Republic T. Fillipovich on the situation and death of prisoners of war in Polish camps (September 9, 1921):**   "*The responsibility of the Polish Government entirely remains the indescribable horrors that are still happening with impunity in places like the Strzalkovo camp. It is enough to point out that 60,000 of 130,000 Russian prisoners of war in Poland died within two years."*   Russian historian Mikhail Meltyukhov estimates the number of dead prisoners at 60 thousand people, the same number is given by I. V. Mikhutin.   And according to the calculations of the military historian M. V. Filimoshin, the number of Red Army soldiers who died and died in Polish captivity is 82,500 people.   A. Kolpakov estimates the number of deaths in Polish captivity at 89 thousand 851 people.  I'm sure you don't care about that. When russians are killed, I'm sure it's OK for you, but when Russians start paying the same coin to their opponents, all of a sudden everyone start whining that need to forget and forgive everything, that this is a limited view that leads to eternal conflicts. Bullshit! These double standards just make me sick. Thus, there will be no Russians on Earth at all (but apparently the Europeans only want this) if we allow ourselves to be exterminated with impunity and do not fight back against our opponents.	1642267185.0	hsscpqi	t3_s3z7oy	t1_hsrplma	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hsscpqi/

aa2el1ra	Dude, I think you really got away from the whole point we were discussing. Your point was that modern day Germans are responsible for atrocities of the Nazis. My point is that by that standard modern day Russians should be held responsible for the crimes of the Soviet Union.  >When russians are killed, I'm sure it's OK for you, but when Russians start paying the same coin to their opponents  Can you point out one instance where I said that it's ok that Russians were killed?  I'm saying that all innocent people killed is a tragedy. On the contrary, you are the one defending and justifying crimes against humanity that Soviet Union committed.   >Katyn was a kind of response to Poland to how they, in turn, dealt with Soviet prisoners taken prisoner during the Polish-Soviet War of the 1919-1920s.  And Polish prisoners also received the same treatment in 1920 war, what's your point here? How far back do we go? Should we still hold Mongols accountable for Genghis Khan?

The last year there was an attempt to make platforms more amenable by shaping the traffic, and for several days twitter was lagging, but then the conception was changed.  Now Russia tries to force the services to cooperate by financial way: first, the law was passed which requires all the Western companies which earn money from Russians to do it through their Russian departments only, not directly through abroad companies.  Second, the multi-million fines were put on those service for "not deleting the illegal content", so now the services has two alternatives: obey the Russia, or stop the operations in Russia.

But they are not even close to equal. They are not equal, which means that all claims to modern Russians are untenable. I "justify" crimes against humanity (since you want to) the fact that before that, exactly the same crime was committed against the Russians themselves, and no one cared about it and for some reason no one considers it a crime and does not make claims to the Poles. Russian Russians are allowed to kill tens of thousands of Russian prisoners, and when Russians kill Poles, it is a crime against humanity?  &#x200B;  >And Polish prisoners also received the same treatment in 1920 war  How is it the same?

3bmg1sm8	The idea that Murmansk is a "must" seems very original to me. It's probably one of the ugliest cities you can find in Russia. The surrounding area, though, is breathtakingly beautiful if you have a car or can rent one.  If you're into city breaks, you can start with the Golden Ring of Russia, a collection of old Russian cities, relatively small, that have some historical and cultural interest. They're all very easily accessible from Moscow on the weekends.   Then you can look into other cities like Nizhny Novgorod, Ekaterinburg, Tula, Pskov, Irkutsk... The possibilities are endless, you probably need to do your own research and see which ones you find more interesting.  As for natural attractions, check out the Caucasus, the Urals, Karelia, anywhere along the northern coast, Kaliningrad oblast, the Far East, the lake Baikal. All are absolutely spectacular. Make sure you have a Russian speaking friend or two with you if you decide to go. Probably avoid Black sea summer resorts as they're just overcrowded and overpriced tourist traps.	1642270150.0	hsskdk1	t3_s4pl86	t3_s4pl86	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4pl86/im_flying_to_moscow_в_вторник_ill_live_there_for/hsskdk1/

They're not so far from Moscow (Kursk, Lipetsk, Tula, Voronezh, Ryazan, Tver - within several hours on comfortable train) and could be good destinations for weekend.

Visit Golden Ring (cities around Moscow), Nizhniy Novgorod (don't confuse with Vilikiy Novgorod... you should visit this to, though). In summer there will be swimming event, to swim across Volga river - they stop all navigation for several hours. You could take slot for 1 km, it is quiet easy (or boats will save you if you fail). I could be interesting, to cross the largest river of Europe.   Also there are lots of good sport events in Moscow or Piter.  Dmitrov to the north is nice town with ground fortress. There is balloon club, you could fly over Dmitrov and river channels, very beautiful sight.   Kazan is fine, only 1 night at train, 4-5k roubles one way. Visit also nearby Sviyazhsk (fortress made by Ivan the Terrible to prepare for storm of Kazan), Vilikiy Bolgar (ancient capital city). If you go to Kazan, taste echpochmak (lit. triangle), a special pie. But not in street fastfood, but in good restaurant.	1642270699.0	hsslszh	t3_s4pl86	t3_s4pl86	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4pl86/im_flying_to_moscow_в_вторник_ill_live_there_for/hsslszh/

aa2el1ra	>How is it the same? Exterminated by tens of thousands?  Similar number of prisoners died in Soviet captivity depending on which historians you look at.  Millions died under soviet regime, including Russians, I think it's a shame that you justify their deaths. I think that human lives, being Russian or not, are a little bit more important just to trivialize them like that.   Again, I'm stressing that people today are not responsible for the wrong-doing of their ancestors, including Russians for Soviet crimes. Why don't we persecute children of murders? Perhaps we should mandate it in the law that they should be executed just to get "an eye for an eye"?  Anyway, obviously we won't find a common ground here, but I hope we can get to a point where we don't have to measure deaths to even the score...

I used to sing with my uncle.  Or some like simple songs for guitar. If you know three absolute chords (Am, Em, D) you can play any song in the world. Any of them. In a quality quite enough for alcohol party ;-) Пачка сигарет, Группа крови, Звезда по имени Солнце, 30 лет, Пора домой, Я свободен.  Songs (mostly Russian) of 80-90 are very popular in people whose youth was in that time. Руки вверх, Комиссар, Света, Наутилус, Сектор Газа, Кино...	1642271295.0	hssncuy	t3_s4g7u8	t3_s4g7u8	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4g7u8/what_are_you_guys_party_songs/hssncuy/

You won't taste anything other than the salt. A group of very kind local fishermen on a different day gave us some crab they'd just caught the same morning and cooked by themselves, and THAT was the real thing.

kn994	Nabokov’s personal opinion is that he was far more capable in Russian, and was self-deprecating whenever he described his ability in English. It just so happened that his ability in written English was far higher than almost anyone.  As for better-worse comparisons, that’s  a little reductive. He was a great writer, with mastery over both languages before he even started out as a writer. He had already graduated from Cambridge before he published novels in Russian.  I love both his early novels and his late English period. The latter novels are more ambitious, and rewarding, but it’s not a language issue. In Germany, he wrote for Russian publishers and in the US he wrote for American publishers	1642271695.0	hssoe7s	t3_s4pje6	t3_s4pje6	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4pje6/did_nabokov_write_better_in_russian_or_english/hssoe7s/
6cg4g	If you have six to nine months (!), then... Let's see here...  If you're into XVIII palaces, then the towns around St. Petersburg like Gatchina, Pushkin, Lomonosov, Strelna, Pavlovsk, maybe Shlisselburg. Valaam just a bit further East. Fort Krasnaya Gorka, too, if you like big guns.  Kizhi, for wooden architecture.  Pskov, Izborsk and Veliky Novgorod, for the history and the fortifications.  A lot to see in the Moscow Oblast, such as the Kubinka tank museum (plus Patriot Park), Monino aviation museum, and Vadim Zadorozhny Technical Museum.  Going North-East from Moscow: Sergiev Posad, Alexandrov, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Rostov Veliky, Yaroslavl, Rybinsk.  Further West: Vladimir, Bogolubovo, Suzdal, Kostroma (possible to go to Kostroma from Yaroslavl, or to Vladimir from Moscow), potentially also Murom and Nizhny Novgorod.  Kazan is definitely worth a visit, perhaps the towns around it like Sviyazhsk and Bolghar. If you have time, Yoshkar-Ola with its kitch downtown.  Volgograd, if you're into WWII history. Astrakhan further south, if you're into fishing.  The Caucasus, hoo boy, can spend quite a bit of time there, from Dagestan's ancient fortress in Derbent and Chirkey Dam to the flashy post-Olympic Sochi, past spa resort towns like Kislovodsk, Essentuki, Zheleznovodsk and Pyatigorsk, mountain resorts like Dombai and Arkhyz, and wine tourism spots like Abrau-Diurso, Lefkadia or Phanagoria.  Further West is Crimea, which is remarkable both landscape-wise and history-wise, from Kerch with its archaeological monuments in the streets and Adzhimushkay quarry, through Feodosia with Aivazovsky's gallery, Karadag volcano, Sudak with its Genoese fortress, Novy Svet preserve. Then on to the southern shore with Yalta, Livadiya and Alupka with their palaces, Ai-Petri mountain, and Foros church. Then the Western shore: Sevastopol with its military history, Yevpatoriya with the Greek ruins around it and Tartankhut; then Simferopol with its history museum and airport.  All of these are reachable from Moscow by train, but some of the listed takes quite a bit of time to reach, so you'd be better of flying (you can freely fly to Crimea since it leaves no stamps in your passport, as an internal flight). I know a few people like the idea of traversing Transsib by train, but long stretches of it aren't all that engaging, so you could as well fly if you want to see Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk with its hydroplant, Irkutsk and Baikal, and Vladivostok with its impressive bridges and fortifications.  Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Isles further East are also all spectacular as far as natural sights go, but they can be a tad bit costly to reach.	1642271759.0	hssok6j	t3_s4k5fu	t3_s4k5fu	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4k5fu/attractive_city_for_tourist_excepting_peter_and/hssok6j/

3qdtoh6u	>Yes, but I was talking about rioters  Overall we can split rioters in 3 groups - common people unhappy with something for various reasons (there are such objective reasons, elites are living in their bubble, thinking they've built state, but in reality it's weak parody), marginals-bandits-thiefs-maradeurs and radical core of riots, organized (by someone). I (and Tokayev) meant last category by "terrorists", which some of them definetely are, religious and not. You think random crowd walks around in small groups, methodically occupies important objects of the cities, isn't afraid to use violence against (and murder) even military/police?  >And they put doubts on Kazakhstan president affirmation of a coup d'etat  This is a weird part - since there was no organized political power, there was no declared political goal by radical part of rioters.   Like first wave in western KZ asked to change gas prices - and next day order to lower them was issued. There were some efforts to lead protests by runaway elites (for example from Kiev) - but they failed. And political demands were laughable, completely unrealistic, so it can't be considered people's will.   If it was coup - then it failed. But for me it's hard to put the events in this category.  By the way you have to separate events around KZ and in capital Astana (Nursultan) - in Astana it was exactly last 2 groups of mentioned, all the people were just shocked by events. Capital is financial center of country, with good level of life and key institutes of the country. It's not Aktau or towns with gas factories - don't get tricked that it was casual "protest of common people" in Astana - it wasn't.   > Terrorists would probably be killed without problems  Don't get me wrong, situation is quite complicated and multidimensional there and we still don't know completely what and how happened. Seems like internal elites were fighting for power - that was main force behind events. All others seem to be secondary force. When I mentioned USA/NATO - they definetely built some networks of influence in KZ aswell, but seems like events weren't organized by them. Just as migrated elites (with antigovernment plans) - they tried to participate, but it wasn't theirs job.  >Terrorists would probably be killed without problems, but rioters no.  But you skip the part that KZ is eastern country, that there are huge family-tribal relationship traditions, that whole country is divided on [3 big family groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuz), and for example one of them, western one, Junior, started protests, being the least quiet in general, just as more nationalistic than others. Also least presented in power, but having most of natural resources.   I mean, when KZ general says it's not going to be easy to use violence against rioters (although it has to be used), it sounds absurd, but it's not that absurd.  Plus don't forget that was elites betrayal, and central power wasn't sure which orders will be performed and which not. Many officials were fired already. I guess exactly because of this mistrust to regional and local elites Tokayev called CSTO help, which was unnecessary from first glance.  There is even some conspiracy that Tokayev himself organized that (or at least went with the flow) to get rid of certain people in power (which he did already).   Anyways, so far it looks like complicated and multi-layered event, we'll see further investigations when it completely settles.  >We clearly see how a simple word can change everyone perception and that's why medias can be so dangerous.  I'm very sure western media would follow their classic "people agaisnt dictator, we need to send them some democracy from bomber planes (and earn dollars meanwhile)" even without that word.   And average joe is nor capable to express his political will for event, nor capable to fight the propaganda machine and identify what is truth and what is lie.  >A lot of people here don't want to see the world as it is, prefering living in a comfortable lie than in the cold truth.  Which sounds weird, because Canada is migrant country, and many citizens probably have an idea of what's going on in world outside. That's in theory. Or maybe it's just - "I'm safe and now don't disturb me".  >I don't know what you are talking about. 🙄😂  Suuure :)  >Anyway, we inherited most of our "across the oceans enemies"  From other side you aren't involved as main actor, so conflicts are easier to solve.  >No one wanna pissed USA here.  Yeah, interesting neighbour, for sure. At least you aren't Mexico.  >a Queen loyalist country  By queen you mean that Saxe-Coburg-Gotha old woman? :) I suggest to view it as anachronism.  >Like you say, everything about this is complex  Well, if we (socialistically) forget everything above of normal working people interests, like "how to get rich and have nice parties like Eppstein" or "country under which flag is the boss" or "whos gun is bigger?" - then it's not really :)	1642271955.0	hssp246	t3_s1sfm9	t1_hso0yeq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/hssp246/

I doubt you can make and even reverse engineer and implement a nuke when you're dead. And the above mentioned famine happened in the course of a big plot of reorganizing the agricultural industry, which eventually allowed to sustain the exponentally growing urban population, which in it's turn allowed the creation of massive inductrial complex that got us through WWII and recovery.    History does not give prizes for humanism, unfortunately, it does not bring you up for your sanity and best intents, all what matters is performance, and whether this performance is in demand or not. This is Russia, we've always been getting leaps forward at a bloody price, St.Petersburg is built on the pile of bones, even scarce siberian logistics had been built with forced or poorly rewarded labour for several centuries, all the southern range is soaked in the bloodshed against Ottomans and whoever else, but on the other hand it returned the resource, it was a desperate reach for opportunity. That's what it is, we paid the bloody price way too often, but an other price was rarely enough.

eqs0s	Well, Russia wasn't meh prior to 1917. It was the largest country and it was growing fast in economic terms. 1917 wasn't even the lowest point. The lowest was 1922 after WWI and Civil War Russia lost sizable territory and its economy and industry was in shambles. The reforms of Lenin and Stalin brought Russia back to super power level.      Main ones were education. Russia built its own technical intelligentsia from peasants. Building heavy industry and infrastructure by any means possible. That's one of the reason for famines. However, agricultural reforms ended famine cycle that was common in Eastern Europe at that time.	1642442964.0	ht2e4gp	t3_s68jnb	t3_s68jnb	/r/AskARussian/comments/s68jnb/how_did_russia_became_russia/ht2e4gp/

1nr4zcn4	Soviet economy at the time was the most efficient economy in human history. When almost whole population has direct control over country's economy, from bottom to top, that is the only possible result.   Unlike capitalist economies where very few people own all the assets and use them with the only goal - to gain maximum profit, in socialist economy (in USSR from 1936, partially before that) all means of production are owned by majority of society (workers) (or collectives) and therefore the goal of the economic production is "securing of the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole society, through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of the highest techniques".  Famines were normal in Russia, occurring every 2-3 years, with its (almost) medieval peasantry from 19th century until 1932, when with the collectivization efficiency of farming highly increased.  There were less people in GULag camps and prisons per 1000 then there is today in USA. In fact Soviet judicial system was far too forgiving and soft as the history showed. There were numerous cases when people who participated in terrorist activities and spying were let go after simply apologizing and swearing not to do it again.	1642446757.0	ht2o68t	t3_s68jnb	t3_s68jnb	/r/AskARussian/comments/s68jnb/how_did_russia_became_russia/ht2o68t/

1nr4zcn4	How do you compare extremely developed at the time USA and semi-feudal Russia devastated after World War and Civil War? Today's South Sudan has capitalist economy too, while less than 1% of population has access to electricity, but you wouldn't take it as an example of modern capitalist country, would you? You should judge by the changes that were made in certain period and certain conditions.   Capitalism is not eternal, it will die sooner or later - just like slavery and feudalism did.   From the point of view of those traitors the country indeed was literal hell, they despised prosperity of common people and freedoms they had and enjoyed having large sums they got from those who they turned to.  China is not a conscious entity, there were certain political changes (same in USSR) made by social groups that led to overthrowing of the workers state. And what it became - a fascist state with widespread national oppresion (Uighurs), one of the highest social differentiation, huge poor population working in awful conditions and a major imperialist power conquering new markets all over the world bringing devastation and oppression to native populations.	1642448845.0	ht2tqkp	t3_s68jnb	t1_ht2pxp7	/r/AskARussian/comments/s68jnb/how_did_russia_became_russia/ht2tqkp/

As for you, think about the fact that in relation to Russians, the use of the words "commie", "rusnya", "redneck" is an analogue of the word "nigger" for Negroes. Oh, yes - and hints of the "slave mentality of Russians" - which your politicians allow themselves - are a direct analogue of instructions like "your ancestors were worthless niggers" - taking into account the fact that about 80% of the population of imperial Russia were serfs - that is, in fact slaves.  Nevertheless, I do not remember a single case of significant protests against such statements by Western politicians.	1642449230.0	ht2urd9	t3_s5szfv	t3_s5szfv	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5szfv/a_question_about_n_word/ht2urd9/

Dont wanna call anyone stupid or whatever but it seems to me people who live in bigger cities and have higher education, who are able to Google stuff - those are straight-thinking and those are vaccinated. Simply because they're the ones best informed.   But I don't blame others who are so low on their trust towards authorities to the point where they hear "u guys really gotta vaccinate" and automatically understand they're not gonna do it until they're tortured to. The level of trust towards Putin and his party is the lowest it's probably ever been. And rightfully so.  People just need to be more well-informed. Because there's a lot of bs flowing around in the internet about what vaccines we actually have and how they actually work.  For the record, I too question our vaccines. Especially when a lot of people in suits keep repeating they're good. Don't trust that crap. I just read a lot so got vaccinated last summer. "Sputnik" is actually okay and it works. Can't say the same for our other 3 vaccines. But still at least 2 of them are better than nothing.	1642449248.0	ht2ut23	t3_s687dd	t3_s687dd	/r/AskARussian/comments/s687dd/whats_the_vaccine_controversy_like_in_russia/ht2ut23/

Stop and think about Ukrainian people who died from Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. It's much more important that your little problem.

Imagine today's DR Congo being on par with Switzerland in 2060, while simultaneously going through a war that destroys 1/3 of economy. And doing that only with its own forces, without any exploration of foreign countries.  There's no such thing as "human nature" in relation to economic relationships. Humanity has been living for about 196 thousand years in primitive communism, compared to 4 thousand years of slavery, feudalism and capitalism.  USSR for the most part of its history had either partially or fully capitalist economy, either while developing socialism (pre 1930s) or deconstructing it (from 1950s) and I'm not here to defend the latter.   US is the prime example of modern capitalism - imperialism. The age of free market capitalism was more than 100 years ago, today monopolies rule everything.	1642450142.0	ht2x3zz	t3_s68jnb	t1_ht2ush5	/r/AskARussian/comments/s68jnb/how_did_russia_became_russia/ht2x3zz/

32sf7h2	I read too much. Also I've had an example like that. But people close to me have had way too many examples of relatives dying to straight up covid without getting vaccinated. Seen that enough for sure.   First thought in that case I would've had would be "did they stay at home safe for a couple of days?". Because that's what u're supposed to do. Vaccine is a punch in the gut to the immune system. You gotta wait it out and let your body get used to it.   Second: did they have any diseases? Are u sure they didn't? Cos then again a lot of russians have some kind of heart or circulatory system disease which they don't know about. And that's entirely up to our Healthcare system. Or just blood pressure thing. I mean, vaccines are not perfect, sure, but u gotta look after yourself and not think you're invincible all of a sudden after you're vaccinated. Heard about a lot of those kinds too.  You get the idea. But I'm honestly so incredibly sorry for those whose close ones got the bad side of the vaccine. Sure, it's not totally finished yet in conservative terms. None of them are. Because vaccines take time to be tested and stuff. But we're dealing with the best we got. Therefore everybody should get checked out just to make sure they're okay to take that stuff in and not suffer from it.  But not getting vaccinated by most of humanity is most certainly not an option. It'll just keep mutating.	1642453619.0	ht36314	t3_s687dd	t1_ht32ze9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s687dd/whats_the_vaccine_controversy_like_in_russia/ht36314/

tslqi	Nah. In the United States, conversation is more of a dance where you allude to your real intentions rather than state them directly.   Instead of “let me use your car,” Americans will usually say something like “Hey, is there any chance I can use your car? [explanation why you need the car].”   Requests are less imperative and more of a negotiation, utilizing business tactics and language for even the simplest needs.	1642455849.0	ht3bu33	t3_s67db9	t1_ht21xia	/r/AskARussian/comments/s67db9/i_noticed_most_answers_here_are_very/ht3bu33/

But things are much better now today I have to admit. The point is Russia suffered much and I mean much, more by Germany but was less resentful about it. To be honest Russia suffered a lot from many nations and relatively low on the holding a grudge scale in that regard.      >Idk, the picture of you chancellor and our president holding hands at Verdun  Nah that was kind of a forced one. I mean chancellor Kohl did not speak French at all. But yes things improved vastly. I dare to say any press conference with chancellor Merkel an French president actually shows that a lot has improved. Also how much our military and economy are vowed together. Even though we are very bad partners for the first part which is kind of ironic since most people who want us to be better at that are those who suffered last time Germany went full military mode.

I dated with multiple girls, who were really kind an smart, not to mention they were really cute and attractive.   I don't have any actual complains, the only thing which might be strange for some foreigners is the cultural difference in the sense that in most of cases the man is the one who is supposed to pay for expenses, it is worth notice that not all women are like that, but it is indeed a common trait here.

clslenwb	As a Russian who got few chances to work in a few different cultural environments with people literally from around the world (except Africa) I'll have to agree with you. There are some distinct cultural communicative patterns in average (with exceptions falling withing Gaussian distribution) for every country and/or cultural group. Your examples seemed legit for me as well.  Although I felt before like I'm a bit more straightforward than most Russians (which still could be true), I got quite a few chances to watch other Russians in the same environments and had to agree on the fact we tend to be straightforward and taciturn.  Though, as you can see, I'm also a bit an exception here. While I really love when allowed to speak frankly, and often do it when not allowed (by the social norm), I also tend to speak rather amply. I'm quite the same with Russians, but in Western environment I probably got a small phobia of sounding rude (same happens in Russia sometimes) and got even more wordy. :) Still prefer openness over the risk sounding rude or overstep my authority, especially in work/business.  ( Doesn't mean I take real rudeness for honesty. Telling anyone that their work is bad for ex., even if you in a position to do so, makes no sense, helps no one and simply counterproductive. Overall good mood and politeness is also mandatory of course. )	1642462840.0	ht3t1ws	t3_s67db9	t1_ht1z49w	/r/AskARussian/comments/s67db9/i_noticed_most_answers_here_are_very/ht3t1ws/

It's not much use if it surrenders in a few days.  > The general consensus in America seems to be in favor of keeping Ukraine as an ally  From the Russian viewpoint, it stopped being that way since a few years ago, and it wants Russia to have it back --- take the financial hit having to restore its infrastructure, economy, and impoverished population; cut the ties between the Europe and Russia (as a result of sanctions) so that the US could feast on the European dying corpse, to turn the whole continent into a Ukraine, so to speak.

t564j	Here's a general take on some "vax skeptics" I talked to in Saint Petersburg: there is a lot of skepticism around mRNA vaccines (especially Sputnik V) because it's new technology that deviates from the more "traditional" approach to vaccines. "I won't ever get Sputnik V but I would get Covivac (a Russian inactivated vaccine still in trials) once the trials are completed." This is because the "inactivated" vaccine is a more "traditional" vaccine than the "experimental" mRNA type.  Another take is this: a lot of people in Russia have already had Covid, were even hospitalized with it, and so their argument is "I don't need a vaccine because I became naturally immune." I'm not saying this is a good or bad argument, but a lot people see the vax as redundant after surviving Covid.   Also, since Sputnik V is not recognized in Europe or the US, but those countries require "western" vaccines for travel, some Russians are booking "vaccine vacations" to places like Greece and Croatia, where tourists are offered the single shot J&J vaccine. People who plan to get a "western" vaccine don't see the point of having Sputnik V or maybe just don't trust it or view it as inferior/useless for their travel needs.	1642465108.0	ht3ybyd	t3_s687dd	t3_s687dd	/r/AskARussian/comments/s687dd/whats_the_vaccine_controversy_like_in_russia/ht3ybyd/

Also at the times of Catherine there was no separated ukrainian language, there were east slavic (or russian) dialect continuum. Soviets standardized distant dialects into Ukrainian an Belorussian which were taught in the certain soviet republics.

I would rather call it 'emergism', because for decades the country was ruled as if in a state of emergency.  And no, to stay afloat you in the first place had to be effective, not vicious.  Unfortunately the Soviet authorities failed to create a more 'civilized' regime. As soon as the society relaxed, it started getting corruption and losing effectiveness.	1642470348.0	ht4ajhk	t3_s68jnb	t1_ht47qrn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s68jnb/how_did_russia_became_russia/ht4ajhk/

It depends on how you use it tho, there's a difference between saying "the black dude" and "that n*gg*r mtherfcker" it depends on the context which makes it racist as the word Negro means both, so our word Negro is not offensive per se, it depends on the context I think is the same wirh негр.	1642472348.0	ht4fca5	t3_s5szfv	t1_ht20j8l	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5szfv/a_question_about_n_word/ht4fca5/

80gwelrx	There was a reboot called "Sailor moon Crystal" in 2014. (And several years after) Overall general public doesn't know anything about it. "Sailor Moon" is the old 90s series and that is all.  The people who knew about the reboot (mostly in sailor moon groups on VK) were excited about Crystal at first but then it came out and became a relatively huge controversy. I don't have any statistics but I remember the 1st season of Crystal being bashed pretty heavily. After that it became better and the opinions on it are split. Some people like it, some don't. Neither consider it "the Sailor Moon". I personally don't like Sailor Moon manga in terms of plot and pacing and "what the Lavos is going on" so Crystal gave me bad pacing/no character development/awful animation combo that made me drop it after several episodes...	1642473587.0	ht4ig2a	t3_s6ehxf	t1_ht3i8xy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ehxf/do_russians_like_any_of_the_newer_sailor_moon/ht4ig2a/

Due to communist exploitation of working force and this evil tradition setup people are hugely underpaid in our part of Europe, that's why we getting 4-8 less money for the same job as in other part of Europe. Raising wages and pensions is good starting move to fix it.   Canceling taxes for small business is amazing move. Look how it helped Poland. They have build society of small business owners providing for themselves and their families. When people have enough money they spend this money and it's helping economy grow. When few hundred oligarchs rob people and evacuate capital to foreign banks it only help them.  Firing bureaucrats and corruptioners is not enough, they need to be jailed for the crimes they did.

I don't think you are racist, but i'm feelint some degree of entilted racism on your words complaining about it, just tey to keep yourself educated.

3m72gmdg	Here's what I think happened. The Ukrainian army's Turkish drone was a robotic Gavrilo Princip prompting Russia to amass the troops at the border, lest Ukraine should be emboldened to make a push into the republics. Enter America, still fresh from the Taliban debacle and needing to look strong again. "Putin wants to invade Ukraine but is hesitant because *we're* here" is actually less unconvincing than the "Putin wants to invade the Baltics next but is hesitant because *we're* here" face-saving maneuver of 2014. Putin, for his part, turned it around and is counter-posturing along the lines of "I'm going to do *something* if you don't comply with these really bold demands I have". So far I'd say Russia is getting the greater power projection returns relative to its investment, but where this goes from here is becoming a complicated question.	1642475965.0	ht4o4ry	t3_s6ismv	t3_s6ismv	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ismv/what_do_you_think_is_causing_the_current/ht4o4ry/

Those my relatives also could never understand why did any border appear between Ukraine and Russia. Meaning the same population lived and lives in Kuban and eastern Ukraine. They speak the same language and have the same culture. Lots of families god separated by that border.

eqs0s	Kuban dialect is easily understood unlike Ukrainian to most Russians. Kuban was populated by people from Black Sea and Don Cossack hosts. Don is considered to be Russian.      Russian language is separated by 3 dialects groups: Northern, Middle and Southern. Standard Russian is based on a Middle dialect. Southern dialect was/is spoken in Rostov. Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian form a dialectal continuum. Thus, it's not surprising Rostov dialect is closer to Ukrainian than a standard Russian. It does not sound as a standard Ukrainian any way you slice it.      Russian dialects disappearing as there was no will to protect them unlike Ukrainian that enjoyed official status in Ukrainian SSR.	1642487265.0	ht5a9m8	t3_s6gt95	t3_s6gt95	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6gt95/how_ukrainian_is_kuban/ht5a9m8/

Other group stands against vaccination because of political reason. They just don't do that because it's Putin's vaccine and they don't do that just to annoy him.

If I ask "расскажи про себя" I'm expecting to hear something about the person's expirience, what he was doing before, how he values that, what are his plans. When I ask "расскажи о себе" I'm expecting to hear about how the person views himself in general, how he feels about various things, what's important for him.

aq471868	I live in the Moscow region. The roads are not very good. They are regularly repaired, but the quality of repairs is low. A few months after the repair, ruts and pits reappear. Moreover, these pits can be in the middle of a flat road. Those you go, you go, and suddenly bam - a blow to the suspension.      In addition, the number of roads and lanes on them is insufficient, terrible interchanges, all this absolutely does not correspond to the existing traffic. The poor quality of the roads does not allow setting a normal speed limit. Even on those routes that could be high-speed, there are limits of 60 km / h.

bvyiq	I never said they were entitled. Yet again I did imply there is an entire world outside of the US and Europe, that has a far different cultural development.   Sure, in this case, the girl is residing in the West where that usage may be problematic (altho Switzerland as a slave state? Really?), and knowledge of local cultural points never hurts, but my point was that the post colonial culture largely exists almost exclusively in the West, and it's not wrong to realize there is the majority of the world in terms of populace and landmass that simply does not care to the same level nor has the same history/cultural taboos.  I believe it was OP's question whether such differences existed and that was a response to her question.	1642492484.0	ht5hu0y	t3_s5szfv	t1_ht4n480	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5szfv/a_question_about_n_word/ht5hu0y/

I'll answer only for the first one:  > a man who deluded himself that war with Hitler will not happen despite plenty of intelligence  In 04.02.1931, in his speach at the 1st All-Union Workers' Conference, Stalin said:  >We are 50-100 years behind the advanced countries. We must sprint this distance in ten years. Either we do it or we get crushed   He foresaw the future war for ten years before, and was mistaken in his calculations for only 4 months! Isn't it ingeniously? Stalin clearly knew that the war will begin and spend all his time to prepare the country to defence.

What makes racial slur hateful is the underlying reason that this slur entails the imposed inferiority. That’s why not saying certain words is not a philosophical discussion or inquire how it is reasonable for us not to use, it is a social norm in the west where we live.

Maybe someone may help you with translation, or I may try later, but it brilliantly depicts the feelings: Шесть «юнкерсов» бомбили эшелон Хозяйственно, спокойно, деловито. Рожала женщина, глуша старухи стон, Желавшей вместо внука быть убитой.  Шесть «юнкерсов»… Я к памяти взывал, Когда мой танк, зверея, проутюжил Колонну беженцев — костей и мяса вал, И таял снег в крови дымящих лужах.  Шесть «юнкерсов»? Мне есть что вспоминать!

When it came down to actual Hitler, Stalin gets [informed](https://erenow.net/biographies/stalinthecourtoftheredtsar/34.php) by Sorge in May 1941 that invasion will happen on June 22nd, but he chooses to ignore that, and all other information in similar way as provocations. The truly disastrous part [comes later in 1941](https://erenow.net/biographies/stalinthecourtoftheredtsar/34.php) when Soviet Union gets informed again well in advance that Germany is preparing for immediate offensive, but Stalin quashes it all as "provocations", and continues to respond in this way even while Germans are already bombing USSR.	1642493948.0	ht5jrew	t3_s68jnb	t1_ht5irh6	/r/AskARussian/comments/s68jnb/how_did_russia_became_russia/ht5jrew/

You make some strong assertions about the negotiations, which are all revolving around claims of a single unnamed official, which are then contradicted by most of remainder of the articles and far more sources, including public government positions. Some things about them suggest that reciprocal drawdown of troops between US and Russia *could* be reached, but that's not some kind of unilateral US pullout and I would doubt that would happen without USA ensuring baltic states and others are comfortable enough about it.	1642494686.0	ht5kp8k	t3_s5p7fe	t1_ht5jg0g	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5p7fe/what_do_you_think_will_be_russias_action_to_a/ht5kp8k/

7vixwrek	The price for cheap convenience is often, unfortunately, someone's cheap and demanding labor. But that is how the price of service remains competitive, so if a competitor decides to fully embrace some sort of all-inclusive high employee standards, the result is that they go out of business due to either unbearable costs or just because everyone will start to deal with the competitor that kept the affordable service scheme. Worth keeping in mind that the customers don't have unlimited money either and people's first and biggest point of contention is and always will be the price. Cause and effect will just not accept the simultaneous existence of both states (unless hyper protectionism and hyper regulation is involved and any foreign company that might provide a cheaper service is disallowed and labor migrants that might work for cheaper while ignoring some of the established business rules are also forbidden from entry, but then you're just eliminating choice and alternatives, not creating solutions).	1642498859.0	ht5pwr7	t3_s6fe6n	t1_ht5b55u	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6fe6n/is_it_true_that_in_moscow_you_can_order_a/ht5pwr7/

1z49bw33	Чтобы понимать библию на церковнославянском, достаточно, чтобы тебе дословно сообщили пословный (где возможно) перевод исходного текста на свинособачий (Modern Russian). Чтобы держать в голове исходник и перевод, вообще необязательно знать сам язык, т.е. грамматику, морфологию, синтаксис — достаточно частичного владения семантикой и минимальной догадливости. Если такую бабушку попросить перевести с русского на церковнославянский незнакомый ей текст религиозной тематики (использующий известный бабушке вокабуляр, но придуманный только что) — она не сможет, потому что собственно языком не владеет.  Также, к сожалению, англоязычные не различают между старославянским и церковнославянским, называя Church Slavonic то и другое, но чаще всего имея в виду старославянский. Который, конечно, специалисты (числом в два с половиной человека) называют Old Slavic или Old Church Slavonic, но 99,999% англоязычных даже о наличии разницы не знают. Не говоря уже о терминах. Для них Church Slavonic — это язык Кирилла и Мефодия.  Так вот, на старославянском существует корпус текстов, в том числе не связанных с богослужебным каноном, попытка бабушки прочитать любой из которых «со знанием библии» приведёт к скоропостижному превращению её в дедушку.  Так что бабушка может научить только значению определённого набора текстов по попугайскому принципу, но никак не языку, которым она сама не владеет.	1642499197.0	ht5qbdb	t3_s5g7ee	t1_ht5p0n4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5g7ee/how_intelligible_is_church_slavonic_to_a_modern/ht5qbdb/

a2k1yczl	Quite a strange alliance of free people in which, say, one side, such as the United States opens secret torture prisons on the territory of other countries, such as, say, Poland or Lithuania. But let's say, Poland or Lithuania could not dream of having a secret prison opened especially for them on U.S. territory, where undesirable people would have their jaws drilled with an electric drill, so that the Polish or Lithuanian government would remain clean and uninvolved in the event.   Or when evacuating a country, let's call it afghinistan for example, someone will take all their troops with them but won't even provide airplane seats for the allied contingents. It seems that this is the attitude to vassal contingents of satellites in the colonial army, but what can Russians know about equal relations between free people, so I guess I will have to keep silent.   Again the person unfree and spoiled could think that when you were not even invited to the negotiations which directly concern you, it's because "why invite them at all, they don't influence anything, they will do as they are told". But this idea of the person unfamiliar with relations between people with the general values of freedom.

And, the issue isn't really whether or not such express delivery should exist, it's how far should we allow such industries to push their workers in the name of competition.   I would hope for a system that leans towards hyperprotectionism even if it means eliminating solutions. People got on just fine without those services before. If their existence is predictated on such an exploitaton of workers, I say tough shit. Your business shouldn't be allowed to exist. And anyone whining about a lack of convenience should reevaluate why they think they are entitled to such a service.

3g1jmfsq	And were Poland or Lithuania ordered to have those prisons opened? Did they have no other option but to accept them? They agreed to that, because they believed it to be a valuable service to an ally, not because it would be in power of someone in Washington to just order them to do that.  "Poland or Lithuania could not dream of having a secret prison opened especially for them on U.S. territory"  Nor could Poland or Lithuania dream of opening secret prisons in Slovakia. And why would Poland or Lithuania want secret prisons in USA or Slovakia? That doesn't make a lot of sense, does it.   However, they actually do want American soldiers on their soil, and America provides them for their protection for free, even long after any prisons were shut down.   &#x200B;  >Or when evacuating a country, let's call it afghinistan for example, someone will take all their troops with them but won't even provide airplane seats for the allied contingents.   It is true that each alliance state of NATO took its own citizens and its own approved persons on board of their own airplanes, but I'm not sure what's your point. Are you illustrating even total technical dependence of CSTO states on Russia for such basics as air transport to Kazakhstan for latest shooting of protesters?  &#x200B;  > Again the person unfree and spoiled could think that when you were not even invited to the negotiations which directly concern you, it's because "why invite them at all, they don't influence anything, they will do as they are told".

7vixwrek	I'll agree with your first statement, letting companies treat their workers however they want will invariably eventually lead to most of them turning into a master-servant relationship, unacceptable nowadays and not even great for business objectively – just dumb monkey-level relationship.   Having nice things, though is something that people won't give away willingly. It is a known quirk of human psychology that losing a minor convenience is a greater deal to people than gaining one. And I'm pretty sure the majority do realize (if prompted via conversation) that the exchange of someone working in a less fairer way for their (end consumer's or someone elses) ultimate somewhat greater benefit.  But they will not reevaluate or feel sorry, because self-benefit is the greatest driving force for a "normal", so to speak, individual. People do want to take the cake and eat it. They will not see it as a contradiction, they will not care if it's a contradiction. People want to have nice things and live in comfort and if someone works a bit harder for them to work a bit less, then like the saying goes, out of sight - out of mind.	1642500909.0	ht5sdts	t3_s6fe6n	t1_ht5rbde	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6fe6n/is_it_true_that_in_moscow_you_can_order_a/ht5sdts/

1z49bw33	Я не знаю, как ещё объяснить, что словами Church Slavonic (к сожалению, некорректно, но там как об стенку горох — они даже своих лингвистов не слушают) упорно и системно называют как церковнославянский, так и старославянский. Считая то и другое одним и тем же.  Оба языка схожи до смешения, это правда. Точнее церковнославянский — это такой извод (subset) старославянского с очень, очень небольшими сдвигами (в т.ч. массой грамматических калек из койне оригиналов священных текстов, правда в употреблении ограниченных этими же священными текстами).  Поэтому бабушка без особых проблем поняла бы церковную книгу XI века, наверняка бы и церковную службу. При этом вообще не врубаясь в древнерусский (о котором речь не идёт).  Но. Старославянский был живым языком межславянского общения на Балканах и за их пределами, и родным разговорным языком для немалого числа южных славян. «Солунский диалект староюжноболгарского», вот это все. Из них большое количество вообще оставались язычниками и не имели представления о письменности на родном языке. Если бы бабушка с ними попыталась разговаривать на бытовые темы, то поняла бы немного. Сразу бы всплыла масса слов, не встречающихся в церковной литературе, а ещё бы бабушка поняла, что не может нормально спрягать, склонять и строить высказывания — ведь её этому не учили. Даже если бабушка наизусть знает весь канон церковных книг и помнит значение каждой фразы — её способность формировать новые высказывания на языке жёстко ограничена, т.к. знание правил языка сведено к собственным догадкам и интуиции (ведь системно бабушке никто сам *язык* не преподавал).  Да она и не смогла бы перевести с русского на знакомый ей из библии  церковнославянский какой-нибудь короткий современный текст типа газетой заметки. Потому что церковнославянскому как языку никого, кроме священников, не учили. Воцерковленных мирян обучали только  значению переводов, называя это «обучением языку», но это же очевидно ошибочно.  Аналогия: я вынужденно много читаю на испанском текстов определённой (узкой)  тематики, но ни могу сформировать на испанском простой фразы помимо заранее встреченных и выученных, ни понимаю текстов и высказываний на темы вне стихийно освоенной мной ниши. Получается, самого испанского я не знаю.	1642501248.0	ht5ssve	t3_s5g7ee	t1_ht5qw1q	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5g7ee/how_intelligible_is_church_slavonic_to_a_modern/ht5ssve/

Телогрейка ,ватник для русских больше чем одежда ..этот примитивизм и утилитарность которая несмотря на простоту спасла миллионы русских от морозов и суровости климата в тяжёлые времена войны и последующей разрухи.

pf87gd6	A bit of sidetrack, but... First death camps of the 20th century were built in Poland to keep Russian POVs from the first world war. My grandmother had like 8 from 10 of her relatives killed in 1937, she escaped from Poland to USSR. Then poles were all smoochie smoochie with Hitler and attacked czechoslovakia together. They didn't attack USSR together, probably, only because they pissed off Hitler by their arrogance.   On a hate scale from 1 to Poland Nazi Germany was like 7.  For Russians any amount of dead poles from the first half of the 20th century is a non-issue.   As for the amount of killed people, we have seen ourselves in the 90th what happens when government collapses. Amount of organized crime groups goes through the roof, robberies, rapes, you name it. And it happens with an ongoing invasion on top. Government needed to act, and act quick.

cpr61ubc	да, извините, там все очень молоды, до среднего возраста 72 года буквально пару лет:  "Что у нас нынче выполняет функции советского Политбюро? Правильно, после всех поправок в Конституцию и обнулений это Совет безопасности во главе с самим нашим верховным правителем Владимиром Владимировичем Путиным, до 70-летия которого осталось, кстати, менее года. Кто там ещё состоит? 70-летний секретарь Совета безопасности Патрушев в органах КГБ СССР с 1974 года, таким опытом пренебрегать никак нельзя. 70-летний постоянный член Совета безопасности Бортников в органах КГБ СССР с 1975 года. Тоже носитель бесценных для управления современным государством знаний. Так что Долгих не одинок, эти тоже из 1970-х, смотрите, какая преемственность: "Это наша с тобою судьба, это наша с тобой биография", как пелось в одной советской песне. Первый заместитель секретаря Совета безопасности Аверьянов Юрий Тимофеевич – 71 год. Заместитель секретаря Совета безопасности Попов Михаил Михайлович – 70 лет. Другие замы – это уже молодежь: Рашид Нургалиев – 65 лет, Сергей Вахруков – 63 года, Александр Гребенкин – 67 лет, Олег Храмов – 66 лет, Юрий Коков – тоже 66. Кто все эти люди? Подробные биографии их нигде не опубликованы. Это, так сказать, аппарат.  Как и в советском Политбюро, здесь сохранена двухэтажная структура. Члены современного Политбюро теперь именуются "постоянными членами Совета Безопасности Российской Федерации", кандидаты в члены Политбюро – это просто "члены Совета безопасности". Кто там среди "постоянных", помимо уже перечисленных? Сергей Борисович Иванов – 68 лет, в КГБ СССР с 1975 года. Владимир Колокольцев – 60 лет. Сергей Лавров – 71. Ещё там состоит бывшая начальница долгожителя Долгих Валентина Ивановна Матвиенко – неловко напоминать женщинам о возрасте, но ей 72 года. Сергей Нарышкин – 67 лет. Сергей Шойгу – 66 лет. Пробежимся и по рядовым членам Совбеза, хотя это уровень пониже, судьбоносные вопросы решают без них: Беглов (65), Булавин (69), Герасимов (66), Золотов (67), Собянин (63), Трутнев (65), Устинов (68), Чайка (70)."	1642506042.0	ht5z29k	t3_s6s7tr	t1_ht5rbwj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6s7tr/tell_me_why_there_wont_be_a_war/ht5z29k/

About Zaolzie, Poland retook the regions with Polish population that were stolen in 1920s by Czechoslovakia. It has been done with no correspondence with Hitler.  Poland was seen as an alternative by Hitler only because of Pilsudski, another socialist. After his death in 1935 Poland was nr.1 hated country by Germany, so Poland started to build their relations with France and England.

Arguments about 'killed more people' doesn't work well if you speak about the times of revolution and civil war (for example, how figures of the french revolution are viewed?).  As for the monument - i want it to remain. I don't support Dzerzhinsky, just don't like the concept of fighting with monuments. It's too western and teenish imo. History should be respected.

And if you then try to interpret the results solely in the context of Dzerzhinsky himself, you won't quite be asking the right questions. I have a very negative view of Dzerzhinsky but I also realize that a very unpopular (with good reason) political crowd has, for decades, monopolized the narrative of condemning Bolshevik crimes and, frankly, turned it into a toxic victim-blaming mess that people quite understandably don't want to be associated with.	1642511268.0	ht6791o	t3_s6uw46	t1_ht63i41	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6uw46/why_do_russians_consider_felix_dzerzhinsky/ht6791o/

My worst one was probably the time when I had a legal agreement + a few technical supplements to it to translate overnight. Basically, I worked 9-5, and someone yet again forgot that translation takes time, so they brought the docs at 4pm and needed them for 9:30am. Not only I had to work all night after working all day, I very quickly discovered that the agreement was a badly reviewed draft. It had unfinished sentences, sentences that made no sense whatsoever, bad grammar, bad spelling, some clauses were repeated, there were references to non-existing clauses etc. Terrible mess of a thing. So I translated it anyway and out of spite decided to edit the source text as well and make a comment about each correction. Felt like a teacher with a red pen :D The following morning, when the meeting was over, my boss brought his partners into my office and said: "You see this young lady here? Thank her and don't show anyone the original agreement you sent. Half a century old and you write like a child".

15cqtc	Ну так я не филолог ни разу. Единственный древнегреческий, который я учила - это коине. Захотелось Новый Завет в оригинале почитать, а тут как раз  университет пускал всех на свой курс для теологов. Учитывая, что я по местному ещё не очень хорошо говорила, было очено весело:). Кажется, из "настоящего" древнегреческого нам как-то показали первые строфы Иллиады, и всё, ни один человек в группе его учить не собирался. Больше я ни разу ни одного не-коине текста не видела, и мне они сто лет не сдались. Хотя нет, вру, как-то открыла википедию на современном греческом и поразвлекалась выискиванием знакомых слов, но это не далеко зашло. Я вам точно скажу, что те, кто никакого греческого не учил, вообще про коине не в курсе. Это только профессиональные филологи агрятся, когда коине называют древнегреским. Греки же на нём говорили? Греки. Древние? Древние.

The same forces that in 1943, already on the side of the Euro-Nazis, created a fabrication about the involvement of the USSR in the events at Katyn.        And secondly, many people in Russia remember that Dzerzhinsky, together with Makarenko, saved two million homeless children during the Civil War.	1642513932.0	ht6cemo	t3_s6uw46	t3_s6uw46	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6uw46/why_do_russians_consider_felix_dzerzhinsky/ht6cemo/

m06af	We are probably entirely in agreement.   I'm deeply aware of most people's attitudes towards convenience and our ability to justify or outright ignore the exploitation or suffering that occurs to support our quality of life. I am trying to be a more conscious consumer but modern life and society is structured in such a way that it is honestly almost inescapable to participate in some degree of it, without becoming some kind of monk or hermit. I am fairly minimalist and it's still quite challenging.   But that is why regulation and worker protections are so important. They stop the problem up stream, at its source, rather than shift the burden on the consumer, who is generally incentivized to choose price and convenience over anything else. We consumers are too busy trying to survive. Expecting even a large minority of people to contemplate every transaction they make as a moral dilemma is probably far too lofty a goal.   We just need to make it systemically untennible to run a business that entails exploitation.  It just seems so backwards that there is moral panic when we suggest any degree of market interference but everyone stays silent when people are literally getting screwed over and leading needlessly shitty lives in the name of profit for others and convenience.   Again, perhaps I'm too idealistic but I just don't think anyone deserves to be treated as means to an end.	1642515355.0	ht6fhiq	t3_s6fe6n	t1_ht5sdts	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6fe6n/is_it_true_that_in_moscow_you_can_order_a/ht6fhiq/

Also polish case is not about 'voluntarily joining', it's about whould it rather be nazi territory or ours.  Bessarabia is another case: USSR didn't recognize it's annexation in 1918.

1z49bw33	Ну вообще по-французски все то же самое: grec ancien это диалектный континуум, [породивший койне](https://i.postimg.cc/h4QFsRF6/Screenshot-20220118-172358-org-wikipedia.png), и долгое время сосуществовавший с ним, а к закату античности (в форме grec classique) ставший мёртвым «языком престижа», который в качестве второго изучали носители койне с претензией на знатность и/или образованность (и все сливки Рима, между прочим). Обе формы греческого сосуществовали, каждая по-своему развиваясь, и противопоставлялись друг другу в большинстве контекстов. Более того, у истоков койне находился вообще македонский язык, который хоть и произошёл от одного источника со всеми греческими диалектами и был с ними взаимопонимаем, самими греками греческим не считался (македонцы считались хохлами Эллады и варварами вплоть до момента, как Александр Великий завоевал всю Грецию). Я понимаю по-французски, и отсылкой к французским источникам «с не такой терминологией» меня не проведёшь.  Другое дело, что ссылка на учебник смутно подсказывает, что дело могло быть в Сорбонне, где уже году в 2012 из чурок и хачей наполовину состояло не только студенчество, но и преподавательский состав. Качество преподавания обрушилось пропорционально, особенно в департаментах филологии и теологии. Так что я ничему не удивляюсь, никого не осуждаю и ни с кем спорить не рвусь.	1642517075.0	ht6jeq7	t3_s5g7ee	t1_ht6ekn7	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5g7ee/how_intelligible_is_church_slavonic_to_a_modern/ht6jeq7/

1nr4zcn4	In my school we were told the same pseudohistorical shit  about so-called "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact" and it's "secret protocol" where Soviet Union And Germany supposedly "divided spheres of influence in Europe". It's not viewed as something initially bad though, just annexing other countries' land.  Reality, though, was different. Baltic states underwent democratic revolutions and voluntarily joined the Union, Western Ukraine and Belarus were retaken by Red Army before Germans could reach them, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina were freed from Romanian occupation diplomatically. All these events strengthened Soviet Union - the main enemy of fascism, so thinking that they could struck a deal is an absolute stupidity. Not to mention that the "secret protocol" is such a blunt falsification that anyone can look at it themselves and see the the obvious.	1642519078.0	ht6o9db	t3_s6ymbc	t3_s6ymbc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ymbc/is_the_annexation_of_the_baltic_states_and/ht6o9db/

1z49bw33	Окей, не буду обижать, прошу прощения. Просто в свое время я мечтал о Сорбонне, а ходил в помойный университет.  А потом попал туда — увы, не студентом, и предсказуемо не преподом —  задержался, и начал охреневать: если половина студентов ко 2 курсу отсеивается без оглядки на *культурные особенности*, то даже плохо знающего свой предмет профа уволить невозможно, если он из *чумазых* — его защищают куча неписаных и негласных этических норм. При этом как преподаватели *чумазые* никуда не годятся — им просто неинтересно то, что выходит за рамки их зверьковой культуры, даже если их этому учили и это — их заработок. Отношение к любой науке, как к ремонту обуви.  Ну и так вышло, что в России я всю жизнь живу в многонациональной среде в самом плохом смысле этого слова, а проработал много лет среди академических коллег Desi, Central Asian и Middle Eastern бэкграунда, и этот опыт меня научил их ненавидеть так сильно, как я сам бы из мемчиков и статеек никогда бы не научился.   С точки зрения светской этики и common decency образ «чурбана в профессорской мантии» отлично иллюстрирует М.Э. Конурбаев — без иронии мировой эксперт по Библии короля Якова и средневековому английскому языку, который по простоте душевной ещё в начале нулевых раздавал интервью о том, как «он переродился и обрёл смысл жизни в исламе» и почему «жизненно необходимо дисциплинировать женщин с помощью телесных наказаний, лишь бы наказывал муж и палка не была толще, чем велит хадис ТУ-9054/K».	1642521031.0	ht6t96q	t3_s5g7ee	t1_ht6p4dc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5g7ee/how_intelligible_is_church_slavonic_to_a_modern/ht6t96q/

djcph	Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to provide any literature about this, but you can start researching by reading about Germany annexing Klaipeda region and how it was reacted to. Then Germany started pushing the Baltics, and they seemed ok with it. On May 22 1939 there was a pompous celebration in Riga commemorating Baltics being free from bolsheviks in 1919 by Germans, so it means they were already pretty pro-German. Non-Aggression pacts were signed, the one with Lithuania was signed on March 24 1939, 2 days after the annexation of said Klaipeda region, which is weird, because the aggression has already happened.     Also, you can read about Baltic states taking part in holocaust and about so called 'forest brothers'. They were fun guys.	1642521789.0	ht6v8pt	t3_s6ymbc	t1_ht6r7p7	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ymbc/is_the_annexation_of_the_baltic_states_and/ht6v8pt/

11uxyfnu	How's the relationship between WW2 Axis powers and the rest of the world these days? Or between people within countries that have had civil wars, like Spain or Russia? How much have Libya or Iraq been in the news lately compared to 20 years ago?   Meanwhile, there's never been a direct confrontation between Russia and USA, yet the only time tensions have gone down was when Russia was on the verge of collapse. Once it recovered - suddenly, it's a threat to the world again and everyone's supposed to hate it. If you'd rather not believe this animosity is manufactured, that's fine. But having witnessed the 80-90-2k roller coaster myself, it's pretty clear that today's tensions, no matter how high, would flame out just as quickly if either side faced existential crisis.  Don't mistake this for war advocacy, though. Starting a war is always worse than sorting things out diplomatically. What I'm saying is that current state of affairs has been cultivated to continue - as a pressure mechanism - not to end with a war.	1642522916.0	ht6y6ib	t3_s6s7tr	t1_ht62p02	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6s7tr/tell_me_why_there_wont_be_a_war/ht6y6ib/

djcph	I don't seem to find any info on this friendship treaty with USSR, even in English. Given how anti-Russian (and anti-Soviet) Baltic states were, I doubt there was any.  Taking care of Polish refugees? Lithuanians executed jews in huge numbers during the war, for example, in Kaunas, and contributed to Holocaust.

9pbfx36r	What do you mean by "check on him"? If you've hired a lawyer, the lawyer will tell you what detention facility he's in and how to write a letter. But, as far as I know, letters are accepted only in the Russian language (at least online). Telephone calls from pre-trial detention facilities are possible only upon a permission from the investigator; and I'm not even sure if international calls are possible at all. So it's easier just to call the lawyer from time to time, as they have direct access to the defendant.	1642524727.0	ht7307m	t3_s6x4ys	t3_s6x4ys	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6x4ys/i_have_a_friend_who_was_arrested_in_moscow_airport/ht7307m/

3o3pmwnp	I’m not Russian but American. I’m not going to sugarcoat this at all for you. Your friend is in an extremely serious situation. Very serious.    And the longer you wait to act the worse it gets.     You mentioned he hired an attorney? Did they hire an American attorney or one in Russia? Your friend needs someone who is licensed in Russia.     Also, I’d recommend you reach out to the American embassy for help. It may or may not help I can’t promise you anything but you should try. The embassy could likely negotiate with Russian authorities to arrange a call. If you call the embassy tell them of your friends asthma and any other medical problems. They will tell the Russian authorities.      He was visiting Russia so does he have family there? Have you contacted the family there to see if they can  hire a Russian attorney if he doesn’t have one.     Does he know the language? That’s important. I don’t know anything about the Russian legal system but he needs to know his rights under that system.     Do you know someone who knows both languages that could interpret for him if he doesn’t? If so give them a call.      Also, you may have the instinct to call the media and raise awareness of the case. DO NOT do that. Don’t even think about it. The US and Russia are geopolitical rivals and tensions are extremely high.     Both countries have a history of using arrested citizens of the other country as political leverage. If the press becomes aware of your friends case this increases the risk of that happening.     I’m praying for your friends safety I hope he comes home.	1642524938.0	ht73kx3	t3_s6x4ys	t1_ht69e1e	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6x4ys/i_have_a_friend_who_was_arrested_in_moscow_airport/ht73kx3/

t3gvp	Sorry, I'm not on in the joke. I only know Troy in Ancient Greece. I meant wars on the current territory of Russian Federation, last being Chechen War, except it didn't affect every single part of Russia, unlike WWII, which is why I called the latter total. But more generally, Russian army still participates in Syrian Civil War right now. So it all depends on what OP means by war.  Actually, I assume he meant open war with Ukraine, because that's what gets talked about in some media right now. But as that would probably lead to NATO intervention and war spilling out to RF territory, I seriously doubt that that would happen.	1642525454.0	ht74yv1	t3_s6s7tr	t1_ht6gg9t	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6s7tr/tell_me_why_there_wont_be_a_war/ht74yv1/

2dl4x23z	I worked for a passenger transport company in 2014-2021. In a city with a population of less than a million, but according to experts by the suburbs and migrants (they live in my city, but are registered in other places), the population is about a million.   The industry is in a difficult state for a variety of reasons.   1. Low fare due to low purchasing power. Until 2015-2016 (I don't remember exactly) in my city, the fare was set by the city administration. The city administration raised the fare only with the permission of the governor. And there was always a reason not to raise prices - so as not to increase social discontent. Now many routes have the right to set their own prices for travel, but still no one raises them without the permission of the administration.   At the same time, the cost of fuel and bus maintenance is growing faster than the price of travel.   2. The high cost of buses. High-capacity buses have not been updated in my city for about 15-20 years. They are too expensive and do not pay for themselves at a low fare. Medium and small capacity buses are being bought, but they are still very expensive in recent years.   3. High requirements for transport security. Installing equipment that should be legally so expensive that many owners of transport companies prefer to pay fines for its absence is cheaper. Regulatory authorities have the right to suspend the company's activities altogether for lack of equipment, but prefer to issue fines. Someday they will be given an order and they will start banning the activities of infringing companies.   4. Many owners created their companies in 1990-2000, when the passenger transportation market was wild, many rules did not apply, and they now do not understand why they now have to comply with something there (a stupid position, but it is so). Only local carrier companies travel in my city. And if a modern company from Moscow came here, with money for new transport, no local carrier would stand up to competition.   5. There is a huge shortage of driver workers in the passenger transportation industry. They are paid little, so they go to other industries. They pay little because the fare is low. Because there are not enough drivers, drivers work longer than allowed by law. This affects safety.   Because there are few drivers, they hire everyone, so the driving culture of bus drivers is very low.   6. Insurance. Each bus is insured twice - OSGOP (passenger insurance) and OSAGO (liability insurance). Without them, the bus should not travel on the road. For an insurance company, OSAGO insurance of a passenger company is unprofitable, because according to statistics, they pay insurance payments more than they receive profits. And that's why companies illegally refuse to issue OSAGO insurance. Despite the decisions of the courts and the supervisory authorities. It is also cheaper for them to pay a fine than to execute the decision. Every year there is a problem - where to insure. You have to pay bribes for the right to insure the bus.   7. Transportation is carried out on the basis of a contract with the city. The right to conclude a contract is played out at a competition. The contract is very strict, it is impossible to fulfill all its norms, for any violation the contract can be terminated. The city administration prefers not to terminate the contract for every violation, but to keep all your violations as a way to control you. these violations are taken out of the cloth as soon as you decide to sue the city administration (there are also a lot of violations on their part).   In general, the city administration is trying to make sure that nothing changes, it doesn't get worse. It is possible to do better, but this requires decisive measures to organize the transport network. there is no money in the city budget for this.  So far this is all I remember, I can answer the questions.	1642527359.0	ht7a56g	t3_rndb9g	t3_rndb9g	/r/AskARussian/comments/rndb9g/outside_of_moscow_and_st_petersburg_how_good_is/ht7a56g/

Putin concentrating on the military intimidation is not a helpful for Russian people. Operations in Crimea have had a big price - and it has alienated many friendly parties. If Russia wanted to "beat" US (or Europe), it would be through advancements in tech, science, arts, culture - not with Putin's power politics.	1642527487.0	ht7ahp9	t3_s6s7tr	t1_ht6y6ib	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6s7tr/tell_me_why_there_wont_be_a_war/ht7ahp9/

73gmo	I have a second hand experience on them, my grandfather was a soldier in Red/Soviet Army and participated in operations against guerillas in Baltic region. The stuff haunted him for the rest of his life. From his stories both guerillas and Soviet forces committed some horrible shit I'm not comfortable to talk even online. One of his stories I can relate, though.   My grandpa was in a group tracking down one of the "Forest Brothers", apparently, he was hiding in that one village. So grandpa gets an order to check the hayloft above the barn. He climbs the ladder and the first thing he sees is a barrel of a pistol pointing at him. The "brother" was there, and he had my grandfather in his sights. A stalemate. If my grandpa warns the others - he's going to be shot. If "brother" shoots - others from grandfather's unit would hear that and the "brother" is going to be caught or killed. They've stood in silence for several moments and after that my grandfather slowly climbed down the ladder. He could tell his superiors about the guy in the hayloft, but he didn't. He always wondered if that guy made it and how his life turned out.	1642529702.0	ht7glb9	t3_s6ymbc	t1_ht6wn2t	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ymbc/is_the_annexation_of_the_baltic_states_and/ht7glb9/

1z49bw33	У меня одноклассник из сферы STEM получал  doc и  postdoc, параллельно преподавая, в университетах Польши, Франции, Германии, Канады, а сейчас он профессор очень редких щей в Вене. Никаких жалоб на многонационалов, единственный прикол — с его слов, в McMaster University при нем была масса иранцев, которым аспирантуру на родине зарубили по причине, что специальная комиссия исламских богословов-правоведов нашла их диссертации противоречащими Корану: по физике квантовой и в подобных областях. Типа вот X — хороший, его интерпретация теории струн соответствует исламу, а Y — плохой, его работа — противоречит, до защиты не допущен. Этих отказников принимали с широкими объятиями в Канаде и быстро давали работу + возможность выучиться на doc и postdoc. Они были рады продолжать работать над тем, чем им не дали заниматься на родине.  В Humanities понакрест Европы тоже все более-менее ровно за исключением крупных университетов Франции, а никаких новостей из первых рук из Нового Света я на эту тему не получаю — только реддитские страшилки от «угнетенных белых геймеров», которые ставят на аватарку лягушонка Пепе и ныкаются от вакцин и chemtrails.  Да и не только в зарплатах там дело: сферы знания, выглядящие «лишними» в картине мира этих «людей» или чуждыми ей, при любой зарплате воспринимаются как навязанная тягость и что-то преходящее, нечистое. Они-то твёрдо знают, что их культура (подчеркнуть нужную из списка в 30+ позиций) — единственно правильная, а все остальные (не только европейцы, но и ближайшие соседи) — потешные выродки-еретики, которых боженька (подчеркнуть нужного) вот-вот тряпкой с доместосом с лица земли вытрет.  В плане культурного фашизма самые токсичные — выходцы с севера Индии, те самые индоарии (тамилы и прочие дравиды — в разы адекватнее и в курсе, что такое личные границы). Относительно миролюбивые и без намерений резать головы, но вот в мастерстве объяснять представителям других культур, почему те — говно и *вообще все* в жизни делают неправильно, с индусами не сравнится даже самый отпетый ваххабит. Между нами даже бытовала шутка, что если ты плохо покрасил *свой* забор — твой сосед-индус всю ночь будет из-за этого хвататься за сердце, а наутро придёт к тебе и пригрозит повеситься, если ты его не перекрасишь; причём состав новой краски и технику движения кисточкой он тебе уже в блокнотике набросал.  r/Samaj и r/Chodi — если до сих пор не забанены, то отличная витрина менталитета	1642530203.0	ht7hycl	t3_s5g7ee	t1_ht7d30d	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5g7ee/how_intelligible_is_church_slavonic_to_a_modern/ht7hycl/

2yeme168	Lol buddy why you butthurt all of a sudden  It just so happens that I am one of those who do study German, along with a few other languages, which allows me to say that German doesn’t actually sound like what is commonly portrayed in Russian movies, and German people don’t go around repeating „Ja, ja, fantastisch“ and „natürlich“ or „Hände hoch“ and „Hitler kaputt“  Back in the early 00’s I saw a TV program dedicated to that very issue, where people were offered sound clips and asked what language do they hear. German, Dutch, Swedish were all commonly mixed up, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese sounded alike, and I think there weren’t a single person able to tell apart Chinese, Japanese and Korean  It’s normal for people to be ignorant about foreign languages, especially of the countries that are not their neighbors, and German, like I mentioned, is not a popular study choice, so I wouldn’t expect that many people to be able to tell a passer-by’s nationality just by hearing a few words	1642530685.0	ht7j98t	t3_s6btdx	t1_ht700i1	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6btdx/will_i_get_critized_when_i_visit_russias_victory/ht7j98t/

Moreover, there is counterfeit vodka that consists of methylated spirits, so you can easily die from it.  But Russian Standard should be OK. Judging by some online reviews in Russian, it seems quite a good vodka for its price.

I've filled papers of transferring to YOTA because their tariffs were cheaper and provided a slightly faster connection, 2 days later a MTS operator called me and offered that tariff, i was in doubt, but i couldn't resist, it was too cheap.

3voewa0k	The myth about AK being a ripoff of StG44 is an old one. It has been debunked years ago - and you would have known this if you had more than passing interest in this issue.  FYI, AK is AK, and AK-47 was a pre-production model that never went into service. There was AK, then AKM - none of these descended from the StG44. Visual resemblance is superficial, and the idea of an intermediate energy cartridge for n assault rifle dates back to 1916 Fedorov's model that used Arisaka cartridge.  So don't be surprised about downvotes - obvious fakes get them often.	1642534381.0	ht7t8xn	t3_s6f1l5	t1_ht7880q	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6f1l5/what_was_kalashnikov_referring_in_this_etching/ht7t8xn/

e8x2y	It's not really liberal if they do ban people for their views. In my opinion people should be banned if they behave bad and don't follow the rules of the sub. It would be fair to get a warning first also  Yeah, the diverse sub is here, that's great. But aren't you worried that people who are curious about Russia will go to r/russia, and then meet a quite different kind of community than they would if they went to Russia.   Also, in my opinion, a lot (not everything) of the upvotet content about russophobia is so much, so weird and just political. Of course I come from a different background and everything and I might see things a bit different than Russians. But I do live in Russia and I'm definitely not Russophobic. But if I would only read r/russia, maybe I would be.  So I'm afraid it's just bad for Russia (depends on the goal of course) and the russophobia in reddit.  I'd rather see another sub being like that and that this sub would be under the name r/russia	1642535357.0	ht7vwc8	t3_s71b4g	t1_ht7omrk	/r/AskARussian/comments/s71b4g/russian_friends_what_is_your_opinion_on_rrussia/ht7vwc8/

There's enough money accumulated in National Funds. They are used by Putin's crooked friends for corrupted projects that are overpriced and used to steal money.

You'll be surprised, but small business share in total taxes ain't that big, only about 3-5%. This hole can easily be patched.   > Remind me, how much EU donations Poland received since joining? ..when injections will eventually stop  Don't be jealous. Poland received money from EU budget and will receive more money, because that's how EU system works. Countries with weaker economies receive money and investment, until they economy reach average EU level. So, until Poland will be on level of Germany and France they will continue to receive money and this injection won't stop in near future.

bci24ojc	**[Polyamory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory)**     >Polyamory (from Greek πολύ poly, "many", and Latin amor, "love") is the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners involved. People who identify as polyamorous may believe in open relationships with a conscious management of jealousy and reject the view that sexual and relational exclusivity are necessary for deep, committed, long-term, loving relationships. Others prefer to restrict their sexual activity to only members of the group, a closed polyamorous relationship which is usually referred to as polyfidelity.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642590742.0	htaz3pf	t3_s7l7t5	t1_htaz2sh	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7l7t5/is_it_true_that_this_what_yall_think_of_europe/htaz3pf/

1z49bw33	Прежде чем подбирать контактные линзы, обязательно гуглить «неоваскуляризация» и как этого избежать. Если носить линзы дольше N часов в сутки (причём очень сильно зависит от индивидуальной реакции организма) из-за недостатка кислорода роговица покроется новыми кровеносными сосудами, и может закончиться тем, что они прорастут поверх зрачка. А кто-то сутками ходит, не снимая, и с ним ничего не происходит.  http://www.reginaoptics.com/blog/gipoksiya-i-neovaskulyarizaciya-rogovicy  Ещё важный минус — если глаз суховат, линза может провалиться глубоко за верхнее веко (или приклеиться к нему) и тебя ждёт такое увлекательное занятие, как ковыряние пинцетом под веком глубоко в орбите глаза (если не удалось её выгнать наружу бешеным вращением глаз). Мой рекорд — 2,5 часа тыкания пинцетом (пластмассовым) под верхнее веко, чтобы подхватить краешек линзы, сложившейся пополам и провалившейся глубоко за глаз. Для профилактики не следует линзы надевать раньше, чем через час после пробуждения (глаза должны быть хорошо увлажненными, потому что линза плавает ровно посередине глаза за счёт сил поверхностного натяжения плёнки из влаги в глазу, а к сухому глазу или веку линза приклеивается вообще в любом месте).  Если глаз достаточно влажный, немного сбившаяся с места линза сама начнет ползти обратно на место — пока не встанет напротив зрачка. Да и сдвинуть линзу с центра достаточно увлажненного глаза можно лишь с определённым усилием.  Для снятия линз необходимо буквально щипать себя за глазное яблоко — этому первое время будут очень сильно мешать рефлексы.  Перед снятием или установкой линз руки нужно мыть, как моет хирург, и вытирать практически стерильным отдельным полотенцем.  Ну вот собственно и все подводные камни.  Большой плюс — глаз в линзе не испытывает дискомфорта под сильным ветром, снегом прямо в глаза, врезавшаяся прямо в глаз мошка не нанесёт травмы, ну и прочие неприятные воздействия в линзах гораздо легче переносятся.	1642592499.0	htb1l6p	t3_s70n3i	t1_ht6wvc5	/r/AskARussian/comments/s70n3i/do_all_russians_have_good_eyesight/htb1l6p/

I don't think Timothy Snyder had a special purpose grant for investigating materials that formed basis for his book Bloodlands. The original claim was that NATO countries are stifling historical research and this is the only reason why nobody knows Forest Brothers were Nazi, but Timothy Snyder for example makes a point of being critical of UPA, hardly a convenient thing for the cackling villains at NATO headquarters situated on mount doom.	1642596345.0	htb7ram	t3_s6ymbc	t1_htb4ve6	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ymbc/is_the_annexation_of_the_baltic_states_and/htb7ram/

He has worked continually since the late 1980s to compile "Books of Remembrance" for Karelia, listing all the names of those executed there.

4mjrqia	Until about 10 years ago the rules said that "кофе" is masculine, however its ending "-е" always implied neuter gender. Then there was something like a mini-reform of the language that, among other things, said that both masculine and neuter are correct.  Some people insists that it's "dumbing down" etc, but they're mostly grammarnazi and similar.  I personally mostly continue to use it as masculine simply out of habit. IMO it should be neuter because it looks like one, stick with the old rules snd consequently creating exceptions in the language out of love for the days of yore (Pushkin wrote like this!!1!1!) is stupid.  P.S.  "метро" (metro, subway) used to be masculine too (because it's a contraction from "метрополитен").	1642597278.0	htb9g6h	t3_s7ozet	t1_htb7y9d	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7ozet/do_you_personally_see_кофе_as_a_masculine_or/htb9g6h/

So that you can imagine how far it is, imagine the distance of your country from the Dominican Republic. Next, I will tell you how Finns are represented in a Russian joke.

Neeeexxxttt ssstttooooppp... - hhhheeeeereee  iiiiiissss!"  "In the Helsinki casino "Ray " stripper fell asleep on a pole!"  They are very drinkers:  "In St. Petersburg, a photo contest on the theme "Gulf of Finland" was won by a photo depicting a Finn standing on Nevsky Prospekt and drinking vodka from a bottle."  They are cold-resistant:  " At −10° Celsius, the heat is switched on in British homes, while Finns change into a long-sleeved shirt. At −20°, Austrians fly to Málaga, while Finns celebrate midsummer. At −200°, hell freezes over and Finland wins the Eurovision Song Contest. (This joke predates the event, previously deemed impossible, of Finland winning the contest, which happened in 2006.) At −273°, absolute zero temperature is reached, and all atomic movement ceases. The Finns shrug and say: "Perkele, a bit chilly today, isn't it?".  Stubborn, devoid of a sense of humor, silent. In everyday life there is such a term "hot Finn". No, it's not because he's hot, it has an ironic essence to emphasize the lateness and lack of temperament:	1642598768.0	htbcad7	t3_s7p8jt	t3_s7p8jt	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7p8jt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_finland/htbcad7/

No rush or overtimes. Feel yourself quite secure, - Good infrastructure and equipment at work. I used to get a new laptop and all I needed regularly. With specs I wanted, - Easy to rent anything: flat, trailer or even fork lift - Coworkers are helpful and very open minded, - No management overhead. Less red-taped processes or may be not mature enough,  Cons: - Taking people in and out is quite a normal process. For 5 years there were 5-6 YT (negotiations) when many people got fired. After a while new people came. Repeat. Quite frustrating to see that good people replaced by others who really don't know much, - Expensive labor cost. One guy in Finland in ICT costs as 4 guys in India, - High taxes, - Healthcare is not that well, but there are some exceptions, - Many migrants who doesn't work, willing to work and they seems to me have more chances than guy like me who never received unemployment benefits and paid taxes from day 1, - Young generation looks really arrogant and impudent and nobody is trying to educate them, - Education process is quite formal and planned badly. I attended language courses and my wife some professional courses. It looks always the same, - To hard to find professional builder/technician/medic. - Small labor market, - Planning is quite a vague.

There are plenty of positions in the government which don't require to voice any opinion but hold enough power to push for one.

I had a pretty minor rank in the government, but I can say that I saved a forest by trimming down some quarterly reports into becoming an annual one and laid out a foundation for a federal law reform in my field of competence (I've wrote the reform, then it was sent to Moscow where juridical and financial experts finished it by adding dates when specific parts of it would become active).	1642600544.0	htbfysi	t3_s7ppit	t3_s7ppit	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7ppit/have_you_ever_considered_running_for_political/htbfysi/

The competences defined by the treaties of the EU, do not define any military competences to the EU institutions and there is no legal framework at the moment in the treaties to create a EU army.   In fact, the EU army question has been up to debate almost a decade now, as we want less dependency from NATO and we need a cohesive policy for all the EU Member States.   It is a question that will be probably be answered when the Treaty of Lisbon is modified, and as we gradually move towards federalisation of the Union.	1642601688.0	htbih8g	t3_s7p8jt	t1_htbhbum	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7p8jt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_finland/htbih8g/

awy1j	Насчёт роликов в Тиктоке хз, не смотрю. Насчёт популярности ВВП зарубежом, здесь довольно легко:  1. Как написано в статье - он занимает более прагматичную позицию, причём открыто, это касается в том числе и отношения к "новой этике" и прочим "прогрессивизмам". Я не говорю про то что это плохо или хорошо, но эти темы занимают важную часть жизни и поддерживаются большим количеством людей.  2. Россия занимает довольно видное место с точки зрения истории, да и в информационном поле часто мелькает, поэтому и возникает интерес к главной персоне. Особенно это усиливает прошлая закрытость СССР, из-за чего многим может быть интересно кто такие русские, как они живут, как на них влияет коммунизм, и прочее.  3. Также здесь можно отметить заметное развитие (или изменение~~(для либералов)~~) страны, которые легче заметны именно в развивающихся странах нежели в уже развитых. И это тоже привлекается внимание к персоне.  4. Учитывая предыдущие пункты и понимая что Россия хоть и не входит в топ развитых стран, но умудряется бросать им вызов, а подобные выпады со стороны более слабых на более сильных всегда привлекали внимание, особенно это можно заметить в спорте.  Правда статья написана довольно странно, как будто под заказ, слишком сильно вылизывают.	1642602406.0	htbk44k	t3_s7pgfa	t3_s7pgfa	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7pgfa/почему_ролики_в_тиктоке_с_путиным_стали_такими/htbk44k/

62el3dhz	Exactly, but that EU “mutual defence” can mean a lot of whole things. Let’s say Finland is invaded, will Portugal help because it is in the opposite side of the EU? Probably not, because France and Germany are stronger, and Estonia and Sweden are closer.  The CSDP has itw own deficiencies, and exactly because of that there is a talk about the EU army creation; as the CSDP provides the framework for joint operations and interventions. In the same Wikipedia article you quote, it states that the CSDP provides framework through to carry out military missions defined by the article 42.3 of the TEU; and there is probably like 10 different missions, with different participating countries in each mission. In practice, it means the EU as a whole does not have framework to unite all its Member States forces, let’s say in case of an invasion. The competences defined by the TFEU state no military competences, and under shared competences between the EU and Member States in the article 4. (j) vaguely states “area of freedom, security, and justice” which is where the CSDP falls under with some countries actually opting-out of the military operations carried out under the CSDP.   It is extremely complex to manage a union of 27 different countries, and even though there is a framework for joint military exercices and operations, there is absolutely no framework to “what are we going to do in case we are invaded”. The treaties exist for a reason, so there can be a gradual change in how institutions work and operate, and at the moment we are slowly moving towards a federalised EU. A federal EU that will probably exist within the next 50-100 years cannot be left defenceless, but by that time we won’t be exacly an “union” like we are right now.	1642604807.0	htbptkf	t3_s7p8jt	t1_htbjgwt	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7p8jt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_finland/htbptkf/

It has been in talks for almost a decade now, and it is becoming a more concerning issue, especially because the EU countries alone are irrelevant in the scene between the US and China. And there is a growing sentiment that neither can be trusted. Therefore, we all must come together. Just wait for the update of Treaty of Lisbon and you’ll see some sort of first version of the EU army in there, together with a less bureaucratic representation institutions (like the Parliament, the Commission, or the Council of the EU) which will mean a step forwards federalisation of the Union.	1642605062.0	htbqg8c	t3_s7p8jt	t1_htbjcag	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7p8jt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_finland/htbqg8c/

2cpox0re	I don't support this style of coping with nationalistic underground, however that's exactly how the Ukraine should have gotten rid of Strelkov and his friends when they were igniting the war in Donbass. However, as in the other thread of this topic someone calling himself Patriotic Neocon, the Ukraine felt obliged to be fully provoked and decided to unfold a full fledged military operation against the Donbass despite of any possible casualties. You might not know this - i don't know where you are living - but the Central Ukrainian residents -the most noisy ones - feel the pure hatred towards the miners and the majority residents of Donbass, calling them subhumans and Russian slaves and Down syndrome patients etc. They felt very free to send there the troops! The military grade troopers, not police or small killer squads - troops with tanks and planes and bombs. Unlike Russia in Crimea, the Ukraine were considering these lands occupied by the aliens since Soviet times! They say the Soviets brought the subhuman workers to those mines to replace the true Ukrainians during the forced industrialization.

3g1jmfsq	Strelkov and his friends were putting up barricades, robbing armory stores, and manning the streets with armed men. Police stations were taken over by special forces-grade troops, like in Kramatorsk. At the scale of things Ukraine was dealing with, deployment of some military troops is not crazy.   They didn't come to just wholesale kill Russians anyway - many of the troops are no doubt Russians, and in fact Poroshenko and Turchynov (and of course Zelensky) are themselves native Russian speakers. I think your perceptions about how Ukrainians just hate Russians and want to murder them do not align with these facts, but also when you consider that no violence occured in places where Strelkov and his men didn't come to first. There's been no real violence or anything in Kharkiv.  The thing only became a matter of artillery bombardments and sieges after the "separatists" themselves began using heavy equipment (supplied by Russian Federation) and boosted their numbers to thousands. But there's no mass graves or anything like it, which should by itself display to you it was never some kind of ethnic cleansing war, despite lies of Russian television.  They could have also been already defeated in summer 2014, but then Russian army intervened with mass bombardments and deployment of regular army units, like the tank regiment Dorzhi Batomunkuyev served in, like troops of 76th Guards Air Assault Division.	1642606069.0	htbswvd	t3_s7p8jt	t1_htbr37p	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7p8jt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_finland/htbswvd/

62el3dhz	Of course there is no legal opt-out of the mutual defense clause based on geographic distance, but that there is no definition what mutual defense is and how will it be carried out in case of an invasion. And I gave the example of Finland just because it was easier and Portugal is in the opposite side of the continent. What would happen in case Greece is invaded by Turkey taking into account they are both inside NATO and only one within the EU? A complete shitshow. There is no legal framework for this kind of cases because there is common EU army.   And it is pretty to say that all the other EU Member States shall assist other but still, that doesn’t establish a framework. For example, when there is natural disasters generally other Member States also help, some with aid, some with human resources, some with money, etc. That quote might mean assistance in all the forms I just mentioned, it still doesn’t mean all the 27 countries will unite forces in the same way to defend. Hence, where the CSDP lacks and why each EU country still maintains their national armies.  No where, I mentioned “anti-Russian” exactly because of that. Firstly because my involvement within European institutions and European politicians made me believe it is not “anti-Russian” but “against policies carried out by the Russian government”; and secondly because my original comment was to point out NATO is a military alliance, whilst the EU is an economic and political union which main aims are to ensure peace in the continent through integration of its Member States’ politics and economies through freedom of movement of people, goods, and services. The “anti-Russian” sentiment, whatever it might be for every person, depends highly from country to country within the EU, with more peripheral countries like Portugal or Spain almost not giving a single shit about Russia.

syrj3	ha a similar situation to myself and my girlfriend, shes doing her PhD in Mexico, so I'm planning to move over there, before transferring back here, with plans to live in Geelong (She loves beaches, and a lot of my family live there)     Now as your partner lives here that alone is good enough justification for you to gain entry under normal times, however with boarder closures likely will be rejected (one loophole is if you are in a de facto relationship, which is largely determined by if at any point you have lived together for about 2 years, if which case you could likely apply now and gain entry)     Now as for unskilled work, typically on an unskilled work visa there are limitations to how much you can work, and it gets pretty complicated:     So first, is if you are from certain countries with agreements for working rights, since  I assume you are Russian and they are not on the list, you can likely ignore this unless you have duel citizenship with one of these countries:   Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Cyprus, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Argentina, Bangladesh, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Poland, Turkey, Thailand, Uruguay, United States     Now if not one of those countries it gets a little harder     first would be Temporary Skill Shortage visa, I'm not sure what counts there, but the two that I know have been in the media for shortages lately are truck drivers and farm workers   [https://www.immigrationdirect.com.au/work-visa/482-visa.html](https://www.immigrationdirect.com.au/work-visa/482-visa.html)     Another method is to have a employer nominate you (again fields with a shortage are the best for this like farms, mining or transport) but be aware this is for regional areas only all major cities are not included, and I am not sure if geelong counts (but if not there are areas that count very close by)     [https://www.immigrationdirect.com.au/sponsored-migration-187.html](https://www.immigrationdirect.com.au/sponsored-migration-187.html)     Than you can also consider getting a student visa (I don't personally recommend this, because as an international student fees are much higher) but due to shortages and demand from universities the government is offering some fee reduction to help entice overseas students and workers back     [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-19/backpackers-internatonal-students-visa-fee-rebate-covid-workers/100765716](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-19/backpackers-internatonal-students-visa-fee-rebate-covid-workers/100765716)     now as for fruit picking in particular, they are a major visa sponcer [https://www.fruitpickingjobs.com.au/visas/](https://www.fruitpickingjobs.com.au/visas/)     now finally I recommend this (since its an actual government website unlike most of the others I have given) Particularly "Regional migration", "Temporary work visas" and "Short stay work visas" as they will likely be most applicable but student visa is also an option (one trick many people do is apply for uni, live with partner, than apply for de facto relationship residency status and drop the uni after two years, its not a cheap way to go, but it is another option)     [https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia)     Good luck	1642606488.0	htbtyk8	t3_s4ruim	t1_ht83xw0	/r/AskARussian/comments/s4ruim/is_it_hard_to_get_a_visit_visa_to_enter_to/htbtyk8/

2cpox0re	>I think your perceptions about how Ukrainians just hate Russians and want to murder them do not align with these facts  I was describing their attitude towards the residents of Donbass, not towards the Russian speakers. Note that i wasn't blaming the West Ukrainian village people. The most noisy are the Dnieper people, Russian speakers themselves, and other Central ukrainian. It's them who want to look holier than thou.  Strelkov should have been neutralised before Slaviansk and Kramatorsk. They did something similar in Kharkov, was easy. Though Kharkov is not the subhuman Downbass.

2cpox0re	Ukrainians are Russians.  As such, they are allowed to do whatever the fuck they want to do. Build a nation, enter the EU, enter NATO, join Russia, build democracy or cleptocracy if they're dumb enough. Same applies to the regular Russians (ourselves). Except killing other Russians. The war was started by the people that believed that these were two separate peoples, "like the French and the Germans", that's why they thought it was something heroical to kill some Banderists or whatever. After the war was started, the first rule was broken: different types of the Russians started being killed.  And the same kind of people prevent the war from being stopped. They name it an alien invasion. This is so tragic. We have to be one.

12poiq	Okay, let's go, top to bottom:  Magma/Iceland - plausible. I would put Cod before magma, but magma is fine. Not a lot of connections between our countries, so no strong association.  Arctic Imperialists/Norway - complete nonsence. Skiing is what unites Russia and Norway.  Group Sex/Sweden - That may stay. However IKEA or "Vikings" would also fit.  Bunch of whiners/Finland - nonsence. Alcotourists would fit much better. Alcotourism from Finland to Russia was very common in the 90s. Now it's probably reverse.  Drunks/Ireland - debatable but nonsence imo. We don't have much contact with Irish people to note their alcoholism (like of finns). I would call it "That green thing".  Abramovich/UK - complete nonsence. They take the "Bunch of whiners" from Finland.  Vikings/Denmark - That may stay, probably. I don't have any strong prejudices against Denmark.  Chauvinists/Baltics - nonsence. These should take the "Fearmongers" from Poland.  Waffles/Belgium - meh. Belgian waffles are rather little known here. Sugnificantly less than belgian football team or the fact that top EU governing bodies are headquatered in Belgium.  Tulips/Netherlands - accurate  Baptized Nazis-Poker loss/Germany - bullshit. We don't distinct East from West Germany as it's a single country for more than a lot of us live. Car makers are what define Germany.  Fearmongers/Poland - I would debate universally negative depiction of Poland, we have quite a lot in common. However they seem to do fear our foreign politics, but to much lesser extent than baltic countries.  Frankenstein/Belarus - Nonsence. I have nothing but "Bros" for Belarus  Fashion Victims/France - close but no. France is most known for cuisine, we call them "Frog eaters".  Wackos/Czechia - that is a miss. Beer brewers, that's what they are.  Former Czechs/Slovakia - Accurate.  Personality disorder and Southern Russia/Ukraine - No comment.  Benfica/Portugal - Nonsense, this was probably picked because Portugal is far enough to not have a lot of connections with russia, so we don't have strong opinion on Portugal. It's just yet another country that should have been Spain long ago, but somehow is not. It may also share "N.A." with Slovenia.  Don Quixote/Spain - funny, that may stay. However Spain is real estate, probably to more extent than Greece.  Banks/Switzerland - accurate  Shopping Center/Italy - accurate, but also a tourist destination. And Mafia. And second residence of our most vocal patriots.  Pastry/Austria - Accurate.  N.A./Slovenia - accurate  Party Stop/Croatia - accurate. And now also a vaccination centre. This is where Russians can go to have a jab of EU-approved covid vaccines, while politicians debate Sputink.  Butchery/Bosnia - accurate  Grand Children/Serbia - that sounds a little condescending, Serbia shares "Bros" with Belarus.  Moldova/Romania - come on. No sane person would think about making Romania Moldova. Gypsies is what defines Romania here.   Barren/Moldova - bullshit. Moldova has always been the wineyard of the USSR, so wineyard it is.  Cousins/Transnistria(I guess) - debatable.  Mafia/Montenegro - what? Montenegro is clearly Real estate and nothing else.  No Man's land/Albania - idk, maybe  Lakes/North Macedonia - no, definitely not. Just calling it "Macedonia" would be enough.  Real Estate/Greece - there is some, but Greece is mostly known for cheese and olives. So cheese and olives it is.  Cheap booze/Bulgaria - sorry, what? Bulgaria is associated with a lot of things, cheap booze is not one of them. For me Bulgaria would be yet another Real Estate.   Tourist colony/Turkey - accurate  Brothers and sisters/Abkhazia and South Ossetia - that is more or less accurate only to South Ossetia, Abkhazia is where clementines come from.  Arsonists/Georgia - What? Georgia is another wineyard of the USSR, now also adds as a tourist colony, to much lesser extent.	1642617785.0	htcnyc8	t3_s7l7t5	t3_s7l7t5	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7l7t5/is_it_true_that_this_what_yall_think_of_europe/htcnyc8/

I'm a non native English speaker, we use the equivalent of the word "poor" like in "poor thing", something petty or pityful.   However if to be nosey, they command Poland like their subsidiary solely because they're economically poorer then the US, and thus dependent upon them, and their military decisions. They feed Poland and it's politicians because they need to contain Russia.

Either way, why would you only send 15% of your military to invade and entire country? Seems like poor planning to me. It wouldn’t make logical sense for them to invade with their current troop setup.   It’s all “yearly training” which has been done since 2014, and no one has invaded any of the times it’s previously occurred.	1642618535.0	htcq0cq	t3_s7uppw	t1_htcmfhn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htcq0cq/

yxyno	Do you mean the lands that belonged to the Russian Empire a century before Finland was even created?        The winter war happened as a result of Finland allying with nazi Germany. Not to mention that USSR tried to solve the issue with Leningrad protection diplomatically.        And no, Russia didn't "demand" that you won't join NATO. The only thing Russia states is that it'll react to it. Like, of course, it would. Moreover, literally every time, Russia notes that it values the independence and neutrality of Finland. I guess, unlike your government.        Soviet military base? Do you mean the one USSR rented and closed in the '50s as a showing of goodwill?        Influencing your policy? A big neighbor would always influence the policy of every country. That doesn't mean that Russia tells you what to do.        As far as I can see, even according to Finland, all airspace violations are minor intersections of far ilands when Russian planes conduct pre-declared flights. Nothing like Russia trying to intimidate Finland with its military capabilities. To be clear, I don't justify it. Every such incident is a fuck up from our military. I just don't see them as intentional ones.        As far as I can see, your recent history is following the steps of baltic states.

i7lavsor	Thank you for this answer. I understand some of your arguments here, especially the one regarding Crimeans and self-identification etc. However, the process of making Crimea russian again was kind of suspicious… Lots of armed personell without any identification(?) and then of course the election afterwards… Anyway… that aside…   Do you not contradict yourself here? In one way you say Russia can do whatever it wants with its own troops in its own country. And that this is not provocative. But at the same time you say Ukraine cant do what it wants(?) - it surely cant join nato because rockets and stuff would represent a treath to Russia. But why can Russia place large amounts of troops at the border without being provocative, while Ukraine cannot arm themselfes and be part of an alliance? Also, why does NATO represent a treath to Russia as long as it exists? Noone has interest in invading Russia. European nations part of NATO are part of NATO because they would be unable to defend against a superpower like Russia without it. It is not because countries like Norway or Finland, or Germany or Ukraine wants to invade Russia…	1642620979.0	htcwla4	t3_s7uppw	t1_htcusfq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htcwla4/

pf87gd6	1. Justification of NATO existence. Every nato member should pay 2% of its gdp to USA. On top of that - hiring instructors, buying spare parts for the standardized equipment. 2. Capitalism, ho. Nobody likes the competition, so it's better to kill them when they are small. This propaganda damages Russia. Directly by sanctions, indirectly by scaring off investors from our markets (like over last 2 months our stock exchange market lost \~30% of value because western investors panic sold stocks scared by the talks about new sanctions) 3. USA, thanks to fracking, became gas and oil exporter. As you can see, as a result of Ukrainian coup, USA gained control over Ukrainian gas transport system which transfers Russian gas to Europe (Hunter Biden& Burisma, Yep, son of the US president. Coincidence, probably). And it simultaneously tries to block Nord Stream. So, USA is eyeing possibility to overtake over Russian market share of gas and oil export. You see, piping is cheaper than liquefying gas and then sending tankers over the ocean. Because Evergreen can happen. So, "Russia is bad, ban their goods".	1642621157.0	htcx2pj	t3_s7uppw	t1_htcp56b	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htcx2pj/

hiyxp	So in other words, what you're saying is that all these thousands of historians specializing in WW2, all these researchers who dedicated their lives to studying the past, who spent years learning how to properly handle the sources, how to escape bias and how to use "logic and facts" (you know, that's what gets you fancy "special certificates"), all of these people are just liars. Liars hired by the international burgeoisie in order to stain the good name of the Soviet Union and cover up the truth.   And the only people who can see through the tenets of burgeois lies, the only honest people in the entire world, are random bloggers such as Kungurov, who just by pure coincidence happen to be rabid Stalinists. And then of course the corrupt imperialist government tries to silence them because they're afraid of the truth getting out and the sheeple finally rising up.  And none of that is a conspiracy theory, right.	1642621337.0	htcxkak	t3_s6ymbc	t1_htcg4k1	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ymbc/is_the_annexation_of_the_baltic_states_and/htcxkak/

3mchalyr	The sense of a democracy is to be able to select a ruler. But more it is   a possibility to get rid of a bad ruler.    There is no guarantee, that a ruler after 20 years is better than after   5 years. What I miss in countries from Belarus to Kazakhstan, there is no   regular or guaranteed or lawful change of power. this is a base for a peaceful   change. And more, these rulers don’t like capable politicians around them. This   makes the succession more difficult.    The long-range thinking should or must have be the continuity without   fight for the power. Nazarbayev seems to be quit clever in keeping his power.   Still the end is not free or trouble. I just wanted to write about the art of   governing with the aim to achieve continuity.	1642621776.0	htcyqqi	t3_s1sfm9	t3_s1sfm9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/htcyqqi/

You simply do not invade the nation that has the largest number of nuclear warheads…  But for some reason, the Americans were very excited when the USSR placed missiles in Cuba.

There are many examples of NATO forces invading other countries over the last several decades. It’s even been proven to be done under false pretenses. But the idea of annexation is not often seen in the modern world. In fact I can only think of 1 other country, and the international community considers this unacceptable. I would still like to know how the Russian media is reporting on the crisis.	1642622252.0	htd01bk	t3_s7uppw	t1_htcusfq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htd01bk/

The nearly empty country was filled with Russian speaking people. Now the Ukrainian insist on clainming back some parts of the country. You loose, you win, the other party the other way round.   I was in Ukraine som eyears ago, there are people who regard themselfs als Russian speaking Unkrainian citizens. I cannot imagine in Kiew sombody complains, he is speaking Russian - on the street.

awy1j	The days of trafficking women are over, and it is inappropriate to ask such questions today, especially in the 20th and 21st centuries, when nationalism was at its height.  To answer your question: there are not many religious people in Russia, and of those who are, they are most likely already engaged or looking for those who are close to their faith. The only chance you have is with people who are new to the faith.   Talk to temple workers, see if they can tell you where the local parties are.	1642624785.0	htd6vm2	t3_s7zirx	t3_s7zirx	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7zirx/are_russian_orthodox_christian_women_good_house/htd6vm2/

3tsc2g79	Про [Елбаева](https://youtube.com/c/yelbayev) полностью согласен: даже если не учитывать отсутствие политики на канале, его контент значительно интересней. Правда, выходит он редко, но это издержки работы урбанистом.   Попытки Варламова лезть в политику понятны, но, как мне кажется, не очень удачны. У того же [Максима Каца](https://youtube.com/c/maxkatz1) (ваше мнение о нём как о политике может быть каким угодно, но околополитический блогер он неплохой) и тем более [Екатерины Шульман](https://youtube.com/channel/UCL1rJ0ROIw9V1qFeIN0ZTZQ) это получается значительно лучше.

My point being, i find many sources wondering why Putin might be actually doing it, but no sources actually doubting weather the troops movements are real or not.

3f2o9oua	That's, probably, a bad idea. Temple workers wouldn't help a foreigner to find a wife amongst parish.   Usually, in Orthodox communities marriages are arranged inside such groups.  Even though Catholic church and Orthodox church are Christians it's very unlikely that such a union will be approved by a reverend father or girl's parents (considering the fact that likely a religious girl comes from a religious family).  From my experience, a religious women tend to choose an appropriate partner from men who share their religion.  What you need is just a "decent" ( in your understanding) girl.

You can't go up to an Israeli and a Palestinian and say "make peace and don't fight anymore" unless you point a big gun at them (and another question is who should point that gun?). You are right about one thing, there will be no war here, it will simply not be beneficial to anyone except the West.	1642626266.0	htdax65	t3_s7uppw	t1_htcosju	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htdax65/

You come across as extremely naive, which is why people think you might be a troll.  That is absolutely not true about you being able to receive their "mass" or "communion" (Orthodox don't even call it that, btw.) Anyone can attend an Orthodox liturgy, but Catholics (or any non-Orthodox) are **not allowed** to receive the sacraments in Orthodox churches.

The Ukrainians will not go down easily. Their hate for you is as strong as yours for them. You’d be surprised how capable a country is in a war when they don’t wanna be taken over. I’m not saying they will win by themselves cause they won’t. But they will put up one hell of a fight and take as many of you down with them as possible. Sure you have nukes but you’re not gonna use them. That would definitely make the US and it’s allies retaliate and next thing you know it’s ww3.	1642630530.0	htdmlf9	t3_s81nff	t1_htdl74t	/r/AskARussian/comments/s81nff/serious_question_for_you_do_you_guys_actually/htdmlf9/

One pretty much moved on imidietly when Maidan started. He worked at logistics in truckers company and smelled the shit from miles away. Second thought, was a single provider for his wife, 2 kids and 2 elderly women. He couldn't just left on a vim. When shit hits the fan, and swastika flashing Ukrainian patriots started shelling residential arias of Lugansk, he was forced to evacuate at rural area, where we lost contact for almost a year. In March 2015, me and other clanmate, took two cars and went to search him out. Took us two weeks to find him and made it back. Does it makes me invader? An aggressor? Do I, Russian scum, also deserve death, as they claim? Because bombing your political opposition is perfectly valid course of action, according to nowadays media.

nyr4w	I'm in Donetsk, and most people here do indeed support Russia and would like to join it. To get a full objective picture we would need to hold an internationally recognised vote, but Ukraine is refusing to it, so any vote would just be seen as illegitimate by the world. Nobody wants an invasion, or any war, of course. Unfortunately, the issues of "Ukraine wants to join NATO and put missiles 400 km from Moscow" and "there are about five million people who want to separate from Ukraine and potentially join Russia, or not, its not actually your business what we want to do with our independence" are being clumped together, and ideally they shouldn't be. Diplomacy has been a resounding failure on the second issue for years now, and now suddenly there's the first one too.  The problem is that on the outside, as well as for Ukraine, it's a matter of land, not people. Nobody cares what the people want, nobody bothers to ask. Ukraine has ruled out pretty much any negotiation on any issue right from the start. Originally, in March 2014, people protested demanding autonomy, not independence. Ukraine simply said "no, end of discussion". And by Ukraine I mean the leaders that had been installed by an angry mob with literal torches just days earlier.   You mentioned Russian speakers, and just for reference, their share is close to 100% here. You can hear some Ukrainian in rural areas mostly, but even there it's not prevalent. Language has always been a point of contention in Ukraine, which refuses to give Russian any rights, even in regions where it's spoken exclusively. In Russia, on the contrary, autonomous republics have multiple official languages, even if their actual use can be infrequent for some.	1642635102.0	htdxush	t3_s7uppw	t1_htdt78m	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htdxush/

gf0v2vz	Ну так в Европе пропаганда против РФ. В РФ -- против Европы. Так оно и работает. Главная проблема в том, что политики начинают верить в то, что наврали журналистам, читая это в газетах.   И у Путина как раз политика миролюбивая до усрачки. У РФ уже столько casus belle, что только спичку поднеси. Более того, война со слабым оппонентом -- предельно прибыльное занятие для государства. Другое дело, что его политика реально плоха: укронацисты за эти годы уже почти 15 тысяч человек, считающих себя русскими, убили в гражданской войне, которую развязали вполне конкретные персонажи. С моей точки зрения, на наших границах такое недопустимо. При этом страну давят незаконными рестрикциями (это, если что, не санкции) так, будто она захватила военной силой чуть ли не всё до Па де Кале включительно.  Впрочем, Путин пока что смертен -- и уже *очень* стар.	1642644560.0	htej61z	t3_s7l7t5	t1_htch572	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7l7t5/is_it_true_that_this_what_yall_think_of_europe/htej61z/

2yeme168	I've dug deep enough, Google Scholar included, when I first became interested in the issue quite a few years ago. If you do that yourself and look past some science-pop I-don't-really-know-what-I'm-writing-about bullshit, trust me, you'll find not just "internet consensus', but numerous serious etymologists, well-respected in the field of linguistics, who point to the undeniable link between the word used to denote the ethnic group and the captives  just to be clear, Otto the Great and his wars had nothing to do with that, of course, since 1) slave raids and wars are two very different things 2) the main market for the slaves was in the Muslim world, and commercial dealings between Holy Roman Empire and Muslim countries were rather limited since they didn't quite see eye-to-eye, y'know. Tatars and Khazars were the primary raiders in the eastern region. There's plenty of surviving documents with slave trade invoices from that time  the fact that Slavs themselves took slaves doesn't in any way contradict the fact that their populace was also a victim of slave raids. The notion that people of Slavic descent are somehow "impossible to be forced into slavery" is laughable, since the history of slavery very clearly demonstrates that pretty much any unprotected population can be taken captive, and being enslaved is not exactly a matter of consent. If it makes you feel better, "saqaliba" / "esclavo" / "sklavenos" quickly came to mean any kind of foreign slave from Europe, not just Slavs  you, of course, have the holy right to indulge in any kind of delusions you like, and I gotta admit I don't really care what you think or believe, random guy on reddit, but still I'll share a little lifehack. If one ever wants to have a serious, academic-style discussion instead of the regular internet nonsense squabble, it's generally advisable to refrain from snooty attitudes, kindergarden ad hominems, and dim-witted strawman arguments  otherwise you might one day encounter a person who actually knows their shit, and you would look silly, kinda like you do now with that ridiculous little link you provided, where some noname "historian" argues something "bravely heterodox" based on a couple of cherry-picked sources. Just because you're ethnically butthurt or something doesn't mean you should believe anything that soothes the pain, or you might end up right there with cockamamie "theories" about Ancient Ukrians building the Great Pyramids, and I suspect you wouldn't really wanna be in that company  good day	1642646431.0	htenems	t3_s5szfv	t1_hte3kbc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s5szfv/a_question_about_n_word/htenems/

55moaazp	Honestly, the best option is to land a job at American company with a presence in Russia and try to transfer. You can try to land a job at finance or consulting or IT firms firms such as PwC or McKinsey. The pay is pretty good. You can expect something around $2500k monthly.  Also you can actually try being a salesman and try handle international sales for a Russian company who is exporting goods/services out West. I think it could be a realistic way to go. Salary won’t be high at start, but there is no cap at sales, so you can make a lot of money if you are good at sales.   Strongly advise NOT to visit Russia and look for a job in person. Just do it online through hh.ru. Start uploading your resume and answer some emails and calls. That’ll give you  a clear idea what market wants.  Your degree in humanities is worthless, unless you want to get into international journalism. You can perhaps try applying to Russian propaganda news outlets such as Russia Today or Sputnik. They might be looking for translators or reporters who is fluent in English.    Overall salaries are not that great in Russia for anything except IT.	1642650338.0	htew6el	t3_s854k0	t1_htek1mv	/r/AskARussian/comments/s854k0/how_to_find_work_in_russia/htew6el/

They'll get their shit pushed in, and the West won't intervene, they've said as much.

The same reason Baltic states were annexed.    You don't seem to understand that USSR **won** the winter war and moved the border away from Leningrad. That allowed Leningrad not to be eradicated entirely during WW2 when German and Finnish nazis committed a war crime there.

Because there can only be one truth, and if your very respectable historians were right, that means Soviet historians were lying.  In reality, unlike in your imagination, servants of certain classes bear these certain classes' consciousness and have to implement their policies. So bourgeois historians have drastically different opinions from proletarian historians.

See for yourself: [https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/family-doctor-salary](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/family-doctor-salary)  By comparison, the "average salary" in the US is around $65k/year. [https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/average-american-income/](https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/average-american-income/)  Nurses and other "lower tier" staff tend to make more average pay, yes.

3mdheb9y	The head of the Registry Office of the Rostov region Olga Isaenko commented on the news. She noted that she could not pass by this topic, which is actively commented on. Isaenko said that in fact these are prohibitions that have always existed. Previously, they were not officially prescribed, as they did in 2022. Isaenko reminded that the wedding is a special ceremony for the newlyweds and their relatives. Therefore, you should not interfere with loud conversations. Advertisement As for laughter, Isaenko said - the media took this phrase out of context. There really is a ban, and it applies to all loud sounds. Including laughter, which will distract the newlyweds and guests from the wedding ceremony. Besides, Isaenko is sure that the solemn event at the registry office is unlikely to seem funny to anyone.	1642697462.0	hth88wr	t3_s8moqy	t3_s8moqy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8moqy/laughing_during_weddings_have_been_reportedly/hth88wr/

11q3id	Most of them actually believe it, because they’re surrounded by these opinions and many don’t have the time or motivation to research + understand everything that’s happening, so it’s easier to take the official line of “this is the United States/NATO wanting to attack” that has worked since the 1960s.  As another example, I knew a Russian who called me in a panic, exclaiming that Biden declared an emergency situation in Ukraine. I looked for the news on several American news sites, and couldn’t find anything. Then I googled “Biden emergency Ukraine” and found where he invoked something named the emergency powers act to declare new sanctions against some IT company who did business with the FSB and a construction company who did business in Crimea. Apparently the United States president has to invoke something named the emergency powers act to declare sanctions.   It was presented as something wildly different in Russian news. It was almost like Biden was going to attack. This happens every once in a while. It’s just enough to keep the fear level high and make people think that Putin is doing all he can because the entire world wants to destroy Russia and take its resources (another very very common thing Russians believe.)  I will say, however, that the official position of the paid trolls is that this is all United States aggression. There are paid trolls here, of course, but they probably mostly play the other side on Reddit because it’s easier to get upvotes that way. It’s a bit like how it was discovered that most russophobic news articles were written by a small team of paid Russian trolls so that state-sponsored media in Russia could say, “look at the russophobic west! More than 60% of their news articles are negative about Russia!”   It’s all weird, but makes sense when you understand that the Russian government is trying hard to maintain relevance as much as it can in the post-soviet world.	1642697936.0	hth9kyw	t3_s7uppw	t1_hth4sbr	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hth9kyw/

There's no regulation around what they charge, it just means they're exempt from taxes on their "profits" as long as they provide "charitable" services in return. Plenty of billion dollar endowment non-profits exist in the States, just look at private universities as well. Obviously both hospitals and universities still make profits, it's just not treated that way tax-wise.

t3gvp	The article is a bit disingenuous. The signing at the registry is a small (although essential) part of the wedding that takes literally a few minutes, not the whole wedding. The official asks some questions and presents bride and groom a wedding certificate to sign, which ends with a customary kiss.  As I understand it, in USA it is done by the priest? Do people in USA speak and laugh loudly at the part when the priest officiates it?  Tatarstan doesn't have this restriction, but I do remember we (close family on both sides) stood in silence during my sister's wedding at the registry.  The wedding reception at a restaurant afterwards had much more guests and was loud with music and dancing and conversation and laughter. Nobody restricts that, not even in Rostov.	1642698455.0	hthb0m5	t3_s8moqy	t3_s8moqy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8moqy/laughing_during_weddings_have_been_reportedly/hthb0m5/

zgyfq	Ну серьёзно, мне ещё нужно объяснять где в российском обществе гомофобия? Ну лол же. Из Москвы там наверное не видно, но быть в открытых гомосексуальных отношениях в России крайне чревато как минимум для карьеры. Как максимум могут и морду набить. Про мусульманские республики и говорить бесполезно. Даже простое упоминание о каком-нибудь бисексуальном опыте, если ты не женщина вызовет волну негатива и непонимания.  Второе, насчёт "больных". Я могу провести экскурс в историю насчёт древней Греции и мира сексуальной раскрепощенности. В мире существует множество странных сексуальных традиций и норм сексуального поведения социально приемлемых в той или иной группе людей. Гомосексуализм в этом списке находится даже не в топ-5. Так что каждый раз, когда вы говорите, что эти люди "больные", ну это просто смешно. Скорее это говорит о вашем ограниченном кругозоре и непросвещённости.	1642698654.0	hthbkce	t3_s79eia	t1_hth3v7c	/r/AskARussian/comments/s79eia/question_regarding_gay_couples/hthbkce/

The penalty for domestic violence in Russia used to be a jail term, which meant a lot of it went unreported because of women fearing to lose the family's only breadwinner to a jail. So the law was amended to make **the first time** someone commits domestic violence punishable by a fine instead; and the number of convictions using that article immediately increased significantly.	1642700411.0	hthghf2	t3_s8ef0t	t1_hth6z3r	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ef0t/culture_shock_us_and_russia/hthghf2/

ibck7	> Didn't Russia literally decriminalize domestic violence?  Not really. I assume you refer to the somewhat recent law about domestic abuse. The idea was not to decriminalize domestic violence, but to make abuse victims more likely to call the police.  We have basically 2 laws for domestic violence now. First one is in the Code of Administrative Offences (6.1.1) and applicable for first time violation only provided there hasn't been harm to health (defined by Criminal Code 115). Second one is in Criminal Code (116.1) and applicable for repeated violations provided there hasn't been harm to health (again, defined by Criminal Code 115). If there is a harm to heath, then Criminal Code 115 applies no matter if it was a first time or repeated. The idea behind separation first time violations to Administrative Offences, because getting criminal charge can ruin lifes - employers would rately hire someone with any criminal charge, and if abuse victim depends on the abuser financially, they would be screwed too, it is not often when victim can just up and quit abusive relationship.  The problem with domestic abuse In Russia is not the laws, but rather the apathy of the police. "Call us when you are dead" is quite a familiar phrase here.	1642700702.0	hthhafw	t3_s8ef0t	t1_hth6z3r	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ef0t/culture_shock_us_and_russia/hthhafw/

As stated by our medias: Russian ambassads personal and family are supposedly leaving Kiev. Lots of Russian tanks are going to the border. There will be a meeting between Lavrov and Blinken Friday. Trudeau isn't sure about giving Ukraine's weapons to avoid giving reason to Putin to attack. The attack can happens at everytime and Putin would be searching for some reason to start  the offensive. That's about it.   What is your medias narrative?	1642701040.0	hthi83t	t3_s1sfm9	t1_hth5kw0	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/hthi83t/

3o3pmwnp	Does Russia have an equivalent of Red Dawn where America, NATO whatever invades Russia and some teenagers fight back?     Red Dawn is a good movie but I’d agree that it along with many such movies does depict the Russian antagonists as inhumane monsters. It may be ideological or just a way for the writers to dramatize it and make you root for the protagonists. Probably both.     Are Russian people offended by depictions of Russian characters as monsters?    For example, in Red Dawn the Russian invaders are depicted as inhumane monsters and commit heinous atrocities. In the beginning of the movie a high school kids are depicted in a class, and you hear the planes outside. The Russian paratroopers land and the kids go to the window and watch the teacher go outside and get shot. The Russian troops deliberately fire at high school kids and kill some of them.      War isn’t puppies and rainbows but I find it hard to believe they’d go that far and be so barbaric.     Then you see the troops taking the kids parents forcing them to dig their own graves and shoot them while the kids are secretly watching. You also see a girl about fourteen leaving a package that’s a bomb. But the troops that see her make lewd comments implying they want to rape her. As she runs away the bomb goes off.     I know it’s flawed and I don’t take it seriously. It’s still an interesting movie because the kids seem to replicate mujahideen style tactics from Afghanistan. I know it’s just entertainment but some people may take it seriously.   Do ordinary Russians ever think the depictions are unfair and offensive?     I think ideology plays a big role in these depictions and also having Russians as villains. But also American movies tend to depict the villains as cruel as possible to make you root for the protagonists.	1642701534.0	hthjlnh	t3_s88d52	t1_htf13ih	/r/AskARussian/comments/s88d52/are_americans_in_russian_movies_portrayed_as_bad/hthjlnh/

fr8cditg	Being $29T in debt doesn’t help. College used to be more affordable until government got involved. Not to mention there’s an enormous push for everyone to go to college and then if one doesn’t or chooses trade school, it’s almost as if there’s a stigma that they’re a failure. Education should absolutely be affordable and accessible but it should also be aimed to highlight peoples natural talents, gifts, skills, and interests. There’s so much to debate about it but I agree higher education is absurdly expensive! Being a libertarian, both parties in power suck. We should’ve listened to George Washington in his farewell address about not forming parties. Too many people are so loyal to their party that they don’t even care about the issues. I truly believe there are more Americans that actually care about policy and the real issues than party but the loudest ones are the ones that get the spotlight so.

Am I missing something? Ukraine wants to join NATO and the EU, so I don't give a shit what Russia wants. The only reason Ukraine wants to join NATO is because they're afraid of Russia. Russia is the problem.	1642703275.0	hthodau	t3_s7uppw	t1_hthn6jd	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hthodau/

In Canada, people can pretty much pass theory, 2 road tests without any courses. But doing that, people don't learn good habits and only bad ones. Like for example if you go slower on a highway, you should stay on the right side.  Red light thing is weird. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Like in downtown Toronto, good fucking luck turning right, there are either lots of cars that you have to let pass and during green a lot of people cross.

i7lavsor	Thats the russian propaganda version. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War  Russian troops had illicitly crossed the Russo-Georgian state border through the Roki Tunnel and advanced into the South Ossetian conflict zone by 7 August before the Georgian military response.[neutrality is disputed][note 4][38][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] Russia accused Georgia of "aggression against South Ossetia",[40] and launched a full-scale land, air and sea invasion of Georgia on 8 August which Russia called a "peace enforcement" operation.[48] Russian and South Ossetian forces fought Georgian forces in and around South Ossetia for several days, until Georgian forces retreated. Russian and Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge held by Georgia. Russian naval forces blockaded part of the Georgian coast. The Russian air force attacked targets beyond the conflict zone, in undisputed parts of Georgia. This was the first war in history in which cyber warfare coincided with military action. An information war was also waged during and after the conflict. Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, negotiated a ceasefire agreement on 12 August.  Russian forces temporarily occupied the Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti and Gori, holding on to these areas beyond the ceasefire. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August and the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. Russian international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014. In 2021, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia maintained "direct control" over the separatist regions and was responsible for grave human rights abuses taking place there.[49][50]	1642707218.0	hthz20e	t3_s8ozot	t1_hthxgwf	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/hthz20e/

bfuei0	I'll humour you: in Belarus, from 1918 to 1934, there was a Belarusian Cyrillic orthography called Tarashkievica.  This orthography's dictionary was also reflective of how Belarusians spoke (Расейская, а не "руская", наприклад).  In 1934, the founder of this orthography, Branislaŭ Taraškievič, was shot, and his standard was declared a fascist invention by Stalin.  This although Taraškievič was a social-democrat and a member of the Communist Party of Western Belarus in Poland.  The new standard is Russified (руская для России, а не только для Руси) and sought to bring people away from their native language and only speak Russian.  Russia robbed Belarus.  In Ukraine, a bigger country that was also better organised around maintaining cultural autonomy, orthography couldn't be Russified.  Instead, the intelligentsia was targeted.  The most famous efforts happened during the seventies, but Holodomor ranks as one of the top crimes of the Soviet Union.  It's not actually better that during the same time there were similar famines happening in Kazakhstan, because that just indicts the USSR even more.  Vasyl Makukh, who killed himself in a simultaneous protest of the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the repression of the Ukrainian language, Vasyl Stus, who died in a Soviet prison camp, Yuriy Lytvyn, who died as well in prison for protesting the repressions of Ukrainian language and cultural associations...the list goes on, and those are some of the famous cases that we learn about.  Not to mention the direct occupation of Crimea and the occupation of the Donbas via proxy.  Russia robbed Ukraine.  Ah, Crimea.  The Crimean Tatars will always remember that it was they who were deported in 1944 from their homeland by the Russians, that it was ethnic Russians who began living in their homes and have a collective amnesia as to why anyone could tell them that Crimea was never Russian except through a genocide that killed most of the Crimean Tatar people.  Russia robbed Crimea.  In Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, before 1940, the attitudes towards the USSR could be best described as positive.  This all changed in 1940 with the occupation of the Baltic states.  The deportation of most of the Baltic states' intelligentsia (of course except for collaborators with the Soviet-Russians) as well as the start of renewed Russification efforts led to the utter reversal of these previously positive attitudes.  That is why normal people so willingly attacked Soviet troops, and why, for example, there was not a single Soviet soldier left in Estonia by the time the Nazis arrived to set up their own occupation.  After the end of occupation, further blanket deportations continued, regardless of whether someone collaborated with the Nazis or not.  The Caucasus...oh it just gets better.  Those countries that are independent are lucky, and even so, Georgia has to deal with Russian bullshit every day, as Russian efforts to "protect" the Abkhazians and South Ossetians have resulted in a depopulation of both puppets...Armenia, with Russian support, refuses to accept the reality that Azerbaijan has Ngorno-Karabakh and Nahcivan.  And then the North Caucasus, where everyone is so used to Russification and anti-Caucasian discrimination that they don't bother looking for dignity, because the last time someone did, there were two Chechen Wars.  Russia robbed the entire Caucasus region.  Not to mention that Holodomor hit the regions of the Kuban and Donbas in Russia as well, because they were Ukrainian speaking until Holodomor.  All Central and Eastern Europe suffered as well.  Poland from 1815 to 1914 endured constant attempts at Russification, the brutal suppression and censorship of the intelligentsia, and after independence in 1918, had to endure a war against Soviet Russia (which it won) and then in 1938, was invaded simultaneously by Nazi Germany and the USSR.  To add insult to injury, Poland became a puppet of Russia from 1945 to 1989, only gaining independence in 1989 due to Gorbachyov being one of the few leaders of the USSR to be a humane leader.  Czechia and Slovakia were not ill-disposed towards Russia until 1945, when Soviet puppet-hood began.  1968 is a year remembered by all Czechs and Slovaks, as that is when the USSR proved that it was intolerant of independent actions taken by allies.  Czechia and Slovakia are grateful that they were able to finally go on their own paths in 1989 and 1993.  Hungary in 1918 declared the Hungarian Soviet Republic under Bela Kun, and that is the last time Hungary was in any way receptive to non-coerced cooperation with Moscow.  1956 proved to Hungary that what had begun in 1945 was a veiled occupation, that Moscow could not be trusted.  1989 was a good year for them as well.  Romania and Moldova remember when their nations were one, where they were consistently pricked by the USSR's desperate claims to Bessarabia.  In 1940, Bessarabia became part of Russia as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and in 1945, the Kingdom of Romania became a puppet of Moscow.  Romanians remember Moscow for putting in the dictator Ceausescu, who was particularly nasty for being a puppet dictator.  Moldova has finally gotten a pro-Romanian president, and a majority of Moldovans wish to truly reunite, not like what happens when a former colony desires integration due to misplaced Stockholm syndrome.  Russia robbed Central and Eastern Europe.  Finland and Eastern Germany remember well.  In Finland, Russia claimed Karjala (not Karelia) and gained it in the two wars waged against Finland in 1939-45, which resulted in "Finlandisation", which involved the USSR dictating Finland's foreign and internal policy until 1985.  Germany paid for the crimes of the Nazis, but the censorship of those who were potentially anti-Soviet while still being democratically aligned still occurred.  The Soviet puppet state is the direct reason as to why Eastern Germany is almost comedically underdeveloped in comparison to Western Germany, and why only after reunification development of the region restarted.  Russia robbed Germany and Finland.  The Balkans were brutalised by Soviet influence.  In Albania and Bulgaria, puppet regimes were set up.  Albania had Hoxha, who isolated Albania after the death of Stalin and aligned with China, setting up bunkers everywhere in a paranoid anticipation of invasion.  1989 was a good year for Albania indeed.  Bulgaria made subservient to Moscow in 1945 as well and was intended to unite with Yugoslavia, though Tito, who had successfully conducted an independent revolution and refused to follow Stalin's orders, ensured Bulgaria's independence by falling out with the Red Tsar.  Until the 1990s, Bulgaria was generally underdeveloped in comparison to Yugoslavia, and only the Yugoslav Wars sadly equalised things for a while.  Russia robbed those that it could in the Balkans.  The Greek Civil War also stands out))))  Central Asia was described by the Russian Empire as their greatest colony, and in 1932-34, there was a Holodomor that occured in Kazakhstan which gave an excuse to further settle more Russians in Kazakhstan.  The imposition of Cyrillic, the cruel destruction of independent states established in the aftermath of Brest-Litovsk, the current fit that Russia is still having about Kazakhstan moving to a Turkic Latin alphabet show that Russia still sees Central Europe as their colony.  Russia robbed Central Asia.  Finally, there is Korea.  Specifically North Korea.  At first the Soviet occupation zone, North Korea became a pseudo-monarchy (much like the USSR under Stalin and even Brezhnev) that has outdone the Soviet Union and China in terms of brutality against humanity.  Russia robbed Korea.  And finally, the other places that Russia has robbed.  Russia robbed the natives of Alaska by claiming the region and then selling the entire territory while controlling little.  Russian support for communists abroad was more often than not simply a power play that put into power communist regimes with little to no legitimacy.  Now, I cannot say I approve of the United States' power plays in Central America.  That is continuing today, and the Sandinistas had no one else but Moscow.  Venuzuela is only kept afloat by being part of the oil bloc, and shoots itself in the foot by economic mismanagement, while taking to heart the Kremlin tactic of blaming everybody else rather than taking responsibility.  China is a direct continuation of Stalinism with Chinese characteristics, and thankfully Vietnam has rejected Chinese influence.  BRICS is honestly just a far-right alliance with China.  Russia robs everywhere it goes.  And Russia itself.  The Federal subject republics mean nothing.  With the recent constitutional changes, even less time is alloted to the learning of the native languages of the republics, and Russification continues.  The poisonous use of "русский" and "нерусский" as effective qualifiers of worth, as was it not ironic that a fucking Kyrghyz woman sang that awful song "Русская Женщина"?  The constant devaluing of non-ethnic Russians and the praising of those who Russify completely by the government, Russian liberals and many normal people is why Russia has robbed those who are forced to be the tenants remaining in her ruined Khrushyovka.	1642708092.0	hti1fi8	t3_s7va8z	t1_hthmpyp	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7va8z/your_opinion_on_this/hti1fi8/

I have yet to meet an American (or European) that 'dislikes Russians' rather their curious, or say 'oh how is the weather there? What is Moscow like? I'd love to see the museums! Never do I hear 'evil Russian people'.   The same goes for Europeans dislike Putin. We see these things in media because it's what media says we should act or feel. But general perception, a countryman is going to love their country but dislike their own government (wanting change) before they 'dislike' another country and their president. Put media aside and think wow how much do I really really dislike Xi Jinping? Oh man my blood boils when I hear Naruhito, or Hasina?

8xknvrpg	>Does Russia have an equivalent of Red Dawn where America, NATO whatever invades Russia and some teenagers fight back?  No. In the entire history of the USSR and Russia, not a single film was made where the United States invaded Russia.   True, films were made that were critical of US policy (for example, "On the Pomegranate Islands", which showed the US invasion of a small island country after oil was discovered there), as well as a few films where the US and Russia military or intelligence (USSR) clashed with each other in the realm of the Cold War. The closest analogue of the film "Rambo-2" is the film "Solo Voyage" ("Одиночное плавание"). However, in this film 1) Americans are not shown as sadistic beasts, just insidious opponents; 2) there are also "good" Americans in the film (not communists, just ordinary people who happened to be in the scene of events).	1642713016.0	htidmn7	t3_s88d52	t1_hthjlnh	/r/AskARussian/comments/s88d52/are_americans_in_russian_movies_portrayed_as_bad/htidmn7/

6ed0xx	First Chechen war concluded with signing a peace deal in 1996, that basically granted Chechnya independence in everything but name. As result Chechnya became cesspool of various criminal gangs dealing in everything from drug trade and abductions for ransom to islamic terrorism. Internal political process in Chechnya brought to power most violent and unappeasable people, thay gained foreign support from several sources, including turkish nationalists and Al Qaeda. After 3 years of this independence Shamil Basaev's squad crossed border and assaulted russian region Dagestan. Second war took 4 years, Russia lived through dozens of terrorist acts, thousands of people died, a lot of them civilians on both sides. So i'm asking, if Chechnya can assault Russia, what makes you think Ukraine can't?	1642714282.0	htih5sh	t3_s8ozot	t1_hthvalu	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htih5sh/

ayqpfvfj	Вопрос, который давно ждал, что кто-то задаст, но не ожидал его увидеть здесь. Мне так подгорает с Варламова, что даже лениво пишу статью, где со ссылками показываю, что он пидорас и хуесос.  Основные моменты:  * Неконсистентность мнения. Варламов ненавидит плотную высотную застройку, но обожает небоскрёбы Нью-Йорка и даже плотно застроенные кварталы в России, когда застройщики проплатили рекламу в блоге. * Некорректность сравнений. Варламов берёт произвольное бюджетное жильё в России(тысяч по пятьдесят баксов), сравнивает с жильём в Европе по миллиону евро(очевидно, эти суммы в видео / блог-посте не озвучиваются) за аналогичный метраж, удивляется разнице. No shit, Sherlock. * Некорректность выводов. Варламов, например, предпочитает малоэтажную застройку и предлагает её, как решение проблем. Вот только он как-то забывает о том, что её в России полно — те самые пятиэтажные хрущёвки, которые ни разу не являются хорошим жильём и почти каждый человек, заработавший немного денег, сваливает оттуда при первой же возможности. Проблема вообще не в этажах. * Выдача желаемого за действительное. "Новые районы станут гетто!" / "В Мурино уже гетто!" / "Высотные гетто Новой Москвы!". На практике же, в новые районы переезжают работающие люди, у которых есть возможность отдать многие миллионы сразу / платить весьма заметные платежи по ипотеке, а вот всякий биомусор остаётся там, где живёт. В Питере МВД даже публикует карту преступлений по районам, и в каком-нибудь Парнасе(там ни одного дома меньше двадцати этажей) всё спокойно, а вот в Обухово, застроенного столь милыми Варламову пятиэтажками, как раз максимум преступлений на душу. * Пиздеть — не мешки ворочать. Варламов на каждом шагу рассказывает, как он бы сделал, если б его подпустили к планированию, но на практике немедленно сливается. Последнее, что помню: власти Выборга предложили ему какую-то должность после поста с критикой, но Илюша немедленно спрятался в кусты.	1642714330.0	htihaq4	t3_s7y20v	t3_s7y20v	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7y20v/какое_мнение_россияне_имеют_о_варламове/htihaq4/

3qdtoh6u	>As stated by our medias: Russian ambassads personal and family are supposedly leaving Kiev.  To be more exact - most honest newspaper NYT said that their source in most unbiased towards Russia ukranian secret service says that ambassadors were supposedly preparing to leave.   Key word is "supposedly". That's the most important word when you read something abour Russia in western media. Story repeats again and again. Actually it's very popular meme in russia - "[highly likely](https://youtu.be/eEg5FQ8kyU4?t=78)".   >Lots of Russian tanks are going to the border  First of all, I thought western and ukranian media and politicans were saying that Ukraine is at war with Russia these years. I'm pretty sure I've heard that several hundred times :)  (Which of course they bravely fight-back in a non-civil war in LDNR, but obviously don't fight in Crimea, where Russian troops really are presented).     But if they are afraid of amassing military for training near border - does it mean they lied last 7 years? :)  Is it criminal by the way?  What about regular NATO trainings around Russian borders, where Russia is seen as enemy?   >There will be a meeting between Lavrov and Blinken Friday  Wait-wait, Lavrov point isn't about Ukraine, Lavrov raises different question - about guarantees for non-escalation from NATO. If these won't be given - then Russia will start doing the same.   If sending troops in Ukraine, Georgia, Baltics, whatever post-soviet is okay - why can't Russia send troops in French (neo)colonies, Central-South America and so on for example?  But the meeting and question raised isn't about Ukraine, regardless of how it's painted in western media. It's NATO-Russia principal relationship.  Although hearing from Josep Borrell things like:  >"We have to talk about all the violations since the Helsinki Final Act was passed in 1975."  makes me think of serious incompetence rather than of political misunderstanding.  >Trudeau isn't sure about giving Ukraine's weapons to avoid giving reason to Putin to attack.  :)  >the attack can happens at everytime  :))  >and Putin would be searching for some reason to start the offensive  If this would be the goal, Putin could have repeated Colin Powell trick without giving a damn.  >What is your medias narrative?  Our media narrative is sort of - NATO plays agressive, either this stops or something has to be done. Negotiations are to find solution. NATO (USA/EU) game in Ukraine was absolutely destructive for ukranians and russian-ukranian relationships, which bothers us since we are basically the same nation (despite last efforts to create new political nation of pseudo-ukranians).      By the way how many ukranian troops are around russian borders? :)	1642714933.0	htiizjr	t3_s1sfm9	t1_hthi83t	/r/AskARussian/comments/s1sfm9/ukraine_situation/htiizjr/

8xknvrpg	>Kosovo is an independent democratic republic...   >   >Well, sadly, we can't say any part of Russia is democratic by comparison, at least as much as Kosovo...  Yep, "at least as much as Kosovo" - criminal non-state that has become the center of the European drug trade, whose former president is now [arrested on charges of grave crimes against humanity](https://www.scp-ks.org/en/indictment-against-hashim-thaci-kadri-veseli-rexhep-selimi-and-jakup-krasniqi-confirmed-ksc-pre); territory where only the presence of KFOR saves the enclaved non-Albanian population from being massacred by the Albanians. And not "independent", but partially recognized. Serbia does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which was torn away from it by force.  Regarding the US troops in Syria, you have already been answered in another comment, providing a link. Yes, they are there against the will of the Syrian government, and this does not bother you.   "And USA is not responsible for what Israel does".   Excellent! Israel has occupied Arab lands - the US has approved this, moved its embassy to Jerusalem and is providing billions of dollars of military aid to Israel. Be consistent: now recognize Crimea as Russian and provide military assistance to Russia. :)   It's okay though, you can keep the money.

5b3g9vgj	Migrants are a complicated topic.  The main problem is that people don’t want to do the jobs that are done by migrants (or rather local people don’t want to do those jobs for the currently offered salary). I remember reading reports that during the pandemic there was a small crisis of low-wage jobs in Moscow because lots of migrants were sent back to their home countries and were unable to travel to Russia.  But the fact that those are low-wage jobs means that the people who will do them will come from the bottom of society. Those people have no interest in integrating into the society - they want to earn some quick money and get back home. While the state would happily police those migrants more, they don’t because it would mean work not being done and businesses being unhappy. Which, obviously, would mean that the work will be done - but the people will be brought illegally. Which is even worse.  Am I happy with the fact that there are so many immigrants in Moscow who have no interest in integrating into society whatsoever? No, obviously not. Do I think that not granting them entry would solve the issue? No, it will make things much worse. Can you make them integrate? I don’t think so either.	1642715293.0	htijzlq	t3_s8thn6	t3_s8thn6	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8thn6/how_someone_defend_the_migrants_after_things_like/htijzlq/

Я сам ненавижу бруталистическую, советскую и пост-советскую плотную высотную застройку которую можно кажется только видеть в России и в Китае. Это често говоря суть ульи в которых кажется есть кошмар жить. Казалось бы державы как  Соединенное Королевство, Нидерланды и похожее, должны строить плотно и высоко из-за плотного населения и мало свободной земли (маленькие державы). И мне как сторонном наблюдателю выглядит абсурдно, что там Росссияне живущие в наибольшей державе на свете должны цепляться в этих ульях.   Смотрю вот в Мурине например Буль. Менделеева или Парнас тот. Фу, ужас. Да, это действительно суть нововостройки, наверно и качественно построенные, но Бог да убьет меня если бы жил там когда-нибудь в таком здании. Да, наверно рядом есть и школа и супермаркет и все другое, но блин, представи жить в этом...   Не знаю что Варламов говорил про Нью-Йорк, но скорее всего там таковые высотки суть только торговые здания, а не и жилые. (Типа Moscow City)     Малоэтажная застройка может и не быть пятиэтажная хрущевка. Пятиэтажная хрущевка и сама есть улей сраный. А малоэтажные домы можно строить и да будут приятные для жизни.

By land border do you mean with Russia? NATO already has a land border with Russia - Norway, Latvia and Estonia border mainland Russia.  >The analogy would be Cuba or Mexico to have Chinese/Russian ABMs. I wonder if the US would be happy with that, and yes most Mexicans or Cubans if given adequate incentive would happily vote for this to happen.  Literally the only reason Ukraine wants our protection is b/c they are afraid of Russia invading. I don't care what the US Gov't says, if we were threatening to invade Mexico and as a result, Mexico reached out to Russia for protection I would understand. This isn't complicated.  >Also as you can see most of these votes you spoke of also aren't a significant majority but barely making 50%. Hope you realize that most Ukrainians have suffered from American Propaganda and hence most of these votes don't really have much actual credibility, even Biden many years ago himself said that being a country with high corruption rate etc would not be a good idea for joining NATO.  Lol, I linked a poll with 64% wanting NATO membership. What percentage is legitimate to you?

US policing has only shown to be with an agenda of obtaining resources or to sell more arms in conflict.   The spread of democracy is the goal and that's what many Americans want. And sure, we also want other countries to trade with, this benefits everyone. Again, I recognize that we have propped up dictators that align against our enemies as well, I do not support this.

7ql0hkem	I’ll humor this and assume you’re being completely serious and this isn’t a troll post. The amount of misinformation surrounding Russia is insane, and it’s 100% because of leftover Cold War fears and propaganda. To sum things up, the Soviet Union (which was made up of the majority of countries that now make up Eastern Europe) collapsed in the early 1990s, and with it, its Communist government. Modern Russia is not a communist country. Russia nowadays, especially in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, are on par with the rest of Europe in terms of standard of living and modern amenities/life. Just like any other country, there are poor people, rich people, and people in the middle. The poorer people tend to live in more remote areas, and the middle class and rich people usually populate the suburbs and cities. Russia is also not like North Korea. You aren’t going to be sent to Siberia or some shit for saying that you don’t like Putin etc to a friend on the street. Everyone has their own political opinions. If you would really like to see what modern and current-day Russia is like, I highly, highly recommend watching stuff like Russian YouTubers (who speak English and live in Russia) such as NFKRZ, or browsing cultural media such as Russia Beyond.	1642727320.0	htjbkry	t3_s8wzag	t3_s8wzag	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8wzag/how_bad_is_it_in_russia/htjbkry/

i7lavsor	__sharing this that someone commented on a question of mine regarding this__:  "In the course of the armed conflict, subsequently named a “five-day war” (7–12 August 2008), and its immediate aftermath, the Russian side justified its military intervention in Georgia by the intention to stop an allegedly ongoing genocide of the Ossetian population by the Georgian forces as well as to protect Russian citizens residing in South Ossetia and the Russian contingent of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces, deployed in South Ossetia in accordance with the Sochi Agreement of 1992. In this connection, the Russian side claimed that in the morning of 8 August 2008 two Russian peacekeepers were killed and five wounded by the Georgian attacks on the peacekeepers’ premises in Tskhinvali, which casualties “gave the right to the leadership of the Russian Federation to take a decision on the introduction of troops into South Ossetia”. The Georgians denied their deliberate attacks on the Russian peacekeepers, arguing that the Georgian troops entering Tskhinvali were fired at from the Russian peacekeepers` compounds and that they had to return fire. At the time of the writing of this Report, the Mission did not have access to reliable independent reports which could substantiate or refute the allegations of either side in this regard. Albeit, taking into account the existing dangerous environment on the ground, casualties among the Russian PKF personnel were likely. There were no reports on clashes between the Georgian forces and the Russian peacekeepers outside Tskhinvali. As far as the Russian accusations of genocide are concerned, they became less frequent in later months as the casualties among the Ossetian civilian population turned out to be much lower than initially claimed. Russian officials stated initially that about 2 000 civilians had been killed in South Ossetia by the Georgian forces and eventually the figure of overall civilian loses in the course of the August 2008 conflict was reduced to 162."  So if i do not use this (unencrypted :/) news article as source but a scientific one, this seems to be russian propaganda in order to justify war against georgia.

Some Tatars do as well. Most of the other Tatars are pro Russian anyway. So Crimea is almost 100% Russian or pro Russian.  2. Russian military and weapons are on the territory of Russia. While NATO countries around Russia have US troops and weapons, a country from the other side of the globe. See the difference? I don't think Russia would care if Estonia stationed Estonian troops in Estonia.  3. Intelligence agents from all over the world kill their enemies all over the world. US is definitely not the one to talk. Russia poses no threat to any NATO country, while NATO is constantly trying to surround Russia to disrupt MAD.  4. "Whataboutism" is a concept invented by hypocrites to deflect being called out for their hypocrisy. US wants to criticise others for something they themselves are guilty of. Using internet catch phrases does not negate that.  5. US is interested in starting wars in Europe, middle east and in the future, rest of Asia. Chaos abroad is beneficial to US which is isolated from the rest of the world and its problems.  6. US supported a revolution in Ukraine, then encouraged Ukraine to start a civil war with its own people who did not support the revolution and is now encouraging Ukraine to start another civil war.  NATO is US' imperial army and can go get fucked.	1642729529.0	htjgogz	t3_s8ozot	t3_s8ozot	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htjgogz/

The US cut off funding and a lot of the IRA's illegal activities like weapons smuggling so they were broke. Plus we got the Tories out of government, who were totally hostile to the republicans and made everything worse.   We could sort Israel-Palestine with different leadership and economic incentives.

As well as the actions of "all of progressive humanity" both before 1991 and afterwards. All over the world. Allow us to assert with great confidence that it was not a mistake, but a successfully executed plan. The people who carried it out KNEW what it would lead to and what consequences would await the residents of the former Soviet Union.    And this is already a post factum statement.    And this at the same time allowed the capitalist world to overcome the crisis of 1990, when the Reaganomics credit bubble burst, painlessly. At the expense of the barbaric looting of the USSR and CMEA countries. And the people who lived in those countries, to whom you destroyed not only the present but also the future.    And sooner or later you will all have to answer for it. So misanthropic deeds will have the most expensive price to pay. There are no more communists in Russia. And with them gone into oblivion are all their snotty ideas about working class brotherhood and other equality.

2tlfl64j	###Cons:   As an American, I believe the U.S. government stages "interest" in Ukraine to be able to have a reason to start conflict.  Our country is 245 years old and we have been in some form of conflict for 225 of those years since 1776. The U.S. government is down *bad*. Very bad. They are losing support by the truckload and they need a reason to spike nationalism/patriotism.   If they can unify Americans right now (which we are at a  nearly beyond repair type of division) under the name of the U.S. and what the public believes it's values to be (the governments values are clearly, to keep resources and strategy away from foreign powers) then they will have another reason to start conflict just like we did in Vietnam.  Our nation's budget will go up, our taxes will go up, our war department and every ABC agency will thrive, and our greedy government will take every inch they can get.  ###Pros:   The American public is quite very much intelligent enough to know that conflict is not in *our* interest and we will not stand for another 2 decades of war in another country.  Americans are exhausted from conflict. The problem is, we've been fighting others for so long we forgot how to live with ourselves.  With love from the /Citizens/ of the United States, we value your freedom just as much as ours.	1642735224.0	htjtrdt	t3_s8ozot	t3_s8ozot	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htjtrdt/

It was really badly received as European because it undermine swift credibility, European credibility and European-Iranian relations.  But if the US had to do it again, at the end they could force swift to disconnect Russia even thought the fallout to Europe would be way bigger than for Iran AND Russia has already started to build an alternative to at least sustain inter banking transactions at a nation wide level.

pf87gd6	Yes. Historically, in Russian empire ruling dynasty and nobility had more ties to western nobles than to russians to the point of nobles having better French than the french emperor. And to keep border regions stable, their nobility was recognised as the russian nobility pretty much with no proofs. So, if you spit at an average georgian you will hit at least a prince. Russians, on the other hand, enjoyed rights like more taxes and life long drafts into the army.  USSR continued policy of berating russians as a second grade people, with "korenization" upgrading them.  So, modern situation - pretty much all of Russian surrounding are "former nobles" which had Russians in slavery.	1642743526.0	htkanil	t3_s934sn	t3_s934sn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s934sn/why_do_georgians_say_stuff_like_peter_the_great/htkanil/

The idea goes "we are the greatest, and were it not for those Russians, we'll be an independent, strong and developed country; even now we're alone feeding the whole SU, their famous people are actually ours, etc." When after separation they do not magically become a second France or Switzerland, they do not say "whoops, that was a stupid idea", they become ultra nationalists.	1642744614.0	htkclof	t3_s934sn	t3_s934sn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s934sn/why_do_georgians_say_stuff_like_peter_the_great/htkclof/

Thing that helped Russia was the rising oil prices... trust me, if the prices will go below 40$/barrel and stay there for a while, Russia will just collapse.  Russia is seriously f\*cked at the moment, and it will stay this way, cause the leadership Is more interested In pocketing the money rather than development of the country.  Coming back to your question, some Russians do like Putin. But mostly those Russians who's lack proper political education, or older people who were brainwashed about NATO=bad blah blah. Putin had carefully crafted his image of being a "real man" by diving, shooting, hunting and saying how he will "Kill the terrorists in the toilets (reference to his famous Мочить в сортире quote) " and unsurprisingly this facade seem to work on the certain people... But under it what we have is an Insecure gopnik who has absolutely no idea about what he's doing.	1642745082.0	htkderq	t3_s93aij	t3_s93aij	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htkderq/

I remember our student diner, where only questionable meatballs with buckwheat were served just the other day suddenly put on the counter jellied salmon...  And I remember how that same dish stood there for breakfast, lunsh and diner, and on the next day too... and then it went away never returned, because the poor students were not that kind of students who would buy it.  The first year (1992-1993) was tough, I remember that sometimes at the end of the month the lunch could be a "sidedish with a gravy". But then I found a part-time job and the things went better.  So I could even help my mother who tried to survive alone with my younger brother, on the military factory, whose products became absolutely useless, being a clerk in the state relations department which became obsolete and was dismissed.  But she was able to finish the courses and change the position to a sales manager on the same factory, which managed to find the market needs and restructured to produce simple but well-sold products.	1642748520.0	htkiu15	t3_s8yvfs	t3_s8yvfs	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8yvfs/this_one_is_for_those_old_enough_to_remember/htkiu15/

Karibsky krizis, IPA: [kɐˈrʲipskʲɪj ˈkrʲizʲɪs]), or the Missile Scare, was a 1-month, 4 day (16 October – 20 November 1962) confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union which escalated into an international crisis when American deployments of missiles in Italy and Turkey were matched by Soviet deployments of similar ballistic missiles in Cuba. Despite the short time frame, the Cuban Missile Crisis remains a defining moment in U.S. national security and nuclear war preparation.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642752476.0	htkodk7	t3_rzlhld	t1_htkochy	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/htkodk7/

You don't confuse anything?  Any state is united as long as it suits the peoples living in it.  Ukraine is not united, because the Ukrainian-speaking part does not hear the opinion of anyone but themselves.  The borders of this country were determined by the Soviet official for his own convenience.  These borders were acceptable only if the Soviet Union existed and the Russian language was used.  As soon as the unifying union was gone, the inhabitants of Crimea wished to be independent from Ukraine, but the 1991 referendum was ignored.  Again.  The current composition of Ukraine is guaranteed by the goodwill of its citizens.  If the Ukrainian regime cannot provide the desired conditions for each nation, that nation has the right to make a choice.	1642752481.0	htkodtq	t3_s7uppw	t1_htkeh7k	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htkodtq/

5qr8qa7m	I’m astonished that just a few posts earlier you used Wikipedia to say “hey, look, it’s Russia who assaulted Georgia”. Now, suddenly, news articles AND official site of ECHR aren’t trustworthy because they are “unencrypted” (dafuq is this even mean?).  Moreover, where in that wall of text it says that   > this (what exactly?) seems to be russian propaganda in order to justify war against georgia.    And do you even read what you are referencing to? I like this quote  > The Georgians denied their deliberate attacks on the Russian peacekeepers, arguing that the Georgian troops entering Tskhinvali were fired at from the Russian peacekeeper compounds and that they had to return fire.   No shit Sherlock! That exactly what our peacekeepers were supposed to do - keep Georgians the fuck out of South Ossetia by any means necessary. Why’d they fire indeed.   Western propaganda work wonders on the feeble minds as we can see here.	1642753433.0	htkpny0	t3_s8ozot	t1_htjddvf	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htkpny0/

And since 1762, Peter the 3rd, it was Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov dynasty that ruled Russian Empire, from paternal line it was from his father - the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp Charles Frederick, who as you can guess from the name is not Russian. Peter the 3rd, being German-born and not belonging to the nation he ruled, actually made him quite unpopular and so he was deposed and the only exception to Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov dynasty came to rule - Catherine the Great, his wife (and also his second cousin), but she was also not Russian in any way, but from the German House of Ascania, her born name was Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg.	1642754983.0	htkrp6o	t3_s934sn	t1_htklm6a	/r/AskARussian/comments/s934sn/why_do_georgians_say_stuff_like_peter_the_great/htkrp6o/

440msf8k	I moved here from America last year. First of all, come visit for 2-4 weeks and make sure this is what you want. If you can connect with native Russians online in order to have friends who will guide you through your visit, that will help you immensely.  Can you communicate in Russian effectively enough to use public transport/go to a grocery store/acquire housing/buy clothes? Can you live like a Russian and not an american? Can you adjust to a culture that doesn’t follow the american definition of “friendly?” Can you abide by strict gun laws? Can you handle the idea of vaccine/QR code mandates on top of things like reduced mental healthcare services, no HIPAA, no ADA rules, etc.? Can you accept different political perspectives on global issues? Really consider these questions honestly. Life here isn’t for every american. I love it personally, I am never looking back, but you really need to know what you’re getting into because it is a very different way of life.  If you know after extensive research that life here would suit you, that’s great! Line up a job ahead of time—you really do want to start on a work visa (and have your employer handle that visa for you) and go from there.  I would not choose anywhere else to live, personally, just be sure you know what you’re doing.	1642755780.0	htksqrc	t3_s93ugj	t3_s93ugj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93ugj/is_moving_to_russia_an_obtainable_possibility/htksqrc/

I believe people dislike the version of Putin after the castling with Medvedev, viewing him as someone who’s willing to do anything to stay in power.  I guess, older people are hopeful that Putin can still do what he’s been doing in the 00’s, and younger people simply don’t remember that period.	1642756583.0	htktrmq	t3_s93aij	t1_htkcffb	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htktrmq/

From the beginning of March 2014, in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Euromaidan movement, protests by Russia-backed anti-government separatist groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, collectively called the Donbas region.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642758161.0	htkvqy7	t3_rzlhld	t1_htkvpuw	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/htkvqy7/

So, first conclusion is good.  You should know the atmosphere here in 90s. End of the world, nothing good is ahead. Everything is falling apart. No governance. Bandints are movie heroes, only because they provide some kind of justice in comparison with corrupted police. A mess with taxes; oil and other resources are extracted by some foreighn companies and government gets nothing for it. Black markets; i'd say, all markets were black.

Crimea also happen to be a strategically important area with important natural resources…  Our country, Serbia, would also never give up Kosovo freely through election. US-led NATO occupied Kosovo in 1999. citing humanitarian reasons. They did it by force, with far more casualties than in Crimea. The Declaration of Crimean independence [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_the_Republic_of_Crimea) that it was done "taking into consideration the confirmation of the status of Kosovo by the United Nations International Court of Justice on July 22, 2010, which says that unilateral declaration of independence by a part of the country does not violate any international norms".	1642758564.0	htkw8xh	t3_s8ozot	t3_s8ozot	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htkw8xh/

fyqq780h	Well I can't judge people of Latin America. There are many colorful countries. They are not bad but different. I noticed following:  Things that are different: - Lazier people. Manana is quite common attitude, - Lower hygiene standards. E.g. In carneceria meat may lay just on a floor, e.g. cashier takes your money and makes sandwich for you, - Not all McDonalds have WC (I used to go to McDonalds in Russia just because of WC :) ) - Shittier cars and expensive gasolina, - Lots of homeless people who laid around and sleeping, - Some food really tasty some really bad: e.g. chocolate surprisingly bad, milk as well, but meat or fruits are really great almost everywhere, - Street robbery is normal, - Loud music on a street at night or dances everywhere, - Single glazed windows that doesn't stop any sound and make your existence miserable (see above regarding dancing and music) - If there are election or come political rallies - better to stay away from crowds, - I'm hobby welder and realized that quality of work is quite bad even for me.  Some things in common: - I was surprised when I met Ukrainians who offered me suspicious phones and mobile devices (i guess they were stolen), - Drivers are crazy as well, - A lot of pro-communistic people, - Free healthcare, free education, - Restaurants like 'Y Ashota' where armenians do really tasty shawarma %)	1642759215.0	htkx1pa	t3_s93aij	t1_htkug0w	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htkx1pa/

262r5m0f	School: had classmates copying my homework all the time, copied it myself from more diligent students a few times when I was too lazy to do it at home. Had my tests copied constantly as well. No one offered or provided free tutoring, just answers. Mostly because school was viewed as a choir: you don’t have to like what’s explained to you, but you have to do homework and pass exams.                  University: that’s when things got interesting. We had group chats for discussing answers and explaining the material, as well as sharing the written notes and tests from other groups. Compared to the USA and other countries, we have our Bachelor program finished in a more or less same team: there are around 10-30 of us and we go to all the classes (already chosen for us by the university) together, with lectures being shared with other groups. So it’s only natural to share and receive help from the collective mind.	1642759427.0	htkxb3y	t3_s8l5jj	t3_s8l5jj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8l5jj/is_it_true_that_ap_student_come_together_to_help/htkxb3y/

Basically, a distance that a tank can travel. So, invasion force starts moving and then exactly at the border it will stop and refuel ? Well...   As for the rest - imagine this:   Mexico placing own troops 300km from US border.   \-or-   Mexico joining an alliance with China and NK and allowing them to build bases on its territory.	1642759582.0	htkxhxr	t3_s8ozot	t1_htk3f2m	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htkxhxr/

iliiffh	To add another bit of insanity, in Russia it is a felony for a person to openly distribute porn. So everyone who posts porn or saves it to their vk page at least without making it private commits a crime (article 242 part 3). Downloading porn torrents can be a crime too, because someone could download from you at the same time, and in court documents there are mentions of police officers downloading porn torrents to charge the uploader with crime. And I'm not talking about CP or some other dark stuff here, no, it all applies to regular consensual adult porn. Some people get charged and sentenced for it every year, even though it's a very random process.	1642760200.0	htky8vm	t3_s91uxn	t3_s91uxn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s91uxn/how_does_russian_perceive_pornography/htky8vm/

c6brgqi	I agree.  For citizens, this is the reasonable conclusion.  But it's geopolitics.  No governmental entity and the wealthy clique behind it are going to freely want to give up territory.  Ukraine has not been doing great economically for awhile now and losing developed territory is going give the nation less options.  These contested territories aren't some rural farmlands.  They are developed and not to mention, in Lugansk there is a massive ammunition plant that not only provided the bulk of Ukraine's ammunition military needs, but also was a large international exporter as well.  All of that stuff is cut off while under separatist control.	1642761247.0	htkzjoc	t3_s7uppw	t1_htdzndq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htkzjoc/

But there are also many of them who laugh at this. Some Ukrainians claim that Korolev was Ukrainian.

4rn0tuar	I live in Germany. German trains being on time is a popular misconception of an outsider. Germans themselves make memes about German railway company Deutsche Bahn, about how expensive and unreliable it is. Most of the time everything is ok of course and on time, but every now and then trains get late or cancelled. Once I had to take 3 hour longer ride because the train connection was off. Fortunately, at least you don’t have to pay anything extra at all (and in fact can get partial refund of your ticket if the delay is above an hour or two). Still, it’s far from perfect.	1642761716.0	htl053l	t3_s93aij	t1_htkuht3	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htl053l/

Такие вот оппозиционные либеральные журналисты в России, мда... но не в этом суть. Касательно НАТО: если НАТО не враг, то почему России не приняли в НАТО 2001 году? Если НАТО создавался против СССР, но НАТО не враг, то какой был смысл в существовании до событий 14-го года?

awy1j	It depends on the circumstances. If there are 3-4 men and they are located close to each other, for example, a regular small office, then yes, you shake hands when you meet them. When you leave, you can just say goodbye.   If there are a lot of people, you shake hands with those who are nearby, the rest can just wave and say hello.  Also, it depends on the relationship between you and how often you meet. Saying goodbye with a wave of the hand if you meet your friends once a year doesn't seem like a good idea.  As you noticed, a woman gets a handshake if she extends it herself and more gently without harsh movements. Otherwise, they just greet her by name.	1642762437.0	htl12qs	t3_s97iu8	t3_s97iu8	/r/AskARussian/comments/s97iu8/greeting_amd_farewelling_as_the_russians_do/htl12qs/

2jfmaqtp	Just to add a perspective of a woman working in a "male dominated environment". Usually I am the only female employee in the room and it feels incredibly stupid when there's a meeting of like 10+ people, a new guy shows up and shakes hands to EVERY dude in the room and ignores me. It's kinda annoying and I mentally roll my eyes whenever it happens. At the same time I am not going to wave my hands around, like, please senpai notice me, I want a handshake too 🥺. My boss shakes hands to everyone, myself included, when he walks into the room, he is the only guy in the office who does that  and I appreciate it. :)))   So, in a formal setting in similar situations perhaps consider offering a handshake to a woman too.

Вот недавно были с мужем в России на НГ. муж американец, и так случилось что схватил ротавирус прямо перед вылетом в США. Боли были адские, что мы стали подозревать аппендицит или заворот. Позвонили в скорую. Через 10 минут они приехали, забрали в отделение. Госпитализация не показана была, так как у них полно ковидных больных, да и  хирург после осмотра исключил операбельность. Вкололи кетанурал чтобы он поспал и спазм сняли. Выписали лечение, справку и отпустили домой. Медбрату правда, попотеть пришлось с американским паспортом, чтобы мужа оформить, но в итоге все получилось.

2jfmaqtp	Oh, I can't speak for other girls. I never really discussed it with my female friends or colleagues. I think it's fine when there's a small group of people, let's say, 2 women and 3 men, to shake hands with men and greet women by saying hi. But when it's a large group with 1-2 women and someone make such effort to greet everyone super personally and ignores women it's a kinda rude, imo.   Actually, I think the cultural shift is the opposite direction.  When I watch old Soviet films I see that women in both formal and informal situations were often addressed by men like "comrade Ivanova" and greeted with a handshake and it wasn't a big deal. Now everyone is just confused. We are no longer comrades to each other but also we are not "gentlemen" and "ladies" we haven't established any uniform cultural code yet.

But saying "in no way caused by Putin" is a lie.

As well as almost every previous was also 'good' while they were at power, and quickly became 'druncards', 'traitors', 'murders', etc. after they left. That what the article I've linked *is* about.  That's apparently also a reason why Putin decided to never leave. He's well aware of such a phenomena.  Also, to be frank, Yeltsin started pretty good with all the reforms, and given up later (probably after the Chechen war). And to be even more frankly his government (not him specifically but still) was the only reason Putin could do so long, since almost every positive law were established in 90s as well as the fresh economy, and it works still. This, and also oil prices that went through the roof after 90s. (Doesn't mean they couldn't do a better reforms in 90s, but Putin did nothing significant to add to that)  The rest of those people are not important anymore.

ekzzcp9z	I didn’t heard nothing more childish for a long time.   They have a transit pipe, they want to dictate a price, for a profit of their own natural-gas companies, by blackmailing Russian gas companies.  My analogy: If you selling something eatable at some shop, and then landlord (building owner) tells you - From this time price for rent is multiplied x2 (or x10 IDK really what price conditions was dictated by Ukraine) And sometimes landlord comes to your shop, and grab some food, “at future payment”, and of course he is not paying. What would you do?  You will try to relocate your shop, to more adequate place with notmal owner. US in this situation is trying to force “shop owner” not to change a landlord, and continue to pay overpriced rent and close his eyes on food stealing. And also is making lots of actions, to prevent of building another shop, so “shopkeeper” will be forced to use “old shop place”. Understood?  So, why you think, if we cut them gas off, their would revolt in favor of Russia? They probably would revolt, but Russia would look like a one of the main reason of their problems.	1642769460.0	htlbm87	t3_s8v6qi	t1_htjfb11	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8v6qi/why_doesnt_russia_just_cut_off_gas_going_to/htlbm87/

As a grand child of Serbian I read a lot about Russian - Serbian relationship, and tried to know as much as I can find. For instance yoy may find that kind of information in school history books about how Russian Tsars had wars with Turkye on Balkans to liberate Slavic ortodox christian people. There it is always underlied similatity between Russian and Serbian, cirillyc alphabet, close language, the same faith and so on.   I can't remember that kind of atitude to the any other nation in historic books.   May be I just saw what I whated to because of influence of my heritage.   My grandpa told me a lot of stories how he lived before WW2, how he fought Nazy with a rebels, how they moved to USSR after war because of Tito repressions. I always wanted to see Serbia and to be in the places where my family lived. In 2014 I've been there, in Belgrad, in Novy Sad.

I worked only in governmental institutions, they have all the qualification requirements in place for job positions, so I doubt a random dude would do something sensitive to be honest the bar is too high, we can't find assistants whose job is actually 99% washing floors and filling journals because someone up there set the requirement of higher education for that position.  I can change a lightbulb if it's necessary, any sensitive head of the lab would cover up my (and their) ass if something goes wrong, but what's the point? I have mice to poke, full time engineer and repairman has yheir jobs to do. The only thing that is dedinitely not in place is unloading the supply of animal feed and bedding once in several months. It's definitely not the job of scientific personnel but that's a normal practice, I worked in smaller labs that mostly fund themselves and there you either do it this way or run unaffordably tight on budget hiring excessive number of specialists for one-timr tasks.	1642772314.0	htlh3rf	t3_s99uwe	t1_htleoz4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s99uwe/how_much_does_government_regulation_affect_you_in/htlh3rf/

cg87p	Honestly, at this point for me the question is not "why I like Putin" but rather "why is he better than the alternative". All his rivals select absolutely terrible people. Either businessmen or radicals or Zhirinovski, who is the national laughing stock by now. Many will point to Navalny, but he himself was charged with money misappropriation numerous times way before he started to feud with Putin. I wouldn't want a guy like that in charge of our already suffering economy.   Overall, he's the best of what is available right now. He provides *some* national stability and has implemented laws towards safety nets for the citizens, even when I admit these safety nets are triggered way more frequently than somewhere else due to conditions of living.	1642773290.0	htlj7sg	t3_s93aij	t3_s93aij	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htlj7sg/

2cpox0re	Yeah i was trying to jokingly day that we're a little poorer in terms of owning vast properties, so we rarely get contacted by the duly elected and legitimate city counsel to discuss how high the tower I'm going to build may be.   But it's true that on the dawn of the Russian independence and "capitalism" everybody was allowed to be considered an owner of their apartment and dachas. Authorities aren't enforcing any weird and illogical regulations preferring just to work as slow as possible to solicit a bribe, so that no one asks how the hell did they get their job and why they are so lowly paid. Just bribe and forget. Or recently you don't even have to bribe, just register everything electronically.  But one thing is becoming getting noticed i must say: the regulations on bank transactions. This shit is evil, and they point fingers to the West saying that in the West the anti fraud, anti money laundering provisions are even stricter, and our terrorists are much more evil so they need to know and control every penny you send across.

3voewa0k	Once more I have to stress that the state does not take anything from the salary.  Even the income tax that is paid by the employees is subtracted before they receive any money, and the employer acts as a tax agent.   The rest is NOT subtracted from one's monthly salary. If, by some act of god, these fees get cancelled overnight you won't get a single kopeck increase of amount received.  I suspect that while the list of expenses is similar in both countries, the percentage is way different. Like, how big is your monthly payment for the college loan?	1642774041.0	htlkvan	t3_s8ef0t	t1_htlf0e2	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ef0t/culture_shock_us_and_russia/htlkvan/
l6v2byz	Sure, but do they?   Speaking of Russian authorities, many high-ranking ones would flee if it smells like fire altogether with all the stolen stuff to their estate and families in Italy or London. And the glorious Western world would never give (and more importantly - the stolen money) back into the hands of evil Russian prosecution.    And that's not just authorities. Rostovites have a living evidence if a living evidence of a developer, who burned down a damn district to free himself space for construction, and when the police took his track he was already in Spain asking for refugee status as repressed sexual minority (despite having wife and son). And he got it, with all the illegal gains he earned before he got exposed. Of course I can blame it on corrupt and lazy enforcement but they're no different in this regard. You can always just make money in least legal ways and when you get exposed you'd be already with n-th most powerful passport counting how many generations of your kids ahead you can put to Oxford. If they ever reach for you just say you once badmouthed Putin and ~~KGB~~ FSB is after you because of that and live on.	1642774226.0	htlla46	t3_s88hyn	t1_htljshj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s88hyn/are_government_officials_paid_well/htlla46/

4w1e7h1p	All russian women i have met somehow worship money and manipulative more than any women from other countries i have met and not just them but all those eastern women seem to be like that. I went to study as well in east asian in china and south korea for language and some programs and they are many Russians who try to escape the country accepting any form of job like stripping, modeling while meeting old rich asian men in bars and ktv at night for fast cash as well the students do illegal jobs to make money, some come from poor families but some just want to use their youth and benefit it. Many told me that’s how they are raised and some told me they don’t believe in love but what can a man provide so it means when they have an opportunity they won’t let it slip away or else it’s such a waste. And honestly i don’t find them really that beautiful they look like many European women, their bodies aren’t that great and many smoke to much, i realized there is tons of countries in the world and some women really modern take care of themselves but have great values and don’t do anything for money as well have some charm and sexiness in their personality for example the Moroccan women as well other Countries that even we take example their worst hoe saw can’t be in the same level as the russian women, my friends all noticed that and i think people just don’t talk about it. I gotta say russian women are so overrated because i saw saw beautiful women and down to earth not arrogant or rude from other nations they even age better and have naturally beautiful curvy bodies that many wish to have. It’s good to have our own experience to understand something and i’m gonna say that after living with many russians i realized they are not my type at all and how much overrated they are and their men seem no existent and have no presence because most just hang out go for a drink and that’s it they seem not into their own women.	1642775033.0	htln3z8	t3_guah97	t3_guah97	/r/AskARussian/comments/guah97/how_common_are_gold_diggers_in_russia/htln3z8/

Можно даже найти устав НАТО и т. п. документы.  > Если НАТО создавался против СССР, но НАТО не враг, то какой был смысл в существовании до событий 14-го года?  НАТО не создавался конкретно против СССР. НАТО создавался по выводам, сделанным после Второй Мировой, когда одна страна успела подмять пол-европы более слабых стран, пока большие и сильные страны либо хлопали ушами, либо занимались другими конфликтами. И продолжалось это пока наконец большие не поняли, что надо объединиться и бить толпой.  НАТО создавался с целью, чтобы такого больше не повторилось, и если одна страна полезет на другую, сразу ей толпой навалять, а не ждать новых холокостов. И не важно, кто агрессор, нападение на одну страну приравнивается к нападению на всех в блоке НАТО. НАТО создавался не под СССР, а под любого вероятного противника, поэтому НАТО не потерял актуальности с развалом СССР. Собственно, поэтому после 9/11 в Афганистан отправились все страны НАТО, хотя нападение было на США.  >если НАТО не враг, то почему Россию не приняли в НАТО 2001 году  Я не эксперт, но в НАТО есть основные принципы вроде унификации вооружений между странами. Например, стандартные патроны 5,56 мм, магазины STANAG, базовые принципы организации войск, обучения, и т. п. А в России, естественно, были свои наработки и принципы, и перекраивать всю армию было бы глупо как с моральной, так и с финансовой точки зрения. Вряд ли это было основной причиной, скорее, одной из нескольких, но вполне себе причина.  По поводу агрессии НАТО против России, тут ИМХО очевидные двойные стандарты. НАТО стягивает войска и оружие к границам — караул, агрессия, ща нападут! Россия стягивает войска и оружие к границе — мы просто гуляем, это другое, понимать надо.  С точки зрения всяких небольших стран, им наоборот спокойнее, когда у них в стране есть войска и оружие НАТО, чтобы если что, никто не полез на них, не важно, Россия или ещё кто-то. Условный Израиль, Тайвань или Украина хотят в НАТО не для того, чтобы напасть на условный Ливан, Китай, или Россию, а чтобы условный Ливан, Китай или Россия не напали на них. А НАТО выгода в том, что в случае если условный Ливан, Китай или Россия всё-таки развяжут войну, навалять ему сразу, а не после того, как он захватит условный Израиль, Тайвань или Украину, и станет сильнее. Ну и стандартизация тем выгоднее, чем больше народа в ней участвует.	1642776679.0	htlr21h	t3_s93aij	t1_htl0xlv	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htlr21h/

171boy	Depends on who you ask really. Some people have this strong notion that Russia has been a longtime protector of Serbs and failed them in the 1990s. So it’s a mix of pride and guilt.        Others became really suspicious about the idea of brotherhood between peoples. They believe smaller nations, especially those that used to be part of the USSR, have been abusing their relationships with Russia, getting preferences without giving back and stabbing her in the back, when it suited them.        The notion is not particularly new. Dostoyevsky wrote some often-quoted passage in his personal diary about it back in 1877. This attitude is traditionally directed at Bulgaria, courtesy of which side they picked during the two world wars. And lately Ukraine gets much vitriol of that kind. But Serbia gets some flak from those guys too for trying to balance between Russia and the EU.        But for the majority of Russians, I suppose, Serbia is not that important. Some friendly Slavic nation in Europe that had a piece of it carved out by NATO.	1642776953.0	htlrqhk	t3_s98n2y	t3_s98n2y	/r/AskARussian/comments/s98n2y/serbian_here_what_is_your_honest_opinion_of/htlrqhk/

But telling that I am disappointed, or even questioning about it- would be rude, I would never do that. A guest has a choise and some reasons that I am not aware of. So if you want to go on be friends with this people, better find some reasonable excuse, cause there are some offensive and sensitive people. If you don't like people make you do things and even blame you for not obeying, they are just not as big friends as you thought they are.	1642777678.0	htltjog	t3_s9cb51	t3_s9cb51	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9cb51/russian_friend_upset_i_stayed_at_a_hotel_instead/htltjog/

Ofcourse you are right by stating that the truth lies somewhere in the middle and ofcourse Russia's behaviour can be rationalised.  But this is exactly what I disagree about with you. It is not the West that is threatening other countries, it is not the West forcing civil wars on other countries.  Even if Russia experience some discomfort with NATO being close to their borders, which is a unfair assessment in my opinion. Russia has not right to invade and annex other regions.  At the end of the day we need to chose, what is morally acceptable and what not. The fact something is logical does not make it right.	1642777729.0	htltoct	t3_s7uppw	t3_s7uppw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htltoct/

171boy	Porn is widely available in Russia and watching it is considered normal, at least in cities. It’s not a taboo topic per se, but more conservative people may shun porn, at least when discussing it publicly, on moral grounds.        Producing and selling porn however is a criminal offense in Russia, so individual sites may be blocked by ISPs as part of various court cases. Free porn effectively exists in a legal vacuum. I don’t recall any prosecution for possession of pornography, unless it involves minors or something. PornHub was forced to introduce a system that pretends to verify a user’s age, so that minors couldn’t get access.        Sex work is stigmatized, so adult actors don’t usually advertize to friends and family their profession, as far as I can tell. There is some drive to reduce it, and even mainstream media outlets can publish neutral or positive stories about, for example, adult webcam models.        There was a recent trend of authorities going after women, who post lewd pictures of themselves posing in front of churches, but it appears to be a fad that will likely blow out soon.        The situation may be quite different in highly conservative places in southern Russia.	1642779017.0	htlx09e	t3_s91uxn	t3_s91uxn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s91uxn/how_does_russian_perceive_pornography/htlx09e/

5fw0elli	Hello, as a resident of Siberia, I can advise you to first study the situation in the region to which you want to go. Look, if in the USA the main offices of large companies are located in more than one state and are even distributed across industries in different parts of the country. Then in the case of Russia, all the main branches are located in Moscow, even in cases where the main production centers are in the Urals and Siberia. This has led to an unequal distribution of tax revenues when all finances go to the capital.    So, the average salary in my city is four times lower than in Moscow.  Below is a link to a discussion of your question. Date of video: summer 2021. So most likely the information will be relevant to you.

I remember my mother getting a "food order basket" though her work at a factory where they would put together a few deficit items along with a few boring items no one wanted otherwise so that you could only purchase it all together. And people were happy to get them in November so that they could have a jar of peas and a jar of pickles for their traditional New Year Olivier salad. One couldn't get them otherwise.  And toilet paper was limited to a few rolls per person when it appeared in a store. I remember me playing outside with some friends and a woman coming to us and asking us to go in line with her so that we would pretend to be her children and she would get like 12 rolls instead of only 3 or 4.  It was early 80ies. Then late 80ies came with food stamps for everything from dry pasta and cereals to a bottle of vodka and a few packs of matches per person per month. Those who had children would use their stamps anyway so that they could then exchange extra vodka bottles for some other services like calling a plumber.	1642781200.0	htm2qcc	t3_s8yvfs	t1_htlau0r	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8yvfs/this_one_is_for_those_old_enough_to_remember/htm2qcc/

No countries do this besides Russia and China, and this is why most countries around the world don't like Russia.  Keep lapping up Russian propaganda.

Prostitues prefer to pay bribes that are way higher than fines to the police, because the fine ticket comes by mail to their official registration address(and it's frequently their parent's home), shows up in the criminal record, and it can absolutely destroy their personal life because sex work is frowned upon.

Cultural differences are a real thing just like back home in the States friends/people will sometimes offer something purely for the show of good faith with zero intentions of making good on that. I have traveled alot and found this to be a USA/Canada thing.  It's not uncommon for someone to say "let me know if I can help with anything" knowing full well that they have zero intentions of following through. In fact it's expected that you don't always accept. You will sometimes hear people complaining that "yes I mean I did tell him/her that I would help but I kinda just said it just to say it you know" like they know I can't help with that" etc etc this is not uncommon even among friends. It's kind like it's the thought that counts.   >If you directly said "no" and explained why - than everything is ok.

xcrun	>Russia did also invade Georgia not too many years ago. What was the reason for that attempt?  OSCE's report states it was Georgia who attacked first. You can find it in free access (you can also find their report on Ukraine btw). Not only Georgian military forces shelled Tskhinvali ***again***, they also burned to the ground Russian peacekeeper's base. Russian peacekeepers (as well as OSCE observers) were stationed in Ossetia after Georgia tried to pull the same exact shit in 1991-92. That alone could be considered as an act of war, which justifies an invasion as a retaliation strike in order to supress Georgian military forces and prevent them from repeating their attack.  to make it somewhat more clear, imagine if Iran decides to invade Iraq and burns US military base in process. The question is, how many hours will it take for Iran to cease to exist as a county in this case.	1642785881.0	htmfe4i	t3_s8ozot	t1_hthp60v	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/htmfe4i/

In most places in Russia, you can run water from a well, make a septic tank for sewerage, make heating and a septic tank. This is not a cardinal problem.   Therefore, a private house, which is not equipped with a central sewerage system, can actually be much better than an apartment in the city, which has sewage and running water.	1642786758.0	htmhsfg	t3_s9fkt0	t3_s9fkt0	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9fkt0/why_20_of_households_in_russia_doesnt_have/htmhsfg/

"**Левее левого, правее правого**" я и на моте не полезу, потому что это опасно. А велосипед ТОЧНО не заметят. Почему? Потому что левее левого и правее правого никто по зеркалам не смотрит. Тебя там не ждут. ВООБЩЕ, понимаешь? В любой момент может открыться дверца, кто-то может решить "подвинуться", кто-то захочет повернуть направо, когда мне надо прямо.   * Даже там, где для велосипедистов есть разметка, автомоболисты на нее кладут прибор.  * Ездить рядом с потоком, который мчит *как минимум* в два раза быстрее тебя — это пиздец стресс. Трафик надо разграничивать. Пешеход не должен выходить на проезжую часть. Велосипедист немногоим лучше пешехода.  * Край дороги обыкновенно предназначен для слива воды. Вся пыль и грязь с краю.   Спасибо за предложение, но я от него откажусь.     >вне часов пик   Это ночью, что ли?     >в Москве нет площади для этого.   А вот это неправда. Про Питер такое, наверное, еще можно сказать (давно там не был), а у нас места валом. "Я вам не скажу за всю Одэссу", но ВАО, ЮВАО, ЮАО и ЮЗАО — это родные мне края и места тут предостаточно.   Не забываем что можно: а) урезать/сузитьполосы, в) слегка урезать тротуар, г) запретить движение авто (в центре, к примеру, хватает мест, где улочки используются исключительно в качестве парковки), д) физически ограничить скорость и дать приоритет велосипедистам ([минутное видео на тему](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGOBOw9s-QM))   В центре ПОЛНО переулков, которые используются в качестве стоянок для новеньких мурзиков с прикрытыми номерами.   На окраинах ПОЛНО улиц, которые можно сузить и/или добавить отгражденную велополосу.     >На автотрафик бы хватило   На автотрафик *никогда* не хватит. Америка — живой пример пиздеца в этом плане.   Представь, что сейчас некий меценат решит подарить машины Северному Чертанову (а это, кстати, не такой уж большой район). У тебя один (один!!) человек резко превращается в кусок железа размерами 2х4.5 метра. Добавь к этому держание хоть какой-то дистанции. Все, про Варшавку можешь забыть. Трафик там будет красным весь день.  Другой момент: пропускная способность дороги равна пропускной спобосности пункта назначения. Простой пример: у тя полторы полосы хотят съехать со мкада. Съезд: одна полоса. Что мы получаем на выходе? 2—3 полосы мкада стоит.   Ты вот неудачный день для спора выбрал:    У нас, может, и не полная изоляция, но хватает народу, коротый дома сидит — раз.  Сегодня снежок выпал нормально так. Многие решили "нуивона, не поеду на машине" — два.   И чо? А ничо: несколько аварий и пробка в 8 баллов.   Открываешь карту, сморишь сколько там "зелененького" и спокойно конвертируешь в велодорожки. Проблема будет только с велопарковками в центре.  &#x200B;  >Хотя, стараниями Собянина и его администрации ситуация стала принципиально лучше чем была в нулевых при Лужкове   А с этим я и не спорю. Выселяют людей с дорог, заменяют автотрафик общественным транспортом. Так и надо. В этом плане у нас все классно.  Хотя, претензии у меня все равно есть.

In Russia, the Serbs have a historically good attitude, there are people who love Serbia so much that they do not notice the problems in its history at all. The minority, on the contrary, is skeptical, because they believe that because of Serbia, Russia got involved in the First World War and almost made the Third World War during the Yugoslav conflict (throw to Pristina).

The only outhouse I've seen in the last twenty years was at my friends dacha, and people rarely bother connecting summer houses to sewers, or building proper toilets - it's expensive and impractical, though of course you can build it indoors and have a separate collector beneath the house.

China is generally sad and longing.	1642788537.0	htmmpn2	t3_s9g3no	t1_html0q4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9g3no/are_russians_active_in_the_russian_stock_market/htmmpn2/
tz09x	I offer no commentary on Mr. Putin, but I'll say that the impulse to credit or blame the man at the top for big changes over which he had no or little control is a universal one.   An American president has almost no control over the price of gasoline, for instance. And yet when prices go up at the pump, his approval rating drops. Like clockwork.	1642788565.0	htmmsco	t3_s93aij	t1_htm5k7o	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htmmsco/

Some people use foreign brokers, like "Interactive Brokers", so they are out of this stat. We have two sock exchanges, MOEX is pretty much domestic only and Saint-Petersburg allows international trade. Most people prefer the latter to have less portfolios.   IPOs aren't on the radar of many russian companies because we are territorially huge, and there's little to no point in doing IPO when you can open an office in the neighboring region instead, so they are rare. Another moment is that many "russian" companies are juridically foreign, like Yandex. Statistically, most of IPOs on MOEX so far weren't worth purchasing, they were immediately dipping and never recovering, I recall that only a single company was in the green.  CHMF currently looks ridiculous with a dividend ratio of \~18% and having more actives than stocks\*price.	1642788591.0	htmmuxz	t3_s9g3no	t3_s9g3no	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9g3no/are_russians_active_in_the_russian_stock_market/htmmuxz/
9v2hcztb	If the case is at an official business meeting, then usually women also shake hands. But if there is a farewell or an informal acquaintance, then they rarely greet women and say goodbye by the hand (this may be, but often in a comical form on both sides). When I was a student and I liked a girl, I could even kiss her hand for forgiveness) I think this behavior is not due to some kind of humiliation of a woman, but because she is treated like a lady and does not want to touch her if the woman herself does not want it. In a friendly company, a woman can hug a man when meeting or saying goodbye if they are friends (men can do this with friends, but obviously less often).	1642788621.0	htmmy1a	t3_s97iu8	t1_htl7eki	/r/AskARussian/comments/s97iu8/greeting_amd_farewelling_as_the_russians_do/htmmy1a/

To respond to your other points:  >A) We don't need your assistance in "dealing with China"  Well good luck, you will either become their pawn or they will crowd you out of Asia. Russia cannot contend with China alone. Their military is already almost 3 times as big as yours and this gap will continue to grow.  >C) Your supposed "democracy" is nothing but an illusion. If it's not, go get elected without enormous financial backing by someone. Yes you can choose, but all your options are preselected.  We select the candidates in a primary then vote in a general election. Campaigns cost money, doesn't mean we can't pick our leaders. We also have term limits so no one can stay in power for too long.  What is your alternative? Just having a dictator like Russia? I'll take what we have any day of the week, it's no coincidence that we have less corruption (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index), a higher standard of living and more freedoms. With all due respect, you may not believe me but I sincerely want Russia to have a liberal democracy and become a wealthier, successful country.	1642789845.0	htmqbdf	t3_s7uppw	t1_htmpwaf	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htmqbdf/
9v2hcztb	A well-known science fiction film of the 1920s is Aelita (1924), based on the story of the same name by Alexei Nikolayevich Tolstoy.        Konstantin Tsiolkovsky took part in the creation of the film "Space Flight" (1935).        In 1961, the director of popular science films Pavel Klushantsev filmed Planet of Storms.        In the 1970s, Andrei Tarkovsky filmed the films Solaris (1972) and Stalker (1979).        The film Through Hardships to the Stars (1980) is devoted to environmental and social topics.    There are screen adaptations of the works of the Strugatskys "Night Watch", "Day Watch","It's Hard to Be a God" (I don't recommend watching the 2013 version unless you like underground movies, it's better to watch the 1989 version, although it's not an exact book either), Inhabited Island. Also the famous film "Kin-dza-dza!" is a comedic fantasy utopia on a capitalist society.  There are also cartoons, but now I remember only the wonderful cartoon "The Secret of the Third Planet" in 1981.	1642789848.0	htmqbo9	t3_s977y6	t3_s977y6	/r/AskARussian/comments/s977y6/can_anyone_give_me_some_names_of_good_russian/htmqbo9/

Sure, if I invited someone, I would really mean it, and if they declined, maybe I would be a bit disappointed, but not bitter enough to bring it up.  Actually, I face the same problem while visiting my relatives: they have more than enough space and are really hospitable, but I get the desire to stay the hotel (I don't,  because they become really upset when I bring it up). When I'm on vacation I tend to stay awake way past midnight and I don't want to inconvenience anyone by turning on a kettle or making any noise, even if everyone tells me it's not a problem. The reasons may be multiple: maybe I like to sleep in the nude, or listen to music, or soak in a bath for an hour, or snore or just need some peace and quiet for little bit.  I get they they are upset, but not that upset, a guest should have a choice.	1642791537.0	htmuop6	t3_s9cb51	t3_s9cb51	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9cb51/russian_friend_upset_i_stayed_at_a_hotel_instead/htmuop6/

qtuew	Russians always say, “what if Russia put nukes in Mexico or Canada”.   Ok, so what. What does that change? You launch 🚀 nukes, we launch nukes and we all die. Mutual assured destruction. That’s why there will never be an invasion of Russia or North Korean or any other nuclear power.   So, knowing that, what are Russian so afraid of? You’ll never get invaded.  Secondly, America’s neighbors don’t fear it. Go ahead, try to put nukes in Mexico. They’ll turn you down. America is no threat to Mexico or Canada. So they don’t need them. Mexico never has to worry about us annexing a portion of their country.

There are rules of war, but they often go out of the window when it comes to an actual conflict. If both sides not to decide to use all their military capabilities, we might as well skip the war all together and resolve a conflict by other means.

58oaoi2z	Все равно не очень понятно. Я предположу стандартную ситуацию: велосипедисты ехали по краю дороги, а, при пересечении перекрестка, "перестроились" к пешеходам.  Дальше только больше вопросов возникает. Если им можно было ехать прямо, то ты глубоко неправ и должен был их пропустить.  Если прямо им было нельзя, то они не правы, но я таки поясню за их логику: проезд на велосипеде на зеленый для пешеходов (и на крансый для машин) дает БОЛЬШЕ гарантий того, что тебя не переедет машина, поворачивающая направо. Если ты будешь стоять и ждать зеленого для машин, то: а) тебя могут не заметить, б) если тебя заметят, тебя десять раз пошлют во все направления сразу, в) тебя могут просто не пропустить.  Поэтому отдельные дорожки и лучше. Я вот даже [кортинко норесовал](https://i.imgur.com/ZREPjIV.png) (:   В случае "а" ты и в зеркало вряд ли глянешь (автомобилисты никого не ждут левее левого и правее правого рядов).

f43tzvk	Reading the comments OP, while there may be some cultural differences... also just no.      Your excuse for unclear / not great communication isn't the fact that people from overseas are wildly different. It's just easy to do that as the foreigner. I have lived overseas and have stayed for weeks or months in different countries. Good communication is always good communication, and most people will be understanding if you have clear reasons why or are communicative about them.     This reminds me of a post about someone and some russian gf / bf. I think people have this assumption that different cultures = totally different people as well. If you have good communication, it will go far no matter where you are. You should expect to treat Russians like X, Italians like Y, and German people like Z. General kindness, communication, and good people skills transcends languages.      So instead of trying to say "it's a culture difference", just stop at "maybe I should have been more communicative". People literally *everywhere* say stuff like "let me know if I can help" as a general just like end of convo thing. I lived in the holy social grail that is Japan, in which everyone is 100% respectful and kind and understanding - except it wasn't like that. People bullshit you all the time still. I'd argue I've been bullshitted more in Japan than any other country. Fake people are fake everywhere, and again good communication transcends whatever culture differences there may be.	1642792638.0	htmxosd	t3_s9cb51	t3_s9cb51	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9cb51/russian_friend_upset_i_stayed_at_a_hotel_instead/htmxosd/

ibck7	On the plan with no monthly fees tinkoff's charges are  terrible - 0.3%. I mean, come on, Sber or VTB offer 0.06% and 0.05% on similar plans with no monthly fees. Even more advanced plans are still more expensive considering that you would trade a lot more than on basic plan.  As for the language, I haven't found option to change it to English for Tinkoff or VTB apps. But VTB also offers QUIK option, so I guess you could access it via QUIK X app or via web terminal. It's meant for professionals and not as user friendly as the app though.	1642792817.0	htmy67g	t3_s9g3no	t1_htmu4bu	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9g3no/are_russians_active_in_the_russian_stock_market/htmy67g/

Not to moo Russian, speak Russian.  - You already have to have residence in Russia, either permanent or temporary (not on a tourist visa).  - No felony convictions, no drug misdemeanors.  - 35 pushups, 100 meters in 15 seconds, 3 km in 14 minutes.  - If you satisfy *all* these conditions, just go to the nearest drafting point.  If you don't, don't go.  - One application attempt only.  No losers in the Russian military.  - If you become an NCO (and you will), there is a danger of losing the American citizenship (you either need to fight the US or be an NCO to qualify for that &mdash; go figure, someone had a bad time with his sergeant).  But this comes with the caveat that you need to intend to relinquish your American citizenship.  If you fight the US, it's assumed proven that you do.  If you are just an NCO, then you can say that you don't, and then you are safe.	1642793618.0	htn0dka	t3_s9ia7d	t3_s9ia7d	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9ia7d/citizenshipmoving_to_rumilitary/htn0dka/

Trader plan is 290₽ per month except if you haven't traded this month, hold their premium car (which has own fees), traded more than 5 mil ₽ worth of shares or just have more than 2 mil ₽ in your portfolio.

Have a trading volume of 6 millions rubles or more during last year, with at least 1 trade per month and at least 10 trades per quarter  3. Have at least 3 years of experience working with financial assets, or 2 years in a company which is itself a qualified investor. Also it have to be a position involving trading, being a janitor will not pass). In practice very few people can apply via this channel.  4. Have a higher education from a university with an accreditation to attest students as professionals of financial market.

But honestly most of time it is usual that the ICE for example arrives have 5-10 ten minutes late. But that happens in my experience more in the evening then in the morning because you have a full day of traffic already done and that is still good compared to other countries. And also you should know that there is a lot of construction going one on the rails … so I would say it depends and it is still great.

And they also cut up the end where he said:  >See how you can inflate such terrible scenarios based on nothing!

15cqtc	My European experience is about Switzerland, Italy and UK. Healthcare is probably better than in some Russian shithole, but *definitely worse than in big Russian cities*. You only get tests or treatments or even a visit to a specialist if it looks like you are in a really bad state. Before the pandemic, it was easier to just go back home to see a doctor. We had some really dangerous experience with this inefficiency.   Next, there are less convenient things for an average person. Like, in Switzerland, if you work full hours, you can only shop on Saturday. In other countries, it's not so bad, but, still, forget those 24/7 supermarkets or delivery. Same with plenty of electronic services and stuff like that. Sometimes, it feels like I'm back to USSR lol. My bank in Italy requires visits *to the same branch the account was opened* to solve anything. Wtf? Yh, Sberbank did that in my childhood, but even they are not so bad now.  Internet is slow and expensive, I had better one in Russia right when dial up stopped being a thing.  Oh, and it's fking cold in winter.

И мир наполнился бы русскоговорящими беженцами.  Даже то, что в 90-х происходило - можно смело назвать геополитической катастрофой.  Но есть и плюсы для всего мира - те деньги, которые были выведены из умирающей России - хватило, чтобы население всей планеты стало жить лучше. Можно было бы и дальше разворовывать несчастную Россию, конечно, но что то  случилось.

As far as I know, for a car with a year of manufacture older than 2008, and an environmental class below EURO-4, it is difficult or impossible to obtain a safety certificate (SBKTS). Therefore, it can only be imported for spare parts, without the possibility of driving it on public roads.	1642800312.0	htniyla	t3_s9ho1c	t3_s9ho1c	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9ho1c/illegal_japanese_cars/htniyla/

4m2hzwy	WTF are you talking about? How old are you? The survived guy in 90ths... Do you know the whole amount of money modern criminals from the government have stolen and transferred abroad since 2000? No one in 90ths couldn't even dream about it! Your KGB-lord built the most tasteless and expensive castle in all the world. For no reason, just because he can take state budget money and use it as his own. His relatives, friends, lovers are extremely rich. Can you name somebody from your awful 90ths who had so much money?    There are calculations about what citizens of Russia could get if that money uses to rebuild the country. They could just bury old moldy towns and cities and build new state-of-arts ones. But that means people just destroyed all chances and hopes for the country's recovery. And what you just said about falling and dividing the whole country that is the future, not the hypothetical past, and no one of the other states or governments will be responsible for that but the Russian one.	1642801946.0	htnni2p	t3_s93aij	t1_htnenzm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s93aij/putin_question/htnni2p/

In a real war, before tank battles begin, they must have fuel, be serviceable, survive rocket and artillery strikes, air raids, and simply reach the battlefield (which I suspect will a big problem for all tanks not from Russia on the territory of the Russian Federation). Only in this case, some technical solution will theoretically be more effective if it works, and the conditions of a real war are always a problem, because there is a risk that the system requires careful service in a well-equipped service center.	1642802301.0	htnohbl	t3_s9h5sw	t3_s9h5sw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9h5sw/how_confident_are_you_in_russias_current_military/htnohbl/

"Я ебал думать, как это написать на английском" - "я счел размышления о том, как это написать по-английски, чрезмерно сложными, и не стал ими заниматься".	1642802690.0	htnpj7r	t3_s96h2g	t1_htn7nee	/r/AskARussian/comments/s96h2g/is_последнее_китайское_предупреждение_a_real/htnpj7r/

So, porn sites were told to verify the age of their viewers. For example, pornhub followed this directive and now it asks you to verify your age through vk.

iliiffh	Real advances in hardware are invisible, hard to estimate and some are unknown. I mean, mentioning Beryl as a factor in context of conventional war between West and East sounds _very_ stupid, even if you're a proud Pole.  Organizational structures, communication, detection, jamming, acquisition and guidance is the key.  It's far beyond the detail level of CoD and even ArmA. Far more esoteric and less known.  In the past Soviet defence systems often failed miserably at least in the hands of its buyers. But I can't guess about the present state. Saudis still suffer from Soviet vintage tactical missiles, Western tanks are far from invulnerable even though they don't launch their turrets into the stratosphere as merrily as soviet self-propelled barbecues, and I don't know how modern Russian SAMs will cope with Western attempts to suppress it and didn't we reach the stalemate resembling the trench warfare where even stealth planes can't fly their missions in the areas covered by modern air defence?

3mo9k6lf	What's the point of all this ? He betrayed your trust, he betrayed you. Being a traitor is shitty already. You're the good person, not him. He'll understand that later. If he won't..well, fuck him. Be above all this. The good thing is that he uncovered himself before you got married and have children.   I think the most hurtful will be just being calm. Completely calm. Like "You cheated and our relationship is gone ? Ugh, no biggie." No insults, nothing. And one more thing. When you go to his apt - you have to look real good. Nice clothes, makeup etc. Show him that you feel very fine without him.	1642806628.0	htnzz4t	t3_s9kfzm	t3_s9kfzm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9kfzm/how_do_i_make_a_russian_man_cry/htnzz4t/

However, if not for such military buildup near Ukraine this unlikely accession would take many decades, while right now Ukraine could be taken up in a matter of months given it's occupation is seen as like the biggest european stabilty risk till Hitler.

eqs0s	The only difference in your perspective is US and Russia negotiations regarding NATO troops in countries that joined in and after 1997.     Russia's position that fewer troops there and no ballistic rockets is required for whole European security. US has not given an official position on this but Biden and others said it shouldn't be Russia's business what they do in NATO's borders. Russia's position is the same regarding their troops within their borders.     This is not about Putin's prestige, but about overall security of Europe. Russia's officials gave vague threats regarding failure in negotiations.     Including Ukraine and perhaps other countries in NATO will lead to further escalation and perhaps war between the alliance and Russia. Russia has communicated the red lines and this is one of them.	1642806863.0	hto0kkv	t3_s9nbf0	t1_htnyrfp	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9nbf0/why_is_russia_threatening_ukraine_if_it_is_the/hto0kkv/

But russian gov sending troops to Ukraine borders seems to have a likely outcome of Ukraine joining NATO fast as the main barrier - support among NATO members - increases every day now.

I've never had covid. I got vaccinated by single-shot Sputnik lite last month just to get the code. It wasn't what I wanted to do but I decided that being able to go to the gym is critical for me due to lack of activity caused by remote work. Vaccine hit me hard, I know that many people don't suffer that much. But gosh. I understand the fever, chills, aches, headache but why I got such a horrible pain in reproductive organs?

t564j	I think the stamping boarding passes is a security thing. It's becoming more common in most airports for international flights. It's not just in Russia, it's all over. Some places also put a security sticker on your passport.  Right, my point was you can't even get a boarding pass online anymore. Depending on what passport you have/your destination, this used to be easier and faster, the lines to check in were not that bad. But now it's much slower since you can't get boarding passes online and all the Covid related stuff has to be checked at the counter.	1642810635.0	htoa0s9	t3_s88p1e	t1_hto3woa	/r/AskARussian/comments/s88p1e/what_are_airports_like_now/htoa0s9/

Macedonia had one, and it failed due to abysmal turnout amidst boycotts. They joined NATO regardless. And the question asked was manipulative, because it rolled NATO membership, EU membership, and country's name change all into one.

You can also find it [here,](http://lurkmore.to/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%90%D0%A2%D0%A1). if you know Russian.  Layer 1: the phrase "ебучий шакал" ("fucking jackal") originates from a copypasta of a prank phone call with a particularly disgruntled woman, which is found above.  Layer 2: the usage of this phrase together [this particular image.](http://lurkmore.so/images/3/31/Zip-01.jpg) "You compressing again, fucking jackal?".  Layer 3: apparently the first time the above picture was used, it was to describe something other than jpeg compression artifacts, and so the effect was added on top later when somebody repurposed it for that context.  Layer 4: the image in this thread, that uses Tabaqui the Jackal from the soviet cartoon "Mowgli" based on Kipling's "The Jungle Book".

7frvbti9	The trouble is the ambiguity and no signs of improvement in the near future. Is trouble likely right now based on saying things in public in general? Maybe not. But this is counting on no one WANTING to be able to cause an issue for you, and it relies on things not getting worse than they are now. If someone is looking to cause trouble for you, having a law that any public statement you make that describes being gay as anything other than negative if in front of a minor as being illegal propaganda is pretty broad. It gives a lot of ability for someone wanting to cause you trouble to cause you that trouble.  If things get worse for LGBT people/rights in Russia going forward, could things you say or associations you make now harm you in the future? Is it possible that there are some jobs in Russia where it could be problematic for a person if it is known that their child is gay? If things get worse, could you be putting them at risk going forward? Where do you see things going for gay people and organizations in Russia in the next 1 to 5 years? Better? It seems unlikely. Worse seems more likely. Say you have even a communication with a gay rights organization recorded, and then they are later branded an extremist organization. How does that go for you? Could it cause trouble with renewing a Russian passport? Any challenges when trying to re-enter Russia?   Honestly, yes, I too sometimes think he may be a little paranoid about it. But he is the one who grew up in Russia, an he knows more about what it like to be gay in Russia than I do. And I think there's enough potential for problems now or going forward that I ultimately try to understand his caution in trying to protect his family and his continued ability to see them in person.	1642818214.0	htos8ke	t3_s79eia	t1_htap5d4	/r/AskARussian/comments/s79eia/question_regarding_gay_couples/htos8ke/

hwp3hyyb	In 2019 I bought Toyota Aqua on Japanese auction. To pay less customs duty the car shall be between 3 and 7 years old. So mine was 3 years old and had 4,5 points out of 5, means very good state, just minor dents. I used a company here in Irkutsk where I live, their commision was 50000 rubles. So they organized the whole process: the put a bet in auction system, the did all the papers in Japan, they booked the vessel, broght my car to port in Vladivostok, did customs clearance and booked a lorry till Irkutsk So I just picked up my car here and went to insurance office and to road police to register it and get numberplates. In Japan my car cost 350000 rubles + 350000 customs fee and other shit like glonass, utilization fee. Right steering wheel is popular and not banned (yet). Why I didn't buy my car in Russia? I was scared of welded-back halfs, scared to get the car that was flooded before, scared to get a car restored after a crush. So I paid my money and enjoy my safe and practically new girl.	1642821463.0	htozwzr	t3_s9ho1c	t3_s9ho1c	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9ho1c/illegal_japanese_cars/htozwzr/

So get rid of social networks for a few days and spend it in most relaxing circumstances :3  You can’t change situation but just feed your anxiety. So take a break. And see later what will happen. Probably there will be no critical issues with the world cause even politics loves simple things and they understand what is on the map today.	1642822397.0	htp21be	t3_s7uppw	t1_htd0h28	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htp21be/

5mift	That's completely false, Ukraine is not Belarus. The majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian in daily life and in the streets. Russian-speaking Ukrainians are mostly immigrants from the Soviet period. If you download any language-learning exchange app you will talk to tons of people who speak Ukrainian as a native language, use Ukrainian at home and with friends, and know Russian just as a secondary language. Cities like Lviv in western Ukraine are majority Ukrainian-speaking. There are more Russian speakers as you go further East, like Xarkiv and Odessa, but Ukrainian is a very active language in Ukraine and it's very much in use.	1642822917.0	htp383i	t3_s7uppw	t1_htohbzp	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htp383i/

i6kdupde	Just thinking about it, so many spheres of life on Russia seem so uncontrolled compared to Western countries, for example the changing a light bulb not by yourself and what not. Like here people break some walls in their apartments for more room and when police find this out they say they didn't know. It feels surreal that you can do something as severe a crime as that (it's literally threatening the integrity of the house) and fly under the radar for a long time.	1642824486.0	htp6qk5	t3_s99uwe	t1_hto0uh9	/r/AskARussian/comments/s99uwe/how_much_does_government_regulation_affect_you_in/htp6qk5/

3y1jod1k	Well, the reality is pretty simple.  She could figure out, what made him cheat and either fix it or leave it be. In that case she would keep the relationships going, moving forward, giving more time to change the outcome. Because when you love, you do everything in your power to stay with that person. That is love.  Yet, she freaked out, broke up, became revengeful. Seeks help online on how to hurt him. Pure immaturity and an egocentric behavior. That's not a love.  So, to sum it up, it took her fast enough to break up with him, meaning there was no love, if there was no love to begin with, circumstances point to the fact, she is the sole toxic reason of the whole situation.  It's her own fault.	1642827896.0	htpdn3u	t3_s9kfzm	t1_htpcgul	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9kfzm/how_do_i_make_a_russian_man_cry/htpdn3u/

9maagmcc	Но я ведь не вру. Я согласен с тем, что в первые 7-8 лет правления Путин делал правильные вещи. Вытащил страну из кризиса, сохранил её целостность, провел ряд критически важных и удачных реформ. В общем, заявил и делом подтвердил, что Россия не сломается подобным образом. Но вот что он делал в свои последующие 12 лет правления? Где рост и развитие? Где образование, медицина, собственное производство, культура? Посмотрите на любую сферу человеческой жизни в России, разве нельзя сделать лучше? Он же управляет самой богатой страной мира, чего он добился за последние 12 лет? Рассорился со всем миром, расставил своих друзей на все важные посты, подчинил себе судебную и законодательную ветви власти. Он просто крутит гайки, ежедневно что-то запрещает и держится за трон всеми руками и ногами. Я знаю о чем говорю, тут нет места инфантилизму, наивности и навальному. Путин начал как президент, сейчас является просто плохим и властным менеджером, а скоро будет плохим диктатором.

geu83wtm	Вообще-то лжете. Среди моего окружения есть только один человек, который его не поддерживает - а круг общения у меня о-очень большой и там люди серьезные, взрослые, а не навальновские подростки. И это тоже срез статистики.  Если вы не видите "рост и развитие" - может, вам надо поменьше читать методичек навального и посмотреть вокруг?... Самый элементарный пример - в 2013 году в российских магазинах было 50 на 50 товаров нашего и импортного производства, а что сейчас?... 90% товаров - нашего производства. Или вы скажете, что я лгу?  Про "рассорил нас со всем миром" даже мне тут не начинайте - я вас старше на 10 лет и хорошо помню 90-е годы, все мое проклятое детство в них прошло. И как люди тогда жили, и как хвалил нас запад - помню тоже. Я уже давно замечаю - чем хуже у нас жизнь, тем больше нас запад хвалит; чем лучше у нас жизнь - тем больше он нас ругает)   Торговать и заключать выгодные контракты это нам ничуть не мешает, а западный вой помогает западу сохранить лицо - так что не устраивайте здесь моралистический детский сад..)

ansvphu6	Yes, Stalin personally shot a billion, and also ate babies for breakfast.   The GULag stands for "the main directorate of the camps." It was the NKVD unit in charge of the labor camps, and not the camps themselves (and then in the Western mass culture there was a tendency to call individual prisons and colonies gulags, and even in modern Russia). In 1960, the GULag was converted into a GUIN. Now it is called the FSIN and is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice.  Brief transcripts of paragraphs of the infamous article 58: treason to the Motherland; armed insurrection; communication for counter-revolutionary purposes with a foreign state; assistance to the international bourgeoisie; inciting a foreign state to war; espionage; sabotage; terrorism; sabotage; anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda; organizational counter-revolutionary activity; non-reporting; active struggle against the working class under the tsarist system or during the civil war; counter-revolutionary sabotage.  In reality, the number of convicts under article 58 was about 4 million people, of whom 800 thousand were sentenced to the highest degree. This number includes those who were subsequently rehabilitated (including during the first wave of rehabilitation in the late 1930s), as well as those whose sentence was not carried out. It should also be taken into account that Article 58 was often applied to criminal offenses: the murder of the chairman of the collective farm was considered political, even if the murderer had no political motive, and the theft of a sheet of stainless steel to cover the shed turned into sabotage if the plant was defensive.  How many people have suffered innocently? The fact is that there are a lot of people engaged in research, and, for example, Egor "bad signal" Ivanov, checking stories about innocent convicts, did not find any such. Upon careful inspection, it suddenly turned out that the "innocent convict" was either a bandit, or helped the Nazis, or something in the same spirit, and the the funniest case was with a person who, through the efforts of the authors of the legend, became convicted under Article 58 of the Criminal Code of the BSSR (measures of social protection of a medical nature). For this reason, all the claims that "many suffered innocently" without specific names, articles and other identifying features, according to which a request can be made to declassified archives, are suspicious and unfounded. I do not claim that there were no judicial errors at all, I only insist that their number did not exceed the margin of error for any justice system at all. And it's a completely brazen lie that the security officers shot someone without observing bureaucratic procedures. One of the reasons for the increase in the number of "innocent convicts" was the hunt for cash payments to "victims of repression", which is why many citizens turn to the archives with family legends and suddenly find out that their ancestors were convicted not for "three spikelets", but for rape, not for an anecdote about Stalin, but for participating in a gang and killing women and children, and so on and so forth. Well, considering that at the moment the government is full of descendants of various interesting personalities (guess who the great-grandson of the author of The Lena Massacre is working with now?), who for some reason were not shot in 1937, it is quite natural that they, for fear of repeating something like this, sponsor in every possible way any denigration of the actions of the chekists both in art (the only film where NKVD officers were not shown as bloodthirsty ghouls - filmed in the Republic of Belarus) and in the controlled press. In general, "I don't need proof - I'm telling the truth" is about them. Still enemies of the people.  During the deportations carried out by the Soviet government, a significant number of representatives of various ethnic groups were forcibly resettled. The most extensive were the deportations of Chechens and Ingush (up to 500 thousand people), Volga Germans (about 450 thousand people) and Crimean Tatars (about 150 thousand people). The exact number of deportees is unknown, but, obviously, is in the range of 1.2-1.3 million people.   During the agrarian reform of 1929-33, a policy of dispossession was carried out. Contrary to popular belief, it did not always involve exiles or arrests of former kulaks, but almost always - the seizure of property. In total, about 4 million people were dekulakized, but about half a million successfully protested this decision.   Almost immediately with the establishment of the Soviets, it was decided to deprive the enemies of the regime — representatives of hostile classes and their relatives: merchants, exploiters and clergymen - of their political rights. The Constitution listed specific types of activities, the occupation of which led to a defeat in rights. It is curious that the same articles of the Constitutions of 1918 and 1926 mentioned among the "deprived" and mentally ill people. The 1937 Constitution abolished this practice.  During the Soviet period there were three famine periods: 1922, 1932-33 and 1947. There are no exact figures for the first of them (approximately the figures are called within 3 million). The excess of real mortality over its trend for the famine of 1932-33 was 2.5 million people (B. Urlanis (1974) - 2.7; S. Wheatcroft (1981) - 3-4; B. Anderson and B. Silver (1985) - 2-3; R. Conquest (1986) - 8; S. Maksudov (2007) - 2-2.5; V. Tsaplin (1989) - 3.8; E. Andreev et al. (1993) - 7.3; N. Ivnitsky (1995) - 7.5; the State Duma of the Russian Federation (2008) - 7), for the famine of 1947 - about 300 thousand. Historians Kondrashin, Winter and the materials of the MSU scientific conference cite much larger numbers — during the famine of 1932-33 — at least 5 million, during 1946-47 - from one and a half to two million. The question of how much the hunger strikes were caused by the agrarian policy of the Soviet government, and how much by objective reasons (for example, an unprecedented drought in the summer of 1932, although the historian Kondrashin believes that in general the weather conditions in 1932 were quite favorable) remains open. Nevertheless, in the then Polish, and therefore not collectivized Western Ukraine and Belarus, there was a famine, and as if not more severe than in the USSR. However, we must not forget that the first occurred immediately after the end of the devastation associated with the civil war (and with the drought: [https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/86233.html](https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/86233.html) and with a prodrazverstka: [https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/63796.html](https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/63796.html) [https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/6936.html](https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/6936.html) and let's not forget about the Soviet authorities: https://d-clarence.livejournal.com/7364.html), and the third - related to the Great Patriotic War, the second somehow unsuccessfully coincided with collectivization (plus weather conditions in Ukraine: [https://nazar-rus.livejournal.com/45126.html](https://nazar-rus.livejournal.com/45126.html) [https://nazar-rus.livejournal.com/51045.html](https://nazar-rus.livejournal.com/51045.html) crop capacity: https://nazar-rus.livejournal.com/46244.html). There was also a famine in the capstans of Eastern Europe at that time... and it somehow unsuccessfully coincided with the Great Depression.	1642832918.0	htpmttk	t3_s9qfks	t3_s9qfks	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htpmttk/

ansvphu6	Another nuance that few people take into account even among historians: collectivization caused famine not by itself, like a curse, but because of extremely hasty and rough administration, which in fact violated all management in agriculture and it was simply not profitable for the peasants to engage in it. Having broken firewood and built an inefficient system, the authorities realized only by the mid-1930s and planted emergency bodies of the MTS Political Department, which relatively quickly pulled the situation and brought relative order, which was further pulled by collective farms and the city. Drought and other natural phenomena in this case acted as an aggravating circumstance, so that the severe phase of famine fell precisely on their period, 1932-33. This gives some citizens the right to blame everything on nature, not at all embarrassed that in 1932-33 the famine, unlike the famine of 1921-22, for some reason more affected the grain-producing areas. In fact, there was hunger a little before and a little after. This is especially clearly seen in the collection of documents: Kondrashin V. V., Mozokhin O. B. MTS Political Departments 1933-1934 - Moscow: Russian Book, 2017. Without going into details, it is worth noting that after the Civil War, it was about the same: the war—induced overdrawing destroyed both agriculture and the motivation to plow - and when the authorities caught on and began to gradually introduce NEP, drought and disease struck. Moreover, at first, the NEP also meant perestroika, inconsistency and the same confusion. As a result, more or less began to get out of hunger by 1923. Of course, from this fault the miscalculations of collectivization are only greater: the first time hunger can still be justified by a cruel mistake and forced circumstances, the second time it is harder to justify jumping on the same rake in much more favorable conditions. Actually, the most famous researcher V.V. Kondrashin often justifies this in his works.    When assessing the scale of repression or the number of victims of erroneous economic decisions, it should be taken into account that in total, more than 400 million people lived in Soviet Russia/USSR from 1917 to 1958 (statistics for those who wish: http://istmat.info/node/36423). In addition, since the early 20s, thanks to the rapid development of health care systems and, in part, education, the real mortality rate of the USSR population has noticeably decreased and fell significantly below the pre-revolutionary trend of its decline. The total decrease in mortality compared to the trend for the period from 1921 to 1953 gives 20.1 million people. The average life expectancy in Soviet Russia/USSR only during the interwar period increased from 30 (!) years in 1917 to 47-48 in 1940 (mainly due to a sharp decrease in infant mortality (and child mortality is the main reason for the decline in life expectancy. When they say that in the Middle Ages they lived for thirty years - this is what they mean. When a third of children die in infancy, adults need to reach at least 50, so that the average goes to thirty) and deaths from infectious diseases).	1642832989.0	htpmy2l	t3_s9qfks	t1_htpmttk	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htpmy2l/

It were acts of pure terror intended to deliver maximum casualties, knowingly perfectly in advance that bulk of them would be civilians. And I am not even talking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Concentration camps for ethnic Japanese in USA did not care about human rights much. People with any noticeable Japanese ancestry got into these camps that were no better than gulag in essence. Black people participating in WW II from US side were far from equal with the rest.   WW I had tons of examples of disregard to lives of allied soldiers. Gallipoli campaign was a poorly planned disaster that costed huge number of life’s from British colonies. French military who poured frontlines with soldiers from Africa who did not really know what they are fighting for, died in huge quantities.	1642836868.0	htpt5aw	t3_s9qfks	t1_htprrz7	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htpt5aw/
bvyiq	In finance, there is a tradeoff between the yield of fixed income securities (defined by the central bank's risk free rate) and the expected return of the market. The current rate offered by banks is high enough that many investors don't need to take the risk of the equity market. This is unlike the US and EU, where the rates are near 0 so investors have a higher expected return on the equity market even after accounting for the opportunity cost of not going into fixed income. Its p simple like that imo.	1642837034.0	htpted8	t3_s9g3no	t3_s9g3no	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9g3no/are_russians_active_in_the_russian_stock_market/htpted8/

1z49bw33	 >Why are you so salty  Apparently because:  >im dicking around on reddit?  Most of the present-day Stalin worshippers are merely the descendants of Nomenklatura families who evaded purges by worshipping Stalin in their day; for their grandchildren, this has been running in the family for quite some time by now. Whenever you see someone worshipping Stalin, you are probably talking to a hangman's progeny.  The demographic that wouldn't say great things about Stalin got killed off sometimes before they could have kids, sometimes along with the kids: do some research what [ЧСИР](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_members_of_traitors_to_the_Motherland) stood for and how the underaged children of Stalin's victims were summarily executed by a firing squad (the so-called 'socially dangerous children', overcrowded prison-orphanages would have their underage inmate population 'culled' on the excuse of *epidemic / riot prevention* which was but thinly veiled code language)  «All we have is the testimony of the survivors.

bci24ojc	**[Family members of traitors to the Motherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_members_of_traitors_to_the_Motherland)**     >"Traitor of the Motherland family members" (Russian: ЧСИР: члены семьи изменника Родины, lit. 'members of the family of a traitor of the Motherland') was a term in  Article 58 of the Criminal Code of RSFSR (as amended from the original wording of 1927). The amended Article dealt with the criminal prosecution of wives and children (kin punishment) of all people who were arrested and convicted as "traitors of the Motherland" in the Soviet Union during  Stalinist purges of the 1930s and later. The practice of automatically convicting wives and children was a base element of the Great Purge.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642837897.0	htpunuj	t3_s9qfks	t1_htpumfw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htpunuj/

I even remember a person saying "He was the only one to care about the common folk", lol.

1c96xp	> There is a legend that during the WWII Hungarians acted much worse than everyone else, and Soviet army did not take them as war prisoners for that. I have no idea how true it is.  The first part seems to be true if we count the relative scale of armies involved. Goebbels himself in one of his diary entries complains that Hungarians ruin his future plans, because their "pacification" activities consist of going from one village to another and murdering everyone in sight, and dead people can't grow food for you.  The part about war prisoners is likely a myth, because during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh offensive the Soviets did capture a significant number of Hungarian POWs. And the usual comparison of prisoners by nationality during the Voronezh offensive conveniently ignores the fact that by that time the Hungarian 2nd Army was already destroyed.	1642839512.0	htpx0vh	t3_s9oh18	t1_htour7x	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9oh18/what_do_russians_think_about_hungary/htpx0vh/

Well, again, in the same environment, the largest number of monarchists, etc. There are also Stalinists among the poor youth, they really don’t like their current state and for some reason it seems to them that if Stalin comes, he will definitely put them in charge of the local branch of the NKVD and they will finally be able to shoot the hated director of the store where they work as a loader.	1642839800.0	htpxg3j	t3_s9qfks	t1_htpumfw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htpxg3j/

Many of our citizens are not aware these thing happened because information was not readily available without the internet.  **Iraq, Afghanistan**  The public was motivated by 9/11  **for the global inflation that hits the poor countries the most**  I can not blame my parents for not being aware of this.    **inequality that increases every day**  Are inequality dose increase everyday. However, compared to the majority of country we are still VERY equal.  **life's that end without any shots fired**  Can you explain this I do not understand  &#x200B;  I do understand why other nations are angry about the US foreign involvement. Within are country's tradition this would be taboo. However, after both world wars many nations did need the US.

As a joke character he is a smart and funny old man. For example.  - Joseph, marshal Rokossovsky has a concubine! She is a beautiful and famous actress Valentina Serove. What will we do? - What we will do, what we will do... We will envy!  Gulags and other "scary" things is very exaggregated by propaganda.	1642841280.0	htpzk28	t3_s9qfks	t3_s9qfks	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htpzk28/

It's not about changing history, it's about actually defending history against relativising statements such as "all over the world it was basically the same".

The second case: in the 90s in the army at night shooting in the fall, the whole company saw a "Belgian triangle". The shooting stopped and in complete silence he circled in the distance above the forest, once making a very fast dash.  The third case: in the same place in the army, he walked at night alone to the training ground along a country road through the field. as from behind a hillock an iridescent smoky ball flew out, approached me, flew around and flew further.

One time it was from the same company that produces beer and the cashier wouldn't bother reading, another time the cashier was a "foreigner" (you know what I mean) and he really didn't fucking know if it's ok to sell kvass is alcohol or not. That's fucking insane. (Though they both did sell it eventually)  The excuse they tell me about alcohol free beer is that parents wouldn't be happy if their kids drink it. ???? First of all, I'd the happiest parent in the world if my child chooses to drink alcohol free beer instead of jaguar, secondly, many parents aren't happy if their kids eat chips and candies, just bab minors from shopping then.	1642844094.0	htq3gop	t3_s99uwe	t1_htpiuoh	/r/AskARussian/comments/s99uwe/how_much_does_government_regulation_affect_you_in/htq3gop/

Stalin addresses a big official audience with some wordy speech. (Of course Stalin gets portrayed with characteristic Georgian accent)   Suddenly someone in the room sneezes. The hall goes silent.  - Comrades, who have sneezed? - Says Stalin.    Noone responds.   - First row out. - Says Stalin.  Security brings the first raw out of the hall and executes them.  - Comrades, who have sneezed?... The audience stays silent.  - Second row, out.  The second row shares the destiny of the first one.   - Comrades, who have... - I, I did, comrade Stalin! - says someone from the last rows with a trembling voice.   - Bless you, comrade! - Says Stalin and continues his speech.	1642844870.0	htq4izf	t3_s9qfks	t1_htq0slm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htq4izf/

If liked classical borsch you should try a green one. There are different types of main green ingredient but I really like with sorrel.   Soup with meatballs. One of the main regular soup in Russia.   Okroshka! If you haven’t try it you haven’t tried Russian cuisine. It could compete with the borsch for who is more Russian.   Saury soup is also very common regular dish among many people. It is made from canned saury with a bit of rice.  Pea soup with smoked meats. I prefer with pork ribs but chicken legs is ok too.   Soup with fried sausage and egg. I don’t know why but kids are really love it. Including myself when I was a kid. But I don't mind trying it now.

3g1jmfsq	Ukraine isn't bombarding civilians, Ukraine is engaging in a military operation targeting separatists. That civilians get caught up in this is unfortunate, but it is not outside of realms of normal conduct of war. Russia's own conduct illustrates what is beyond it, and how meaningless are claims of Russia to be caring about civilians foremost. Especially considering it was again Moscow who initiated the war in the first place, by sending in men like Borodai or Strelkov and weapons. It is again Moscow who sustains this conflict by continuing its supply of weapons and insistence that Ukraine can not simply end this militarily. It is Moscow who ensured the war started, that it will keep going, and that it will never end. Blaming Ukraine for defending itself is rather meaningless. Unless Ukraine is expected to just turn on its back and accept becoming a part of Russkyi Mir, a decision that never worked well for anybody on Earth.	1642847765.0	htq8gf5	t3_s7uppw	t1_htq7m8a	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htq8gf5/

I am no historian, but i do know that the vast majority of people i talk to (mainly uni students, the uni has a fairly liberal or left-leaning student body) think he was a tyrant and the things that happened, especially the political repression campaign in the thirties, cannot be justified. Again, i'm not here to argue for or against that point, that is merely what i hear people say most often.

ms6e8	He is being kept on a short leash after his actions dragged Russia into the conflict.  Russia indeed participated there... in late 2014 and 2015. Only after Ukraine began shelling and bombing cities, and West did nothing to stop that.  Ukraine mistook Strelkov's occupation of Slavyansk for Russian invasion and ordered full-scale military operation against him and other dissenting Ukrainians. That was the root of the problem. Strelkov was trying to get Putin to join Donbass, same as he did with Crimea. Putin perfectly understood all risks and problems of such action, but Strelkov was independent actor. It took some time to forcefully remove him from Slavyansk, but he did enough to deteriorate relation between two countries to the dust.	1642850942.0	htqcv0n	t3_s7uppw	t1_htqbxyj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htqcv0n/

If in your design "yes, there were mass murders, but the industry was developing" you are satisfied that tons of cast iron are more important than human life, then I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist with suspected psychopathy or read a couple of books by humanist authors. Of course, there were also positive aspects, such as the victory in the war and relatively good architecture. But at the same time: the great architectural heritage was destroyed, hundreds of potentially unprofitable heavy industry factories were built, which naturally and safely died in the 90s, as well as collectivization, which is simply the highest crime of the Soviet government in its entire history. Absolutely monstrous price of human life, state banditry and arbitrariness. These are the things that first come to mind after many years of studying the Stalinist and the entire Soviet period.	1642851002.0	htqcy2u	t3_s9qfks	t3_s9qfks	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htqcy2u/

But also what's usually ommitted was that it was an airstrike on Strelkov/Girkin and his headquarters, with the pilot relatively narrowly missing the intended target building (a minute error by the pilot at high speed still sends projectiles hundreds of meters away).	1642852169.0	htqems8	t3_s7uppw	t1_htqdr17	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htqems8/

3g1jmfsq	No, because as Doctors Without Borders point out, the strikes against hospitals are widespread and systematic. There's very many medical establishments getting hit, and they get hit repeatedly. Sometimes, airplanes return to hit them again. They stopped sharing GPS coordinates, because even though fighting parties have them at disposal, they believe they are being used for targeting their hospitals. The syrian government too, by their words, directly threatened them with targeting the hospitals.  There's very many materials on this topic if you are brave enough to search for them yourself. I can give you some links to some materials dealing with the topic, but although you may discount this source or that source or this attack or that attack, the amount of sources confirming this and incidents where it occurs is overwhelming.

It started with attacks on medical staff treating protesters or wounded rebels, but it turned into widespread persecution of medical staff operating outside of their reach. In their minds, if they operate in rebel areas, they operate unsactioned, thereore they operate in defiance of authorities, and are therefore rebels themselves. Russia then just accepts these "rules of play" that their ally set out.	1642853221.0	htqg5ek	t3_s7uppw	t1_htqf5gc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htqg5ek/

1z49bw33	Нет, не щёлкает. Я знаю достаточно много людей, кто просто не ассоциирует себя ни с каким этносом, не молится ни на каких тиранов прошлого, etc. etc. Даже приметил: если человек не приписывает себе никакой идентичности, он почти всегда оказывается очень человечным. При этом у человека предки до седьмого колена могли жить где-нибудь под Брянском, быть (до XX века) православными, а поныне — русскоговорящими. Но при этом человек вообще не поднимает нац. вопроса, не желает никого захватывать от лица целого государства, не устраивает на новый год вакханалию, не помешан на наркотиках и развлечениях, скучных даже для обезьяны... Русский он или нет? Однозначно нет, т.к. сам он себя таким не считает, а называющие себя русскими задают своим примером абсолютно другие критерии.  И наоборот: самые остро переживающие свою особенную идентичность группы — например, хачи с чурками — переживают её такими общественно опасными способами, что кроме как унтерменшами я их назвать не могу. Увы. И русня в этой олимпиаде латентных людоедов далеко не на последних местах. Ну и под руку с ней идут беларусы, украинцы, поляки — которые никак не отличаются от русни по уровню вшитых в подкорку жажды крови, бытового хамства и мелочной подлости в обычной жизни каждого дня.  Мне кажется хорошей профилактикой всех, кто в оправдание цели кого-то хочет истребить, сгноить или иным способом подвергнуть эффективному менеджменту — подвергать примерно тому же, если этот кто-то уже начал прям так ощутимо-измеримо браться за свое и есть пострадавшие; а если он только собирается — то жёстко изолировать от любых рычагов управления (а в случае рецидива — и от общества, в отдельном Городе Дураков на Земле Франца-Иосифа, и вдоль берега колючку пустить; но не мучить и кормить нормально).  Наилучшая иллюстрация русскости, на мой взгляд — это Гражданская Война, где две (на самом деле больше) фракции творили не только друг по отношению к другу, но в особенности по отношению к мирным жителям невиданные зверства, хотя, вроде бы, называли себя носителями противоположных ценностных установок. Однако же вели себя одинаково по-русски до степени смешения.	1642855238.0	htqj8rb	t3_s9qfks	t1_htqgns2	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htqj8rb/

Because intervene, for example, Russia against America or England, what would NATO begin to yell about this?	1642858321.0	htqohf0	t3_s7uppw	t1_htqdfre	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htqohf0/
kxccq44	Well, no. What they tell.   Three in cruelty, Germans, Finns, Hungarians. There were real atrocities against civilians and prisoners.   The rest, the usual soldier's attitude to the population of the occupied territory. When it's loyal enough, when it's not.   Romanians, rapists and robbers. Italians are funny loafers. The Spaniards could be violent, but during the conflict, not for fun.	1642858361.0	htqok3m	t3_s9oh18	t1_htpluyg	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9oh18/what_do_russians_think_about_hungary/htqok3m/

h3qjoj2	On one hand, I never bribed anyone. Police, teachers, doctors, bureaucrats, ect. So in that sense, there's no corruption around me.  On the other hand, I walk on sidewalks not cleaned from snow, because there's not enough tractors and sweepers to clean, because money for buying them were partially stolen. I drive in buses that work for "black" cash and all the income from any bus line goes directly to some government official's pocket. Those buses drive on roads that break after two years, because why make a road that can last 10 years, when you can steal half, make a road that will last 2 years, and 2 years later get more money from the government to fix the road, stealing half again? With that kind of corruption, we deal daily, even though it's not really noticeable.	1642858625.0	htqp1p2	t3_sa1kaq	t3_sa1kaq	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa1kaq/how_bad_is_corruption_in_russia/htqp1p2/

3g1jmfsq	Of course, but this would imply more than total exchange of Soviet population in between 1917 - 1958 (a 41 year period). If I assume average Soviet who survived childhood died at 60, and compare the 60 years with the 41 years, it should be let's say 68% addition to baseline population + population increase of 74 million to final population number, and it would be still 319 million.  Of course, this doesn't deal with the nature of the population increase, which partially was caused by conquest, namely occupation of Baltic states and Eastern Poland+Western Belarus, Transcarpathian Ukraine, Eastern Romania, and maybe others. All of which would be accompanied by some straightforward repressions.	1642859389.0	htqqh7q	t3_s9qfks	t1_htqpuu8	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htqqh7q/

The pandemic is not over though and more real than a full scale war with Ukraine, even if they actually provoke by razing their eastern cities to the ground.

11s724	Get Beluga. Not sure how much you want to spend, but their normal level vodka is better than any other vodka on the planet. Belvedere (Polish) comes close though. And if you want to spend more, theres the Transatlantic Racing edition, Allure and the most expensive one, Gold Line. They are somewhat better than the entry level one, but not by that much honestly. The normal one is already so good, its hard to improve on it.  The most important thing though, if you are gonna drink shots, put the bottle in the freezer for a few hours before drinking it. Not fridge, freezer. It must be really cold, when you pour it, it will be thicker, almost a little bit jelly like.  And when you take a shot, have some cold or hot food to chase it down, anything works really but in Russia, pickles (cucumbers) or pickled herring are most traditional. But if you dont like those, honestly, any food works, you can even take a bite of pizza if you want lol, as long as you eat something after every shot, youre doing well.	1642859840.0	htqrcsd	t3_sa1tvc	t3_sa1tvc	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa1tvc/authentic_vodka/htqrcsd/

c0nna1mt	Ordinary people do not communicate with officials, we have multifunctional centers for this: an electronic queue and standard procedures for conducting any operations taking place through one window. 10 minutes and the documents are submitted. Then a few days later, a notification arrives on your smartphone that everything is ready. There is such a thing in cities and in small settlements. Some of the operations can be done through the Public Services application on a smartphone without getting up from the couch. Personally, I have not encountered any manifestations of corruption for 20 years. The only exception is obtaining a driving license. But that was a long time ago. I think there is corruption where there is a lot of money, for example in construction. There is everywhere for this.

h2ky4po9	It depends on the city , regional government, but in the whole- yes. And it impacts on mere citizens on daily basis. Example - I'm from small resort town. Local government received huge budget from federal government. The purpose- building a shelter for stray dogs ( cases of rabies and bites are growing, so something needs to be done asap). Money were acquired, but no shelter in sight. Only in papers. In the meantime, packs of stray and sometimes aggressive dogs are roaming on the streets. It's going to get ugly one day for sure, as we have a law in place, prohibiting you basically to defend yourself from an aggressive street animal. Also, crazy "animal lovers" who keep feeding them and promoting breeding on the streets, against spay and neuter program, because of "animal rights to reproduce" and other BS like that.

If the main reason people exist in society is to make money, then everything, including rules, is a commodity. And, of course, there are people who can trade this product. There is another interesting feature. Some "intellectuals" began to explain the difference in the development of countries by the so-called "level of corruption." This is an attempt to hide post-colonialism and historical reasons that do not fit into the current economic theories. It used to be explained by different races, but now it's not fashionable, so now it's all about "corruption" ...	1642863617.0	htqz6zb	t3_sa1kaq	t3_sa1kaq	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa1kaq/how_bad_is_corruption_in_russia/htqz6zb/

We do not have any special differences in attitudes, even with strong visual differences. Why should we somehow single out and treat the Germans negatively? Which, moreover, visually do not differ from Russians ...    In addition, you need to understand that if you are talking to a person who left his country, then for some reason he did not like it there (and this is not necessarily the reason that he openly talks about).

As part of a terrorist group he took over the country, killed a lot of people, lost a lot of land, and imposed an inefficient evonomic system, setting the country back many years in development.  Russia has only began recovering from his devastating incompetence in about year 2000. Until all people who have even lukewarm feelings towards him, his accomplices and their policies die off, there will not be an optimal level of development in Russia.	1642866426.0	htr5ml0	t3_s9qfks	t3_s9qfks	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htr5ml0/

Many of us (including me) only have one parent or grandparent who is a german-russian, while the rest are "normal" russians. So we actually originate from both nations. It just happened that many people took their german last name when immigrating to Germany in order to fit in better.	1642866485.0	htr5ro8	t3_sa4jwy	t3_sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/htr5ro8/

6cg4g	>Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians?   This is again an issue of English not having separate words for ethnic Russians and Russian nationals. We don't think Tatars or Chuvash to be ethnic Russians, despite them being Russian citizens, either. Russia has been multicultural since before it was a state, from the times Slavic tribes cohabitated with Finno-Ugoric ones. There are hundreds of different ethnic identities in Russia, so as for Volga Germans - of course, we see them as Volga Germans, not ethnic Russians.   That said, being Russian is not certified with a genetic passport, especially minding the diversity of features coming from hundreds of years of cohabitation and intermarriage. So as long as someone's willing to consider themselves Russian and thinks in Russian - it's good enough for most of us to join them in this opinion.	1642866881.0	htr6pw0	t3_sa4jwy	t3_sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/htr6pw0/

The division felt much sharper during the Soviet era, but even then it was not definitive. There are talks about 60s-people, but mostly they are from what we call "intelligentsia" (which I personally despise, but please don't listen to me on that). I also used to think younger people (80s+) are worthless because of how education has degraded, but it happened to be not true, as I've seen bright and intellectual younger people better than me at intellectual pursuits.	1643125530.0	hu5xtsy	t3_scevt8	t3_scevt8	/r/AskARussian/comments/scevt8/generational_divide/hu5xtsy/

If I say that people are eating out of trash containers, he’d say “America and the west are to blame!”. He calls our generation lazy, even though he’s been given free education, job assignment upon graduation, free apartment (because my grandpa was wwii vet). Apartment, which he privatized and kept in the 90’s.  Yes, they had it rough in the 90’s but I feel like their generation is still entitled.

nyr4w	This is a rather complex issue. First, some background. Back in the post-war USSR Russian was the dominant language throughout the Ukrainian SSR. It was, after all, the lingua franca of the entire union. Ukrainian wasn't banned, but the use of Russian was encouraged. Parents could opt out their children from learning Ukrainian in schools, and many happily did so. Ukrainian was still spoken frequently further west, as well as in more rural areas, but in larger towns Russian was almost everywhere. Thing is, the two languages are *very* similar. The grammar is almost identical, and they share probably the larger part of the vocabulary. Therefore, there was very little language barrier even if you didn't speak one of the languages. With just some basic knowledge you could easily hold a conversation with one person speaking Russian and the other Ukrainian.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, nationalistic tendencies became popular in Ukraine. Over the following years some people developed the opinion that the country cannot survive unless everyone spoke only Ukrainian. Over time, this sentiment grew, and those people got more power. Russian lost a lot of rights. Eventually there were strict minimums on how much media content had to be transmitted in Ukrainian (so you couldn't have a fully Russian TV channel, for example). All foreign films shown in cinemas had to be dubbed into Ukrainian. Higher education had to be only conducted in Ukrainian (though many ignored this requirement in Russian-speaking regions, but that was technically illegal). Any official business, even if you're only interacting with your local town council, had to be conducted in Ukrainian. If you bought medication, the piece of paper with instructions often only came in Ukrainian.  Meanwhile, Russian was still commonly spoken. I visited Kiev many times, and in the 90s and early 2000s I *almost never* heard Ukrainian spoken out in the street. Late 00s and early 10s I would hear some Ukrainian, but overwhelmingly predominantly Russian. Further east, in Donetsk, Kharkov, Lugansk etc. Ukrainian was almost never heard. In Donetsk pretty sure the only time I heard it "in the wild" was during Euro-2012 games when a lot of fans came from all over the country. In Crimea it was almost exclusively the tourists from the western parts who spoke it. There was more Ukrainian in rural areas as I said; mostly you'd hear the mix of the two languages called *surzhik* there. In 2008, Gallup polled Ukrainians all over the country about some issues. I don't remember the answers, but over 80% of people when given the option chose to take the survey in Russian. This should give you the understanding of how popular Russian was (and still is in many parts). And despite all that, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the rights of the Russian language were being curtailed. The language had absolutely no legal status. It was no different from English or Swahili.  Many politicians promised to deal with this issue, to give Russian some sort of status, to guarantee the rights of Russian speakers, in order to get the votes from the population. Almost nobody did anything. President Yanukovich, the one that got ousted in the 2014 coup/revolution, signed a law that allowed any language (including Russian) to be declared an official "regional language" in specific territories that would give it some benefits. It was a rather poorly implemented law because most of the limitations set on Russian were set on the national level and thus the regional status could not affect them. And when the protesters took over the government in February of 2014 and forced President Yanukovich to flee the country, *literally on the very first day* they repelled that law. Eventually, after a lot of deliberation the interim president did not sign this repeal leaving the law in force, but they have sent a clear sign to all the Russian speakers about where their priorities lie. It was declared unconstitutional in 2018 and voided anyway.  Since 2014 it became much worse. Russia was declared the "enemy country" and its language "the aggressor language". Many people, including some prominent politicians, openly said that if you speak Russian you're an enemy of Ukraine and that Russian speakers threaten the security and existence of the country. Many Russian speakers, out of the feeling of "patriotism", chose to switch to Ukrainian; but still many remain. Last year I asked my friend in Kiev how many people spoke each language, and he said that he feels like it's about 50-50 split. By 2019 any remaining primary schools that officially had the right to teach in Russian were either forced to change, or closed. In one case that I know personally, a school that chose to display informational notices in both languages was ordered to take down the Russian text; I hear it's common.  So to answer your question, I guess Russian speakers might not be happy about being declared enemies of Ukraine, even if it's not always in such direct terms. For now it's not illegal to just use Russian in everyday conversations; however, I've heard of people getting in some minor trouble for using Russian in professional areas. I must say that as I live in Donetsk, which is currently for all intents and purposes independent of Ukraine, I wouldn't be able to give you an accurate depiction of how the situation is in Ukraine right now. We don't even know how many people use Russian in everyday life there. Over here, Russian was made the only official language (both were official between 2014 and 2019), and I haven't heard anyone complain, although personally I didn't mind having both. It didn't impact me in any way but it wasn't hurting anyone either, so why not both.	1643139078.0	hu6y2ro	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu425nd	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu6y2ro/

nyr4w	It's hard to get any reliable stats because holding a poll with questions like that would be illegal in Ukraine, and over here in the not-controlled-territories, as they are officially designated, no such poll was ever held either as far as I'm aware; and if it was, I'm not sure I would believe the results anyway.  From personal feeling, I'd say that the older generation (like 60+) is probably overwhelmingly in favour of joining Russia because they can still fondly remember the good times of the Soviet Union. Among the others there are people of all ages with different opinions. Some younger people only remember their good life with Ukraine, so they want to go back (most of those probably already left anyway, though). I think overwhelmingly most people of all ages mostly have a negative opinion of Ukraine, especially after eight years of informational as well as actual war. I think overwhelmingly most people would say that the biggest priority is to stop the war and figure out the political status of our territory. I think the majority of people does favour joining Russia. I think some people would be inclined to rejoin Ukraine on the condition of receiving significant autonomy and proper guarantees of its protection. I think few people, though they do exist, would want to essentially completely surrender and go back into Ukraine without any changes to the old administrative-territorial status. Over the eight years of war, death and destruction many people's opinions shifted (further) towards opposing Ukraine, though there are still people who sympathise with it. I wish I had some numbers, but I don't think there are any. So to sum up, yes, I think that younger people probably have fewer support for joining Russia compared to the oldest generation, but most are likely still in support of it.  A major problem is that the Ukrainian government feeds on the patriotism of the more radically inclined people. The harsher their stance on Russia and the separatists, the more support they have from the right-leaning population, and those are the people who would not hesitate to stage another revolution and overthrow yet another government in a heartbeat. Any talk of compromise is immediately branded as treason by the public and the more radical politicians. Therefore their stance throughout the entire affair has been "we wil not accept anything but complete surrender and there can never be any talk of autonomy or any other changes whatsoever".	1643139951.0	hu70f02	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu3m0xg	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu70f02/

fswkg9m9	You are overdosing on copium rn  If you listen to the phone call he gives it all away. There is not a chance it was anybody else. Again all this info he provided has been verified by Bellingcat using publicly available records.   In addition, Bellingcat had arranged for its representatives to be present during the call, and they were; there are direct witnesses, in addition to the published audio and visual records of the call.  So that’s four different bodies independently identified novichok was used and that doesn’t even include the doctors themselves who published their findings in one of the most prestigious medical journals.  One of the developers of substances like Novichok, Vladimir Uglyov, said that he "trusts the German specialists 100%" and suggested that the poison was delivered using “a solution (for example, in dimethylformamide) of a solid analogue of A-234, namely, a solid A-242, which was applied on Navalny's underwear, plus the addition of some faster-acting substance that hides symptoms (for example, clonidine).  Chemical weapons specialist Vil Mirzayanov, who worked at GosNIIOKhT and in the 1990s revealed the Novichok development program in the USSR and Russia, agreed with the conclusions of the Bundeswehr special laboratory and suggested that the latest versions of Novichok were used to poison Navalny: the compounds A-242 or A-262.  Boris Zhuikov, Doctor of Chemistry and Head of the Laboratory of the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, explained that although Novichok can break down in the body relatively quickly (for example, in a couple of days), when decomposed, it leaves behind specific compounds containing fragments of Novichok molecules, with which it is possible not only to confirm a poisoning by Novichok, but also to establish which substance from this group was used. The Russian team stated that it did not find Novichok itself in its analyses of Navalny's samples, while the German laboratory found traces of Novichok's presence. Zhuikov explained that these statements do not necessarily contradict each other: "the substance itself is really no longer there, but the interaction products remained." Modern methods of analysis (primarily mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography) make it possible to detect such chemical byproducts with very high sensitivity (for example, easily detecting the presence of 1 mg of poison in a human body weighing 70 kg), and the detection of these byproducts can unambiguously identify the original poisonous substance. The German laboratory of the Bundeswehr, which analyzed Navalny's samples, had such equipment.  This case is a slam dunk, a Grenada.   You think the doctors who worked on him are wrong? You never addressed that. I’m interested to hear to copium response there.   I mean this was the Russian investigation. What would they do? In your opinion? They threw him in jail and declared his group an extremist organization which outlawed. They’ve tried their hardest to deny and turn this into MH-17. Anyways— On 27 August 2020, Russian police and the Ministry of the Interior said they had launched a routine preliminary investigation into the poisoning, inspecting the hotel room and security footage. Russian police said that over 100 pieces of potential evidence had been collected.[120] Prosecutors asserted that there was no need for any further investigation after the preliminary investigation, claiming it had found no sign that a crime had been committed.

3kktj0kv	To give a western perspective, some people feel that it’s romantic to display love for your partner in public since you want the world to know how how much you care for this person, although personally, I prefer to keep things private. As for same-sex couples, because they have been historically forced to keep their love private for so long, some of them feel being affectionate in public can be a display of being proud of who they are instead of being told to be ashamed of themselves. Either way, I feel being affectionate in public is generally more of something young people do than older people, and it’s something I’ve definitely seen less of with the pandemic.	1643142165.0	hu76czt	t3_scfheq	t1_hu617uf	/r/AskARussian/comments/scfheq/how_is_to_be_gay_in_russia_is_it_all_the_hell/hu76czt/

djcph	20, even 10 years ago there was a certain negative stigma about people with tattoos, now that they're mainstream, nobody gives a damn, I think people with tattoos can even join the police nowadays. I knew a girl with multiple tattoos who was working in some municipal department. It's fine nowadays.  Gotta be careful though, because prison tattoos are still a thing, so you gotta check if a tattoo you want has some meaning in prison tattoo culture. Tattoos are like a passport in prisons, when you come to prison, you have nothing personal on you, only your bare skin, and tattoos, by looking at them can tell everything about your or your story. For example, you wouldn't want to tattoo cats, because cat means a recidivist criminal (cat - кот - К.О.Т. - коренной обитатель тюрьмы - prison dweller). But, from what I can read about it, if a tattoo is highly artistic, prisoners won't bother that much (I wouldn't want to check that on myself).	1643143892.0	hu7azg0	t3_sbzi5a	t3_sbzi5a	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbzi5a/how_is_a_person_with_tattoos_perceived/hu7azg0/

gm2dc10y	I live in Los Angeles so I can only speak for the ones I met in America. The ones that come here have a ‘grass is always greener on the other side’ mentality. First year they usually love it because it’s new but then they get the rude awakening of what America truly is. A lot of them barely make ends meet working 50 hours a week minimum wage when they could’ve done the same back at home.   Some of them have degrees but the job market is so saturated and a Russian is competing with a American for the same job and well it never turns well for the Russian. So if they want to emigrate they well get first hand experience the difficulty in America and realize life is the same.   I always as a kid up to 25 wanted to live in Hollywood because I thought this is the coolest city in the world. Now I realise it’s a disgusting city with homeless everywhere, drugs, vomit and smells like urine every block.

And if you remember so far, then 30 years before that, the Chechens themselves took an active part in the deportation of Cossacks organized by the Bolsheviks.   And your opponent says that the 90s. When Chechens led by Dudaev organized ethnic cleansing of non-Chechens. Before Dudayev's rule, a third of the Chechen population was not Chechens, about 300,000 thousand. Now they are 100 times less.   The rebels in the Donbas are not engaged in genocide.	1643146311.0	hu7hfsr	t3_sbw0bn	t1_hu3152a	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbw0bn/how_do_you_feel_about_the_ukraine_conflict/hu7hfsr/

yiinn	This really reminds me of Franco-Anglo tensions in Montreal. Franco politics is also substantially more leftist and nationalistic. But one of the driving forces behind implementation of a dual language law federally and a French language law in Quebec was that French speaking population were being precluded from employment opportunities as employers preferred Anglo speakers. This also widened the wealth divide.   So is it fair to say that Russian speaking Ukrainians are also disenfranchised by employment and opportunity?	1643147124.0	hu7jkyn	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu6y2ro	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu7jkyn/

9v2hcztb	In 1324, the Kiev prince Stanislav was utterly defeated in the battle on the Irpin River by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, by the same time Volyn had already been captured. The Lithuanians took Kiev by storm and established relations with the Kiev principality on the basis of vassalage. In 1362, after the victory over the Tatars at Blue Waters, Kiev finally became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Vladimir Olgerdovich became Prince of Kiev.  The weakness of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Livonian War led in 1569 to the Union of Lublin - the unification of Lithuania into one state with Poland and the formation of the Commonwealth with a single Senate and Sejm; the monetary and tax systems were also merged. Volhynia, Podlachie, Podolia, Bratslavshchina and Kievshchina came under the rule of Poland. As a result of the Russian-Polish war, the Deulino truce was signed, under the terms of which the Smolensk, Chernihiv and Seversk regions also became part of the Commonwealth.	1643148000.0	hu7ls0l	t3_sb05qx	t1_hu7bxdj	/r/AskARussian/comments/sb05qx/киевская_русь/hu7ls0l/

Young people are eager to prove their independence and sometimes force themselves to do stupid things just to prove the point ("Назло маме отроможу уши").    Older people are way less adaptive to new ideas/technologies - which is seen as a stupid feature by younger generations.  "Fathers and children" is a book from 19th century on this subject.

7aml7cjq	If you look at the map, Ukraine matters because it's a huge chunk of flat land between Russia and NATO. Having Ukraine in NATO is absolutely unacceptable for Russia for security reasons and as an invasion in an immediate sphere of influence of Russia. As an example, it was unacceptable for the US to have Soviet ballistic missiles on Cuba and in general Cuba as a military ally for a foreign power, the US were ready to take extreme measures to prevent it and eventually they made USSR to completely withdraw from Cuba.   So, Ukraine is a red line for Russia US. The US encouraged NATO expansion to Ukraine and it's association with EU. Yanukovich refused it in 2013 which caused the following revolution. Russian response was taking Crimea and supporting separatism in Donbass, basically creating conditions for Ukraine to not be accepted neither in EU nor NATO.   Regarding a prospect of war, it's rather unlikely. Russia will not invade Ukraine, it has nothing to gain there. In the best case scenario Russia will get a territory with rebellious and disgruntled population which is expensive to upkeep at the cost of complete international isolation.   Russia is ready to press Ukraine until it eventually split into two - pro Russian east and pro US west. What could help Ukraine is if the US back down and publicly give up on claims to expand NATO at the Russian backdoor and sit to discuss returning to the status quo as it were before 2014.	1643149892.0	hu7qfap	t3_scov2o	t3_scov2o	/r/AskARussian/comments/scov2o/why_ukraine_again_why_now/hu7qfap/

4wstgypn	I know some of this first hand from working for an international company for decades. Wealth of a nation is not a direct relation to selling natural resources or hard manufacturing. The company I worked for for 20 years is a 80 billion dollar a year global company based in the US. and although some production is based in the US much more of it is based in other countries because of cheap labor and threats that if we do not base manufacturing in thier country then we will be banned from selling in that county. China and Germany are bullies lile that. But the point is a country like the US can be like that company in that wealth can be made by exploiting cheap labor and cheap natural resources of other countries. It truly is a global economy and the US gov just cares about taxing these big companies. Why these companies drive our politics so much.  Unlike other countries none of our Government income is funded from selling of natural resourced.   As for the perception that we are competing for export of oil and gas and my comment of being a consumer nation.  Let me put things in perspective. The last report I saw last year Russia is number 3 on the list for where the US gets crude oil from. Canada being #1 Mexico #2. Yes it is interesting thay we get more from Russia than Saudi Arabia now. But in the end we consume way more oil than we produce i.e. why we are considered a consumer nation.  As for Natural Gas. Our production as more than doubled in the last decade and still until a couple of years ago we were still importing it because we were consuming way more than we produce. Again a consumer nation. We just just started exporting Nat Gas and as far as know only to Canada and Mexico. And very very little in the big scheme of things.   I am not an expert but the info I am basing this on is not propaganda it is reports that come as a result between business and government. Meaning it is not something out government could easily lie about and get away with that.	1643150841.0	hu7su5g	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu5rrcq	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu7su5g/

gaqd5	Cursive used in schools, colleges, high schools all the time. Back when computers and printers weren't as common students used to write diploma and other big works in cursive. But thankfully it's no longer the case.  Small documents at work like reports (about accident/misdeeds), request for paid/unpaid leave usually written by hand.  Personal memos, note books, address books are usually written in cursive. Mostly because it's much easier and faster way to write and everyone learns to write that way in school.  Cursive usually used in many forms or inquiry forms unless they're meant for machine procession.  Many years ago I heard an opinion that if you'd write text in block letters people would laugh at you. I don't feel it's the case anymore. But I don't think it's common to use block letters, it's slower and less convenient. Except maybe for people who have engineering degree and familiar with national standard font (GOST Font) that's used for blueprints.	1643151325.0	hu7u36i	t3_scohp0	t3_scohp0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scohp0/how_common_is_cursive/hu7u36i/

The main opponent is Navalny, his message is "Stop stealing from the people", but he has been discredited by mass media for general voter.   I personally do not see any positive outcomes for Russia; there's going to be some painful struggle for power once Putin is out of the picture (might be 10 or 20 years from now). Meanwhile there's going to be no major investments into Russian economy, so further stagnation is the only visible option.	1643152989.0	hu7y9yh	t3_scnpi0	t3_scnpi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scnpi0/how_popular_is_president_putin/hu7y9yh/

And considering it was able to start a civil war in the Eastern Ukraine regions, it surely can ignite a larger conflict yet again.	1643153813.0	hu80bi6	t3_scco15	t1_hu75aa0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scco15/russian/hu80bi6/

Ukraine is building up its army and getting more and more military help. It hopes to crash rebels. Russia has a responsibility to protect this population.   At this point these territories are not recognized by Russia, because it would violate Minsk agreement. I don’t think a full pledge occupation is going to happen. As the US doesn’t push Ukraine to execute their agreement, which could be the best peaceful solution, there will be another escalation.

She even has wise polite discussions with him in her dreams at night sometimes, so she tells me.   Also, people in their forties and fifties remember the 1990s well which was an extremely chaotic, poor, violent and scary time, organised crime practically owned the country and everything seemed to fall apart. They do appreciate Putin giving them stability.   Also, remember we didn’t have a democracy with elections almost ever. We had an absolute monarchy, then the revolution, then USSR with people having no say in who gets in power, then another revolution, Eltsin was thrust upon us, so was Putin, we were mostly playing with the cards we were dealt (I’m simplifying of course, but still). We don’t have a habit of leaders changing regularly, of presidential elections making a difference, it’s hard to miss something you never properly had.	1643156500.0	hu86sh7	t3_scryt7	t3_scryt7	/r/AskARussian/comments/scryt7/do_the_russian_people_like_having_putin_as_a/hu86sh7/

So you're saying one can go to the same courts that have convicted people of expressing a different opinion in russia? The same courts that somehow found a reason to convict Navalny for taking too long to recover from being poisoned by russian state? Or do you mean the courts that sentenced a Ukrainian service member for taking part in the war? Or the courts that sentenced a dead tax advisor?   Any opinion that doesn't agree with putinism is 'extreme'. Try talking about corruption in russia and see how long you will last.  Russian state has been assasinating people abroad even before boomers were born. Your mentioned case is not even the first time a poison was used on UK soil, that might be 1978 Markov's case. Not to mention Litvinenko. And in Skripals case we even know the people who performed the operation, it's not like it's a huge secret of who used what. The are videos, scanned pasports and the operatives are living in russia care free, as we saw in the interview by russian state TV.    We haven't even touched on sources, but the videos, pictures and other data is there for everyone to see. I have laid out logical arguments with multiple examples.

Go and die in the cold while your wife goes and marries another man back home. For some stupid land you’ve never been to? I’ll pass.   All this stuff going on reads to me like monkeys pounding their chests and throwing their own shit at eachother. It’s so pathetic and lame. Like no one even wants this to happen, it’s just posturing and dick waving.

I reckon russia should have a leader that the West doesn't see as a by product of the USSR but one that is as strong as him to make it clear russian sovereignty must and will be respected internationally, one that embraces close relations with EU members that they can trust him on issues related to Europe security and trade that will eventually push the US out of Europe because EU leaders will be like "we don't need you anymore and stop causing trouble for us"	1643162036.0	hu8jzrw	t3_sbn0dy	t3_sbn0dy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbn0dy/what_can_be_done_to_improve_russian_relations/hu8jzrw/

4kcp6a11	For those of you who don't understand why russians are opposed to NATO expansion. Read this open letter written to president Clinton back in 1997, by a group of 50 prominent foreign policy experts that included former senators, retired military officers, diplomats and academicians of the US.    June 26, 1997  Dear Mr. President,  We, the undersigned, believe that the current U.S.led effort to expand NATO, the focus of the recent Helsinki and Paris Summits, is a policy error of historic proportions. We believe that NATO expansion will decrease allied security and unsettle European stability for the following reasons:  In Russia, NATO expansion, which continues to be opposed across the entire political spectrum, will strengthen the nondemocratic opposition, undercut those who favor reform and cooperation with the West, bring the Russians to question the entire post-Cold War settlement, and galvanize resistance in the Duma to the START II and III treaties; In Europe, NATO expansion will draw a new line of division between the "ins" and the "outs," foster instability, and ultimately diminish the sense of security of those countries which are not included;  In NATO, expansion, which the Alliance has indicated is open-ended, will inevitably degrade NATO's ability to carry out its primary mission and will involve U.S. security guarantees to countries with serious border and national minority problems, and unevenly developed systems of democratic government;  In the U.S., NATO expansion will trigger an extended debate over its indeterminate, but certainly high, cost and will call into question the U.S. commitment to the Alliance, traditionally and rightly regarded as a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy.  Because of these serious objections, and in the absence of any reason for rapid decision, we strongly urge that the NATO expansion process be suspended while alternative actions are pursued. These include:     —opening the economic and political doors of the European Union to Central and Eastern Europe;  —developing an enhanced Partnership for Peace program;  —supporting a cooperative NATO-Russian relationship; and  —continuing the arms reduction and transparency process, particularly with respect to nuclear weapons and materials, the major threat to U.S. security, and with respect to conventional military forces in Europe.     Russia does not now pose a threat to its western neighbors and the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are not in danger. For this reason, and the others cited above, we believe that NATO expansion is neither necessary nor desirable and that this ill-conceived policy can and should be put on hold.  Sincerely,      https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997-06/arms-control-today/opposition-nato-expansion	1643162472.0	hu8l0tz	t3_s7uppw	t3_s7uppw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu8l0tz/

And even if Russia invaded and occupied the whole Ukraine, it literally makes zero sense as it brings NATO to Russian borders now officially.

es9x1	I can compare the Russian and American media, so I'm perfectly aware that the US does not have any freedom of speech, and that Americans aren't familiar with the idea of press actually criticizing the ruling regime.  Russia's primary goals in the West are: 1) a mutual safety agreement, 2) selling gas. This 'invasion' thing fits the United States' agenda, but clearly contradicts Russia's.  The Kiev regime, supposedly afraid of an invasion, instead of protecting itself amassed all its troops next to Donbass, with a lot of modern equipment, foreign mercenaries, and outright nazis. They are clearly planning an invasion and ethnic cleansings, and they know quite well that every single journalist in the West will report their atrocities as a 'Russian invasion'. We saw it in Yugoslavia, we saw it in Ossetia, and there is no reason to think that Donbass would be different.  Russia's position is weak. Putin can't just sit and watch how thousands of ethnic Russians are being killed next to the Russian border. He somehow has to prevent everything without doing anything. A very difficult task.	1643163472.0	hu8nelq	t3_scsakl	t1_hu8j9d0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scsakl/with_so_many_russians_against_invading_ukraine/hu8nelq/

The situation right now doesn’t give any meaningful reason to send Russian troops to die.

ahle7qv5	I think putin is the main factor to NATO expansion and if he is replaced this could all change (dont know if you guys like him but imagine if navalny got to be president) . I think the US and EU see him as a the legacy of the USSR ( ex kgb officer now in charge) and a political thug, a cold war babaika,  it scares the shit out of them and they can't take a chance with him.   This is purely my opinion but Putin supports dictators in the old former soviet states and he needs to realise that it's a catch 22. He does it to keep them in his sphere of influence by supporting them and them keeping NATO out but people living under it just get so fucking over the political stagnation/corruption that they want change, so they protest for a political change and look to EU NATO as security garentee to keep the newly installed officials in power rather then russia intervention to put the ousted dictator back in power. Maybe just maybe if he allowed a bit of political freedom then people get their political changes but there won't be so much resentment to the russian leadership   ukraine wanting to have closer ties with the EU and then putin having a few words with ukraine about dropping the EU and being closer to russia backfired on him badly, he could of allowed them have closer relations with EU but at the same time fostered a good russian relationship as well and maybe this mess would of been avoided.	1643166296.0	hu8u146	t3_scsakl	t1_hu8pp9i	/r/AskARussian/comments/scsakl/with_so_many_russians_against_invading_ukraine/hu8u146/

Today, to get to a gay night club, you have to go through a maze in Moscow. That wasn't the case in 1992 in American largest cities.   There was a [pride parade in NYC](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/nyregion/thousands-join-in-parade-to-celebrate-gay-pride.html) in 1992, no pride parades in Moscow. You get arrested for waving an LGBT flag, though.  [Latest polls](https://www.levada.ru/2021/10/15/otnoshenie-rossiyan-k-lgbt-lyudyam/) from Russia [suggest that](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/) \~70% of the population oppose even allowing same sex relationships to exist. [Gallup 30 years ago](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx) \- where the same question yields only 44% opposition. (Do you think gay or lesbian relations between consenting adults should or should not be legal?)  So no. That ignorant person is wrong on all counts.	1643166386.0	hu8u8nw	t3_scfheq	t1_hu80pfk	/r/AskARussian/comments/scfheq/how_is_to_be_gay_in_russia_is_it_all_the_hell/hu8u8nw/
5thicd6t	Agreed. I am from Russia but I lived most of my life in the U.S. I have friends in both Russia and Ukraine, and some of my Russian friends are currently serving conscription, so I'm pretty worried about a possible conflict. Even then, I don't think it will happen, but it is still pretty stressful.	1643166438.0	hu8ucw2	t3_scco15	t1_hu6f1bf	/r/AskARussian/comments/scco15/russian/hu8ucw2/

Но большая часть людей так и не приняла переименование и так и осталась русскими. Все они прекрасно знают русский язык и в жизни на нем общаются. Поэтому война Украины с Россией это война русских с русскими. Война никому не нужна и ее никто не хочет, может быть кроме правительства США и Украины.	1643169127.0	hu90edq	t3_scco15	t1_hu5gyvp	/r/AskARussian/comments/scco15/russian/hu90edq/

And to get one you need to be registered in the military recruiting system.  I mean, please get more information before traveling not to put yourself in awkward situation.

vxm57	Eh, I think what u/alblks said is too harsh of a judgment. I do know Russians living in Russia who go by diminutives in virtually all contexts, except extremely formal ones. It's not ommon and maybe depends on one's specific name and the available diminutives but it does happen. There are young journalists who use the diminutive form to sign their articles, for example.

5thicd6t	I live in the U.S, but I have had experience with both American and Russian police.   I was in Moscow visiting and I got into a minor traffic accident. The police who showed up weren't very helpful but they didn't worsen anything. I think that the process took too long though, and they could have helped more. This was in 2018  In another time, which was only 1 year ago in 2020, I was in Moscow again, and I slipped off a step and broke a wrist. There were two MVD and they helped me up, asked if I needed help, and stood with me until my friend arrived upon which my friend took me to get it treated. They were friendly and I was happy with the experience, but there wasn't immediate medical treatment, although since it wasn't an emergency, this is understandable.  In around 2009, my friend told me that he had a bad experience with the police when he told them that he had been assault on the street, and nothing got done, but this was 11 years ago so most likely something has changed.  In the U.S, I have only had 3 experiences with the police. Once, a couple years ago, I was pulled over for going too much over the speed limit and I got ticketed. It was quick and I did not think too much of it, although of course, I was pissed for the ticket.  Another time, there was an old man who was a neighbor who had choked on something in his house, and the medical services arrived. There were some police blocking the street so that there was not a huge crowd forming. Some of them were aggressive but there was one officer who I had a nice conversation with, and he explained to me what the situation was very kindly.   My only other real encounter with the police in the U.S was when I was in the subway and there was a homeless man being arrested by them. People were told to keep away and not to film, so I just got on the train and left. I don't really know what happened, but the interaction was very quick, because I was afraid to get arrested or grabbed if I stayed and tried to interfere or ask what the situation was and film it.	1643170963.0	hu9495j	t3_rrt1rl	t3_rrt1rl	/r/AskARussian/comments/rrt1rl/whats_your_experiences_with_russian_police_like/hu9495j/

When’s the last time CNN or Fox News weren’t in lockstep over the US charging a publisher for publishing news  like Assange beyond even what “espionage act against journalists” Obama realized was insane. When have they ever given a “differing opinion” on NATO as anything in other than amazing or from a Russian perspective. Yeah, Jeff Bezos owning the WaPo is some real free society shit.   Americans are the most propagandized people on earth - worse than the Russians and Chinese by miles, because the Russians and Chinese know the media propagandizes and they have to be critical unlike Americans who treat every MSNBC articles citing “in-named NatSec sources” as gospel.	1643171663.0	hu95osv	t3_scsakl	t1_hu8j9d0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scsakl/with_so_many_russians_against_invading_ukraine/hu95osv/

I also emigrated last year because I was basically forced to. Many of us leave not because we really want to live elsewhere but only because we don’t want to live in prison.  As for the general populace, I would say most young Russians toy around with the idea of moving abroad at some point, but only a small fraction does end up leaving because it’s not that easy. You need to have money and be ready to do lots of paperwork, preferably have skills relevant for foreign markets and speak a foreign language.

i7m0l0jw	Это не правда. Температура не так сильно влияет на количество жителей. А вот финансы очень сильно влияют. Если бы в Московию не текла река денег со всёй россии, там не было бы столько жителей. У нас в стране большинство налогов переводят А Москву. Потом москва решает кому и сколько вернуть и что профинансировать в других регионах.  Вот так примерно.  It is not true. The temperature does not affect the number of inhabitants so much. But finance is very important. If a river of money from all over Russia had not flowed into Muscovy, there would not have been so many inhabitants. In our country, most taxes are transferred to Moscow. Then Moscow decides to whom and how much to return and what to finance in other regions. That's about it. https://zen-yandex-ru.translate.goog/media/id/5f0a90adc3f39b5ed133e203/prostaia-analitika-regiony-rossii-s-samymi-vysokimi-dotaciiami-v-2020-godu-60362b37a332dd737344f10f?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=wapp	1643175995.0	hu9dqoe	t3_sc1de3	t1_hu3f1we	/r/AskARussian/comments/sc1de3/what_is_considered_cold_in_russia/hu9dqoe/

l6v2byz	Direct proof is not something that supports the hypothesis, but displays it can't be otherwise. And requires mutual recognition of credibility, otherwise it's playing chess with a pigeon. In public sphere it's almost impossible to provide valid proof unless it refers to universal knowledge, that's the catch. You say Russian judicial system is faulty therefore not credible, ok then why not. On the other hand I have no reason to recognize foreign intelligence either, not because they're faulty or something, just we're not each other's buisness and not each other's responsibility. So then have zero mutually recognized sources and obviously won't get anywhere. That's the logic.   You don't have to change my mind in the first place. You don't even know it, just assume there's something I believe. I don't. I just collect opinions and take my time to estmate how internally conflicted they are. That's why I say it's pointless - you have a web full of people to convince besides me, have a web full of stories to read  besides yours.	1643176305.0	hu9ea09	t3_s7kimz	t1_hu89yuy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7kimz/as_a_russian_what_is_your_opinion_about_ukraine/hu9ea09/

In the northern regions of the region, up to -50 is only at night. During the day, the temperature warms up to -30 -35. On such days, the number of cars on the roads is reduced, because the car has to be warmed up at night several times or in the morning to warm up the car with heaters (webasto, hydronic). I know for sure that there are regions even colder. In 2022, some anomalies with the weather. In January it was +3. At least it was -29 for one or two days.

This is also a kind of competition, since we do not allow resources to be taken away from us for free and at the same time we begin to behave like the United States in miniature. For example, in Syria. Regarding exports, look at how much liquefied natural gas the United States supplies to the international market.

We had a few American guest professors in my university and they butchered my name so badly trying to pronounce it without any expertise in Russian I actually asked them to go with the closest version of this name in English (it's a Latin name in origin so it exists in many languages in different versions).

One is Communist, the other is capitalist. One is left, the other is right.

6bhiz0xy	What does it feel like to be gay in Russia? It's illegal, literally.   We have a law prohibiting the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations, you cannot be openly gay, write that you are gay, hold hands with another man on the streets, and so on.   In general, any manifestation of homosexuals is prohibited.   If you look at the news, people are regularly fined for LGBT propaganda, films and clips are canceled if there are hints of LGBT in them, public people cannot speak out in support of LGBT, all this is punitive.   And do not forget about the opinion of people, lesbians are treated neutrally, gays are extremely negative. Yes, if you're just gay, then the attitude will be more neutral, as long as you don't show your inclinations   Do not think that we, as in America 50 years ago, are moving towards North Korea on this issue, the difference is that we do not have executions.	1643181299.0	hu9lx0i	t3_scfheq	t3_scfheq	/r/AskARussian/comments/scfheq/how_is_to_be_gay_in_russia_is_it_all_the_hell/hu9lx0i/

So why are you calling them not free and fair?	1643181522.0	hu9m86t	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu74cfj	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu9m86t/
bci24ojc	**[United States involvement in regime change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change)**     >The United States government has participated and interfered, both overtly and covertly, in the replacement of foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for regime change mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, including the Spanish–American and Philippine–American wars. At the onset of the 20th century, the United States shaped or installed governments in many countries around the world, including neighbors Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. During World War II, the United States helped overthrow many Nazi Germany or imperial Japanese puppet regimes.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1643181542.0	hu9m95l	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu9m86t	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hu9m95l/

2jfmaqtp	Even in countries where elections are important people now and then face with the situation when politicians promise one thing during the elections and then they do the opposite. And yes, they can remove this politician in the next election cycle but it doesn't guarantee that the next candidate will stick to his word. So in overall although people in these countries have more control over the situation it's not really like they manage the whole thing. The recent example I can think of is that Biden promised to cancel student debts partially during his campaign but it doesn't seem to go any further, at least according to what I read on Reddit. Trump also promised a lot but accomplished very little imo.	1643181708.0	hu9mhl4	t3_sct9rt	t1_hu9iqq9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sct9rt/is_the_culture_attitude_of_it_will_be_alright_or/hu9mhl4/

Even if there is no plan to invade,  building up so many troops and equipment on the border of a country which was invaded in 2014 and occupied since is begging for trouble.

44gf46hg	My point was a bit different. Negative selection starts happening as soon as you become a politician and democratic and non-democratic elements of political system are not even coming into the equation. Look how our opposition treats those who disagree with its political line just a bit - bullying and slander. Same happens within ruling party.   Of course ruling party adds to this negative selection, and they capitalize on its results as well, sometimes it is enough to air the opponent's dirty laundry to curb it chances of electability.  But just getting a person out of the streets into elections is not possible. That is theoretically yes, anyone can register for elections, but without media coverage, support from any political force chances of electability are non-existent even before any administrative pressure is exerted.  It is not Russia only, Bernie Sanders is a good example in USA. And any other "democratic country" - look who is being elected - mostly they have money, sometimes they have foreign money and support, and none of them are what people of those countries would actually want. Yes, some of them come from humble beginnings but by the time they reach electability they are either thoroughly corrupt, or deep in big money pockets or have money themselves.  Most current systems are plutocracies, no actual democracy in sight.	1643182184.0	hu9n4ys	t3_sct9rt	t1_hu9l9sy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sct9rt/is_the_culture_attitude_of_it_will_be_alright_or/hu9n4ys/

There is a proof they called someone; there is a proof that someone confessed in poisoning.

37j270yc	where did you see mad, in letters on the screen?  lol 1. Writing "I love Russians, but I don't love Putin" is at least stupid, because (get ready!) Putin suits most Russians, and these Russians regularly vote for him in elections. 2. I didn’t write that you are an enemy, don’t lie, you just express yourself in boring clichés. and 3. when you read about the terrible Russian armadas near the borders of Ukraine - look at the names of the places of deployment, take a map, and look at how far from the borders of Ukraine there are settlements in which these terrible (BOO!) armadas are located (Yelnya, for example  ).  And in the end, try to think critically (seriously, I recommend - critical thinking is a very useful thing) at such a distance from the Ukrainian border, does this look like preparation for an invasion?	1643184312.0	hu9q0pp	t3_scsakl	t1_hu9lkwq	/r/AskARussian/comments/scsakl/with_so_many_russians_against_invading_ukraine/hu9q0pp/

8x1g8tlr	Oof, brace yourself for a long one...  When I was a kid, my mother was afraid of Islamic extremists (Chechen and Afgan wars), and grand parents worried of Japan. Granted, we have no peace treaty up to today. West wasn't an issue, nor perceived as bad guys. Same for NATO. It changed drastically with Yugoslavia.   Surveillance is there, because big brother always watching, cameras and shit. And listening. It became a meme already, when FSB agents have to manually listen through you cellphone craptalks. But basically every state keeps those recordings, hardly seen anybody upset explicitly about it.   War on drugs is a real deal. Police pushed dealers so hard, so they basically forced in to underground. Utilizing phone apps and drop oof coordinates. Doesn't surprise me, considering how much of this crap start flowing over Russian border from Afghanistan and a body count it caused.  With cultural differences can't be said much. We are a multicultural country and there always will be some frictions, but nothing too major now days thankfully.   Narrative is mostly religious, but who listen them in a sound mind?

Yes, absolutely. For example, Moscow has a huge amount of security cameras, and there is a face recognition technology that searches through the collected data. Moreover, in the metro, there are cameras that perform face-recognition search online. They tell you that it helps catching the criminals, but there has been a number of cases when people got stopped when they were going to a political rally. And many people who participated in rallies. were identified post factum. Also, there are huge amounts of data collected: (supposedly) anonymized data on population movement around the city from cellular towers; from transport cards (mostly anonymous but easily enriched with other sources; moreover, the govt encourages the population to tie the card to their phone number to get discounts; and the pensioners' cards are already personal); health insurance numbers, pension cards numbers, etc etc. The amount of data collected is huge, the legislation is vague, and the judicial control prioritizes security concerns over privacy.	1643185048.0	hu9qyoo	t3_sd0b5s	t3_sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/hu9qyoo/

9pzoc4cx	As a Pro-Western (more like Pro-EU, Anti-American, but generally Pro-Western) (somewhat) leftist liberal, I just hate it. I genuinely think that there can be more to humour about Russians than "here, we have THE accent, also they're bad, drunk and communist". I see Russians as easy targets in humour, as even content creators I very much enjoy watching (I don't really watch Russian content) can get cancelled for saying a wrong word (and sometimes I completely agree with a reason, but not with methods of cancelling), but then can chew out borderline offensive jokes about Russians and nobody's going to bat an eye, even worse -- Russian fans will like it! Either because they're young and they don't really understand what's going on yet, or because it's our form of cultural autoagression (you're Russian, but you hate everything Russian), so they think it's "true".    For me it's "be funny or go home". If you cross the line of not only being funny, but also spreading false cultural stereotypes (DRINK VODKA ALL RUSSIAN DRUNK) then that's kind of annoying. But what pisses me off is the historical stereotypes, originating from literal Nazis post-WW2, and finding their way into Russia even, because a lot of "historical memes" follow the same trope for the Soviet Union -- "uhh yeah they zerg rushed their opponent 1 rifle 5 men numerical superiority and uhhh WINTER AM I RIGHT?". You can see this in many earlier games about WW2, afaik, but I don't really know about movies, I think I saw some that perpetuate these myths.   Speaking of games, I just remembered about Call of Duty MW 2019. Didn't buy the game because at that point I was really disappointed with Blizzard and because of Russophobia in there. A shame as well, as I enjoyed multiplayer during the open beta.	1643187241.0	hu9tphe	t3_sceqhh	t3_sceqhh	/r/AskARussian/comments/sceqhh/how_do_you_feel_about_being_so_often_portrayed_as/hu9tphe/

It was perfectly ok 50 or so years ago(if working as intended), but not today, because apart from money and resources there is information, exposure to news etc. And since policies are controlled by votes, and votes controlled by decisions that are based on available information for an average voter, and information is formed by highly organized businessmen(ex. Murdock), then- there is no true freedom without getting ultra rich in line.  And there is no leashes for the rich in the West. Just like in the east.   Main difference: we think of our leaders as bastards. They are not us, not our friends. Our loyalty is fickle.   And, from what i saw, your loyalty(western) is to institutions, you believe in them.  Its important for them to work. But, in my opinion, they no longer work as intended. You are no longer a true voter as a citizen. A true voter is a company, organizations, politician etc. that had your attention with his money.   It always was a problem, naturally, but today its a cancer for human centered society.  We may be on a course to become cyberpunk dystopia, where new kings are the upper class.  Whenever its better to be in obvious non democracy like us, or in an illusion with high(for now) living standards for the west, i think its all gonna go downhill from here, unless we dont change our stands on billionaires and such.   And war is, as usual, a great time to steal some wealth, directly or through contracts and fear mongering.   It was Eisenhower that warned america about military-industrial complex.  It is a common thought in russia, that patriotic talks are in correlation with corruption.  Both statements should be kept in mind in current political climate.	1643187366.0	hu9tv2w	t3_sd0b5s	t3_sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/hu9tv2w/
aq471868	How many times do we repeat this about the 90s. Especially those who did not live at that time, or were very small.   Real problems were in the first half of the 90s. Because the USSR collapsed. And these problems were so small compared to what could have been - up to a civil war with the use of nuclear weapons - that we should rejoice, and not grieve about it.   As for the second half of the 90s, I have a feeling that it is time to publish a text indicating salaries and recalculating their purchasing power in relation to the current moment. My personal calculation result - there is a difference in relation to the current moment, but not so significant. And given how much time has passed, and the overall progress of mankind over this period, I would generally say that the increase is lower than expected.	1643187419.0	hu9txf4	t3_scryt7	t1_hu86sh7	/r/AskARussian/comments/scryt7/do_the_russian_people_like_having_putin_as_a/hu9txf4/

I don't say that USA is an example of democracy, but there are no true examples, probably.  Also, democracy, in my opinion, has nothing to do with kindergartens and schools, authoritarian regimes can be benevolent as well. There are terms like "benevolent dictatorship" or "nanny state" (both actually referred to Singapore at one time). Democratic governments (and I am using this term purely theoretically here) can be indifferent too, especially if they don't have money for social issues.	1643188379.0	hu9v3po	t3_sct9rt	t1_hu9sykx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sct9rt/is_the_culture_attitude_of_it_will_be_alright_or/hu9v3po/

44gf46hg	I think I understand the main points of the question even if it is too long.  Well, Russia is in many ways following the western trend for total electronic control. I have long since discarded the idea of privacy - unless you totally live in the forest and are completely self-sufficient, your actions will be recorded. But with that amount of information you only get in the bad spotlight, if you are making yourself visible. So security by obscurity is the best approach if some semblance of privacy is your actual goal. Otherwise, be prepared, and being prepared means quite a feat.  Yes, this all has the potential to grow into big totalitarian anti-utopia, where you are penalized for your opinion or even lack of the voiced opinion, but I think contemporary regimes are just too impotent to actually implement something like this.  As for the general overview of the outside world. During the Soviet era, western countries were being portrayed rather badly by state propaganda. But it was an unspoken opinion that all of those cliches were false until the iron curtain dropped down and some were proven to be true to an extent. However, both during the Soviet era and afterward the real accomplishments of western civilization were generally not downplayed, and it was always said that people themselves are good and suffering under governmental oppression. Currently, the state media also keep the propaganda focused on the western leadership rather than the people. No one says people are bad because they are not trying to overthrow their government or some such.	1643189819.0	hu9wulu	t3_sd0b5s	t3_sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/hu9wulu/

fswkg9m9	From the Sweden lab which is one of four sources that has confirmed the use of novichok in the poisoning of Navalny. It is not as difficult as you somehow seem to think it is:   The use of poisonous substances such as nerve agents or other chemical weapons can be verified in several ways. It could be through analysis of so-called environmental samples of soil, air, water or swipe samples that may have been exposed, or by analysis of human biomedical samples of, for example, urine and/or blood.  In a somewhat simplified description of verification by blood analysis, the procedure is as follows: a blood sample from a person who is suspected of exposure to a nerve agent is collected. Blood contains proteins. A nerve agent reacts with and binds to these proteins: this is what makes nerve agents so poisonous. But, this same protein binding is what makes it possible to use blood samples to verify that the person has been exposed to a nerve agent.  Proteins are built as a long sequence of amino acids. By extracting the proteins from the blood, and then dividing the protein into shorter amino acid sequences, it is then possible to use a special technique, called liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (shortened as LC-MS/MS), to analyse patterns in precisely the part of the protein that the nerve agent has binded to. Different nerve agents give rise to different patterns. Based on the pattern from the protein from the blood sample, one can determine exactly which nerve agent the person has been exposed to.  Again that’s four different labs with no agenda.   In the article, it accuses Bellingcat of accepting a small amount of funding at one time from one organization. How that pertains to this I can’t see. Again grasping for straws my friend   What do you make of this:  * As of 2009, the Russian government owns 60% of newspapers, and in whole or in part, all national television stations *  * Over 5 years between 2011 and 2016 the government forced changes of ownership over 12 significant newsrooms with all-country reach, all of them previously associated with honest and independent reporting. RBC, Forbes, Russian Media Group, TV2, Russkaya Planeta, REN TV, Grani.ru, Lenta.ru, Rain TV, RIA Novosti, Gazeta.ru and Kommersant were suppressed or taken over using different techniques - some of the, with government owned shares were completely disbanded and their resources passed to newly created bodies under control of state-approved managers (e.g. RIA Novosti), while Rain TV was forcibly removed from TV channels and only allowed to continue business as an Internet-only station * All but one national TV channel are fully or partially owned by the state. The last channel – NTV – is owned by Gazprom, in which the state has a controlling stake.  Are you seriously trying to critique Bellingcat then rely on the Russian police as a source about Navalny’s medical condition?   It’s been a few comments and you still haven’t refuted what his doctors said. I mean c’mon. At this point I can’t tell if you are trolling/arguing in bad faith or really that dumb.   https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32644-1/fulltext  You are telling me 4 different labs, the doctors at one German hospital, and one of the most prestigious medical journals are joined together in an elaborate conspiracy while the Russian government which has the most obvious vested interest in the case is telling the truth?

dfku3	I think there is a lot of evidence though? A dutch research team intercepted many phone calls of russian seperatist (with strong ties to russia) discussing and ordering the missle strike on the plane.

We do sometimes also have hibiscus tea, but it's a choice whether or not you personally want to have it. My friend's family always had tea with cinnamon, and the girls I spoke to are generally more, huh, tea-varied? Some of them have different teas for different occasions or use tea for health, like chamomile tea for calming down and falling asleep better. So the answer is... I don't know? Your best bet is some fancy black tea, I guess.

Then he was an excellent leader, raised the economy, raised the political weight of Russia in the world, raised the army, caused a huge rise in patriotism (Crimea is ours). He was a reliable president and a leader we loved.   But then I decided to become not the President, but the Tsar.   He raised the level of corruption to unprecedented heights, founded an autocracy in the country, and in recent years has already been a dictatorship.   Therefore, opinions are different, those who remember life worse consider him a leader, those who did not find it do not think so.   There is another saying in Russia "If not Putin, then who?", but the truth is that everyone who could replace him was killed, in prison or fled the country.	1643190730.0	hu9xyg0	t3_scnpi0	t3_scnpi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scnpi0/how_popular_is_president_putin/hu9xyg0/

Which is not to say that those things aren't abhorrent or don't exist or don't warrant eradication. However, the prevalent political discourse just uses fearmongering around those concerns as a red herring to mask the pushing of partisan agenda.

t3gvp	The original discussion was not about elections though. Yes, they are most important thing a citizen could do about politics (btw, please vote everyone), but they are not run every month, and not every single issue is raised there. So, if a person dislikes what the government does at the current moment (covid handling for example), then what are they supposed to do? Expire from stress waiting for elections? And then some more if their candidate doesn't win or doesn't deliver on promises? You could protest, but that doesn't mean the government will take it unto account on their decisions. And even with elections, what if a person likes the policy of party 1 on issue A, but dislikes their stance on issue B and likes what party 2 is suggesting there? Then you have to decide what issue is more important to you and live with the rest somehow.	1643193741.0	hua1old	t3_sct9rt	t1_hu9iqq9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sct9rt/is_the_culture_attitude_of_it_will_be_alright_or/hua1old/

I've spent some time in Surgut, it was about -45 C one night. On one hand, extreme cold, on other hand central heat system works fine and inside a building it's comfortable. Walk from work to apartment was not a big thing either.  In Yakutia it is extreme cold. I've never been there.  Oh, by the way, it's only in winter time. Just in case.

36tu1oo	>So even in the times of the Tsar and the USSR it was the general consensus that you just don't go into that place.  Imperial Russia controlled a large cities (as trade centers and military garrisons), roads and loyal tribes, paying little attention to other (until they don't start messing around), so yes. Also, cleansing a Black Sea Coast, effectively cutting all possible foregin support to rebels, helped a lot.  Soviet Union attempted to fix this mess, then Stalin occured and solved that problem in his Stalinesque way, adding even more mess. Afaik, last (not only for region, but for the USSR at all) active anti-Soviet partisan was shot only at 1970s, and while seashores were popular tourist spots, the central region still was seen as non-hospitable.  >Chechnya only become know to us after the fall of the USSR and unfortunately Beslan really made it known to atleast me, during those times was it still volatile or was it calmer?  Calmer, of course (at least in terms of body count), but we don't know what is happening there *actually*. It seems that radical islam is spreading, population is growing without the corresponding growth of economy, and the whole situation looks disturbing.

ms6e8	Lancet report actually reveals that on the next day after the 'poisoning', Saturday August 22, “16 h later when the patient was handed over \[sic\] to the German air ambulance crew for transportation to Berlin, his condition had slightly improved (pupils constricted, heart rate 59 bpm).” This appears to be evidence that the Omsk hospital treatment had not only stabilised Navalny’s condition – as the hospital doctors told the press – but had demonstrated the effectiveness of the Russian antidote medication.  There is also no reference to contamination precautions by the German doctor in Omsk; by the German air crew; the Berlin ground ambulance; or the Charité Clinic staff. By omitting these details, the German doctors appear to concede they did not suspect a nerve agent threat to anyone in close proximity to Navalny himself.  The Berlin doctors admit they did not detect organo-phosphate poisoning in Navalny’s blood, urine or on his skin; they tested no water bottle or clothing evidence which had been brought to Berlin by Navalny’s staff on the evacuation aircraft.  They also acknowledge they did not know what might have caused “severe poisoning with a cholinesterase inhibitor” until the German armed forces laboratory in Munich reported the Novichok allegation “2 weeks later”.  “Testing for cholinesterase status \[was undertaken\] in a specialised external laboratory,” Eckardt,  Steindl,  and their colleagues said. They are referring to the German Army laboratory in Munich – the Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie der Bundeswehr (IPTB). A report from that source was first announced publicly by the German government on September 2, though no details have been published.	1643194604.0	hua2sk4	t3_s7uppw	t1_hua0mnx	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hua2sk4/

And him (a song hero) never unbuttons his shirt, because he has nakolka on his chest. It's a prison tatoo. Then something about his hard fate =))  I thing this is essential. Tatoo could have a meaning, or be just a beautiful picture. Guys in army showed their tatoos, and said that scorpion means warrior, bat - recon, parashoot - paratrooper, bat with parashoot - paratrooper recon. I'd like not to trigger a guy with such tatoo.  Also there are criminal tatoos. A church on a chest, the ring on fingers, stars on knees. It's better to stay away from such guys if you are not connected with thier world.  Some could ask what that tatoo means. I've heard that one guy got an hieroglyph tatoo without knowing its meaning. Then it appeared that hieroglyph means "a virgin of a noble house".

And my "elderly" was gay, but nothing really gave him out, I havent really know that he was gay for 3 or 4 mounths. And only one person from the whole department had gave a shit about it and confronted him with some stupid question like "why are you gay", later he asked his forgiveness.     I dont think most russians have any issue with gays, unless they are looking wierd. Like I dont support LGBT as a political power, but the things that are going in your bed is your things...

aq471868	I think there were about the same number of office workers in Moscow as there are now, adjusted for the growth in the population of the capital.   The 98th year really was, and after it there was a fall for at least a year, then salaries began to recover. I'm talking about the level of salaries in dollars, of course.   About a salary of 1.5-2 thousand a month, and even for a dental technician - I don’t know where they could pay so bad in 2001. It was 100 bucks a month. In Moscow, even students did not want to go after lessons to work for this money.   I can’t say for all other regions, the situation was different everywhere. In the central regions, salaries were, of course, lower than in Moscow, and perhaps twice as much. If not more. But in Kamchatka, sailors could get good money, and in dollars.	1643196797.0	hua5r71	t3_scnpi0	t1_hua4s7t	/r/AskARussian/comments/scnpi0/how_popular_is_president_putin/hua5r71/

Sounds simple, but for Russian speakers it’s sort of weird that, for example, Daria would be Daria, and not ‘Dasha’/‘Dashenka’ even if she is 1yo referred by her patents	1643196945.0	hua5yrc	t3_scuplm	t3_scuplm	/r/AskARussian/comments/scuplm/who_else_as_a_native_continues_to_use_their/hua5yrc/

1nr4zcn4	I mostly agree with your post. What you describeed, though naively, is one of capitalism's pillars - class oppression in the sphere of ideology, and one of it's modern symptoms - breach of people's personal freedoms.  Russia and, really, all other governments, dictated by their ruling classes, behave in the same matter you describeed as it has become the defining feature of modern capitalism. Earlier they relied more on blunt force, now they prefer much more subtle tools, adding to that that boosts profits too.   You are not the first person I encountered with these thoughts, especially after Corona and how it was handled with all these restrictions, lockdowns and such other repressive measures. Many people in Russia think that way.   But although realizing that is good, it's not enough to change anything, because change only comes through action.	1643198983.0	hua90q0	t3_sd0b5s	t3_sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/hua90q0/
rhjcs	>there is a slight chance Zhirinovsky could become a president of Russia  No. Zhirinovsky is basically a paid clown on Putin's payroll. He is allowed to say anything, but in exchange for that he and his party always vote in parliament to support everything Putin proposes. There is no thing as "LDRP party", it's just a different department of ER (Putin's party).  But yes, if for whatever reason he'd become president, I think it would be like Trump, but unlike Trump, it would be more destructive because Trump was held back because US separation of power is working, while in Russia it's not a thing. So like if a president of Russia wants to build a wall, the only thing that might stop him is that his friends who get that contract will pocket all the money.	1643199116.0	hua987u	t3_schg7e	t3_schg7e	/r/AskARussian/comments/schg7e/what_would_change_if_zhirinovsky_would_take_the/hua987u/

I know it's normal for Americans to use diminutives like Bill even when referring to presidents, but for a Russian, full first name + patronymic is the respectful form of address to be used by default with anyone of higher social standing or age, and using diminutives for adults sounds quite a bit infantile.	1643199679.0	huaa537	t3_scuplm	t1_hu92jdz	/r/AskARussian/comments/scuplm/who_else_as_a_native_continues_to_use_their/huaa537/

The application form is "Приложение N 5". It must be filled in 2 copies and submitted to the embassy/consulate; a document confirming the identity and place of residence must be shown to the consulate officer. Attached must be 3 photos (3x4 cm), receipt for the consulate fee and the following documents: a confirmation of her German residency (if not indicated in her passport), confirmation of her deregistration from her Russian place of residency (if not indicated in her passport), confirmation of her new German citizenshop or the fact that she's approved for it, confirmation from the Russian tax services that she has no tax debt. The documents should be translated into Russian; documents issued by foreign authorities should  legalized buy the consulate or apostilled (with some exceptions - so I don't know for sure if it's necessary for Germany).	1643203744.0	huahl7c	t3_sd4xaf	t3_sd4xaf	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd4xaf/process_to_renounce_russian_nationality/huahl7c/

Usually green tea is considered Uzbek tea, and black tea with milk is Kazakh. There's also  a tea with butter and salt,  called Atkan chay by Uyghurs and shirchoy by Uzbeks and Tajiks, that is considered traditional Uyghur tea.  But I personally can't imagine how it tastes and Kazakhs don't drink it.	1643203942.0	huahzqe	t3_sd24yx	t1_hua2njb	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd24yx/what_kind_of_tea_do_russians_like/huahzqe/

hwp3hyyb	I asked to call me Jenny when lived abroad, sounds closest to Zhenya. It was easier for everyone. Now I work in Russia, but with lots of expats and they learned to call me full name Evgenia. Still some mispronounce G as Zh.  Also many foreigners think that, for example, Nadezhda and Nadya are different names, while Nadya is just non-formal version of full name Nadezhda. English language adopted non-formal versions as separate names. But for Russians it sounds too familiar to call an adult barely known woman Nadya. We use such short names for kids, or friends and family. Misha Barton for us sounds crazy, cause Misha in Russian is a male name only.	1643205955.0	huamalx	t3_scuplm	t3_scuplm	/r/AskARussian/comments/scuplm/who_else_as_a_native_continues_to_use_their/huamalx/
ansvphu6	There are many Soviet adaptations of Western works. And you won't believe it, people are portrayed as people there. Sometimes the plot could be slightly adjusted, for example: in "Treasure Island" in 1937, the main characters are looking for treasures to buy weapons and ammunition for the Irlan uprising of 1798, Jimmy turns out to be a girl Jenny in love with Dr. Livesey, and Trelloni runs over to the side of the pirates. And the Soviet film adaptation of "Tom Sawyer" is quite accurate, there are even real Negroes there. In the 1936 film Circus, a charming white American woman gave birth to a black boy, her German boss tries to blackmail her, but in the end she finds her happiness in the USSR, where no one cares about race. In "The Man from Capuchin Boulevard" 1987, the Wild West is parodied, but the Americans there look like Americans. In some films of the Great Patriotic War, the Germans were depicted in caricature, but in later films they are depicted more plausibly, a vivid example: "17 moments of spring". This is not at all like the depiction of Russians in American works as Uruk-hais.	1643205982.0	huamcsi	t3_sceqhh	t1_hu62r5h	/r/AskARussian/comments/sceqhh/how_do_you_feel_about_being_so_often_portrayed_as/huamcsi/

disf4zb8	I’m not apolitical, I’m a leftist. Why would I die for an empire?   Hypothetically, if another country invaded the states, I wouldn’t fight. I would take my family and try to go to Mexico. I don’t care about any country as much as I care about actual human beings, IE my family. I’d rather live as a refugee than die a martyr. I have nothing but respect for refugees of this world. It takes more bravery to try to make a new life than to die and leave your children as orphans.   Yes, America is the empire now, but this isn’t unique to today. Russia was an empire once. Imagine dying in a cold field in Manchuria in 1905 from a Japanese artillery. Why? So the empire can try to colonize some other country thousands of miles away? I won’t die for a politician who will only ever see me as a statistic. There’s no point in dying for any country if I can live in peace somewhere else with my loved ones.	1643207583.0	huaq0mj	t3_s7uppw	t1_huaognw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/huaq0mj/

And if you look at the figures of the average salary, even for IT, they are very sad. In order to get more or less normal, you need to be at least an experienced specialist in a sought-after direction. And this is not all IT people.

Besides the preference for a type of tea, the tea mixes can be good and bad (the size of the leaves, how they are prepared etc), so I wouldn't advise buying and gifting them in bling.

Your media lying to you every second of your life no matter on what side you are. Liberals lying about conservatives and conservatives about liberals and they both trying to show Russia such evil as it possible (yep, Russian government IS evil, but not even close that bad like western media draw them)  Fact checking on any political news will give you all the answers if you have time for it.   Meanwhile, In Russia government struggle with freedom of speech and free media, for sure, but they are not successful in it:) We have real journalism in Russia that they can’t block for now - we have ton of brilliant unbiased YouTube journalists with real reports and millions views by Russian citizens who don’t trust government at all. We have very popular in Russian media source meduza.ru (there is also .com option) that publicates unbiased news no matter what and a lot of Russians read them (even if recently government actively trying to struggle Meduza).  Dictatorship in Russia gave a birth to a lot of independent, good quality media sources there.

That should be a familiar scenario for americans that watch some of the horrible interactions with police that went wrong.  Imagine you send guns and ammo and make Ukraine say they feel threatened so that they move their forces to our border. While saying that we’re most definitely attack them. What would you do? No one asks us what is true. CNN is an avatar of everlasting symbol of truth which aren’t allowed to question. Your question only explains why they able to say whatever without proving anything.   If anyone on the conservative side will interview a russian they’re immediately russian bots or whatever is the new buzzword for it.	1643213990.0	hub6i9b	t3_scco15	t1_hu75aa0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scco15/russian/hub6i9b/

Do you know how close the Ukrainian troops are to Donbas?  I was just going off where you mentioned their them putting troops next to Donbas, which doesn't necessarily mean they violated the Minsk II unless they're inside the 15km buffer zone.	1643214531.0	hub806p	t3_scsakl	t1_huayjku	/r/AskARussian/comments/scsakl/with_so_many_russians_against_invading_ukraine/hub806p/

11uxyfnu	Should: forget stereotypes. They're 99% fiction and Russians aren't cloned in vats (mostly). Ballet culture is one such thing - it exists, but few Russians relate to it.  Should NOT: make mom jokes, offer vodka to co-worker's bear, stress out over trying to fit in.  Hate: Russophobia.  All in all, you'll survive most wild encounters. Just try to act natural or you might startle them.  Seriously, Russians are same as everyone else - with both cunts and decent folks aplenty. Do as you do and if misunderstandings arise, decent folks will get over it and cunts don't matter.	1643215035.0	hub9eh7	t3_sd91sq	t3_sd91sq	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd91sq/new_job_only_british_person_with_russian_team/hub9eh7/

8q9wiblq	Well, Russians do seem rude sometimes, but there are several factors in play.   First of all, our intonations tend to be flat, and rising notes are quite uncommon. That’s why, if you ever happen to hear a Russian mom talking to her child at the playground in Russian, you might believe that she’s saying something like “I hate you”. However, it’s usually “my sweet child, you look so pretty today”. So, Russian language sounds rude by itself.   Secondly, not a lot of Russians speak English, so they might get frustrated by not being able to help you. ESL school teachers might be harsh sometimes, so some people are just traumatized :) I know that sometimes locals start explaining something in Russian, but if they get something like “I don’t speak Russian”, they keep speaking Russian BUT MUCH LOUDER CAUSE WE HOPE IT MIGHT HELP YOU MY POOR FOREIGNER. Makes no sense. Still pretty common. However, unfortunately, I’ve noticed that over the years a large proportion of population even in Moscow started to believe in this “foreigners want to invade our sacred country” BS. I was once taking the underground with my American friend, so we were speaking English. One woman grew visibly upset and starting scolding us, without realizing I was Russian.   Well. I wouldn’t recommend traveling alone at night in Moscow. Especially in the city center (suburbs tend to be quieter). The biggest problem here is that if, God forbid, something happens to you, you’re unlikely to get any proper help at the police station due to the language barrier. I have a really vague simplistic image of Australian cities (courtesy of 5 seasons of MKR), but, yeah, it’s more dangerous compared to Australia. And way noisier. No kangaroos, though :))  I’d say it’s dangerous to the mental health cause it takes A LOT of time to get there. There might have been some accidents, but Russian trains seem to be quite safe. Sometimes even comfortable.   Sochi sounds like a great choice, even though not for a long trip. Also, I’d recommend considering St Petersburg as a nice addition to a trip to Moscow, you can take a Sapsan train, which is really fast and convenient. As for the Siberian trip, I’d strongly recommend looking for a reliable tourist agency. Also, you might love Murmansk region. This is a wonderful place, you can Google “Teriberka” for a reference. Also, there are a few tourist agencies that are focused on working with clients from Canada / the US and Chine, so they’ll provide you with anything you might need.	1643215493.0	hubap38	t3_sbj34p	t1_hu8btdd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbj34p/what_do_russians_think_about_australia/hubap38/

h87yiuii	>What is my media? What is my media saying?  You don't have to pretend to be dumb. It's not your media, it's the Western mainstream media, and at this point, with all the propaganda and selective reporting, one shouldn't be obliged to explain what they're saying about all the "rival" countries. Your media, with all its freedom and independence, is full of SHIT. But then again, so is the Russian media.  >Is it possible that your tightly controlled state run media isn't giving you the full story?  Your argument would've had at least some weight if I was the one bothering Americans on r/AskAnAmerican with what my "tightly controlled state run media" was telling me.   >America doesn't hate Russia. Not the American people, not the American government.  There is no Russophobia.  This is just some abstract, anecdotal opinion, some people in the West absolutely hate Russia, and some people don't differentiate between the government and the people, since the line between the two is blurry to begin with and with worsening relations between countries, people tend to become more radical and opinionated. And make no mistake, most people that hate Russia do so because there is propaganda aimed at it... hmmm, if only there was a word for that... let's call it "anti-Russian sentiment" or "Russophobia" for short.   >That's propaganda designed to keep you distracted from Putin's shortcomings as a leader.  Thanks for telling me, I guess all those times when Americans and especially Europeans insulted me online just because I had a Cyrillic name, called me a Kremlin bot for having a different opinion and not willing to tolerate slander, vodka chugging Russki, cheater, snow nigger, etc. was just a fever dream. This is something akin to a white person telling a black person that racism doesn't exist and it's all just propaganda fabricated by BLM.  > I don't like Putin's corrupt oligarchic regime.  Same, but sadly, Western elites do like Putin and his oligarchic regime, since they were able to siphon trillions of dollars from Russian economy during his reign. These oligarchs now own real estate all over Europe and the US, football clubs, largest yachts, luxurious cars, castles, manors, palaces, you name it.  >The sooner you kick that ex-KBG warmonger to the curb the better. Find a leader that can fix your economy and not harass your neighboring countries.  Are you willing to give any more brilliant advice from the comfort of your armchair?  >Join the EU.  No, thanks.  >Join NATO.  We tried. Twice, actually. First time under Stalin, he was denied and had to create Warsaw Pact as a counterweight. Second time during Putin's first term and despite all the calls for common security system in Europe, that would completely remove any chance of a nuclear conflict between Russia and the West, he was also denied. I guess at this point it became clear that NATO is just a "no Russia" club.  >I have no limits on information in my country. I read different perspectives from all over the world, including Russia.  And yet you are this clueless and naive.  >Be careful. I'm not your enemy.  I know that you're not my enemy. You're just daft.  > I want the Russian people to live in peace, happiness and prosperity.  Me too, but America wouldn't enjoy a democratic, prosperous Russia that is also not under American boot.	1643215662.0	hubb672	t3_scsakl	t1_hu9cj6l	/r/AskARussian/comments/scsakl/with_so_many_russians_against_invading_ukraine/hubb672/

9ws0o	Don't believe in all you see in this reddit subject. All you can see is obviously one (very subjective) point of view of pro-Kremlin people.  Ukraine since 2014 has had TWO presidential elections (won by two different people) and TWO parliament elections. Both presidential and parliamentary elections were won by people and parties stating a pro-European position. That means that Ukrainians at least FOUR TIMES in the last 6 years confirmed that they don't want to go with Russia.  Kremlin pushing the (false) statement that "ukrainians and russians are very similar". That's why they cannot allow demonstrating the free will of the common ("very similar") people in Ukraine, that have chosen freedom over Putin's Russia. Because any free democratic elections in Russia itself (if allowed) will show the same - how low the support of the current regime of president Putin among russians.	1643218289.0	hubim8d	t3_rzlhld	t1_hrw0eg5	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/hubim8d/

If the ОДКБ decide to expend his alliance , and  start to put decisive weapons and troops let’s say in Mexico and Groenland ,what do you think will happen ? Now let’s talk about historical context . Check how many times foreign countries or alliance of countries tried to invade Russia  , and just realize that if people made  history , the opposite is true as well . Almost 30 millions people died during WWII and it was not only German Soviet Union were fighting: Finnish , Hungarians , Italians, some Ukrainians,Bulgarians ..  how do you think Russia will react about the presence of  new alliance of foreign  troops at the border ? The négociation were conducted in the Normandie format , with French and Germany , and some deals were signed by all the involved partners. Who break this deal ? Do you know that in diplomacy , when some actor  start to break official agreements, then it’s really hard to get back and situation can escalated quickly .

Is Putin's program or any other politician's program fundamentally different? What happened to those promises of doubling GDP, catching up Portugal by GDP per capita? And How 'bout ridiculous claims that every one in Russia who's making 17K RUR/month is middle class. LOL.  >  Today we have a bit shaky but working consensus between state and all big taxpayers.  LMAO. That's called corruption and bribe. Good investment for big taxpayers, but real suck deal for most population of Russia. I've seen article in Novaya comparing KRAZ tax payings in late Yeltsin times and under Putin. It went down hundred times. Before KRAZ was biggest tax payer in Krasnoyarsk region with share of 1/3 of the budget, now not even in top-10 and not because economically it's doing much worse than in 90's. It's other way, there's more production and more pollution as well, but less taxes. If tax dept were really doing it's job this wouldn't happen.   > we will see hell on earth.  It's already there, when infants being born with cancer in Krasnoyarsk, KRAZ optimizing taxes by bribes. Massive pollutions in Norilsk going with small fine comparing to damage. It's just most famous cases, I'm sure there's tons corrupted companies like that in Russia. Because they cheat on taxes the whole country lays in ruins.  > Yet again I must remind, that simply raising minimum wage isn’t going to solve poverty problems. That’s just wishful thinking.  Hmm, and why would they go up? Don't prices go up when Putin let's his Rotenberg friend to waste money from those funds on new project? Not giving people their money, because of imaginary inflation is good tactic to ensure eternal poverty. Is there any good reasons to not improve infrastructure all around Russia?    > It’s still billions. How exactly this hole will be patched, that’s what I want to know.  If you never heard of multiplicator effect, I suggest take economics course. Small business help households provide for themselves and grow with time, that helps goods consumption and economy growth in general. When that helps big companies to produce more goods, sell more goods and pay more taxes. Independent citizen, that doesn't require and subsidies from the state is big achievement already, look at Russia, where half of society is leeching of the State in some way and demands their "discount".  > Not having an economy of your own is not something one should be proud of or brag about.  I wonder what you mean under that? Polish economy is in the great shape and developing rapidly. It's one of the most stable in Europe with average growth of 4% annually foe the last 20 years. Economy growth has reflection of every sphere of life, but first starting with salaries. Did you hear about 13th pension? Minimum pension of 1500 zloty for every old person, that's receiving less than that? And no taxes for everyone until you make certain amount. As you see in some countries authorities really doing something for people in term of giving to them, not taking away from them, like raising pension age. Who wouldn't want to live in Poland after that? Only lazy, jk.  You seriously want to compare it to Russian corrupt economy, owned by few Putin's friends and the rest by foreign benefiters anyway? Russia, where salaries in steady decline for last 7 or already 8 years because of Putin's political failures starting annexation of Crimea and starting war on Donbass in 2014 that caused sanctions by the world community.   > But millions will still be fired according to Navalny plans and thrown into the streets.

11nx44x	Sadly, you are vastly oversimplifying the situation. The days of fighting wars for national pride and expansion are over. The military industrial complex and large companies with a suffocating influence over the US government could make lucrative profits off a little skirmish, and that’s all the matters to them, the bottom line.  If you don’t believe me then ask around. Everyday people buy stocks in drones and military companies already, sales will explode if even a small proxy war happened. Iraq is an example of how far we will go to flex our might, how little we care about where the cash comes from, and how delusional our people are as to how “good” we are for the world. Fuck that. We make life good here by stepping on most of the rest of the world, it’s no wonder they despise us for it.  I honestly doubt Russia, China, or anyone else would be any better. Putin will not start a war with Ukraine unless the Russian elite can profit from it.  Most likely, nothing will come from this. Russia seems to have realized invasion would be a bad idea. But what happens when we continue to pollute the globe and resources run thin? Will we still care about profit then?  I am not worried about Ukraine but I am very concerned for the future of this world. I think the only thing the every day American, Russian, or anyone else has in common these days is that we’re all stuck on this ride together.	1643222348.0	hubu3m3	t3_s7uppw	t1_hu8cl72	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hubu3m3/
12sv3g	One certain thing you definitely shouldn't do is rush to conclusions about someone being rude to you because of the way they build their sentences.      The guys may be fluent in English, but there's a common trait in the way we (I believe, not just Russians, but Slavs) tend to build the words we say in English. Russian (and all Slavic languages) has much more flexible order of words to use in the sentence to express different nuances. We're used to it. And when we switch to English we lack the instrument that makes speech "alive" and "not robotic". You guys usually use extra words and phrases to express such nuances.       So let's say one needs to ask another to send some email. It may be said as "отправь письмо" (literally, "send the email") for a neutral emotion, "письмо отправь" (literally "the email send") for a bit pushy and rude command, or "отправишь письмо?" (literally "will you send the email?") for a meaning of "is it okay for you to send the email?". There're other ways to say that but the latter example might give you a hint our languages have different ways to express politeness.      So when a Russian knows English just enough to be able to effectively communicate with their colleagues, but yet not enough to adopt the English tools such as "would you", "could you", "wouldn't you mind" etc, their speech may sound "angry", "annoyed", or plain rude for an English native speaker. My advice is please remember 95% of times that's not what they mean.	1643222408.0	hubu9np	t3_sd91sq	t3_sd91sq	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd91sq/new_job_only_british_person_with_russian_team/hubu9np/

tpj90ey	I’m not implying anything. I was quoting. Other than that I’m just guessing. Any dumb numb person in the world knows that is insane. Putin can be rough but loves his money and it’s counterproductive. Why would you think he was sending people and weapons to Donbas? Why not just invade if he’s that dumb? Imagine news in Mexico USA forces are moving towards our border!! And world saying what? Noone gives a shit. Because it’s US land and they can do whatever. But if we speak about it you start to wonder. If you want to blame Russia it’s easy. But I see why what’s happening could be of use for only Ukraine and USA. Just simple geopolitics not thinking they’re evil. Ukraine can’t even do anything at this point. Imagine how much time you need to negotiate to get weapons and other shit in between countries? And they got like literally in a day after the news break out. I think US even talked about it with Putin, there will be a stalemate until it won’t be useful. Putin sells oil bucks by a higher price because of it and then it’ll go down. But I just imagining things and don’t know much. And think that states don’t give shit about us that’s my baseline.	1643225389.0	huc2nek	t3_scco15	t1_huc09sp	/r/AskARussian/comments/scco15/russian/huc2nek/

However, ex-pat populations from countries that have already been listed as not overly keen on Russians might tip the balance in terms of the city's attitude to Russia.	1643228649.0	hucbtmy	t3_sd8jf4	t1_hubtj5e	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd8jf4/top_five_russofobic_countries_top_five_prorussian/hucbtmy/

fbuon	> If there has been an invasion 8 years, then stop screaming like it's suddenly any different.  Looks like you have crying problem, childfree sect member? Invasion that happened 8 years ago was localized in certain areas under Minsk amendments, now there's talks about new full-scale war.   > And your propaganda preaches what?  I don't create propaganda and don't identify with any.   > That Ukraine is actually has been fighting regular Russian military and people of DNR and LNR do not engage in this war in any way, but sit idle on the side?   I don't watch to Ukrainian TV, it's not on the cable, but it's obvious that both present in Donbass, russian military and separatists. Also it's understood that without russian involvement war there wouldn't start in 2014. Your country is directly responsible for this war, all blood of 15K dead people is on your hands.  >  Please, if Ukraine was fighting Russian military then it would have ended in two weeks, like Georgian war.  Yeah, that's another myth that russian propagandons trying to feed it's sheep auditory. In reality results aren't that impressive. Remember interviews of captured paratroopers from Pskov division, that's one of 3 elite ones AFAIR? They were not that brave at all, lol. It's not possible to win war in two weeks today against big European country such as Ukraine. We all know this. You can capture some territory, but then what? Guerilla war will start and eventually you will lose everything and will be forced to retreat. I'm sure that Ukrainians can fight way better than Afghanis and we all know that USSR wasn't able to conquer it in almost 10 years. Ukrainians are fighting for their Motherland. What are Russian occupants fighting for? Putin's money? Possibility for his friends to steal more? You will never win a war against Ukraine or Belarus. Stop dreaming.   > Yes, single man started a war just like that.  Terrorist group of Girkin that kidnapped Slaviansk included over 50 people. About the same that was in Shamil Basaev's group.  > It's the vice versa that butthurts you so much  Never noticed own butthurt about the fact that someone speaks Russian. It's funny and partly sad when some of you speak ONLY Russian, but not my problem anyway, just result of your school system degradation, thanks to Putin's policies. But there were numerous times, when I saw butthurted Russians, when they hear people speaking Ukrainian and Belarusian. And even with this situation of Ukrainization in Ukraine today. Who is mostly butthurt? Ukrainians? No. Belarusians? No. Russians in Ukraine? No, again. It's again imperial chauvinistic Russians in Russia who are hurt most. Kinda funny, I admit.  > Ukrainian citizens understanding and preferring content in Russian.  That's result of hundred years of forced Russification after occupation of RI tsars. You were fined and jailed for chosing Ukrainian content. But situation will be changed and it's changing already. Ukrainian government is taking steps in this direction and this makes Putin and you guys so mad.   > Because Ukraine is not an enemy state? If you want to see how enemies behave to one another, then look at Armenia and Azerbaijan. No trade, no gas pipes, no migration, no media representation.  Not necessarily. All wars are different, same with attitudes of people. There's extreme cases such as Armenia vs Azerbajgan, Israel vs Palestina and there's mild ones Like Russia vs Ukraine. Where we talk mostly about hybrid war now.     >  no media representation  Btw, I've seen somewhere that last Ukrainian journalist Tsymbalyuk was recently told to leave Moscow.  Migration is already hard, with covid and stuff, but not so easy for Russians to visit Ukraine, for known reasons. Gas pipes can't be unbuilt, you know.   > You are welcome to go and cry to Unicode Consortium about this.   Why should I cry about it? It seems that you having problems identifying where people are from, not me. I'm just a user, if sub owners didn't took extra time make it more comfortable to users, why should I care?  > You do know that nazism is a subset of fascism, right?  I do and lukashysm is another subset of it.   Luka is grandson of fascist, he spoke about his devotion of Hitler and his regime long time ago in 1995 and since then he's built similar system in Belarus.

fbuon	> Their main arguments are : that During interwar and the commonwealth years majority of the population was polish or polish speaking.  Hehe, but many of those 'polish speaking' people were Belarusians. Because after Russian occupation those mofo closed all schools and Vilnya university. You could only get education in Kasciol or Russian church. Russians were occupants, nobody liked or trusted them and zombie propaganda about Tsar-batyushka, Belarusian and Lithuanian education was banned, Kasciols were in Polish, so we had no other choice where to learn. For learning at home, unauthorized by Russian occupational government you could get huge fine. Polish speaking was one real option for our people.  They are using some ridiculous arguments like some guy here:  "What happened to 200 thousands Lithuanians in 3 years between 1862 and 1865? And where did almost 300 thousands Belarusians come from?"  https://www.quora.com/Is-Vilnius-a-Polish-city/answer/Jonas-Galtas-1?comment_id=202592868&comment_type=2  Obviously this guy and others at the thread never heard of self-identification. That people who previous identified themselves as "litvin", which we consider Belarusian and you guys consider "Lithuanian" have not disappeared. Just more people openly called themselves Belarusians after the revolt of Kastus' Kalinouski 1863-1864.  > And that Poland was a senior partner in the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth therefore they should have no claims in commonwealth lands.  Poland Kingdom was bigger country and can be considered senior partner, but confederation was created on equal grounds. When someone tries to claim your lands it's occupation and no different from Russian one.   > THey mention that polish was the official and mostly spoken language.  For reasons I explained this is understood, why it was this way.   > Also are you a belarussian nationalist?   To a certain degree. I want best to my country and it's people, but I'm not against other countries, unless they represent danger to existence of mine. And we all know which one does that in our region.   > whats the point of being a nationalist and preserving ones culture?  The point is having some pride and moral orienteers.

But something went wrong.. Since Empire was established from Peter the Great till Aleksander the First was a long stretch of military successes.  During Aleksander the Third and Nikolai the Second huge cultural boom has happened which lasted into Soviet Union until Stalin's repressions. After Stalin's death there was another cultural boom, but it was over by mid 60s.

Такая сумма пенсии выплачивается только тем, у кого нет стажа  Нет, когда работаете на кого-то всю жизнь с хорошей зарплаты да. Но когда на себя или с неофициальной зарплатой. Все так и может закончится. Не копили деньги на будущее и вот результат такой. Если у вас в семье все хорошо, конечно рад для вам но далеко не у всех все был так хорошо.  > Муж у нее давно на пенсии и все равно придется работать потому что не хватает  Получается так, он платит алименты бывшей жене и получается что содержат с тещей 3 ребенка. Ну родили детей очень поздно и что теперь делать?

Я могла бы позволить себе вообще не работать - настолько "ужасна" экономическая ситуация в России..)   Это правда до тех пор как вы вместе. Если вдруг вы попадете в разводе... Ваша идеальная жизнь может просто так закончится в ад и потом уже просто поздно будет и у вас пенсия будет нулевая. Например завтра он исчезает по неизвестным причинам... как будете жить дальше? Вы сможете взять на себя все затраты, дом, еда, коммуналка, машина итд? Например, если вдруг я умру завтра, моя страховка будет оплачивать дом полностью и ипотека закроется. Так что моя семья не будет без дома. Всякое бывает в жизни но если вы так будете жить, у вас пенсия минимальной. Мои родители с небольшой пенсии могут себе позволить купить дорогую машину, летать в Европу, ремонт делать и жить без заботы и при этом деньги остаются на то что бы считался люксовые продукты в России. В это время, дедушка моей жене должен был подготовить рассади всю зиму чтобы летом их продавать на "рынке" и пахать в земле чтобы не покупать овощи летом и законсервировать как можно больше чтобы не тратить деньги. Я тебе уверяю он этого не делал для радости жизни.   >  - думаю, что бабушки это делают для общения. У нас так же бабушки собираются толпой кормить у подъезда кошек.  думай думай, если бы для общения делали, то бы просто собирались чай попить а не продавать все что можно.  > - это вы не понимаете) Россия стала автаркией(спасибо санкциям). Ваша канада может похвастать тем, что она полностью на самообеспечении?..  Ахах, Россия стала "автаркией". Смешно как. Даже Россия не может хвастаться этим. Делать сыр это уж не так трудно) Но даже если мы практически все можем делать в Канаде. Такая идея "самообеспечении" нет. Это просто бессмысленно. Нет смысла делать самому того что кто делает хорошо и продает по демократичной ценой.   Это не случайно что много заводов в Америке закрыли и открылись в Китае. И таким образом, заводы в Китае закроют и откроют в стране где будет дешевле. Самообеспеченность это как решить делать все у себя любой ценной когда можно делать тоже самое дешевле и быстрее в другой стране.  Так что нет, похвастаться этим Канада не может и наверно никогда не будет потому что это не цель и если вдруг случайно будет так, то нет смысла хвастаться тем что получилось случайно. Я себе представляю идти к родителям и хвастаться что я самообеспечён и что мне их помощь не нужна.. не о чем говорить больше что-ли?   > Изучайте и не пишите глупостей.  Езжайте в других регион России там где в основном люди покупают продукт в магните или в пятерочке. Вы мне ничего нового не учили. Понимаете, на сколько я хорошо зарабатываю. Я знаю что мой уровень жизни на много лучше чем среднестатистический канадец. Я знаю что далеко не все живут как я. Я не жил в богатой семье. Я видел как очень бедные живут тут и в России. Когда вы мне говорите как будто все офигительно живут в России. Вы себе обманываете, со своим ограниченным взглядом о мире. Вы можете себе позволить не работать, а количество людей которые должны работать до самой смерти на много больше. Вы зачем злитесь когда вам говорят что есть на что работать.   не все плохо но закрывать глаза на все не решает ничего.

So it will certainly continue to mimic IRL statements by polarizing opinions and grudges, frustrations, arguments.  There would be an avoidable part of fueling this by limitating bad troll sometimes while encouraging more subtle and fun one, something to federate a bit more members.

9mpxf37e	On the contrary. The government has been creating additional ways to take the public opinion into account. Every notable case that attracts attention of the public gets a reaction from the officials. Sometimes it's enough to complain in the social media, even without official request, but also there's a nation-wide program to get citizens a platform to complain about virtually any inconvenience, and officials must respond to every request in short term.	1643812036.0	hva1ytq	t3_siexe3	t1_hv97wku	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hva1ytq/

Central government actually was more or less against that expansion to the south to avoid confrontation with China but local siberian administration allowed it arguing that there are no chinese (han) permanent population there so it isn't actually China. Chinese administration argued that local tribes are chinese tributaries, so it is China, but they weren't very adamant about that, so it went rather easy for Russia.	1643812719.0	hva3l3q	t3_sipqjk	t1_hva24du	/r/AskARussian/comments/sipqjk/why_did_the_russian_empire_take_outer_manchuria/hva3l3q/

Our country house was robbed several times (now there is a security and alarm system). A driver's license in the USSR were not relevant, since it was necessary to spend 2 annual salaries of my father on a car, and cars were also issued in turn, which had to wait for several years. The majority of people started buying cars in the early 2000s, before that they lived poorly. In the 90s there was a lot of crime and corruption, university diplomas were sold right on the street.	1643812782.0	hva3qhg	t3_siawdf	t3_siawdf	/r/AskARussian/comments/siawdf/how_did_daytoday_stuff_like_driving_licences_car/hva3qhg/

The narrative is that Western democracy does not work, elites do everything as they want, people can't influence at all, so why we should develop it in Russia?  When you object that on the West there are competitive elections, protests are always considered as major factor and authorities do something with it they'll always ask"So, you want protests? You want it like in Paris? You want looting?"  At the same time the RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY always works best, authorities listen to people and since the ruling party never changed, there is the stability, no "clowns in parliament", everything is peaceful and decorous.	1643812939.0	hva44ai	t3_siexe3	t1_hv8vrcp	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hva44ai/

If we are talking about the United States, then there is not democracy but an oligarchy, the situation is better in Europe, but only because the maintenance of the army and navy is not required from Europe, all costs are borne by the United States. Only global megacorporations can pay for such expenses, hence the corresponding state system.

wfsm7	You are claiming that the empire - back during the Manchurian adventures - had no need of further territories because it apparently already controlled some resource-rich areas.    I'm just telling you that your simplification of "controlling some resource-rich areas" is useless if you want to have any actual understanding of history. You need to evaluate the accessibility of that resource, the profit (if any) found in its extraction, and the logistical constraints of actually exporting it. So yes, in context of your question, every piece of land you've listed above was functionally useless for the Russian Empire because the technology to exploit it simply did not exist in the 19th century, and the majority of natural resources of the far north are still not profitable for extraction today in 2022.     Thus, their control or lack of control over Chukotka, Kamchatka and Alaska is as relevant for this question as control of Antarctica.	1643816920.0	hvae8ej	t3_sipqjk	t1_hvadmom	/r/AskARussian/comments/sipqjk/why_did_the_russian_empire_take_outer_manchuria/hvae8ej/

It is about doing what people want. How many people in those countries want to be enemies with Russia?  Leaders get elected for life everywhere. Roosevelt, Merkel, de Gaulle, Chirac...  These leaders could have been elected indefinitely. Why? They actually did what people wanted or at least they were perceived as doing what people wanted.  Lets take Roosevelt, he got elected 4 times. Does anyone doubt that he would have won in 1948 or 1952, if he was alive? Why? Because he got US out of the Great Depression. Is that true? Maybe it was due to WW2? The point is that he was perceived as responsible.  For Russia, the 1990s were roughly 3-4 times worse then the Great Depression. Putin is perceived as having gotten Russia out of that. Is that true or not it doesn't matter. He will win any election. There is no need to manipulate anything.

62el3dhz	The Polish Constitutional Tribunal, that same court that had judges replaced and appointed by the government in during the Polish 2015-2016 Constitutional Court Crisis, instead of them being elected by the Polish Lower House; came out recently to say that articles 1, 2, and 19 of the TEU were inconstitutional.   Roughly speaking, article 1 states that countries accept to be part of the Union, and that the Union is established by the TEU and the TFEU.   Article 2 states that the Union is founded based on respect for human rights, freedom, democracy, equality, non-discrimination, rule of law, etc.   Article 19 explains how the ECJ works and what are its powers.   To begin with, back in 2015-16, Poland already did some inconstitutional shady stuff within their internal borders which raised alarms within the EU institutions for breaking rule of law (article 7 which establishes how other Member States and the EU institutions should react in case a country is not adhering to the Union’s treaties).   Now, that same court which was inconstitutionally replaced, is now saying the documents they signed and ratified when the Lisbon accords were signed in 2007 and entered in force in 2009 are inconstitutional.   The Lisbon treaty (new reformed versions of the TEU and the TFEU) had its own complications, as in the beginning (2004/2005) there were plans to create an actual European Constitution which was rejected via referendum in both France and the Netherlands, hence the need of creating a more dynamic set of treaties (TEU and TFEU update during Lisbon accords in 2007/2009). Therefore, if the European treaties are inconstitutional, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal would have never signed and ratified the treaties back then.   And this is massively, massively simplified as the issue gets more law-complex and there starts a need for having lawyers from both sides for the discussion.	1643821166.0	hvapub2	t3_siexe3	t1_hvak256	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hvapub2/

62el3dhz	I am from Portugal. Together with you guys, we were the hardest hit by the Euro crisis. But what do you want? Close your borders to freedom of movement, goods, and services? Go back to the Drachma? You and I as persons we are not responsible for our governments excessive spending and subconsequent crisis provoked by it. Besides the fact that you guys have and had a complicated migrant crisis to deal with.  It is totally fair and fine if you are unhappy with the EU institutions or with some EU countries, especially during difficult times, but a lot of what you probably enjoy such as food standards and consumer protection, environmental standards, freedom of movement and cheap travelling, among many other things are due to the EU.   If you understand by “ sovereignty” as being isolated from the world, go ahead and look at countries that are closed to the world and check out how well they are doing.	1643822886.0	hvauko8	t3_siexe3	t1_hvat6ci	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hvauko8/

6aai7	Football, hockey, figure skating are the most popular for TV audience. +MMA (and boxing slightly earlier), but here the ultra-top fights (which happen like once a year) get into yearly top-10, maybe top-3, but then there is a very sharp decline in viewership, much sharper than with aforementioned sports. Then there is biathlon (now kinda declining in popularity) and skiing (now kinda growing). And F1 has its audience. Everything else, well, becomes kinda niche outside of Olympics/NT scenarios when a wider audience watches handball, volleyball and basketball.  Among American sports, I believe, it’s NHL>NBA>>everything else (NFL, NASCAR, MLS, baseball (don’t even remember the league name, sorry)). NBA was significantly more popular in the 90s because of Jordan and stuff, but then the inconvenient timing, complete lack of promotion and contracts with strange channels resulted in what we see now. Recently NBA and NHL, to a lesser extent, have started to do something adequate finally, making contracts with good portals, but they still stay niche. And watching sports declines in popularity overall, the only exceptions if we compare with the 90s, I guess, are MMA (which has its loyal audience) and figure skating (and here it grows in popularity among women after a drop in 00s; also it’s mostly older women who watch TV nowadays in general, so here we are).	1643825795.0	hvb2ih3	t3_siu4qb	t3_siu4qb	/r/AskARussian/comments/siu4qb/whats_the_sport_russians_watch_the_most/hvb2ih3/

Tennis is not that popular, but people among my friend/pal circle are mostly into it. American sports are not popular, but American football has a niche.	1643825943.0	hvb2woa	t3_siu4qb	t3_siu4qb	/r/AskARussian/comments/siu4qb/whats_the_sport_russians_watch_the_most/hvb2woa/

3o3pmwnp	I live in the US and will answer. It’s true that in American history people have been arrested for criticizing the government or its policies. But that was decades ago. In WW1 people were arrested for criticizing the war effort and the draft.       With many Supreme Court cases overturning previous law it’s become pretty much impossible for the government to arrest people who merely criticize it.   You can be arrested for threatening to harm a government official. For example, people have been arrested for calling members of Congress and threatening to kill them.     The thing to understand is the US with its First Amendment is very unusual in the amount of speech it allows. I’m not bashing Russia in fact many of America’s allies criticize its laws on speech.      In general Americans can express any thought no matter how hateful or offensive. Hate speech is legal in America. You can express racist views and not be charged.	1643826978.0	hvb5pg2	t3_siexe3	t1_hvaors2	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hvb5pg2/

8xknvrpg	1. You can write about Nizhny Novgorod. This is not very famous in the world, but an important city for Russia, which has a rich history. The name literally means "New City Down the River". Sometimes in everyday speech it is simply called "Nizhny" (lower), because in Russia there is another city called Novgorod (new city). Founded in 1221. Due to its convenient location at the junction of two rivers (the Volga, the largest river in Europe, and the Oka), the city has long been a major center of trade, it hosted the largest fair in Russia. In the center of the city there is a hill with an ancient stone fortress - the Kremlin. Yes, the Kremlin is not only in Moscow, but also in many other ancient Russian cities. This fortress has never been taken by the enemy. As in the Moscow Kremlin, the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin houses historical monuments and authorities (although not the president of Russia, but the government of the Nizhny Novgorod region). In addition to the Kremlin, many other historical buildings have been preserved in the old (central) part of the city.     In 1612, during the Time of Troubles, when Russia was in a severe crisis, Minin and Pozharsky, the national heroes of Russia, began to gather in Nizhny Novgorod the people's militia, which expelled enemies from Russia. Since the end of the 19th century and especially during the Soviet era, many industrial enterprises have been built here, including a large car factory, an aircraft factory and shipbuilding enterprises. Although Nizhny Novgorod is far from the sea, even nuclear submarines were built here, which were then transported to the sea via the river transport system in special transport docks. Today, more than 1.2 million people live in Nizhny Novgorod, this is the sixth place in Russia (and the fourth in the European part of Russia, after Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan). The city is a large industrial, educational and scientific center.     Nizhny Novgorod is located on the right bank of the Volga; on the left bank is the satellite city of Bor. In addition to bridges, they are connected by a cable car with the largest span in Europe.     A couple of good videos about the city (the first is a very short but bright and colorful aerial view, the second is a 20-minute city tour in English):   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNjkkdO-rzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNjkkdO-rzg)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0zOuBcKQ34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0zOuBcKQ34)	1643827110.0	hvb62ay	t3_si24gd	t3_si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/hvb62ay/

pf87gd6	It's not a truth by any mean. Reality is a complete opposite of your opinion. During USSR times Ukrainians ruled the country after Stalin's death, not Russians. They had 50+% of Politburo, and multiple genseks. Ukrainians were robbing Russia, as a result in 1992  Russia was the poorest republic and Ukraine the richest. There was no control over Ukraine after 1992, they freely backed chechen terrorists, annexed Crimea in 1994, they were stealing Russian gas from the transit pipeline, joined Georgia in the attack of 080808... Ukraine wasn't controlled by Russia at all. Their current problem originates from the fact that as an independent state they still haven't reached level of 1992 Ukraine and russians of Ukraine are tired of living in a shithole which tries to murder their relatives. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD?locations=UA	1643828013.0	hvb8ifd	t3_s7uppw	t1_hvar2wz	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hvb8ifd/

8xknvrpg	Children in Russia are very advanced in information technology (maybe except for those who live in very poor conditions or in very remote small villages). They play computer games, use social networks and Tiktok, etc. Of course, they also communicate “live” and can play on the street (football, catch-up, “war”; in summer they go roller-skating, skateboards and bicycles, in winter they go down the mountains on sleds and “cheesecakes”, as well as ice-skating , if there is a skating rink nearby), but smaller and less frequent than in former times. More often on the street you can meet small children who have fun on the playgrounds under the supervision of their parents and grandmothers.     Parents often try to send their children to additional classes - in sports sections, music and art schools, hobby groups (choreography, foreign languages, biology, robotics, etc.). It can be paid and even free (in the so-called "Children's Homes of Creativity", which are in almost any city and are sponsored by the state).   During the holidays, many children go to a children's recreation camp located in some picturesque area in the forest or by the sea (summer holidays last 3 months, there are still winter, autumn and spring holidays lasting 1-2 weeks each). The most famous such camp in Russia is Artek. The following video from Artek is just to illustrate what Russian schoolchildren look like:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paHDhEJkoeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paHDhEJkoeM)     If you have time, I recommend watching a good Russian science fiction film, where one of the characters is a Russian schoolboy (although he is from Moscow, but this is not significant), and the action partially takes place in a Russian school. Turn on English subtitles.

l6v2byz	That's a rather strange question to see here, but as I had some experience here are my tips:  1) Leave beef to commercial chains and multiculturalism worshippers. Pork patties are the best (and they're much more forgiving).  2) Don't take lean cuts. You need some stuff in there for good texture and juice.   3) Grate twice. With garlic, onion, pepper, a bit of worchester or oyster sauce, maybe a bit of rosemary.  4) Leave milk and bread for mommy's *kotletas*. Adding ice is pointless too - too much hassle, better add butter instead.  And it really, really should stay in the fridge for a while after.  5) Fry with butter or lard. Vegetable oils are for pussies. Don't forget to bathe the patties at the end.  6) You don't really need cheese and greens, and vegetables whatsoever. You don't need these petty excuses for eating a juicy chunk of meat. Maybe just a little bit, you know, nominally. After all, if your burger has a place for vegetables, then your patties are not big enough.  7) Barbecue sauce is easier than it seems. Gentle caramelization and deglazing are the keys.  8) It's really, really easier to buy buns than to make them. To be honest it's even easier to buy the whole burger.	1643831451.0	hvbhnej	t3_siu4pk	t3_siu4pk	/r/AskARussian/comments/siu4pk/what_are_the_best_recipes_for_making_a_burger_at/hvbhnej/

By threatening Ukraine, you are shooting yourselves in the foot. Russian hostilities only increases desires amongst these countries in Eastern Europe to strengthen their relationship with NATO.

8xknvrpg	3. Regarding names, it should be understood that each Russian name has many forms that are used depending on the circumstances. Take, for example, the male name Victor (Latin origin, meaning "Winner"). This is the "official" form that is used in documents and in a formal setting. But, for example, a mother calls her son "Victor" only if she is angry or very serious. If she is in a good mood, she will use the diminutive form "Vitya" or even the "affectionate" form "Vitenka", "Vityusha", "Vityushka". On the other hand, Victor's friends will never use the "affectionate" form; they will either call him “Vitya” too, or they will use the “familiar” form “Vitka” (the familiar form can also be abusive - for example, from a disgruntled mother), or even the “rustic” form “Vityok” (although in a certain situation it can also be affectionate; but she cannot be abusive). The teacher at school most likely uses the official form "Victor", but if he is in a good mood, then "Vitya"; a teacher of the opposite sex, who is very kind to a student, may sometimes use an "affectionate" form. (The stress is everywhere on the first syllable, except for "Vityok", where the stress is on the last syllable.)      The same applies to other names. For example, a couple of male names.      Vasiliy (Greek origin, means "royal"): diminutive form - "Vasya"; affectionate - "Vasenka" (there are several more rare forms); familiar - "Vaska", rustic - Vasyan, Vasyok. The stress in the official form is on the second syllable, in the rustic form - on the last syllable, in the rest - on the first syllable.      Michael (Jewish origin, means "like God"): a diminutive form - "Misha", very affectionate - "Mishenka", "Mishutka", familiar and at the same time affectionate - "Mishka", rustic - "Micha". Interestingly, this name is associated with a bear (or a teddy bear, especially the affectionate and familiar forms). The stress is everywhere on the first syllable, except for the official "Mikhail", where it is on the last syllable.    Here are some female names as an example.      Alexandra (Greek origin, means “Defender of People”): diminutive form - “Sasha”, less often “Shura”, affectionate - “Sashenka”, “Sashulya”, “Sashulchik”, less often “Shurochka”, familiar and at the same time rustic (if necessary, then abusive) - “Sashka”, “Shurka”. All forms except the official one have the stress on the first syllable; the official one is pronounced "Alexandra". There is a paired male name Alexandr (AlexAndr), in which other forms are similar to the female one, but there are also special short forms (“Alex” - “almost second official”, “Sanya” - familiar, “Sanyok” - rustic).      Marina (Latin origin, means "Marine"): all diminutive forms are affectionate at the same time - "Marisha", "Marinochka", "Marishka", "Marinka". Only "Marinka" can still play the role of familiarity or slightly abusive form. The stress is always on the second syllable.      Olga (Scandinavian origin, means “Holy” or “Wise”): diminutive form - “Olya”, there are many affectionate forms - “Olenka”, “Olechka”, “Olyushka”, “Olchik”, etc., familiar / rustic / sometimes abusive - "Olka". The stress is always on the first syllable.      Svetlana (Slavic origin, means “Light”, “Shining”): diminutive form - “Sveta”, affectionate - “Svetochka”, “Svetik”, “Svetulya”, “Svetlanka”, etc., familiar / rustic / abusive - "Svetka".

8xknvrpg	6. Often cats are called human names, and, depending on the circumstances, they also use different forms (mostly diminutive, affectionate and familiar forms). For example, Vasiliy (aka Vasya, Vasenka and Vaska at the same time) is a “classic” name for a male cat. It happens that the official form of the name is not used at all (for example, "Gosha" or "Goshenka", but not the official form "Georgiy"). For female cats, human names are used less often ("Masha" or "Mashka" - but not the official "Maria"; "Ksyusha" - but not the official "Xenia").  The most common name for a female cat is Murka (“Purring”), stress on the first syllable. A cat can be called Pushok (“Fluff”), stress on the second syllable. I think that's enough for now.As for dogs, they are very often given foreign names (for example, English or German name - yes, yes, any will do!), "historical" names ("Caesar"), as well as "geographical" ones ("Baikal").	1643836299.0	hvbuo5o	t3_si24gd	t3_si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/hvbuo5o/

2b66ebhs	No disrespect but the belief that NATO is merely a defensive alliance is ignorant. All military is supposedly 'defensive' in nature until one day, and it always happens, the best defense is a good offense. To fully understand why Russia is taking this to the brink and will probably invade or move missiles and troops into lands bordering NATO lands,  unless NATO concessions are made one needs to understand history. The western front of Russia has lost tens of millions of soldiers and many many millions of civilians. Civilian and military casualties,POWs, and MIAs take that number well above 100 million. And then there is the loss of commerce, property, history and legacy from war damage. Russia has a long history of being on the good-guiy side of wars that involve their western front but always reap horrific outcomes. For Putin to be concerned and taking action against an aggressive NATO expansion makes a lot of sense. To see this only from an American or western view tells me that you do not have the knowledge of history that is needed to fully understand the reasons and nuance of what is going on here.	1643837252.0	hvbxdei	t3_s7uppw	t1_hut918i	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hvbxdei/

2b66ebhs	Lol, you speak as if you are knowledgeable but boy are you wrong, and aggressively so. It has everything to do with how sanctions work. the sanctions at the base level is to prevent any commerce occurring from the allied countries. A goal is to prevent any hard currency from entering Russia. Businesses and individuals will be prohibited =by American and allied law from transacting any business with Russia while sanctions are in place. If an American visits Russia during the sanctions they would obviously be spending money and bring benefit to a country on which we have sanctioned. I am not sure why you are not mindful of this as a risk of traveling to Russia right now. smh.   With that sad, Americans caught in Russia when sanctions are levied, I suspect that if a reasonable effort is made to leave Russia in a reasonable time period then no repercussions will occur. No one in our govt is out to get Americans traveling to Russia, but once there they still need to follow American law.   If it were me, I'd still travel to Russia but I'd be mindful of what is going on and make sure I dont accidentally violate anything tied to the sanctions. Personally I think it would be an interesting time to travel there. I traveled to Kosovo as a tourist with my gf (now wife) back when NATO was basically at war there under a peace keeper mission. It was a fantastic and exciting time to travel for those that enjoy that heightened adenine type of travel. I was in Cambodia in 1997 when there was an attempted coup and the U.S. ambassadors residence was bombed. Again, interesting time to be there. But I chose to turn down a side trip into Iraq b/c of sanctions that were in place (not potentially login to happen but were in place) in 1996 when I was covering happenings in Eastern Turkey. I have no issue with travel to areas of conflict but no one should ever break the laws of either country when visiting.  Go to Russia but pay attention to what is going on and make sure the embassy has your contact information. There is no threat to your safety, but you should be respectful of our laws.	1643837960.0	hvbzc9k	t3_s7uppw	t1_huyka87	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hvbzc9k/

Just having a dick is a singular parameter. and when you're comparing countries you suppose to look at several metrics like: GDP, GDP per capita, population size, military power.. So at the very minimum you need to at least add the ability of raising your dick, the duration of time it can be used and attractiveness of your dick as perceived by partners around you.  And as for Belgium and Luxembourg - looks like they have an access to a cumulative European dildo, so have no reason to whip out what the author considered to be a tiny dick..	1643838090.0	hvbzp9o	t3_sj06os	t3_sj06os	/r/AskARussian/comments/sj06os/your_browsing_political_reddit_and_you_come/hvbzp9o/

Again, If you want to study Physics, nuclear or Astrophysics then go for MEPHI,MIPT, TOMSK STATE,TOMSK POLYTECHNIC, NOVOSIBIRSK STATE ...if you want to study economics then go for Plekhanov or HSE .

American companies even traded with Soviet Union, back in the day.... due to this thing called "jurisdiction".	1643839337.0	hvc33xb	t3_s7uppw	t1_hvbzc9k	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hvc33xb/

gf0v2vz	Do you remember what was Poroshenko promising before being elected? Are you aware of what Yatsenyuk and Turchynov have done to the country after ousting the President? Do you even know the President Yanukovich has not resigned? Answers to these questions, combined, will give you an answer to yours.   36 phonies won't make one whole opposition representative. To grasp a glimpse of the scale of this catastrophe, here's an example for you: [Tymoshenko Yuri Volodimirovich](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%AE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87). Do you know what this guy was planning for Ukraine as a President and how much population support did he gather? Here's a clear answer for you: [Tymoshenko Yulia Volodymyrivna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko), one of a few candidates that were considered to be real opponents to Poroshenko. Yes, And she wasn't even pro-Russian the last few years. Of course, if you know anyone of those who was openly pro-Russian, you could name them here :)   Also, you are told Russia considers its right to control the Ukraine by the same mass media to which Yelnya is on the Ukrainian border. Russia has no interest in border conflicts all around it, since it's interested in bringing in cheap gastarbeiters and peddling around resources and produce. And restoring broken and ~~indentured~~ indebted Ukrainian economics is definitely the last thing Russia needs. Do the math, it's simple here.	1643839864.0	hvc4ifm	t3_s7uppw	t1_hv9xroc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hvc4ifm/

No one is trying to claim that Ukraine is an excellent example of a democracy, they have a young and corrupt democracy but they still do have a democracy.   Russia needs to stop making insane demands regarding Ukraine and let Ukraine do what it wants. It is as simple as that. It's not Russia's country and most Ukrainians don't want anything to do with Russia.	1643843126.0	hvcd0x8	t3_s7uppw	t1_hvc4ifm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/hvcd0x8/

He did mention being notably absent from Seattle.    You don't sound like the immigrating type, but just for shits and giggles let's imagine this scenario:  For some catastrophic reason you must relocate from the motherland.

fbjkyium	This is a “widely known in narrow circles” conspirologist, claiming to be Russian expat residing in Czech. He wrote a lot of post in Live Journal. For example this is from a cycle where he claims that French elite lost war to Germany in 1940 intentionally, calculating that they can win but will suffer to much losses to the benefit of Britain and will be left alone with Soviets on the continent. So they decided to make others fight and change side when Germany will be exhausted. And that both Vichy and Free France were communicating, playing spectacle as many people supported Vichy, but after war they did not suffer or received symbolic punishment.  https://bohemicus.livejournal.com/118600.html	1643917671.0	hvgo28u	t3_sjlvym	t3_sjlvym	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjlvym/what_is_the_craziest_conspiracy_theory_you_heard/hvgo28u/

3w4spkpx	A former friend of mine thought that all world history is falsified, and, to pick a few examples, cherusci, etruscans and a few other peoples were actually Russians.  I mean, looking through this thread, you can see that this is a pattern, actually. We had a gigantic Communist Empire which was supposed to unite Earth and colonize near space just like that. Its propaganda in its most direct form became ineffective, but various ricochets accumulated and made people search for empires in their past, as there are none coming in the future. Some became syncretic Communists (because despite failing miserably to achieve intended goals, USSR was kinda impressive), some fans of the late Russian Empire (which wasn't all that mighty, but their thought process is just different), and some decide that they don't like world history as it is and there's something better, where Russia is a 10+ thousand years empire which has built Egyptian pyramids, reached space, dug out the Black Sea (oops, different story), and in general did everything great on our planet.	1643919578.0	hvgszt3	t3_sjlvym	t3_sjlvym	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjlvym/what_is_the_craziest_conspiracy_theory_you_heard/hvgszt3/

Patronymic is widely omitted in conversations. Also social culture now cultivates much less piety to age itself and traditional hierarchy. So yes, "ты" and absence of patronymics in communication is becoming more common and normal.   But that still doesn't mean you can go by "ты"  with strangers without their permission.

Fun fact: Moscow even took the first place in "Infrastructure development" and "Quality of life" ratings, created by UN  And some government statements say, that middle class is anyone, who makes more than 20k/month (if I remember correctly), so, according to that, I might say, that I'm in the upper class, but that's bullshit, honestly	1643922819.0	hvh1a5y	t3_sjni4w	t1_hvgwz5t	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjni4w/monthly_expenditures/hvh1a5y/

There would have to be a global conspiracy of western news outlets. They're all in competition, there's no pressure to conspire with each other. When mulitiple free press insitutions report something indepently, you have to accept that there's some truth there.  And Putin's wealth is not the only thing, there's also allegations of poisioning, interference in American elections and so forth. There's just too much smoke coming from different independent sources for me to believe he's a good guy.	1643922965.0	hvh1ogj	t3_siexe3	t1_hvfvz4a	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hvh1ogj/

4rsb8161	Economy 101: If you expenditures surpass your revenues - you go bankrupt.   USSR economic model was inefficient; lots of social programs going and not enough resources to support it.    Specifically agricultural sector was a disaster; since 1960s USSR started to purchase grain abroad and relied on this supply heavily. in the 1980's oil revenue dried up and grocery store shelves got empty.   As for Russian economic model choices: it's kinda counterproductive to restore the system you just witnessed collapsing first hand.	1643923391.0	hvh2uqu	t3_sjt7i4	t3_sjt7i4	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjt7i4/why_soviet_union_fell_apart_and_why_russia_did/hvh2uqu/

It is very difficult for a non-specialist to recognize such methods of influence.

ls9hx	Ok so I actually have two ones:  The first one came from my school's computer science teacher. While being a great teacher and a fun person, he was actually believing a whole ton of conspiracy theories, including:  - all languages in the world came from Russian, proof to that being some words sounding similar to Russian ones. My favorite example was "the word "crocodile" comes from old Russian "corca dil" which means "a horse with crust". He would also tell us that Turkic languages are "low-grade languages", and "other languages were created from Russian under Turkic influence"  - Russians arrived to Earth from Sirius. They used to be something like gods, driving flying saucers and knowing everything about everything. But then the Earth left the area of some galactic energy stream, and they turned into whatever people are today (also, aliens visiting earth are actually those god-like pre-humans). The only source of the ancient knowledge is Veda, which is highly protected though. Actually, I've also heard this from my biathlon instructor, who was trying to convince me that antimatter is matter which gods are made of, and therefore it's by definition is impossible for humans to comprehend, because it's literally named "antimatter" which means it's nothing like our regular matter  - Slavic pagan gods exist and are actively influencing our lives, proof to that being multiple "geoglyphs" (giant captions written on Earth/Sun/Mars) found everywhere. The guy who searches for these geoglyphs (his name is professor Chudinov) is pretty weird one too. My favorite story about him is when he was handed a bad photocopy of a contour map of Western Pomerania (with a lot of artifacts from the scanner) and found a bunch of geoglyphs including his favorite "mim" (pronounced like "meme", means "face" in old Slavic), and "this is Yar's land (Yar is a Slavic god)  - Christian god exists too somehow – he once showed us a video with some bright circles of light passing through a building (which supposedly were angels retrieving the soul of a deceased woman) – I bet it was video edited by some 2ch.hk (Russian 4chan) troll who wanted to see how many people world believe it. Another one was some video with some chaotic screamy noises with a lot of interference, which were claimed to be hell noises "with souls screaming in pain" recorded with a microphone put into the Kola superdeep borehole.  Another person to believe in weird conspiracy theories (less crazy ones though) is my mom, sadly. Aside from thinking that COVID/flu vaccines are ineffective hoaxes performed by big pharma because supposedly vaccines last for decades, and not 6 months, she also believes some shit called "new Germanic medicine", which is essentially the claim that every illness comes from your psychological problems (sich as repressed emotions), and therefore should be treated psychologically too. While she does take medications when she gets sick (we'll get back to it later btw), this is still a point of concern for me. Also, when I looked it up, the creator of this conspiracy was claiming that "Jews are trying to destroy everyone else with their academic medicine", and also this is why Steve Jobs refused cancer treatment and died.  Speaking of my mom's medications, she often buys homeopathic drugs (that are sold in the pharmacies, such as anapheron or some syrup, don't remember the name). When I was trying to explain to her that those concentrations meant that there would be a few atoms of these things spread all over the Galaxy, she would say things like "I don't understand those numbers", and "these pills have antibodies in them, just one antibody is enough to launch an immune response" (maybe, but certainly not by ingesting those orally lol), and in the end she would just say that even if it's placebo, placebo still works, "some people can heal themselves by drinking their urine, for example".   The weirdest part is that she used to be a doctor (but she left her job at the local clinic back in 2012 because of the low wages and bad treatment from the boss)	1643926621.0	hvhbgbq	t3_sjlvym	t3_sjlvym	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjlvym/what_is_the_craziest_conspiracy_theory_you_heard/hvhbgbq/

ibck7	> No it’s brainwashing people there   And where is the proof?   > for being Uyghur alone   There are about 13 million Uyghurs in China. Do they kidnap them all?  > also China is Literally State Capitalist  Capitalism with Chinese characteristics. Private sector contributes to 60% of China’s GDP, 80% of employment - doesn't look like "state" to me. But whatever you want to label it, doesn't matter. By your logic syndicalist Spain was also capitalist as even the Gaston Leval noted: "Workers in each undertaking took over the factory, the works, or the workshop, the machines, raw materials, and *taking advantage of the continuation of the money system and normal capitalist commercial relations*, organised production on their own account, selling for their own benefit the produce of their labour". And many didn't took over anything and simply worked under the direction of their own union bureaucrats with the old bosses as advisors.   >  if anyone here is a Liberal it’s you.  You parrot like every point of Western liberal narrative.  > Taiwan is an independent country  And now your ignorance is through the roof. You (US) call Taiwan as Taiwan, because you don't want to piss off China. Taiwan is a geographical term, name for an island. Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China and does not consider itself "an independent country" from mainland China as per their official policy of "one China" there is only one sovereign state under the name China and Taiwan is part of China. That is as opposed to your idea that there are two states, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC). So by calling them Taiwan you certainly do not respect their independence.  > your the one   Sorry, my the only one what?  > defending ethnic cleaning  There is no cleansing to defend. Uyghur population rose by 1.5 million in the last 10 years. I with our population was "ethnically cleansed" as such.  > yellow bird it was an entirely peaceful operation  Sure it was, and Yugoslavia bombing was a humanitarian mission. Also Iraq had WMDs.  > how about the fact that the PLA was sent in the first place?  Gee, riot police (mostly unarmed) is being sent to protest.

iy9twsvq	The party at the time was communist until the later years and the end goal was communism. The end goal  would be achieved through the process of socialism (look at China for an example in this). The USSR was socialist, which is why there was years and years of implementing state capitalism throughout the entire region. Major sectors were nationalized and put the profits back into the country and population, which is what pissed the west off as well as why Oligarchs in the 90s became wealthy so fast	1643927888.0	hvhepr0	t3_sjt7i4	t1_hvhdlqx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjt7i4/why_soviet_union_fell_apart_and_why_russia_did/hvhepr0/

4rsb8161	There is a project for next high-speed line to connect Moscow - Nizhny Novgorod - Kazan  - (possibly) Yekaterinburg. It was in engineering phase and got postponed. Estimated construction to Kazan was expected to take 5 years, but given the tendency to under-deliver on all major projects, you could have expected it not sooner than 2030.    There is another idea to connect Moscow - Voronezh - Rostov - Sochi, but nothing concrete was ever announced.  So i guess you're stuck with old railroad speeds and retro experience. Train from Moscow to Yekaterinburg takes about 1.5 days; from Moscow to Vladivostok - 7 days.	1643928013.0	hvhf154	t3_sjw403	t3_sjw403	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjw403/russias_infrastructure/hvhf154/

7w15rz55	That's like saying "Man is not meant to fly" (a common saying in late 19th century :)   Although, I agree "communism"--whatever that is--may never be possible, but Socialism is a "broad church/big tent" idea and there are many, many strands from history and who knows, many more in the future. 30 years ago people would have laughed at the notion that totally free software (free from cost, free to modify as you please, i.e. "free as in beer, free as in free speech") would be running the entire Internet and most mobile phones, but that's the world we're living in. Many other things were also difficult to even imagine but for younger generations they're second nature now.

2mvlv34f	Oh, that's an easy one for sure. NOD (Natsional'no-Osvoboditel'noje Dvizhenije, National Liberation Movement) has a theory that everything's and everyone's controlled by the evil empire of the United States (including the United Russia party, which the founder of the movement is a proud part of (what???), and the only man who can save Russia (which is currently a colony of the United States????????) is Putin, who's been appointed as the President-Tsar by Yeltsin, one of United State's occupants.   Also I guess a close call is the Soviet Citizens movement, which is like a russo-fied Sovereign citizen movement. Basically, the Soviet Union never broke up, we're just 'dead' people-clients of the British 'Russia' LLC. Russian official papers (what we call usually 'Coat of Arms' papers here) are dead marks because they contain symbols of a non-existent country. They have their own little schizoworld with Highest Soviet of the USSR, with it's own little citizenship approval process. Oh, and they actively undermine local law enforcement - even when it's their local policeman just trying to make a living and not go insane along with them.	1643928389.0	hvhg00e	t3_sjlvym	t3_sjlvym	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjlvym/what_is_the_craziest_conspiracy_theory_you_heard/hvhg00e/

9s0czx4	If you meet someone in a formal setting you start by using "вы". Then, judging by the situation, one of you may offer to use "ты". It's considered polite that the "higher standing" offers first. I.e. older person to younger one, boss to subordinate, etc. And sometimes, due to "chivalry" notions - women to men.   But it's arbitrary. You judge by tone and circumstances (like, if you start from "вы" and the person seems really standoffish or you're discussing some serious/tense business matters - it would be kinda rude to suddenly go by "ты" and doing so may be even perceived as disrespectful or aggressive. My rude boss liked to start using "ты" towards "lowly" service people, like cleaners or couriers, to show her displeasure. Which also clearly showed to all nearby her Karen nature and awful manners haha).  You can also take cues from the way you're introduced. For example, if I was introduced to someone by their short name (hi, this is Миша, Колян, Иришка, Аня...) it kinda implies informal setting and going by "ты" seems ok. If I'm introduced to someone by their full name, ESPECIALLY including their patronimic name (hi, this is Михаил Васильевич, Ирина Викторовна) I'd go by "вы" even if we're meeting in a dance club or something. At least at first. They can offer to be less formal if it's ok for them.  All this of course subjective, just how I see it	1643928629.0	hvhglx3	t3_sjsvmv	t1_hvhcosd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjsvmv/have_people_been_drifting_away_from_the_use_of_ты/hvhglx3/

There was also an ambitious project of a high-speed rail from Moscow to China, with the Moscow-Kazan part being the first link. But after a few years of development, the Moscow-Kazan project was abandoned for financial reasons and because someone decided that a highway is more important. There were also plans to build the Yekaterinburg-Chelyabinsk part of this project in the nearest future, but I haven't heard of this project in the recent years, since the Chelyabinsk governor was changed.  So, basically the high-speed infrastructure in Russia sucks.

I start with "вы" and then see how it goes (one of us might suggest using "ты" or we both just naturally end up using "ты" if we click). "вы" is useful if the other person is being rude or standoffish or you just don't like them so you can use it as a shield in a way or to draw a line (signaling you're not gonna be work buddies).

3qou1io	Because BLM claims all police is bad and should be completely gotten rid of. Which is idiotic top to bottom. They also defend lots of "innocent" black felons who have been clearly seen swinging their weapons in front of the cops or civilians before they get beaten up/arrested/shot dead. Hell, even fucking George Floyd was a junkie and wad high on multiple substances at the time of his arrest and he was panicking and freaking out before he even had cops knees laid on him. He was also shouting "I can't breathe" tens of minutes before being "choked to death" while sitting in the cop car without anyone touching him. And later the medical examiners stated he died of overdose and not asphyxiation. Sooo that's a lot of bullshit too. And that's basically what flew BLM to the moon in terms of popularity and people's "outrage". Just think about it. People went crazy over a know felon dying of overdose. The they went robbing their own towns to protest. Protest what? The suicide of a felon? So yeah. That's why most normal people would be sceptical of BLM no matter the country. Cause it's lots of bullshit. That's what it is.	1643930739.0	hvhludq	t3_sjiibm	t1_hvfr903	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjiibm/the_is_racism_in_russia_against_the_latin_people/hvhludq/

ahngc35j	I think originally "кайф" was a drug-related slang term.   For example, "to get high/to get stoned/to get a trip" (ловить кайф, быть под кайфом, поймать кайф).   Then it creeped into everyday speech and now it means joy, bliss, euphoria.   For example, Я кайфую от жизни - I love/enjoy life.   Новый фильм про Спидермена кайфовый - the new Spiderman movie is a thrill.   Давай потанцуем-покайфуем - Let's dance, let's have some fun.

I.e. when the West does it - it for the greater good, "promotion of freedom and democracy" and it's totally not an illegal and aggressive actions. At the same time the use of force by other parties is regarded as unwarranted and unlawful and is punished by sanctions (such punishment being possible because of the roles of dollar and euro and general control over global economy).  *Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi* as Romans would say. NATO's encroachment towards Russian border is seen as continuous effort to cement this status-quo.

ls9hx	Not sure about your particular teacher, but generally I think there might be a few reasons for why smart people sometimes believe some random conspiracy shit – im not sure if this is true, but here are my assumptions:  - First of all, a smart person who knows they're smart is prone to a bias when they might feel like they're qualified to appreciate about things they have no clue about. Like, take my teacher: he would talk about (pseudo)history of languages without knowing shit about linguistics. He just found something on the internet that seemed reasonable to him, and believed it without ever considering doing some legitimate research on the topic  - Second, a smart person is more likely to question something that is considered a common knowledge – which is exactly what conspiracy theories are all about. Oh, the Earth is round? Have you seen the curvature yourself? Are you able to prove it's not flat? So you basically agree with it just because everyone does? C'mon, don't be a sheep, take everything critically (well, everything but our crazy theory that can be debunked by anyone with more than six braincells, but pfft – that's details)  - Third, speaking of computer science teachers. My teacher literally looked like a skinny Morpheus. He used to wear foggy glasses, grey textured suit jacket over a Steve Jobs style black turtleneck. He sounded like a mix of Veritasium and some nerdy genius. Those older CompSci folks seem to love mistery – probably because the field itself used to be associated with mysterious hackers and Matrix characters back in the 90s and early 2000s. My guess is that this might also be one of the factors that caused him to believe all that stuff. But not everyone is like that: our other computer science teacher was a completely normal person. The nicest teacher we've had actually, she was really patient and treated students with attention and respect. In fact, she was so respectful and nice that kids were usually too hesitant to misbehave in front of her – but that's a whole different story.  Again, these are just assumptions, and I could be just as wrong as all these conspiracy theorists lol	1643932839.0	hvhqwtd	t3_sjlvym	t1_hvhhg4h	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjlvym/what_is_the_craziest_conspiracy_theory_you_heard/hvhqwtd/

I think getting to a state where at least 3/4 of population consider each other partners rather then enemies is quite achievable though.

They are basically selling a cafe for 3,5 months worth of net income. I would ask for more financials. There might be something wrong with the store.  A town of 40k is too risky as well, because there are not much growth projected, unless they open another location in a different city. If it’s a suburb of Moscow or any other city, that’s understandable.  I don’t know your situation, maybe your visa depends on the business or something else.

3lpgl6q9	Sort of. There is Medicaid for very poor people and people who are disabled (totally unable to work because of illness or injury), and there is another insurance program, Medicare, for people over the age of 65.   The Affordable Care Act expanded access to medical insurance and the government will subsidize the cost of buying insurance, but it is still private insurance that each person or family must buy, although most people have health insurance through their employers (and the Act I just mentioned requires all businesses with more than 50 employees to offer insurance benefits, even for minimum wage workers).  However, the actual insurance available was left up to the states. More conservative states, like mine, chose not to make the public Medicaid insurance available to people who are low income but not disabled. The bigger problem is that some people make too much money to get Medicaid (in states that do have it), but not enough to be able to afford private insurance even with the government subsidies.  In these cases, the doctor or hospital is still required to treat you as best as possible— they can’t deny care or provide inferior care because you don’t have insurance. But then they will send you a bill afterwards.  Most hospitals have forms to fill out if you make little money. They will lower the cost as much as they can, and this is possible because of donations from individuals and universities and businesses that can pay less taxes if they make the donations. And if your bill is, for example, $5000, you can arrange with the hospital to pay $5 a month until it is paid off. You will never pay it off, but usually the hospital will “write off” the debt after a few years (and the government will let them pay less taxes for doing so). As long as you pay them something, it won’t impact your credit.  But sometimes it is still a better financial decision to declare bankruptcy. In this case, most of your debts (including medical) are forgiven but all of your assets (house, car, bank account, anything you own completely) is taken and divided to pay your creditors, and it will be impossible to get a loan from a bank for several years.	1643946389.0	hvilmfm	t3_sjeg7r	t1_hvgf5rg	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjeg7r/what_is_it_like_to_live_on_minimum_wage_in_russia/hvilmfm/

(NOT my taste or anything like that) I thought the suits they made were well put together, creative and I thought of it only as a costume, like someone dressed  up as their favorite character.   But then....  People got weird with it. Like really weird. To the point where it crossed over to animal abuse. Like the creeps who believe they can be in a..."relationship" with their animal and that the animals actually want it. Their whole mentality is fucked, at least the ones who take it too far. Ruined something that was fairly innocent for those who just liked to dress up.

The fact that Georgia wasn't allowed to annex the Republics in 2008 differs drastically from what he claimed: if Russia wanted to annex Georgia which suffered a military defeat, there would not be a power in the world to stop it from doing so -- yet here Georgian Prime Minister is, telling another tale about Big Bad Russia.   > Russia isn't being forced  That was incorrect in 2008. And everyone knows stuff like that isn't allowed around it. Doing something disallowed == forcing the hand of local authorities. It always has been this way.   > Russia already invaded Eastern Ukraine  as the same propaganda outlets try to make you believe. Yet, when Russia has began its operations in Syria, satelite photos of its base of operations were in the media even before the official presentation by Russian authorities -- but [Russian troops camouflage their presence in Ukraine really well](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/04/241036.htm) -- all too well to be discovered. Obviously, a large scale military operation leaves no tracks on the Russian territory as well. Seems like at times Russians wield some sorcery to make stuff invisible -- but at other times they somewhy don't wield it.   > Russia moves 100K troops to the border   We've been through this already. Did you look Yelnya up yourself, like we discussed a bit earlier?   >  everything western media says  I've linked a video of a fine example of "western media" example being dissected in a previous comment. Watch it carefully and tell me if you want to believe these guys.   > Ukrainian politician who said this  ...and that's **the** dirtiest thing that Ukrainian propaganda machine was capable of digging up on him over all these years.

Begging, pickpocketing, fortune-telling fraud. Sometimes drug trafficking, as a minimum, was common in the south of Russia back in the early 2010s. Well, that is, they have the ingenuity to find money, but they absolutely do not want to direct it in a creative direction. For example, about six months ago I was on the subway - a young guy came into the car. A gypsy, with such a powerful physique that it was literally possible to plow on him.

ajf56	This is utter nonsense. You are literally just typing baseless assumptions as if they're facts.  The reason they adhere to what you call "shady lifestyle" is twofold: one reason is that their culture views non-gypsies as resources rather than fellow humans, and considers scamming / cheating of said "resources" to be an honorable lifestyle. The other reason is that it's a fundamental tenant of their culture that working for another person is the ultimate shame, akin to being a slave. They used to have access to limited self-employment avenues such as tin smithing, but in the modern world, it's impossible to live in such a way. You can occasionally meet gypsies who run their own businesses and thus are able to behave as more-or-less normal members of society - but in order to become a business owner in the first place, the only "honorable" path is through crime.  >One might think that it's better not to perpetuate the issue..  Or one might have a brain inside their skull and realize thousands of them went as "refugees" to Canada, where nobody even knows what a Gypsy is, and immediately resorted to scams, petty theft and even created a human trafficking network. There are also many other groups of people in the world who have to live with an overwhelmingly negative reputation, but none of them are famous for abducting children, except gypsies.  Your Noble Savage rhetoric is itself a prejudice, so you have no ground to stand on preaching about prejudice to someone else.	1643954911.0	hvj1xnk	t3_sk4t7c	t1_hviyxmm	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk4t7c/is_it_just_mutually_accepted_by_all_russians_that/hvj1xnk/

3y1jod1k	Well, my condolences, try reliable resources. Russian state media, for example.  Western mass media is known to perverse facts, use lies, and publish semitruth, all in order to brighten the darkness following the so called western civilization.  It is the western civilization, which is known for multiple genocides, bloodbaths, history falsifications, constant interference with other internal affairs, terroristic acts against humanity, etc.  But coming back to the conversation, there's no evidence for any of those claims. If you repeat a false statement many times in many different sources, it will still be a false statement, yet, a well known one.  So, far, none of those sources has presented any proof, neither for this bullshit with poisoning, nor with anything else.  Let me tell you one thing, when in the rarest occasion Russia wants someone dead, they always die. There never was a failure with that.  And besides all that you just have no idea, what people actually think about Vladimir Putin in Russia. For me he's both a savior and a blessing bestowed upon us after the darkest ages, when our home was ruined by the so called western civilization.  And it is understandable, why many feel threatened by your world, why we really think you are an enemy.  Especially the terrorist state of USA.	1643955071.0	hvj2733	t3_siexe3	t1_hvh1ogj	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hvj2733/

The only way I ever heard of people repeating a year is when they are expelled, but then pass entrance exams to a different institute on the following year and do everything from the first year again. This can't be a viable scenario for you, as afaik, once you are expelled, your visa can't be extended another year, and you can't stay for entrance exams again.

But on my return home, when I wanted to confirm that I was on the correct train with someone, a woman on the train ignored me and walked away.  So what the protagonist in the movie clip experienced is pretty familiar. I'm not assuming this happens with all people. Actually in Moscow, the majority of people I interacted with were patient, kind, and very helpful.

Now imagine that these billionaires have new competitors who are not familiar to them, do not have a joint business, and so on. At the same time, new competitors create problems, since there are few resources on the planet, and the sales market has long been divided. This was the case until 1917, when the Russian Empire strengthened. To weaken Russia, it was dragged into the First World War, and then contributed to the revolution. So it was under the USSR and so it is now. Every time we start to grow, we are thrown back decades. I do not know why we are not compatible. Maybe time should pass (I hope so). Maybe the problem is religion (but there are many religions in Russia), maybe we haven't created the right number of connections, or maybe it's banal greed and thirst for power, as in the Billions series. Don't know. At our level of an ordinary person, this is difficult to understand.	1643957093.0	hvj5fe8	t3_sjxmbw	t3_sjxmbw	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjxmbw/what_would_need_to_happen_to_restore_positive/hvj5fe8/

ouzfr	I'm living in Ekb, not Moscow, but for the *whole my life* a random person on the street wanting to "ask a question" **never** needed directions (or directions only). It's always some sort of begging, scam, or, when I was younger, gopnik's attempt at extortion. Only *once* a poor-dressed guy actually asked for an address, but when I helped him with it, proceeded to ask for "a bit of cash".

j4an6z3l	There are no Latin Americans in Russia, especially in the provinces. In large cities, they are mostly students, I have not seen or heard anyone speak ill of them. But you understand that racism can be different. However, racism is based on the principle of relations, one nation considers itself a more civilized, higher nation than another, and another racism is when one nation increases its population in the traditional place of residence of another and begins to aggressively change the culture and life of this place. The nation that traditionally chews in this place begins to show racism.	1643957637.0	hvj69ql	t3_sjiibm	t3_sjiibm	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjiibm/the_is_racism_in_russia_against_the_latin_people/hvj69ql/

9pbfx36r	This is a great movie, it does not picture all the Russians as cold-hearted racists but rather depicts life quite realistically: there are many good people but there is also much casual racism and ignorance - not just from Russians toward the migrants, but even from the fellow migrants. It is so realistic that soon after its release the plot story came true. In 2020, a desperate Uzbek woman left her baby in an underground passage. The story was practically the same: she had to do lousy jobs, got pregnant from some kind of criminal guy, was cursed by her relatives and received absolutely no help from anybody, gave birth prematurely, returned to the maternity hospital for help when the child got sick but was kicked away, tried to leave the child to the nearby orphanage but no one opened the door. Without support or advice from anybody she had no option in mind than to leave the baby somewhere when people would eventually find it.	1643959987.0	hvj9o0c	t3_sk6k2u	t1_hvj60dl	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk6k2u/why_do_people_in_moscow_ignore_you_if_you_ask_for/hvj9o0c/

May be you want come to Russia and you will live here couple month. You will see that russian people - are another than you thought about us. I am shure that you would like our country. You can google what Mokhammed Ali says after his visit to the Moskow. You asking about racism. Tell what racism could be in the country - where is the greatest author of all our culture - Pushkin A.S. - the man with non white skin. Skin colour - it does matter to west culture.  Do you know that on west europe on expo 58 (1958 year) was human circus with afroamericans ( https://mobile.twitter.com/arafrika/status/424052996117262336 ). Google it. On all territory of the US - only on the Alaska - exists real native americans with their culture. On other territory of the US - the was murdered.  Maybe they exist on alaska because there they was in Russia (Alaska was a part of Russia).  Russian people don't destroy other culture. Russia dosnt want war. Russia want to live in peace. Does pentagon, lokheed martin,... want the same? Or they want more budget money through the war? Its just lots of questions.

4j3oy9de	A fellow Pole here. I know for a fact that my Russian is pretty decent and I don't have too many difficulties with the accent, either. But goddamn, it takes a while until I can "re-adjust" my tongue to match Russian pronunciation and accents. In fact, initially, for me, it's much more difficult than English or German or any other language for that matter. My hypothesis is that, due to both Polish and Russian being Slavic languages, your brain kind of forces you to make the same (sry, I'm kind of ignorant when it comes to linguistics, I don't know how to call this phenomenon) "connections" with particular letters/diphtongs etc.   When I look at this thread I think Russians agree that the Polish accent is funny. The same thing applies to the Russian accent in Polish - I've spoken to Germans, who spoke better Polish than Russians, simply because they didn't have any pre-existing, particular "Slavic-conditioning" before. Although overall, they may make more grammatical mistakes than Russians, as our grammar is wildly different from one another - Russian is much more similar in this regard, in terms of accent, they sometimes have learn everything from scratch and aren't "corrupted" by their respective Slavic mother tongue.   (maybe Germans speaking Polish is not the best example, as they have some similar pronunciation to us, but you get my point)	1643962422.0	hvjd148	t3_sk597b	t3_sk597b	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk597b/what_does_a_polish_accent_in_russian_sound_like/hvjd148/

Putin never lived and did not strive for wealth, and his daughters do not live in palaces. Conditions for life gives him and will give, even after leaving power, the state as a person who has access to the highest state secrets.	1643963457.0	hvjeeie	t3_siexe3	t1_hvepcrp	/r/AskARussian/comments/siexe3/does_the_average_russian_believe_their_country_is/hvjeeie/

68kbi9n8	So i am African and have been living in Moscow for 14yrs... at first i lived in Izhevsk to study, few racists and thugs there who often think they can extort foreign students, cus they even attacked our Hungarian friends too.. so i wouldnt even call the motive "Racism"  Then i lived in St.Petersburg for like 2yrs, pretty normal place to live, i faced few racists though...i think im just not lucky in the city, my other friends who lived there said they havent faced such thing before, i almost beat one mofo inside the vogzal in St.Petersburg but my friend said i should leave him to hit me first.  NOW Moscow!!!! Aaaaaaah! My paradise! Paradise on earth but with great expenses.. Moscow is awesome, i worked as a professional model here for like 4yrs, at first whenever i go to castings, i don't get selected.. i was in more than 20 castings and never get booked, i was starting to think it was racism but then i started getting booked, it got to a point i don't spend 1 minute at castings, they just needed me to show up so they can nod their head am i am booked, people in Moscow are also very helpful, they mind their business alot but if you ask for help, they will go out of their way to help you, there are tons of Latinos in Moscow, i don't think they will face anything different	1643964457.0	hvjfpft	t3_sjiibm	t1_hvez2dv	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjiibm/the_is_racism_in_russia_against_the_latin_people/hvjfpft/

It always devolves into "The west is not ____, stop reading so much PROPAGANDA, Russia is always hated on", etc.   I got permabanned from /r/russia for saying Crimea was invaded and occupied. I suppose the accepted narrative in /r/russia is so fragile that every differing point of view is banned and removed. And in the next post you see comment how the West does not have free speech or how differing opinions are not allowed.   I understand the notion that there indeed exist western folks who blindly hate on Russia and really think Russia is just USSR v2. Western cowboys that just keep on parroting the shit CNN broadcasts. But don't you people really see any irony here? Or maybe you do, but you get banned..?  It is just sad.

fbjkyium	Before 1917 Russia was part of “club of European powers”, tale that “we were always at war with the West” is not true for those who are good at history. Prussia/Germany for example spent more years at war with France than with Russia. Our beloved Polish cousins were just as active with fighting Sweden. Sweden was in nearly constant “Cold War” (its really cold in Scandinavia) which was becoming hot war each 30 years in 13-19 century. And so on. But in 1910s growth of Russian Empire was such rapid that Britain really feared Russia will take its place as world hegemon. Tsarist industrialization with fastest temps was taking place, new generation of peasants was receiving basic education, agrarian reform guaranteed extreme growth in agriculture (in 1917 about 90% of private land belonged to peasants). Projecting these trends western politicians understood that to mid 1930s Russia will be industrialized and to 1940s it will reach western gdp per capita. Mendeleev stated that to 2000 there will be 600M people in Russia, but it was linear progression, without taking into account “demographic dividend” - generations with low death rate, but still high fertility. So realistic figure is 900M. More than EU and USA today, with same labor productivity. So the world should been have speaking Russian, with news like “NY Stock exchange had offered its shares in SPB Stock exchange”, not vice versa. Germany was a problem for Britain too, but it had no potential without expanding sphere of influence. So Brits decided to make Russians and Germans to kill each other, then help establishing in both countries radicalism regimes detrimental to national potential, then repeated first war with more casualties. We are too big nation, in fact the biggest white nation, so “club of western powers” is not interested in efficient economy and good living conditions in Russia	1643966991.0	hvjiv6k	t3_sjxmbw	t3_sjxmbw	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjxmbw/what_would_need_to_happen_to_restore_positive/hvjiv6k/

One day two girl of 7 and 9 years old went missing, people turned every stone to find them and of course went into gypsy camp to ask and beg if people saw anything, but got nothing out of it. Two weeks after being missing they were found newr the read in a ditch a few kilometers from the gypsy camp, but reeked of it so there were no doubt in peoples minds. After a few days apparently heartbroken, people took their guns and killed every living thing in that gypsy camp, even dogs were not spared.

8nlxl	Dollar is the world currency, because it has stable and good value. Dollar has a stable and good value, because it is backed by the world's biggest economy.   If you are referring to the concept of petrodollar, removing the whole US oil industry would lead to only about 10-20% drop in dollar's value, this would not dethrone it as the major currency for trade.   Still, how removing dollar as the world currency would help Russia better their relations with the west? You would probably have to get dependent on yuan for foreign trade. Is this a better option? Rouble does not hold well in foreign trade, as it is backed by Russian economy that is the size of Italian economy.	1643967295.0	hvjj8lm	t3_sjxmbw	t1_hvhnmtr	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjxmbw/what_would_need_to_happen_to_restore_positive/hvjj8lm/

6mrufqnd	As was said above вы is always the best way to address a person unless the person suggested ты. However there are two curious exceptions: - In social media many bloggers and stores (especially the ones with younger target audience) use ты to imply something like ‘we all are close friends here’ . That’s actually might be the case with an elderly Russian lady you mentioned.  - Healthcare workers! Always refer to a doctor, even to a very young intern with вы and full name + patronymic, even if you are on good terms with them. I didn’t realize it myself before I started working with healthcare organizations and a member of my family became a medical worker. Now I know a lot of doctors who address to they fellow doctors super-druper very close best friends with full name, patronymic and вы.

2ziw3k4x	No. We have been through it, and communism doesn't work. Moreover, american 'communists' mistake communism and social democracy. Basically what they want is free (or at least fair) education and healthcare, but the problem is that you can't just make it out of nowhere. Countries that have it have absolutely different political philosophy, and a system made for it. From what I've read on reddit - their basic idea is to destroy what you have and build social country from scratch. What they don't worry about is that this way leads to a massive drop in wealth level for ordinary people, and that includes human casualties as well. To achieve this fundamental changes you need to change the political system the way it can step by step lead to what people want, this will take decades. And a stable system that won't be affected by a leader. I mean us presidents for example can destroy everything previous one did, just because his political party is sponsored by someone who doesn't want this happen.	1643970086.0	hvjmq96	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvjmq96/

I've tried living in Turkey for 3 years, and I still couldn't fit in too easily, people are a bit too curious overall.   I really love how Russians basically don't give too many f*cks out of context, they're not the meddling type or the type that would strike up a weird uncalled-for conversation with a stranger, and I love that.   Weather wise: I'd definitely choose Northern Russia, Northern Finland or Anything above or on the Arctic circle.   Culture wise: Russia, The Netherlands or Baltic states.   Economy wise: I don't care about money too much, anywhere where you can have a decent living.   Overall: Russia, because I love the people, language and culture. It feels almost as natural as if I'm still living among my family members.  Russians are welcoming enough to make you feel safe and secure, and cold enough to make you depend on yourself and have a taste of realism.	1643974249.0	hvjs6hw	t3_sjsaac	t3_sjsaac	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjsaac/in_which_country_would_you_most_like_to_live_and/hvjs6hw/

l6v2byz	I doubt communism or anyhow socialism in the west has at least something in common with that of Russia. The latter left this woke, idealistic stage and academic environments even before the revolution, and eventually became rather pragmatic and conservative. The whole narrative is different. What any living former Soviet citizen experienced was past that stage by half a century, and has never been exposed to such narrative. For generations in the system that was already remade, with class interactions that were already reset to something else, and a whole world of questionable aftermath to it.  So whatever Western "communists" say, they are just living in the reality Russia never had (well, hopefully, they live in some reality at least), and vice versa, so... let's put it mildly and say we're mutually irrelevant.	1643974489.0	hvjsiqe	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvjsiqe/

6mrufqnd	Hi!:)  1) I’d recommend you to watch some english speaking youtubers who travel all over the Russia, like Eli from Russia, RussianPlus etc. Location depends heavily on the atmosphere you want. Would it be beautiful Imperial melancholy in Saint Petersburg, or pastel bourgeois houses with pretty tint of tartar culture in Kazan, or nearly deserted creepy streets of Vorkuta? Moscow could easily give any vibe from pretty shiny sunny clean city to suffocating overcrowded place full of people racing for money. You also can go to unsplash type  Russia, and than chose place that caught your attantion. When you choose, you can also type name of the place in booking or airbnb to see streets and interior references. 2. Depends on time period, school and place. Mine in Moscow Region, was mostly Chinese style studying, studying and then studying some more. But I remember building make shift houses (shalash), playing some kind of  jungle discoverers with my friends in city park, and trying to impress each other in city sport spot (спортплощадка). 3.  First of all children in Russia are usually called by their short and/or diminutive names (well, unless they aren’t scolded). Maybe Shura (Aleksandr m., or Aleksandra f.), Sonya (Sofia, f, also short form means “sleepy”), Misha/ Mishka / Mishutka (Michail, m., also the short form means Teddy Bear), Tasha / Tata (more rear but existing form of Natalia, f.), Asya (Anastasia, f.), Dima / Mitya (Dmitry, m.), Arisha (Arina, f.), Marisha (Marina, f). Ilya (m) and Nina (f), would be fine both as full names and for addressing to children. 4. New Year is a very, very big thing Russia, just like Christmas in USA and Western Europe. The only holiday which is more important for a child would be their Birthday. 5. It’s mostly apartments. Commonly children are living with their parents until they find decent job or get married. Sometimes they leave earlier, sometimes especially if they can’t afford renting children might live with they parents and spouses/children. 6. Tortik (cake, m.), Persik (peach, m.), Bulochka (bun, f.), Druzhok (little friend, m., super common dog name), Barsik (little snow leopard, m., super common cat name), many pets are usually called western names, because it sounds cool, like Jessie, Rick, Michal, Tom etc.  Good luck with your project!:)	1643974832.0	hvjt0b1	t3_si24gd	t3_si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/hvjt0b1/

The countries which decided that they will better ally with Satan than to be associated with Russia? That is what you are calling "Your"  sphere?   \>deployed absolutely hostile NGOs,   Another propaganda victim. The destruction of NGO is a big tragady. We are watching big raise in AIDS epidemics, Drugs abuse, domestic violence and all that because NGOs which helped in it were banned. In Russia so-called "foreign agents" are claimed so absolutely randomly. The state supported NGO take grants from foreign countries - and they are fine, but if an NGO talks anything against the state politics (e.g trying to support sexual education, replacement therapy or domestic violence law) - it will be immediately banned for any random financial transaction which MOJ will claim "foreign financing", even if it isn't.  \>they destroyed our economy,   How did they do that?  WHO were those saboteurs which made our civil products incapable, and lost the competition to foreign competitors?   \> they subdued our country and governed it from usa embassy,   I'll skip this one because it looks like your are just repeating the TV with no real knowledge at all,  \> they promoted defeatism in our war in Chechnya and subsequent    dissolution of Russia  Could you be more wrong? Yeltsin saved Russia from dissolution, When Putin took the office in 2000 all the needed reforms to keep it intact were already done, he himself made nothing about it.  If you think that Russia "fought back" Chechnya you are wrong. Putin just put the former chief of separatists as a head of Chechnya, and so he effectively founded the first sultan dynasty inside the borders of Russian Federation. Which decision led to today's situation when Kadyrov demonstratively ignores any laws of Russia and voluntary shows Putin that nobody can speak against him.	1643975249.0	hvjtmb1	t3_sjxmbw	t1_hvjegef	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjxmbw/what_would_need_to_happen_to_restore_positive/hvjtmb1/
1nr4zcn4	Leftism and more precisely communism is inherent to the working class and oppressed people. What these modern "communists" and "leftists" do is the the same thing social-democrats were doing in the first half of 20th century - they turn genuine progressive thinking people away from the class struggle and towards made up or unnecessary "issues" like LGBT, hysteria about Russia and such. Or they take real issues like racism and try as hard as they can to downplay it and reduce unrest like it was with BLM.  I'd like to add that the "rightists" often openly oppose the real wrongdoings of capitalism like for example organizing anti-covid (anti-mandate, anti-restrictions etc) protests. They are in their core antifascist pro-democracy protests. And while "leftists" ask governments for more and more restrictions and therefore fascism, "rightists" took under their wing those toilers that didn't want to sit and watch as the last decorations of democracy are being destroyed.	1643975337.0	hvjtqzn	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvjtqzn/

Level-headed commentators do not usually talk about communism in the US, unless in polemical fervour, but often note the sharp rise of the left wing in the Democratic Party. And they call it ultra-left and leftist movement, left-wing radicalism, leftists, etc. This direction also includes many media, university professors, wokeism, aggressive LGBT ideology, BDLM, black racism, cancel culture, the Jewish left community.   Many believe that the US is losing its internal stability and is heading down the path of destabilization and party-to-party confrontation.   I don’t see an analogy in today’s Russia, but at the beginning of the 20th century we also had the growth of the ultra-left movement, which led to the state catastrophe of 1917.	1643976279.0	hvjv5ny	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvjv5ny/

Time is running out.   2) The United States always prepares public opinion before the start of a war. This takes about six months. The US launched an information campaign in November.   3) Hence the attempt to reverse the situation: the Russians are preparing for war. Ukraine receives informational support and gives the go-ahead for NATO entry into Ukraine.   4) Russia understands all this and increases the presence of troops on the border.   5) Since the information is so mad, Ukraine will launch an attack on the Donbass this year.	1643979226.0	hvk01x7	t3_skbahp	t3_skbahp	/r/AskARussian/comments/skbahp/when_ukraine_attacks_the_dpr_and_lpr/hvk01x7/

6y5qak31	You'd have to specify what you mean with communism. Overall, I think the ideology of communism is too broad to evaluate it unidirectional. I think we can all agree that Stalinism, for instance, was a totalitarian ideology which was created to serve the interests of Stalin and his party members. But ideologies such as Marxism or even socio-anarchist ideas of Kropotkin, Bachunin or Boockhin can be very valuable. Especially in a neoliberal world that is increasingly suffering from oligarchic tendencies.	1643979689.0	hvk0wcl	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvk0wcl/

Я бы поступил следующим путем. Я бы через соц сети попытался бы пообщаться с местными людьми из этого города и спросить посещали ли ли они это место. Что они о нём говорят. Можете прямо говорить зачем спрашиваете. Вообще люди там ходят ли или нет? И ещё вопрос, а продаёт русский или нет? Я ничего против не имею других наций, но на моем жизненном пути, обмана со стороны ребят из кавказских республик, было в разы больше, я поэтому с ними стараюсь не иметь дел.	1643979946.0	hvk1dco	t3_sjzqz7	t3_sjzqz7	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjzqz7/нужен_совет_насчёт_покупки_кафе_в_маленьком_городе/hvk1dco/

You are wrong not because you are thinking differently, you just haven't enough thirst for enlightenment, because all of the below are well known facts. Well, that's what I am here for,  1. It's very strange to here from  Natsbol that ban for sexed (which ROC is promoting by any way) is ok. ROC wants it because they want more teenage moms, dependent to their men, but why YOU promote it?  2. You must also know that AIDS in Russia is not a homosexual nor junkie disease. The most frequent way of transmission now is a heterosexual intercourse.  3. Hasavyurt has little to do with saving Russia's integrity, it is other ethnic republics which could blow up the federation (and Tatarstan is the first among them).	1643980164.0	hvk1rx2	t3_sjxmbw	t1_hvk0egr	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjxmbw/what_would_need_to_happen_to_restore_positive/hvk1rx2/

ikxidbgw	I read one book in Polish according to the method of Ilya Frank and started reading the second one. Sometimes I listen to some Polish articles.   In general, the Polish language is perceived by Russians as a language incredibly filled with hissing, whistling sounds and an abundance of sounds cz, c, dz, dzi (ч, тш, ц, дз, дж ). For us, it's tough. The abundance of prz and krz pleasantly surprises.   There are also sounds with pronunciation into the nose (ą), but this is little felt by us.   But at the slightest acquaintance, the Polish language begins to open up rapidly. A Russian person can learn to read Polish very quickly. Of course, it takes a lot of work to learn to speak.  Короче, вы очень шепелявые.   But that's how you should be, for you are Poles, and that's nice.	1643984814.0	hvkbkk1	t3_sk597b	t3_sk597b	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk597b/what_does_a_polish_accent_in_russian_sound_like/hvkbkk1/

837f1l0h	I like how sincere the intent of the question is. Never mind that Russia started to accumulate the troops at the border first, never mind Russia is trying to benefit from the situation the way it is now, without any war - it is implied that Is Ukraine which is aggressive.  I do not think attacking those Ukrainian regions is in Ukraine plans. In the end, the country they belong to, would need to pay a lot of money to reconstruct them. Ukraine does not need that at the moment. And Russia cannot really afford to pay either.  So those regions are just stuck. Eventually, as Ukraine keeps improving its economy, it would become so much more desirable for living than Russia, that those regions would likely just revolt against Russian domination and join Ukraine all by themselves.	1643985295.0	hvkconv	t3_skbahp	t3_skbahp	/r/AskARussian/comments/skbahp/when_ukraine_attacks_the_dpr_and_lpr/hvkconv/
462mwutd	I am curious about this as well.    In America there's a divide.  Most people who lean towards communist ideology have gone to college or are self educated (ie they already had an interest. They sometimes overlap in that they had an existing interest and then they went to higher education here).  A good number of higher education (colleges and universities) institutions have professors who espouse communist ideals. For many students it's the first time they are introduced to a deeper discussion on communism other than "it's the direct nemesis to capitalism."  People who work in blue collar jobs often don't go to school and I hate to say this and might get downvoted but often times those demographics are conservative due to their views on things like religion,  education,  immigration,  etc. They are often made to feel like they are competing with foreigners.   There's a lot more to it but it makes me very curious what Russians think.	1643985354.0	hvkctqv	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvkctqv/

What you wrote above this, I don’t even ask because it’s outright nonsense and speculation.  >Any serious attempt to challenge Ramzan Kadyrov’s position will lead to a third war only this time the Chechens have far more money and firepower provided by Russia itself.  Conventional small arms will not help the Chechens much in the event of a civil war, and Russia has made much more progress in armaments since those years. Moreover, this will definitely not happen under Putin, but under Navalny ...  >it doesn't see the gay concentration camps and child marriages in Chechnya.  This is of course nonsense, but let's assume that it is.

wfsm7	>  do you agree with it?  Nah, it's historic revisionism, or reflecting the realities of 1230-1280s that had long been irrelevant by the time of its writing at best.    We are also a firmly European nation, this whole "unique orthodox civilization" bullshit ideology had never held water.     But yes, it's a rather beautiful poem. Nothing wrong with it as a work of art.    > Do you think is still prevalent or somehow common today in Russia?  Well, those Eurasian ideas have their followers, but their numbers are hard to gauge. 1%? 5%? 10%? 50% due to recent TV propaganda? The problem with any kind of social-political view in Russia is that most people will pay lip service to what is trendy for conformity, even more so than in most other societies.   For example, around 75% of Russians claim to be Orthodox Christians. However, only about 1-3% of Russians actively participate in Orthodox religious rituals. Most of the rest have a very vague idea of Christianity of any denomination at best, and are just labeling themselves "not a national traitor" by claiming orthodoxy.	1643986372.0	hvkf9gs	t3_skdxdo	t1_hvkdvy3	/r/AskARussian/comments/skdxdo/what_do_you_guys_think_about_the_spiritmessage_of/hvkf9gs/

This is an excellent mode of transport for traveling around Russia. The railway network is very developed, all trains run exactly on schedule and are never late.

The fact that Georgia wasn't allowed to annex the Republics in 2008 differs drastically from what he claimed: if Russia wanted to annex Georgia which suffered a military defeat, there would not be a power in the world to stop it from doing so -- yet here Georgian Prime Minister is, telling another tale about Big Bad Russia.  Lol, more like Russia once again justifying invading another sovereign country to "protect ethnic Russians". Same bullshit they say every time.  >as the same propaganda outlets try to make you believe. Yet, when Russia has began its operations in Syria, satelite photos of its base of operations were in the media even before the official presentation by Russian authorities -- but Russian troops camouflage their presence in Ukraine really well -- all too well to be discovered. Obviously, a large scale military operation leaves no tracks on the Russian territory as well. Seems like at times Russians wield some sorcery to make stuff invisible -- but at other times they somewhy don't wield it.  Right, because they aren't wearing any gear that identifies them as being members of the Russian army. So it's conveniently impossible to tell who is in the Russian military, who is a mercenary and who is a Ukrainian.   >I've linked a video of a fine example of "western media" example being dissected in a previous comment.

fo1ob	I highly doubt comments about Polish hissing are helpful. Once a Polish person speaks in another language there's no reason for them to pronounce many sz sounds and its variations. So it's just stereotypes speaking here.  It's more helpful to point out that Polish language is syllable-based (all vowels are pronounced clearly and syllables have equal duration) whereas Russian is stress-based (the distances between stressed vowels in adjacent words are equal, only stressed vowels are clear, the rest are reduced, "muffled"). That would be a major distinction in pronunciation that's hard to spot for a learner. So Москва is not pronounced [maskva] but [məskva] - only the stressed vowel is clear, the first vowel is a schwa similar to the scwa in English, German, Portuguese.	1643988229.0	hvkjv0p	t3_sk597b	t3_sk597b	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk597b/what_does_a_polish_accent_in_russian_sound_like/hvkjv0p/

6mrufqnd	I visited UK several times as a tourist, and overall impression is very good. Believe it or not but London and Moscow share more resemblance then any other city I visited, when it comes to pace of life, people on the streets and how the act and the whole vibe of the city.   Here are the things that were hard to get used to:  - Minimum central heating or lack of it. In Russia heating is relatively chip, so in winter we are not satisfied with the temperature indoors unless it’s like 30C (86F) degrees or something. Same goes for long hot showers and baths. Contrary to popular beliefs most of Russians are heat-loving creations, so we are super serious when it comes to warm clothing and central heating. Unlike most of people I met in UK lol We were extra shocked in Scotland, because while we felt sort of chilled in our winter coats, people on the streets of Edinburgh were wearing thin raincoats, sweaters and blazers. - Traditional English faucets🥲 - Prices. Obviously prices in UK are higher than in Russia, especially than it comes to transport and food. - I missed some kinds of dairy products, for example, ability to choose between different kinds of kefir, order syrniki, or buy syrok in chocolate. But those desires were fully compensated by cheddar and red Leicester🧀  However, I must admit that there are a lot of things that are common in UK and Russia, but were sadly unavailable in most of Western Europe: - All kinds of tea. I forgot to pack my tea for European vacation twice, and it was depressing experience, like even in big stores there would be some Lipton, something with fruits and artificial flavors, perhaps some weird stuff with celery and camomile and that’s it.  - Electric kettle in the room. - Duvets (like wtf seriously!) - Also sense of humor in Russia and UK is quite alike. I have no idea how people live their life without irony/sarcasm🤨	1643989380.0	hvkmub6	t3_skcdwt	t3_skcdwt	/r/AskARussian/comments/skcdwt/whats_the_one_thing_you_miss_most_about_russia/hvkmub6/

d9v15	Citizens of the US call themselves "american", ignoring all the other countries in the western hemisphere, which are also located in Northern and Southern America. While "american" as "US citizen" personally feels kinda awkward for me, it is the most prevalent meaning.    Speaking of continents, it is usually "something-north/south-american". For example, it is not an "american animal", it is "an animal from South America".	1643989839.0	hvko28g	t3_skdlwo	t1_hvk9xwa	/r/AskARussian/comments/skdlwo/how_do_you_usually_understand_translate_a_word/hvko28g/

And it's not only about big cities, but in general. Of course, like any big country we have poor and rich regions, but taking a medium average into consideration, it is just coming back from dead to being alive.  There's a multi-national couple, traveling around Russia and CIS countries, vlogging about it. I may not like all they have to say, but they do an important job in showing around our cities big and small, and what you see there shows exactly what he did for us.  Check their [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/MattandJulia)  Additionally, there's couple of private Zen blogs, showing country factories and production facilities, that are being developed and built. And I hope, that you understand, that each new production line means new jobs, means quality of life changes, taxes, general improvements, which are easily seen with infrastructure based changes.

Not one of these countries presented a threat to NATO. NATO officials constantly declares Russia as a threat. Constant deployments of foreign troops equipment and infrastructure on Russian border.   The US has passed a law that expects new sanctions against Russia every 6 month. Sanctions can be considered an act of war.   Constant flights of nuclear capable bombers near Russian airspace including inside none NATO territories such as Ukraine.   Multiple provocations such as the "Right of passage" operations by US Navy.

4dfpdp73	American ML here- My experience with American communists has been vast confusion on what communism truly is. Most try to reconcile concepts of populism, anti-authoritarianism, and anti-communism. This results in a confused idea that you can achieve a Proudhon type fantasy utopia, where the state simultaneously doesn't exist, but also provides for everyone, while also keeping the system safe from opportunists, and that all of this can be achieved peacefully.  On top of this confusion, the hyper individualism of the US encourages these "leftists" to believe that they are the next Lenin or whatever, who will single handedly create communism. These people tend to not get along with each other, so every person has their own unique philosophy and political party of ~10 people.   I have no hope for communism in the US anymore, at this point fascism seems inevitable. Democrats only political stance is anti-republican, and republican stances are increasingly fascist.  Personally, moving to Russia or Belorus is sounding better and better, but any Russian input on this is very welcome!

ajnku	Great comment, but I disagree on the "humans aren't greedy" part.  It's not that we're greedy, it's that we have strong sense of exclusive use.  Desire to create wealth for your inner group isn't contrary to cooperation. Unreinforced† cooperation breaks down very fast - past a small group of people. Try to agree about colour of walls in a house of 8 vs an apartment building of 800.  Reinforced† cooperation clearly works, that is how natural selection worked for us. Do farming work in summer with 3 people = get more food in winter. Build a house for 1 - freeze to death, build it with 10 people - survive.   Cooperate with unknown people = get something in return.  † - I don't mean use of physical force, but psychological reinforcement by providing benefits as a result of action... like salary or social capital	1643992165.0	hvkubkw	t3_sk9tkd	t1_hvjruus	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvkubkw/

ikxidbgw	У меня мать и двоюродный брат рассказывали, как попадали под действие цыганского гипноза. Два разных случая. Мать, когда уже отдала деньги цыганке на улице вообще непонятно как, просто позвала на помощь милиционера. Деньги потребовали вернуть и вернули. Двоюродного брата цыганка попросила в поезде разменять деньги, предлагала так разменять, потом этак, потом вот так, потом он почувствовал, что голова поплыла, понял, что гипнотизируют, хлопнул ладонью по деньгам и послал её нах.  Короче, вообще не надо связываться с цыганками, потому цыганский гипноз подразумевает какую-то древнюю методику, известную цыганам, и они ею владеют.  Самое главное, не надо позволять себя трогать, касаться, позволять теребить на себе пуговицу или часть одежды, потому что с этого начинается ввод в гипноз. Сразу отрубайте разговор бесцеремонно. Пусть идут в жопу. Не заводите отношения.	1643992573.0	hvkvfm5	t3_sk4t7c	t3_sk4t7c	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk4t7c/is_it_just_mutually_accepted_by_all_russians_that/hvkvfm5/

6mrufqnd	- American movies and music are still a thing! - I love Mark Twain, O.Henry, Jack London, Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King. - I really really hope to see the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New Orlean’s unique architecture and Yellowstone National Park with my own eyes.  Also I can't help but be surprised at how much my idea of Russia vs USA changed over 2+ decades. When I was a child I saw America in perfect glamorous movies about rich people or in music videos on MTV, while seeing newly born Russian Federation in absolutely censure-free news about deaths, criminals, gore and decay, or in depressive critical-realistic Russian movies. The difference was HUGE, back then it seamed to me that things would be like this forever. Over the years Russian big cities were slowly recovering from shock and became cleaner, safer, more comfortable, better looking. And at some point I started meeting people, who visited USA, and many of them were like: “Well it was nice, but it’s not like in the movies at all, not that shiny pretty Hollywood image, there are a lot of beautiful places, but there are also dirty places, and poor places, and criminals, it’s not some perfect white fence heaven”. And then social media happened. Currently looking at many youtube and tiktok videos with people in cafes, malls, their own houses or ikea stuffed apartments, bathrooms etc. sometimes it’s impossible to tell if it’s actually Russia or USA, or any other part of the world. Which is nice, because after all we all are people and we are not that different at all:)	1643993039.0	hvkwpi2	t3_si5927	t3_si5927	/r/AskARussian/comments/si5927/what_are_your_thoughts_on_america_and_what_do_you/hvkwpi2/

It must base on scientific approach. And there is no place, in terms of common sense, for many things that have been considered "normal" in recent 30 years. Sadly, people know very little about communism not only in the West, but also in Russia nowadays.  What an average westerner with all his lgbt, eco and whatever else ideas seek is permissiveness, which they deem to be "freedom". And permissiveness is a basis of liberalism, not communism.	1643996074.0	hvl513c	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvl513c/

2cpox0re	>Well I simply wanted to use the clip from the film to illustrate what I was asking about. I asked because when I saw this part in the movie, I did think to myself "Yes, something like that did happen to me". So I learned from the replies here is that it's because of scammers, beggars, suspicion in general, and busy lifestyle.  Anyway, there could be multiple different reasons like other people said. Among others, the person could wear earphones listening music or be just deaf. Or they could be annoyed by the Chinese tourists. Or be outright idiots.

55moaazp	I feel like at this point it’s easier to travel to Russia from USA. Traveling to USA for Russian citizens is a pain in the ass. First of all, there are no visa service in Russia, people are traveling to other countries to obtain a visa and it doesn’t guarantee a success either. Second, USA requires WHO-approved vaccine for tourists, which is not available in Russia.

44gf46hg	I've never gone abroad for a long time, and I always try to actually get into the lifestyle of the destination country. But there is something I miss sometimes when outside Russia - pickles, or more specifically sour cabbage, salted cucumbers, and salted tomatoes. I even sometimes make quick-salted cucumbers myself, but it is not the same as those that were aged in salt. It's not a big thing, and I hear you can buy those in "Russian shops", but it is not widely available.  In Russia I miss salad cream (somehow Heinz only produces it in England, and making it at home is rather hard), vinegar crisps (sometimes you can buy those in Russia, but those are expensive) and Marmite (most people I know do not like it one bit, but I got hooked).	1643997018.0	hvl7mtw	t3_skcdwt	t3_skcdwt	/r/AskARussian/comments/skcdwt/whats_the_one_thing_you_miss_most_about_russia/hvl7mtw/

8nlxl	>It takes skill to say "fuck Putin" without saying "fuck Russia". And then some people just say "fuck Russia" outright and act surprised when Russians tell them to fuck off.   Is Russian culture intertwined so strongly on your national politics that you take everything so personally? I don't need to treat any other nationality as delicately as Russians.  >ask Crimeans whether they feel invaded and occupied before making any assumptions.  The point is not whether the locals wanted it or not. If a country illegitimately annexes an area from other country, that is invading and occupying. Why are you so strongly in denial of this? The UN has not recognized the referendum's results. Majority of nations in the world see the annexation of Crimea as occupation.   >I personally see nothing exceptionally ironic in consuming propaganda and accusing everyone else of being brainwashed - this is just how people normally operate at this point.  I very much agree with you on this. If you critique a Republican (or why not a Democrat) on US problems, they probably will get angry and accuse me of being a NPC, a bot, a shill, or whatever.   Now look at /r/russia: say one thing that is not approved and you get permabanned.

7owema4	Currently teaching in American university. No, American universities are right wing liberalism hellhole and that they are somehow “left wing Marxist enclaves” are nothing more than propaganda from right wing conservatives.  I can only name two explicit Marxists professors in the US: Fredric Jameson (Duke) and Richard Wolff (UMass Amherst). I don’t know of anywhere else in any major US universities can you enroll in graduate studies in Marxism.  The US academia in general is very anti-Marxist and anti-communist, and as you’d expect, strongly pro-imperialism. Not surprising after decades of Cold War propaganda. Yes, there are some humanities studies where students might get assigned some Marxist literature in some of their classes, but I’d be very surprised to find a course that actually teaches in depth Marxian economics and political literature.	1643998402.0	hvlbf9m	t3_sk9tkd	t1_hvkctqv	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvlbf9m/

c0nfl	Lol. Ok my bad for mistyping on a phone while on the train.  It's obvious you are some nationalist crazy person just looking to spread hate.  There is no hope for people like you to have an intelligent conversation.  You can't just take one isolated military incident with the soviets and Japan in Manchuria and apply that to the war as a whole.  I'm not using one genocide to justify another.  I'm pointing out the horrible aspects that are war in general.  I'm completely open to point out the injustices done by the US.  It should be talked about.  And it is, even within the US.  This is the kind of dialogue we have at a MIDDLE SCHOOL level in the US about such things.  Everything you bring up isn't "new" by any means.  Yet you speak as if you are some enlightened individual ready to change the masses.  Lol.  The fact that you say "Americans" and throw us into one pot is proof you think in a nationalistic and sensationalized mind. There is massive criticism of our own government and the way it behaves in complete disregard for how a vast majority of its own citizens.  Even amongst elected politicians themselves.  13.5% of our population who are citizens aren't' even born here.  I would never take the actions of Putin in regards to something he's enacted into law and say "the Russians did it". People are not their government.  It's hard in an authoritarian society to change the way its government behaves and it's hard, in its own way, in a constitutional representative democracy.   You are quick to anger.  Quick to judge.  You assume people are talking directly against your ideals and try to twist what they say and straw man your way into a counter argument.   As far as just bombing and making Japan's army useless?  Disabling their military and invading the country are two separate things entirely.  YOU need to look specifically at what happened in Okinawa and the nature of how the Empire of Japan decided to hold it.  The American government didn't want an Okinawa 2 scenario.  Completely different than the Soviets and Manchuria.  Lol. Not even the same.  You know nothing.  There is also the "propaganda" of the atomic bomb itself and sending a message.  Also equally horrific.  I think it's safe to say that since we've never dropped a nuclear weapon since.  Or any other country for that matter speaks loudly of what we have all learned from what happened. The sad part is you're just angry.  You don't want to have intellectual conversation. You just want to project your anger.  Spread one-off comments on the internet. Like some tough guy.  I've been in real life you don't do anything to back up the tough guy act you portray online.  What do you do in your daily life on the side to help make life better for more people?  Do you help create dialogue?   No, YOU just want to spread hate and make people angry so they can be divided even more.  I don't hold anyone alive now for any sort of atrocities their grandfathers or great grandfathers have done.  You do.  I don't take a government's actions and project that onto their citizens and blame them for it.  You do.  I don't take little slices of history that are completely disconnected from each other and try to prove a point that doesn't even make any sense.  You do.	1643999566.0	hvlekai	t3_rbxbqg	t1_hvl0n6e	/r/AskARussian/comments/rbxbqg/does_a_typically_russian_believe_the_united/hvlekai/

4mjrqia	As others have said the specific restrictions are decided at tge regional level, so it varies.  > Can you be banned from public transportation or fired for refusing to get vaccinated?  IIRC in Tatarstan you need to present the QR code to use public transportation, but it's an exception rather than a rule, as in the majority of the regions, to my knowledge, public transportation is unrestricted. In Saint Petersburg you need a QR code in order to shop at anything besides grocery stores and pharmacies, to go to theaters, cinemas and museums, and to eat at a restaurant (take out is unrestricted). A QR code is granted if one had COVID within the past 6 months, got vaccinated within the past 12 months, or had a negative PCR within the past 48 hours. I think they were going to implement issuing of QR codes based on antibody tests, but it's not there for now.  > the majority Russians are distrustful of the vaccine  It's not like the majority is distrustful (I know only one person who thinks that these vaccines might be harmful), we simply have more carefree attitude towards vaccines and doctor visits in general. Say, my father (mid 60s) hasn't had tetanus vaccine since his college days and a friend of mine (late 40s) hasn't had it since high school.  > Putin said he would not make vaccination mandatory. Others have claimed he lied. Who is right  There are no vaccination requirements at the federal level but there are requirements at tge regional levels. The specifics vary from region go region.	1644000662.0	hvlhj2e	t3_skflcl	t3_skflcl	/r/AskARussian/comments/skflcl/how_tough_are_covid_restrictions_in_russia_at_the/hvlhj2e/

12poiq	Our boomers weren't as fortunate to acquire significant retirement savings as boomers in the US because there weren't a lot of options to save money in USSR and even personal investments were straight frown upon by the state and society. Also the whole USSR went bust, so all they got is an apartment that post-soviet government allowed them to privatize for free, sometimes dacha and a meager pension from the government that not always even covers basic necessities.   So they don't have many options. Its either dacha or local parks or whatever their siblings provide. In Moscow retirees may also get a travel voucher to southern resorts (Greater Sochi or Crimea) in off-peak season when basically no one else goes there.	1644004334.0	hvlr9zo	t3_skl99d	t3_skl99d	/r/AskARussian/comments/skl99d/where_do_russian_boomers_go_to_have_a_happy_fun/hvlr9zo/

4mjrqia	Hmm, renting or exchanging games was popular because the cartridges for Dendy (a NES clone) and Mega Drive could be rather expensive despite being bootlegs (I mean it's an electronic circuit). The price of the game often depended on how cool the game was - in mid to late 90s the cheapest cartridges for Dendy were like 5000 or 10000 RUR (that is 5 or 10 RUB), and for Mega Drive 30000 (maybe 20000 even). The most expensive Mega Drive game I remember for sure was Monster World IV for 130k RUB, Virtua Racing cost either the same or maybe a bit more due to the SVP on the board.  PS/3DO/Saturn games were cheaper due to being on CDs. The prices depended on the number of CDs, for instance a single CD game cost 25 RUB while a 4-CD game cost 100 RUB (4 x 25). I've seen a non-pirated PS game only once (black CDs), I'm forgetting the name now, a space shooter with view from inside the cockpit (think Wing Commander or Starlancer), it came on two CDs.  No games for consoles were localized so one had to use intuition and be able to sense the context in order to understand what was going on with the story (or use a dictionary and improve the language skills, in fact, I mostly learned English from games). Japanese language games were more difficult in this aspect, yet I somehow managed to play them with trial and error and determination (those Sphinx questions and statue riddles from MW4, ouch)	1644004625.0	hvls27r	t3_skl6w7	t3_skl6w7	/r/AskARussian/comments/skl6w7/what_was_gaming_like_in_russia_during_the_80s_and/hvls27r/

c0nna1mt	I went to school in the 70s. It was a normal life, calm and unhurried. There was no constant stress and the need to work hard like now. We lived much poorer than now, but it was more fun. It was difficult to buy something made in the West, but there were a lot of locally produced goods. To buy a car, you had to stand in line for a long time. It was possible to buy a TV or a washing machine without any problems, loans were without interest (!), an apartment was given for free, but there was a queue for them too, education and medicine were completely free. There was often a shortage of some small things, since the planned economy was rather slow and reacted with a delay. For example, soap could suddenly disappear in one city, and there was a lot of it in another. There were also problems with diversity, since the state was responsible for all production. As a result, there was a constant shortage of some goods and shop assistants sold them illegally through their acquaintances.	1644004687.0	hvls8ak	t3_skk5z1	t3_skk5z1	/r/AskARussian/comments/skk5z1/what_was_life_like_in_russia_in_the_70s/hvls8ak/

17e1kt	Yes, Volgograd is a current name that is everyone uses. Stalingrad will always assosiate with WW2 battles for it, but nothing less, there are some people that want to rename it back, but they aren't majority. There is also it's original name - Tsaritsin, that is refered in some monuments and names of nearby locations. I guess since Stalingrad was renamed to Volgograd already in soviet times, after destalinisation, they didn't want to leave Tsaritsin name because of it's assotiation with Russian Empire. And after USSR collapsed, no one realy cared to return it's original name and leave as it is.	1644005056.0	hvlt7g3	t3_sklgom	t3_sklgom	/r/AskARussian/comments/sklgom/name_of_volgograd/hvlt7g3/

9pbfx36r	I can't say I've had similar experience. But generally I see four options here:  1. Buy it from a Russian unofficial reseller such as this one : [https://www.ozon.ru/product/fitnes-braslet-fitbit-14184041-341452059/?sh=MEwzigAAAA](https://www.ozon.ru/product/fitnes-braslet-fitbit-14184041-341452059/?sh=MEwzigAAAA) (£125). 2. Send with regular post. The customs threshold is currently 200 EUR, the recipient doesn't have to pay any additional fee if the price is below that. Just send to the home address, the post will send a note once the package is received, and the recipient will collect it from the office. It's almost impossible to pick up a wrong parcel because the post worker verifies your identity when you receive the parcel (you either show your passport, or get an SMS to your phone number if you had registered in their system previously). Alternatively, I believe you can indicate only the country, city postal code, name and POSTE RESTANTE or ДО ВОСТРЕБОВАНИЯ instead of the address. And they'll wait 15 days for the recipient to pick it up. 3. Use a mail forwarding service such as this one: [https://en.global.cdek.ru/gb](https://en.global.cdek.ru/gb) or this one [https://pony.market/](https://pony.market/) for example. Once you register, you get an address in the UK for the order (from Amazon/Ebay/...), Fitbit is delivered to that address and then sent to Russian with other goods. Then it's delivered to the recipient / to the office. 4. Buy a similar product in Russia, for example Xiaomi Mi Band 6, which is 2.5 to 3 times cheaper than Fitbit.	1644006002.0	hvlvp57	t3_skmewq	t3_skmewq	/r/AskARussian/comments/skmewq/how_can_i_have_a_fitbit_sent_from_the_uk_to_russia/hvlvp57/

Yes, they are liberals, but they aren’t left wing.  Even the most left-wing prominent politicians your country has, Bernie Sanders, is nothing more than a very mild social democrat that would be considered as a center-right politician in Europe.

h87yiuii	>Is Russian culture intertwined so strongly on your national politics that you take everything so personally?  I don't think Russians take everything involving their politics personally, but yes, Russian culture is to a certain degree intertwined with Russians politics, this shouldn't come as a revelation.  >I don't need to treat any other nationality as delicately as Russians.  You don't have to treat anyone delicately.  >The point is not whether the locals wanted it or not.  What? To the locals it was absolutely the point that they wanted it. The right of people to self-determination and all that. When Hong-Kong doesn't want to return to China, they get full support from the West, but when Crimea doesn't want to return to Ukraine, they get completely ignored. How are Crimeans supposed to feel about it? They fucking despise you more than any Russian or Ukrainian ever could.  >Why are you so strongly in denial of this?  I'm not, the world is just not black and white.  >If a country illegitimately annexes an area from other country, that is invading and occupying... The UN has not recognized the referendum's results. Majority of nations in the world see the annexation of Crimea as occupation.  That's realpolitik for you - big powers don't ask the UN if they can annex, invade and destroy small powers, just look at any conflict since WW2 (with some exceptions like the Korean war, when US "asked" its allies if it's okay to invade, while USSR and China were absent from the Security Council meetings), you might call it 18th or 19th century mindset, but that's how things have worked so far. Russia didn't take Crimea because it's some sort of an economic jewel, that would outweight any potential sanctions (quite the opposite) or because Putin loves ethnic Russians so much, it's purely pragmatic - Crimea has been the main base of the Russian Black Sea fleet for centuries, and with Ukraine leaning towards NATO and EU, Putin saw an opportunity and seized it.  >Now look at r/russia: say one thing that is not approved and you get permabanned. How does this differ from the fuck-all uptight Western bullshit?  I really don't care about r/russia but people keep bringing it up the last few days, if you don't like their rules or how mods loosely interpret said rules, then just don't go there.

Also having abundance of natural resources doesn't guarantee cheap heating for consumers unless government regulates internal prices which it does in Russia and I think pretty well.

Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were woodcuts, followed by engravings or etchings, and from mid-19th century lithography. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern comic strip.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1644007845.0	hvm0l2q	t3_sknhzm	t1_hvm0irp	/r/AskARussian/comments/sknhzm/im_having_a_hard_time_figuring_out_whats_going_on/hvm0l2q/

I think if more Americans understood just how short changed we are,  things would change but as soon as people speak up it seems like they are demonized.    I agree.

I had one, and not only played, but even wrote a kind of snake game for it. Really, I think then I understood the profession I should choose. ZX clones had more sophisticated and colorful games, but they were more expensive. A bit later, cheap Dendy came there, and almost every second child had one.

5bpnrqcs	1. Back to school as in, finish last 2 years? Yes, until she's 27, then she would have to take evening school for adults. But, see next point - she could just go to vocational school and take those 2 school years as part of curriculum there. 2. There were (and still are) a lot of different vocational schools that all have different courses, but generally it has separate tracks for those who did or did not finish last two years at school. Those who did get short track without school subjects, those who didn't get longer track with it. 3. Important notice here. In USSR (and now Russia) only part of school education is compulsory (you have to finish 8, now 9, years). So you can leave school at 15 and do whatever you want, in theory. In practice even in USSR it was a sure way to never get decent job, hence evening schools for adults. 4.  My friend is 31 and she enrolled in art vocational school and got dormitory there. Same in USSR. Vocational education is free, but dormitory is not (cost is mostly symbolic, though, and more than affordable). 5. Vocational education is and was very, very varied. Plumber is vocational, cook is vocational, but also librarian or even an artist or designer.  6. At least some vocational paths have corresponding higher education courses. Finishing vocational school allows one to go straight into high-ed, no exams needed and usually skipping several years.	1644072035.0	hvpa3b3	t3_sl2dvd	t3_sl2dvd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl2dvd/vocational_schools_in_soviet_union/hvpa3b3/

More than just that, not everyone goes to a boot camp, to begin with: some military occupations that are supposed not to require extensive learning just receive recruit training ("курс молодого бойца", "young fighter's course") in the regiment where they'll serve. Recruit training typically lasts about a month, while boot camp (or rather, "training military unit") can take up to half a year.	1644072452.0	hvpazj3	t3_sl1188	t1_hvor73f	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvpazj3/

В масштабах страны с ~300 миллионным населением и на отрезке в 30 лет эта цифра, пусть и трагичная, совершенно ни о чем. Кстати, если вы такой поборник праведности, то не хотите США те же претензии выкатить? Там сейчас при сравнимом с СССР населении сидит больше, чем когда либо сидело в СССР. И умирают постоянно там тоже, от всяких кишечных и заточки в почку. Плюс использование заключённых как рабов (именно как рабов, в СССР лагерникам платили, все ведомости можно найти в архивах).   Ну и самое мое любимое. Может хоть кто-то из вашей когорты объяснить мне, зачем руководству СССР было «убивать граждан миллионами»? Чтобы что? Они же руководить пришли, им надо чтобы люди работали, налоги платили и т.д. С мертвых ничего не получишь. Так в чем сакральный смысл?  А, ну да. Просто большевики злой-злой был, русский ненавидел.

He got lucky, there are few like that in the whole world. Like Alexander Karelin....  VDV and other special units have more time dedicated to physical training. So you will see more fit soldiers in units like that. But that will be the case is any special forces unit in most countries.  A friend of mine served in a US army unit in 1999 and did some patrols with the VDV units that were at the Pristina airport.

Through yeah, as it was said before Shariy is the best option since if someone would catch him on stealing, he, as a media person and a politican, will be busted by all the government media who hate him. But he will basically use the charity he will do for your money as an advertisement of his political affairs, through it still will be charity.	1644075789.0	hvpijdc	t3_skzdbk	t3_skzdbk	/r/AskARussian/comments/skzdbk/is_there_anyway_i_could_help_the_people_in_donbas/hvpijdc/
4mjrqia	> Not in Moscow. I have a Landstalker copy here with the price tag of 240, which I bought in '98 and it was one of the most "expensive" carts. The price of MD was 900, I believe. I'm not entirely sure, but it certainly was nowhere near 200.  I might be thinking about summer of 1998 (before the August). 200 was probably a used one, but 300 for a new console, that I saw in Saint Petersburg. And Landstalker went for 110 or 120 here (I rented it several times and remember the price tag).  SNES games appeared in 2000 or 2001 in the store I frequented, before that they sold NES, MD and PS games only (later added Dreamcast), by then 16-bit was waning and they were around twice the prices of the most expensive MD games.	1644075906.0	hvpitam	t3_skl6w7	t1_hvp92u2	/r/AskARussian/comments/skl6w7/what_was_gaming_like_in_russia_during_the_80s_and/hvpitam/

44gf46hg	Vodka is considered a common hard liquor, but I cannot say it is as popular as the stereotype may say. Lots of people would prefer other hard liquors over vodka, mostly because it is hard to keep the track of all vodka brands, and most of them are rather bad. Even some good brands of vodka tend to deteriorate over time. And vodka is generally flavorless, so you get it only if you want to get smashed, not to actually have a nice drinking evening. Cognac (at least Armenian kind), whiskey, tequila and rum are equally popular.	1644076089.0	hvpj916	t3_sl7kez	t3_sl7kez	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl7kez/vodka/hvpj916/

g6k7v5q	As I understand it, in the USSR coffee, which had to be imported, was a premium product. So unlike first-world countries, where instant coffee had to fight against the inertia of drinking ground coffee, in Russia in the nineties it flooded the new market as a convenient and cheap self-defined beverage, rather than an alternative to an entrenched product. Ground coffee is slowly catching up, but I'd guess by now many people got used to the instant one and don't hate it enough to warrant a switch. I imagine the emigrants brought that habit with them.

4qkuepxp	One of the fascinating things, here, is that the form of the narrative they're using is what people in the west would call a "Jeremiad". A Jeremiad, named after the prophet Jeremiah, is a form of literature in which a society is taken to task for falling from its previous state of goodness and prosperity because it has abandoned some moral principle or code of conduct. The audience is encouraged to return to the path of righteous action, so that their society will be healed and return to peace, happiness, prosperity, power, etc. It's a common narrative arc across many cultures, though- not all the works that use the Jeremiad form are drawing from the western literary tradition. This is a great example of the exact same narrative formula, being used by people who probably are not being influenced by that literary tradition.	1644079779.0	hvpsdl0	t3_sla3go	t3_sla3go	/r/AskARussian/comments/sla3go/is_this_russian_or_mongolian/hvpsdl0/

8fzpbt29	Типичный пример ватника-коммуниста, говорим про совочек, значит надо приплести злую омерику. Никто не отрицает, что омерика злая, только вот мы сейчас говорим про совок, а не про омерику. Я не поборник праведности и уж точно не моралфаг, но ты совсем ахуел называть 690 тысяч расстрелов(только по официальным данным!) называть "ни о чём" цифрой? Может быть ты ещё и геноциды будешь отрицать? Смерть одного - это трагедия, смерть миллионов - это статистика, да же? Ах да, по тем же официальным данным около миллиона человек отправили в советские концлагеря. Не будем забывать, что детей туда тоже отправляли, вспомним хоть концлагерь А.Л.Ж.И.Р.  Причин убивать было много, политические репрессии, выслуга, квоты на расстрел, банальное безумие, эксперименты над людьми.  Жизнь не чёрно-белая, нет. Я не отрицаю всех достижений которые СССР принёс миру, научные достижения, военные достижения (забудем про Финляндию на секунду), промышленные достижения, а вот с экономическими достижениями беда... но все эти достижения не являются оправданием страданий обычного советского человека на протяжении существования всего совка, даже победа над Германией не является оправданием, потому как хоть Германия и заставила бы русских страдать ещё больше, но страданий которые принесли коммунисты это никак не оправдывает, и не только поэтому, в это же время на другой стороне света, в той самой злой омерике люди почему-то не страдали так, хотя достижений у них было не меньше, чем у совка.   Отрицать этого нельзя, обычный советский человек страдал, страдал, потому что коммунизм невозможен на таком грандиозном уровне, потому что люди не био-роботы.

It is what people want to do with it that may be questionable. I consider myself a Communist to an extent, but my actual worldview is actually quite far from what Marx thought, and I find most theories of Communism from the early XX century outdated for many reasons.	1644082120.0	hvpyctc	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvpyctc/

58oaoi2z	 Even though I spent quite a lot of time at the store playing with the Salesperson, I don't *really* remember the prices. I *think* SNES carts were 500\~600. Not even sure if they were OG or not. I *do* remember these prices not being such a big deal compared to '95 or earlier.  Either way, people were buying mostly PS1 games. Sega was on the second place. NES stopped being popular. I'd say, less than 5% of customers wanted to buy a NES game. Then there were some people who owned a 3DO (obv, these are not some real statistics, more like personal observations drafted from memory). Anyway, my point is that even 3DO games were sold more frequently than SNES ones.  >I rented it several times   A fellow Landstalker fan! What a surprise! =D \*high fives\*   My first copy didn't have a battery slot (later on this shitty version would be priced 70\~110. Smth like that), so I had to keep MD on for a few days.

11ref0	If she graduated at 17 that means she finished the full high school (10 grades).  After that she could get some job which didn't require vocational education or enter the Uni (Институт), or College(Техникум). Technically she also could enter vocational school (ПТУ) too, but that would be useless waste of time because she could leave the school at 15, after finishing middle school (8 grades).  Vocational school prepared for some work jobs not requiring much education, like locksmith, turner, house painter etc. and simultaneously gave the full high school education certificate (аттестат).  Some College specializations were allowed to accept  students with middle school certificate, some required full high school. Those with middle school certificate after finish of college got the high school certificate too, which allowed then to apply for the university too.  Colleges prepared technicians and workers of similar level, graduates were allowed to apply for positions which assume managing people: foreman etc.  Universities prepared higher education graduates: engineers (those unis usually were called Институт) , scientists (Университет) etc.  Students of universities and colleges could apply for a place in a dorm if they were not registered residents of the same town (not sure about vocational school).	1644085829.0	hvq6ahk	t3_sl2dvd	t3_sl2dvd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl2dvd/vocational_schools_in_soviet_union/hvq6ahk/

Lakota is mutually intelligible with the two dialects of the Dakota language, especially Western Dakota, and is one of the three major varieties of the Sioux language. Speakers of the Lakota language make up one of the largest Native American language speech communities in the United States, with approximately 2,000 speakers, who live mostly in the northern plains states of North Dakota and South Dakota.

If you want to talk about a failed ideology, you should go speak to the millions of people living in tents in rich cities in the US, or maybe ask some of them how their $1million dollar medical bills are doing.	1644091317.0	hvqh0ux	t3_sk9tkd	t1_hvkkbmw	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvqh0ux/

Conscription doesn't have anything to do with professional military and zero benefits come from it   To be an officer you need to join a military university, that's the only way.   You can also be a professional non-officer rank, but the wages there are not great - only desperate people join as lower ranks(but there are plenty in remote areas)   Having served as a non-officer rank also doesn't give you any benefits in military career, except earlier retirement	1644094774.0	hvqn3n2	t3_sl1188	t1_hvowc1h	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvqn3n2/

jazn7	So, Russian army have 2 very different groups - conscripts and professionals.   Those are not the same and even if conscript is at the same military rank as a professional they are completely different in essence.   The difference is in everything - conscripts have very low salary - like $30, and the professionals start from $250, and in general conscripts are treated a bit like prisoners because they are not allowed to leave in contrast to contractors      Enlisted have very low standards, you can be enlisted after being convicted(there are tricky rules, but if you really want you can have your mandatory service even after killing someone if the circumstances are right)    Also no physical fitness is required and if you don't have a limb missing they can still pass you if you aren't noisy about it      Professional service is possible only after either conscription or military university(but that one will start you as an officer)   The requirement are much stricter and if you don't have a decent health and good fitness they will fail you unless you bribe someone   Health and fitness are reevaluated all the time, but the requirements are not extreme, and you also can weasel you out usually       There are plenty of paperwork for professionals, but I believe no one reads it so it's not a biggie, you just sign whatever you told to sign	1644096101.0	hvqpxch	t3_sl1188	t3_sl1188	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvqpxch/

hnvolv0	Russians who speak Russian would not really know as they never need to not speak Russian.    For those who have visited Russia with poor or no Russian or more specifically those who move there. I will tell you   *Dealing with phone companies *Dealing with healthcare *Dealing with any government Bueracraucy *Dealing with finding a good job that isnt exclusively an English bubble type job *Having friends outside the bubble    Ordering food, shopping, the Bank, and getting services is the easiest part and something an A2 level speaker person can do. Or in big cities in central areas or among young or academic Russians someone could be around who speaks English and can help you. Dating at a low level is something a B1 speaker could do. Actual formenting deep friendships and relationships takes b2 I say.   However, to call your phone company and hope there is a fluent English speaker or to deal with government papers or government workers who arent at the office that deals solely with foreigeners is hard in any country. Usually its women in their 40s and 50s working there who dont have a lot of patience and would not have a need to know English.   If you come to Russia and dont know Russian or English you are doomed. If you come and dont know Russian but know English you arent doomed if you stay in bubble areas and arent intending to live there and assimilate.   I cant imagine what one would do if they arrived and only spoke Chinese, Spanish, Hindi or French.	1644105135.0	hvr9xzi	t3_skvcuj	t3_skvcuj	/r/AskARussian/comments/skvcuj/what_are_the_most_difficult_things_to_do_in/hvr9xzi/

2mvlv34f	It... Kinda depends on the military approval commission. For example, some people don't send open gays as a part of conscription to the army for everyone's good - better off without some random schizo murdering them.   Sometimes, even actually legally disabled people have to go through hell and back to stop the commission from sending them to Siberia or whatever. A bit of anecdote, a friend of mine had to prove he has diabetes 7 times to the local commission. They were really fixated on tye idea of him being trying to evade conscription. *Really, really* fixated.	1644106026.0	hvrbwk9	t3_sl1188	t3_sl1188	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvrbwk9/

156e5g	Depends on the city, and on a particular military commissariat. In Moscow a lot of people will do anything to avoid getting conscripted, since it’s basically a waste of a year with zero benefits. Contracted services became more popular, but not enough to replace conscription. And since they have a quota to fill some commissariats are a bit too zealous in their methods. For example: they have tried to illegally coscript me one time.	1644108811.0	hvrhx34	t3_sl1188	t3_sl1188	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvrhx34/

This is average (maybe a bit low) by big city standards, but considered a sizable income in other parts of the country. The biggest draw of being on contract is government covering for your mortgage. But you have to serve for a considerable amount of time to get that iirc. The contract service is actually a good way for young guys from smaller cities and countryside to get their own honme and a decently paying job.	1644114270.0	hvrtoir	t3_sl1188	t1_hvrlhud	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvrtoir/

The military is also viewed in a negative light, because in yhe 90-ties and early 2000 the discipline was really bad, and hazing, regular beating of new recruits and similar practices were rampant. Hard to glorify such institutions. Nowadays it’s a lot better, but the damage to army’s reputation was already done.	1644159045.0	hvtedua	t3_sl1188	t1_hvt8t6a	/r/AskARussian/comments/sl1188/is_the_russian_army_strict_about_enlistment/hvtedua/

c0nna1mt	This is a difficult question, but I will make a pathetic attempt to explain on my fingers. Trotsky wanted to arrange a world revolution, fortunately he was killed. Stalin just wanted to make a just society, but this society was socialist, we never had communism. After Stalin's death, everything gradually began to fall apart. The Eastern Treaty countries became socialist by accident, as they had to be liberated from Hitler and Stalin took advantage of the opportunity. If Hitler had not attacked the USSR, everything would have remained as before. The West was not afraid of the expansion of the USSR, but of the fact that Westerners (mostly those who have nothing to lose) themselves would want to live the same way as in the USSR, and big capital would lose all power and money. The real state of affairs and what the media say in the West are two different things. In order to avoid socialist revolutions, the West has created a middle class of well-off people living, as a rule, by wage labor in high-paying jobs or engaged in small business. Now the middle class is no longer needed and it is gradually being dismantled.	1644159909.0	hvtg9mi	t3_sltyih	t3_sltyih	/r/AskARussian/comments/sltyih/what_was_the_soviet_unions_end_game/hvtg9mi/

icigcd98	>So you could think of Ukrainian as a DLC to Russian? Like, Ukrainian is Russian+, or "Russian and some more"?  Good xD  Okay so basically Ukrainian was formed by Polish influence, which means it has a lot of Polish vocabulary. Plus, many words that are considered "uneducated village people talk" in Russian are considered normal words in Ukrainian.   But the grammar is mostly the same.   Also keep in mind that dialect vs language is a weird classification and is mostly based on politics. Swedish and Norwegian are considered different languages although they are mutually intelligible.  Cantonese and Mandarin are viewed as dialects but they are NOT mutually intelligible. Same with Arabic, various dialects are different enough to be different languages.	1644161303.0	hvtjf11	t3_slvn1k	t1_hvt0o5c	/r/AskARussian/comments/slvn1k/i_am_well_aware_russia_and_ukraine_have_different/hvtjf11/

81i27gwt	Dear Anglo-Saxons,  With all the richness of the English language you still can't deny it's one (at least) major flaw: you use the same word - Russian - to denote the largest territory in the world inhabited by hundreds - if not thousands - of nations and tongues, and also just one of those nations! In Russian it's two distinct notions: 'rossiyskiy' and 'russkiy', correspondingly. So, the correct answer to your question would likely be "Yes, the guys are Russian (because they live in the RF) but they're not Russians (not of Russian ethnic group; from Altai, I believe)"...	1644161830.0	hvtkmp7	t3_sla3go	t3_sla3go	/r/AskARussian/comments/sla3go/is_this_russian_or_mongolian/hvtkmp7/

85fot6id	The world now and before is under control tiny group of reach men.  How it happened? Private property. Consider a big factory, single owner, every employee get salary. But all profiit takes capitalist. So small group of men becoming extremely rich, and all others employees have only small salary. Rich ones control media, police, army and have all means to control all society. The rest of peoples have not much. How to stop it? In the factory replace capitalist who takes all money on an emloyee who will do his work just for salary. The factory should work as before, even better: the same workers, the same equiment an salary even moe, because there is no that man who takes all.  The world where was no big abyss between riches and poors would be attractive, and so win of communism looked inevitable. So USSR was never going to conquer the entire World, the task was just survive until times all peoples see how good is life under socialism. Most citisens of USSR was sure, that peoples of all countries want to join USSR so build up fair and happy new World. No need to conquer anything, just wait.  But something went wrong. The communizm ideas happened to be not so effective.	1644165962.0	hvtuq9y	t3_sltyih	t3_sltyih	/r/AskARussian/comments/sltyih/what_was_the_soviet_unions_end_game/hvtuq9y/

11ref0	>Yah? And who created this law?  The History. She's a very cruel witch, almost as ruthless as gravity. This law is observed always, everywhere, without any exception. That's why it is called "the law".  I could explain very simple logic behind it, but it looks like you just don't want to learn.  > but it also exported a very large amount of industrial goods,   Let me enumerate those "industrial products":  1. Weapons 2. ... That's all, folks!  All the others products (cars, machines etc.) were exported to developing countries ONLY because of dumping prices, almost any Soviet product was uncompetitive. Our engineers were good, so there WERE some moments when we made some product better than in capitalist countries, but ALWAYS it longed only year or two: after that market competitors were able to pass us but Soviet product stayed the same (no goal to compete, so no progress). I could give you many examples.  >  In contrast to modern Russia,   Looks like you just don't know anything. The modern Russia successfully exports one of the most complicated and high-intellectual products: computer programs. Why 70% of Russia GDP is still inducted by the natural rent? That's the question which should be asked from the current government, that's only their incompetence which does not allow to lower that percentage.  > And by the way, as I said, if it weren’t for the huge burden of military spending, I’m just sure that there would be no problems with a shortage of goods   Mua-ha-ha-ha!!!! Seriously? You REALLY believe, that if Soviet leaders didn't give shit to rise living standards of people in the real world of XX Century, they would suddenyl started to do it if they had more money? NO! they would just dpend to the weapons more, people would still live the life of the third world citizens, as it was in reality.  > labor under capitalism, when you have two ways - either work until you fall, or die of hunger  That is very fun to know :) I work in my favorite specialty, do what I love to do, I change the world and feel pride for what I've done. All in a capitalist company. Also I must remind you that when joint ventures were allowed, anybody wanted to work for capitalists, because it was a labor which was clearly useful, while on Soviet factories they just shuffling papers. Many engineers and scientists left the country because their ideas just could not break through the bureaucratic wall, while on the West any valuable idea was bought (sometimes - with the fraud from the buyers, because Soviet people were not familiar with capitalistic world, but it was anyway better than nothing, which they would get here).  > And somehow here you seem to contradict yourself, with the "inefficiency of the planned economy"? Not?  No it isn't. It's so simple, can't you see it???? IT's exactly because the economy is only PARTLY planned. ANY high-tech Chinese company is private and capitalistic. Any government company is huge and much less effective. That's what we see. And the root flaw of such hybrid (ideology, which dictates that planned economy must prevail) will inevitably lead (in the near future, actually) to wide repressions of capitalist entrepreneurs, so the colossus will fall. That is a very obvious future.	1644170381.0	hvu5x84	t3_sltyih	t1_hvt2393	/r/AskARussian/comments/sltyih/what_was_the_soviet_unions_end_game/hvu5x84/

If you take a Russian who doesn't speak Ukrainian and an Ukrainian who doesn't speak Russian (those are kinda rare though), they will be able to understand most of each other's speech due to similar sentence structure and a huge overlap in vocabulary between the languages.   In fact, due to similarity, in some areas of Ukraine, the languages have blended and some people speak a mix of the two https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surzhyk	1644171454.0	hvu8oib	t3_slvn1k	t3_slvn1k	/r/AskARussian/comments/slvn1k/i_am_well_aware_russia_and_ukraine_have_different/hvu8oib/

For example, between 1917 and 1920 Kiev changed the "controlling government" 8 times or so - Red army - Rada - Skoropadskiy+Germans - Petlura - Red army - White Army - Red army- Polish army - Red army - finally formed Ukranian SSR and joined USSR as one of the founders. And also Lithuania, Latvia, Moldavia and Estonia, who joined (voluntarily-compulsorily, as we say) during WW2, because war situation needed to do so.	1644172028.0	hvua4g9	t3_sltyih	t1_hvu25z1	/r/AskARussian/comments/sltyih/what_was_the_soviet_unions_end_game/hvua4g9/

6mp3t1pz	Firstly, no one lived in the Soviet Union at the level of the third world, especially during the dawn in the 70s, you probably remember the dashing 90s, so it was much later. Why would the Soviet leaders direct money for weapons if they didn’t need to defend themselves? Because they were "Evil and bad communists"?    That a huge amount of our developments flowed to the West in the period after the collapse of the USSR, no one doubts, this is a well-known fact. And yes, we have always made and are doing weapons well - since these are the very high technologies. So, if something is leaking out of the country, then it is clearly better than where it is leaking to.   Well, okay, but here is the export of the software product:   Exports from Russia for 2020 amounted to $336.4 billion (mainly mineral resources mainly)    https://ru-stat.com/analytics/7839        Can you find out how much our software has been sold during the same time?	1644172508.0	hvubbso	t3_sltyih	t1_hvu5x84	/r/AskARussian/comments/sltyih/what_was_the_soviet_unions_end_game/hvubbso/

Ukraine is part of a large Russia, the very name "Ukraine" comes from the word "outskirts" - because Ukraine was on the outskirts of the Russian empire.  The new language "Ukrainian" was created by the Poles in order to convince the Ukrainians that they are a different people, not Russians.  That is why Ukrainian in Ukraine is spoken mainly in the western regions that adjoin Poland.  For the first time, the independence of Ukraine (from Russia) was discussed following the results of the First World War in documents that are also known as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.  Until that time, Ukraine has always been a part of and within the Russian Empire.

When it happened, Sber didn’t activate this feature automatically (as all other banks did), he hide it in settings. So every person should activate it MANUALLY. That’s how sber still doing money on what should be free for everyone, that’s freaking  insane!!! So every time you make a money transfer to sber-person who didn’t enable it, you pay your own money for commission which shouldn’t be! Oh God, I hate it!    P.s.

58oaoi2z	I'm more of a Quake kind of guy. New games should've been right down my alley, BUT they feel too "consoley" to me. Dropped D16 almost immediately: no air control = no fun.  It's quite astonishing how id managed to introduce all this ~~bunny-hopping~~ strafe-jumping, rocket-jumping, plasma-climbing back in the day, yet all they did afterwards was attempts to remove (old games) or contain (new games) these features.  I mean... All this wall-running in DE sounds good on paper, but have you played ULTRAKILL? Now, that's what I'd call evolution in the genre.  I haven't played any of the 2.5D shooters back in the day and jumped straight into QIII LAN tournaments. I did play Blood a couple years ago and had *an absolute blast* with it, but classic Doom just doesn't click with me and I haven't tried DII.  So, yeh...

djcph	This may be an unpopular opinion, and I had many debates with people over it before, but my favourite entry is Doom Eternal.  I understand that Doom 1 and Doom 2 are iconic, these are the games that changed the industry forever, and they had huge impact on the games we have now. But I was born in mid-90s, and these 2 games were released even before I was born, so I couldn't really appreciate them at that time being short enough to walk under a table. Plus, I remember being scared to death with FPS games, like I started playing the first Half-Life probably in early 2000s, so my childhood, and I remember being scared as soon as headcrabs started spawning, so this was like the 1st level, and I'm already out. I only started playing FPS games when Painkiller was released, and it was awesome. Plus, I wasn't afraid of shooters anymore. At that time, I think, I also played the first 2 Serious Sam games, which were awesome too,  Doom 3 (and Quake 4 as well) were kinda skipped, mainly because I didn't have a computer good enough to run those. Plus, I mainly played Warcraft 3 at that time and didn't really bother with FPS games that much.  Doom 2016 was also skipped for a time being, mainly because I didn't want to spend 2k on it, being poor student at first and then receiving shit salary. But I watched the walkthroughs on YouTube, and it just blew my mind. The music, the graphics, the sheer pace and aggression were great.  Being really impressed with 2016, I got excited when Doom Eternal was about to release, I bought it straight away (I think even on the first day) and immediately started playing it. Plus, it was when pandemic started, so why not. I really loved it for the same reasons I loved watching 2016, but also for the dynamics, like, you never stood in one place, you always flew around, used every tool you got, it was amazing. Didn't really find it that hard, maybe because I played on Hurt me plenty. Couple months ago I revisited Eternal and actually completed it on Nightmare. It was tough (I think I spent couple hours to kill the Icon of Sin, and it took me almost an hour to kill him on my latest attempt, it was like a WoW raidboss on steroids), but totally worth it.  Then my friend persuaded me to buy 2016, I got it, loved it, but not as much as Eternal, , I enjoyed dashing, meathook and all that stuff way too much.  &#x200B;  As for custom maps, I played some games with map editor, like Serious Sam or Warcraft 3, but I never really got to create my own maps. It was fun playing with models and assets, but nothing more.	1644415682.0	hw84xvo	t3_so3i8v	t3_so3i8v	/r/AskARussian/comments/so3i8v/favorite_doom_game/hw84xvo/

Retook de-facto control over colonies?Didn't USA promote fascists to power after war, like in Italy, Greece, Western Germany?  No and No. After a short period - a couple of years - of de-Nazification, all European countries were free to elect whoever they wanted. What they did. And, against the will of the US, sometimes Nazis still got elected. But did not stay elected for long. The US did put in motion the huge Marshall plan that allowed the economies of European countries to be quickly restored (USSR did no such thing for the Soviet Block countries).  >The country for which war isn't about survival, but about getting profits and control over parts of globe, tries to whitewash its' crimes by propaganda and you happily believe it.  I find it that it is rather you who were brainwashed by Russian military propaganda to believe what you do.  As for the US, the war was never about profits and was always about survival. The critical for the USSR Lendlease was a giveaway with not profits, but just expenses. To sustain the war effort, the country heavily borrowed from own population, which - voluntarily! - loaned the US government money required for production of military supplies. People agreed to work 10 - 12 hour days because of the war.  Yes, the US was not bombed. And yes, because of the lack of land destruction and that huge economic effort, because of the amounts of economic help it provided around the world to the countries devastated by war, only because of that was the US able to assume the position of the world leader. Indeed, with the drop of the Iron Curtain, the US was the only country preventing Stalin, and then Khruschev, from invading other countries of the Europe. It provided what amounted to a free security to European countries, allowing them to spend those money on economy and reconstruction.  >You can point by point prove that replacements for lend lease shipments would lead to defeat?  Just read memoirs of Khrushcev and Zhukov - ask Google where to find them. They say that much - quoting from memory, "... and what would we do without armor, rubber for wheels, explosives, lubricants?..." There is more there. There are other sources as well, all recognized by historians. If you have a will to find them, you would.	1644426976.0	hw8xmnf	t3_smyx96	t1_hw7s52o	/r/AskARussian/comments/smyx96/why_dont_russians_make_a_big_deal_out_of/hw8xmnf/

eqs0s	Some Russian surnames were Ukrainiazed, some Ukrainian ones were Russified. Pavlyuchenkov is an example of a Russified Ukrainian surname. In some cases it was done by authorities, in some by people themselves. People cared less about surnames back in the day and change them to fit in or just because. Changing a name was a lot easier then too.     I have a Russified Ukrainian last name. Here is a story how I got it. My great grandfather's neighbor didn't have any sons. He was afraid that his surname will perish with him. My great grandfather had several. So the neighbor asked to give his surname to my grandfather. The neighbor didn't adopt my grandfather just had him registered with his surname. This story is odd and not a common occurrence by any chance, but shows how surnames can travel.    I doubt you can separate Russians and Ukrainians via a DNA testing. They have been mixing for a while especially in South of Russia and came from the same ancestry.	1644433742.0	hw9g2xp	t3_sok8bn	t3_sok8bn	/r/AskARussian/comments/sok8bn/a_question_about_east_slavic_surnames/hw9g2xp/
