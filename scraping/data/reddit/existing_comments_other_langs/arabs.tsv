1otjig3y	Pretty impressive if you look at the failed attempts by other oil rich nations + nations with raw materials that chose massive corruption instead of investment in industry and normal people.  So yes it's impressive relative to the nations around it.   Your comment honestly sounds like cope.  Nation X is rich in X material, and capitalising on it is apparently so dumb right? Using foreign labour because your current workforce aren't equipt enough is bad somehow esp when you don't even have enough numbers even if they were skilled. Those dumb bedu should have stayed fishing and in tents right?  Those moves aren't a bad thing, yes the nature of how it's done can be bad like Kafala but most industrialised nations in the west went through this. The British with coal, and irish/Scots immigration into England during the industrial era etc.  Not to mention their 100x massive exploitative Imperial system they used in India and Africa that put their foot up front, all foreign labour. All.  Think Dubai has less of an abusive footprint compared to other nations who are idolised historically	1641475696.0	hrhl6ez	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhhr36	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhl6ez/

1otjig3y	Bad leadership and incompetent foreign policies that cost them more than reward them  Yes the US dominates the world. But like China, or any other nations your interest matter too, esp when it comes to prosperity.  Shitting on the US will cost you, make sure the cost isn't going to damage your people's livelihoods. That's good leadership.  Challenging an entity you know you'd be crushed by so you can look like a big dick (Saddam) isn't going to mean anything to the average person. Even if people say you shot rockets at Israel that one time that never landed anywhere.  I'm not a fan of the US but I'm not a fan of lower the standards of life and throwing people under the bus for the sake of looking Chad when you have no grounds to challenge.  For me what matters most is general people getting a good crack at life. Even if it means showing the US some good will, because the other dudes around the region aren't going to be nicer (Russia, Iran or China).	1641476703.0	hrhn8xf	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhmn0w	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhn8xf/

1otjig3y	Tourism, oil and gas is a whole industry in itself that the world relies on, without it you wouldn't type a reply to me, finance industry etc  They're the top in the region.  So they do have and there's no shame in oil and gas, esp other oil and gas nations that have better reserves and can't so anything with it (Algeria, Libya etc).  Dubai itself right now doesn't run on oil and gas anyway.  Abu Dhabi does and they're pretty good at it with ADNOC.	1641480488.0	hrhvxkh	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrht86o	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhvxkh/
1otjig3y	They don't but don't pretend they didn't know, esp the ones who did so because they miscalculated and thought they were winning brownie points with local people etc.  No one deserves to get bombed that's not my point, it's knowing you'll get bombed and ignoring it because you think you can desperately cling to power by challenging something bigger than you, we saw Saddam and Gaddafi try that and Libyans and Iraqis suffer for it, ultimately it's the US's fault but let's not pretend dictators don't rely on using them as a prop for support when they're failing in every other aspect etc.   As I said I'm not a US fan but what I hate most is those who risk their whole nation to try and cement power and it backfires miserably.  I don't want to starve because my countrys leader is using palestine as an excuse and suddendly mad about Imperialism (especially funny when his power relied on it at a point) so he risks our whole economy by shit fisting publicly for 3roobah points.  I just don't find these people appealing nor do I find transnational groups like Hezbollah appealing, who's whole mantra is resistance and pretending to be defensive and using the flag of Palestine to mow down Arabs in Yemen Iraq and Syria because if they don't like them they can easily label them as pro US therefore anti-palestine or Islam etc.	1641481178.0	hrhxmh4	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhpewn	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhxmh4/

exa0uq8q	You always insist to act as if you're super smart do you?  The Lindisfarne context is not idiotic ranting. It is perfectly correct. Europeans did not loot St. Catherine's monastery like the Vikings did at Lindisfarne.  Plundering implies violently robbing or stealing something. You could've said "duplicitously acquiring" or "taking and not returning" and have been correct.  You make it seems as if Europeans are Vikings in some ways or another. Or suggesting the conquest and Islamization of Egypt wasn't a more adequate definition of a violent political acquisition which could be described as plunder. Whether this is of course the case is beside the point. It would be a better descriptor.  Conversely, I can't imagine how many artefacts were plundered by Muslims or how many churches were turned into mosques or how many converts were scored through abusive practices. Not saying that this is unique to Islam mind you.	1641482183.0	hri04vz	t3_rwk70p	t1_hrh1sjf	/r/arabs/comments/rwk70p/lost_languages_discovered_in_one_of_the_worlds/hri04vz/

1otjig3y	It costs less to export it then refine most of it at home.  You know that right? You're asking them to export refined product thats worth less? That's the whole point in why ADNOC Aramco and such invest in methods to extract cheaper cleaner oil, to lower the price of production to sell.  Refining is important if you're selling to local markets or regional, like Saudi has Ras Tanura that mainly feeds products around ME and europe but it's more profitable to refine them in India/Pakistan ror the Chinese/Japan market.  Yes you should, which isn't such a huge say in how oil revenue is managed, some countries here can't even scale half their development to their production if you're going to ratio them with the UAE.  You clearly don't know much about oil esp when you think refining them is a smart movie as a producer	1641482471.0	hri0v13	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhzbbl	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hri0v13/

The absolute dripping butthurt you must be feeling to even bring this up out of context in a post about Europeans thieving historical artefacts from Egypt is just mind blowing. Are you crying right now? Are you sobbing into a pair of panties? Gargantuan levels of coping in here, wow  And I can't think of a more idiotic take than trying to argue about historical artefacts plundered from the Middle East during the colonial period. It shows some enormous levels of ignorance that it's unbelievable. Fucking France literally invaded Egypt to plunder its artefacts. The Rosetta stone is in London solely because the Brits captured a French ship full of goods they had very literally plundered from Egypt. Invading a country and making away with its historical artefacts is the definition of plunder. The Brits and French even stole ruins from Leptis Magna and then rebuilt them in London to look like authentic Roman ruins. Then some butthurt little weasel wants to correct my terminology to "duplicitously acquired". There are more Egyptian obelisks in Europe than in Egypt. See if you can guess how many of those were gifted or sold and how many simply stolen. Fucking duplicitously acquired!

65330	OP, I think you’re a good person. You come across as very young and naive, and that’s okay. Everyone starts somewhere. Perhaps you grew up in the kind of Muslim household that leads you to hate everything about your faith and your people. So long as you recognize that perhaps the error is in the way you were taught Islam, you may one day be open to recognizing that your issues aren’t with the religion, but within yourself. I have many friends that I’ve brought back to the religion just by explaining to them Islam as it was meant to be taught. I suggest you find what you specifically dislike about Islam and study it. You may come to a place of understanding and a renaissance where your eyes open. Or you may not. Both are possible, but at least worst case scenario, you walk away with an even stronger conviction. That aside:  More or less, everyone is telling you the same thing. It’s unlikely that *everyone* is wrong except you. Everything you described can be done islamically. I, too, want an educated wife and no kids. I, too, want to travel with said wife and explore the beauties of life together. And what is a feminist, anyway, these days? Most of the time, husbands and wives do the same work for each other under the same household. I have a good friend and brother of mine, a Syrian, who is married to an African Muslim woman. He helps wash the dishes, watch the kids, and so on. His wife is in her PhD program and he is finishing his Masters; educated, sophisticated Muslim family. Is that what you mean by feminism? If so, then congratulations, you’ll find it almost everywhere even amongst Arab men. But if by feminism you mean the Western flavor, what’s the appeal? Westerners themselves are marrying more and more Latinas, Africans, and Asian women that prescribe to more traditional roles than their own compatriots. Believe me, it isn’t as “rosy” as you may think it is.  Besides that, everything you want can be done within the bounds of good taste. Will I be okay with my wife not wearing the hijab? It’s her choice. Will I be okay with her being half naked on the beach? Hell no. Do I want my future wife educated and sophisticated? That’s a requirement. Will we be bound by cultural norms and values? Yeah, as is every relationship. Arabism is one of the most beautiful cultures there are. But that isn’t synonymous with whatever you’re describing. Ironically enough, you’re glamorizing Western culture when they tend to have significant domestic abuse, alcoholism, incredibly stupid gender roles, and so many other traits that you seem to prescribe to your own people.  Anyways, this was a long post. My point is to relax, ya OP, oo تهدي بل رحمٰن. You think you’re open minded but you really aren’t. Be more open minded and learn to listen and inshallah you’ll find what you’re looking for.  Allah oo Mo7ammed oo Ali wiyach.  My point is: relax و صلي على النبي و آل النبي. What you’re seeking can be found but only if you’re reasonable.	1641525494.0	hrl5fko	t3_rwwsim	t3_rwwsim	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrl5fko/

8g2fp9gl	I didn't say that. Obviously it would be nice if there was a heaven, but that doesn't make your purpose in life any more "meaningful". It is still something imposed in you. It is like someone forced you to play a dangerous game and told you if you win i will give you cake everyday. Obviously cake is nice, but i would rather not play at all or play a game i chose.  On the other hand, you don't feel anything when dead; you're dead. You live life, choose your own purpose, and try to enjoy it and then that's it.	1641561423.0	hrmrv87	t3_rx0pr1	t1_hrkewyp	/r/arabs/comments/rx0pr1/درر_المخارج_في_العامي_والدارج_نقاش_حر_بالعربي/hrmrv87/

I met my now husband online, and he's my support and my best friend.  I want to say that your post does come across as angry and a bit condescending. And whereas I understand where the anger comes from, it's better to try and address it. What you're asking for in a partner is actually very reasonable, don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but maybe it's the delivery. Don't lose hope, don't settle. We live in a patriarchal society, but Arab men who see their wives as partners and not property do exit. I wish I had advice to give, as I used to live in an Arab country and know how hard it is. But maybe your best bet is to explore your options online.	1641599777.0	hrpk4f9	t3_rwwsim	t3_rwwsim	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrpk4f9/

You might not escape this Arabo-consnervative atmosphere that you find so nauseating because Ayrabs are everywhere, but you can practice  your freedoms more openly and easily. I am the opposite of you, a conservative traditionalist, but I can never deny the level of dysfunction  that our societies suffer from. It is bad for liberals and conservatives alike. Just *Get Out* of there and you'll definitely find that someone. I personally think Palestinians in general are much more liberal than most other Arab countries.	1641624112.0	hrqz02y	t3_rwwsim	t1_hrphvz2	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrqz02y/

Other common annoying translation mistakes include misgendering words, messing up the maaany plural forms, phrasing that is pointlessly long because the translator is "thinking in English" and lacks the right vocabulary (ex: الكمبيوتر الخاص بك vs حاسوبك).	1641634255.0	hrrcodj	t3_ryvw0v	t3_ryvw0v	/r/arabs/comments/ryvw0v/a_questionnaire_for_arabian_gamers_about/hrrcodj/

9k3699ws	He’s possibly referring to their ethnic phenotype or whatever. I think he does at one point show the whole Arab world with Middle East and North Africa as all assimilated into Arab identity. He says how South Arabians aren’t “ethnically Arab” as in they’re originally something else like Egyptians, Sudanis and Maghrebis. But I do get what you’re saying.   The thing is ethnic identity has to do with language and culture. What people like his channel are looking at is science like genetics, which can help explain identity, but isn’t the basis for it. Separating people based on genetics is pretty stupid. But people like to look at genetics and human migrations because I guess it’s a fun though experiment.	1641965133.0	hsbahpu	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsb6oup	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsbahpu/

3j3dj	Oh my god so much of this video is just confidently expressed conjecture and nonsense. Haplogroup J doesn't originate in the Arabian peninsula. It originates in the Caucasus or Eastern Anatolia. Some put it as far south as Mesopotamia. There are no adequate studies of South Arabians or Yemenis or Omanis that would allow us to confidently claim anything, especially that 80% of Modern South Arabians belong to J. Then he makes confident claims about the phenotypes of South Arabians as if he has visited southern Yemen himself or as if there's a phenotype database somewhere. He also claims they share "slim noses" like their neighbouring Arabs. Ok? Having been to Oman, I can tell you that lots of Arabs do not have "slim noses". At 7:00 he shows a photo of a typical South Arabian looking guy who is neither dark nor has a slim nose. This is garbage pseudoscience. It's like you can say any outdated nonsense you want if you add the word "phenotype" to it.  And where is he getting this claim that Mehris don't have African admixture like other Yemenis? Who has published these studies? I literally just saw [a Mehri guy online](https://twitter.com/AlmehriAman/status/1478120131209441280?t=A5ZWAbNlD9AoBFyVv9W_ug&s=19) who is not J and is mostly East African. Nearly all of his sources are blogs, not actual studies. He only cites 1 study. It's about Soqotra and is from 2009, a millennium in the timeframe of genetic studies. What's funny is that that study found Qataris, Omanis, Emaratis to be closer to Egyptians, Lebanese, and Tunisians, than to Soqotris. Nevertheless people insist on using Modern South Arabians as a sample for "pure" Arabian peninsula genetics.	1641977152.0	hsbryf1	t3_s1wnaj	t3_s1wnaj	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsbryf1/

However, there is a phenotype specific to South Arabians just as there is to Egyptians, Maghrebis, Mesopotamians, etc. The thing is there’s a big niche on anthropology of people who like to examine genotypes for some weird reason. I prefer to read up history. Historically, this region spoke many South Semitic languages until today. Much of them are not appreciated and unfortunately are dying. Genotypes are a weird obsession online.

cu0szb3y	The vast majority of the Mahra don’t have Bantu or Horner ancestry.They are the purest population in Southern Arabia at this moment especially when it compared to the Arabic speaking Yemenis and obviously the heavily Bantu admixed Omanis  They are just darker on average then other Arabians but that doesn’t mean anything as skin tone has little to do with how much West Eurasian a population carries.Look at the Maghrebis who are way more African shifted then Arabians with 20% West African & ANA ancestry yet are much lighter in complexion on average.  Also the Mahra have lower Anatolian Farmer ancestry compared to Yemeni groups like the Yemenite Jews,folks from Amran etc.They are far more Natufian/Arabian hunter-gatherer rich	1642010386.0	hsdk6vq	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsbryf1	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsdk6vq/

3j3dj	> However, there is a phenotype specific to South Arabians just as there is to Egyptians, Maghrebis, Mesopotamians, etc.  There's no phenotype specific to South Arabians or for any population. Where have you ever read a scientific paper published on facial phenotypes in countries? There are a thousand phenotypes in every country. It's not a science, it's like 18th century skull measuring. There is an enormously broad range of phenotypes within any Arab country.

3j3dj	What are your sources for these claims? Aren't you the person who was just telling me last week that you use Mehris as a proxy population for the Arabian peninsula? The sources in the video above specifically identify them (or rather Soqotris) as outlier populations compared to other khaleejis. Even their y-haplogroup, basal J*, has never been found in the GCC. The study cited in the video specifically says: "Since this lineage was not found by Cadenas et al. (2008) in the Arabian Peninsula, this raises the possibility of an earlier input for these lineages or more probably very strong genetic drift of a low frequency Arabian lineage in the Y-chromosome gene pool of Soqotra."   So why the hell would you use them as representatives of khaleejis??  Yemenis and Omanis are among the most admixed populations in the Middle East with Africans. So it stands to reason that Mehris are also mixed. "Purest" is a nonsense term. It's not a scientific term. Yemenis in general actually have more sub-Saharan African Mtdna lineages [than any other Arab country](blob:null/88e00ccd-1a8e-4c02-941c-f21ca93f33d0). More than double that of Morocco. (Although these are all highly spurious data since there are no decent or recent studies of Yemen to begin with). Hadhramaut is infamous for having 60% of all its Mtdna lineages be sub-saharan African, and Hadhramaut is in eastern Yemen near the Mehri homeland. According to wikipedia, the sub-saharan macro-haplogroup L subclades make up 21.5% of all Mehri mtdna lineages. That means they are just as mixed with Africans as any other Arabs.	1642015286.0	hsdxbzz	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsdk6vq	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsdxbzz/

Every single academic source states that Arabs settled most heavily along the coast of North Africa. You think they only settled the Sahara desert before you don't read anything and base everything on childish stereotypes.

Not J1. Do you even understand what that means? It wasn't found anywhere else in the Arabian peninsula. We're not talking about a subclade you moron.   You are in here arguing that the Mehris are autosomally the "purest" people in the Arabian peninsula, and therefore representative of them all, when their paternal lineages are completely distinct from the rest of the Arabian peninsula and a quarter of their maternal lineages are sub-Saharan African.	1642022527.0	hsegq98	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsdz8x8	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsegq98/

ovqdzum	That's why Rumi said don't escape but face them. Sit with them, you'll realise it's only in your head, once you see that then you are free from them. That's why I. Tasawuf there is this thing called muragaba which is watching the thoughts and going within yourself to understand why you have these desires or fears. If you wait for someone to make you happy then you are relying on others to help you escape your thoughts temporarily, but you'll soon realise no matter how many people are around you, you are essential alone on this path called life, that's why when things get hard not many people stick around to help.you out. It's good to have friend and people to love yes, but you have to know that Allah gave you the power to decide to be happy or sad, it's all up to you and no one else. Look withing.

9k3699ws	No. He had no other choice. Kuwait could have worked with Saddam to settle their debt that Iraq took on to fight Iran sacrificing hundreds of thousands saving Kuwait as well in the process. But no, the Kuwaiti royal family were snobs and expected Iraq who literally sacrificed everything fighting Iran to pay back in full and on top of that over producing the oil keeping the price low screwing Iraq over in process AND refusing to renegotiate the border issue that Iraq wanted settled. You living in the west or probably some pampered life wouldn’t know about struggle, so your naive comment doesn’t surprise me. So no, Saddam’s actions on Kuwait was inevitable. And funny enough, all the debt Kuwait could have forgiven Saddam for, Kuwait paid double to the Americans to save them. 👍	1642148425.0	hsls767	t3_s35aq9	t1_hslr6m0	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsls767/

Colonial/postcolonial countries all across MENA leaned towards the USSR or nonaligment for ideological reasons (except for the various monarchies, which had already been bought by the west); regardless of America's recognition in 1948, Israel, as a colony in need of an imperial backer, would've always been a natural american ally once the cold war intensified.	1642156467.0	hsm2ldp	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsjmz62	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsm2ldp/

f6avfqpv	I don't really agree.   The United States was the first country to recognize Israel after it declared its independence. The first country to do so was actually the USSR. At the time, Stalin felt that Israel would be a "natural" ally of the USSR because the vast majority of Israel's early elite political leaders subscribed to the ideology of Labor Zionism, which was a form of Zionism fused with socialist economic beliefs. Israel did not have a PM who did not belong to the Labor Party until the late 1970s, 30 years into the country's existence. On top of that, Stalin believed that many European Ashkenazi Jews would be grateful towards the USSR for stopping the Holocaust.   What really brought Israel and the US together, IMO, was Israel's relationship with the UK and France, who were America's key Cold War allies. And what brought Israel together with the UK and France was Nasser.	1642160390.0	hsm7xvu	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsm2ldp	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsm7xvu/
9muiw	>What really brought Israel and the US together, IMO, was Israel's relationship with the UK and France, who were America's key Cold War allies. And what brought Israel together with the UK and France was Nasser.  Yes, Cold War politics. This is the part that's inevitable - and the fact that the USSR was even quicker to support Israel, and many Israeli politicians had ties to european socialist movements, and yet Israel STILL fell into America's orbit, is exactly proof of what I'm saying. "Labor Zionism" was impossible, because social classes reorganized, and split between colonist and colonized(same thing happened in French Algeria btw; commies/anarchists who wind up exiled there more often than not became settler activists, and the french communists were loathe to admit algerian members). Further, the "internationalist" sentiment of arab nationalism/anticolonialism, and the natural distrust of the west shared by all colonized peoples, means the "Second World," and especially the "Third World" blocs were much more attractive to the people of MENA than the "First World." The dynamics are totally reverse in Israel, whose status as a settler colony puts it directly at odds with the USSR's/the Third World Movement's professed egalitarianism/internationalism.     Essentially, the "Third World" demanded wealth and land redistribution after colonialism; Israel and the US share a goal of stopping that redistribution, and the USSR (regardless of actual ideological convictions of the party/its leaders) stood to gain by supporting those demands. The mechanics of history and the nature of US and Israeli society drove them together more than any one discrete event, especially a discrete event post WWII.	1642162432.0	hsmb25n	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsm7xvu	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmb25n/
f6avfqpv	But that's not actually how it happened in practice. In reality it was balance-of-power politics during the Cold War, not ideology, that resulted in Israel being within the American orbit.  The stuff about settler colonialism and so forth is really just importing the way the conflict is framed now onto events that occurred 50+ years ago, when it was not described in those terms.	1642163197.0	hsmcbf8	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmb25n	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmcbf8/
9muiw	>But that's not actually how it happened in practice. In reality it was balance-of-power politics during the Cold War, not ideology, that resulted in Israel being within the American orbit.  That's what I'm saying to you. Whether George Marshall or Truman believe X or Y is irrelevant, even if it changes some discrete political event, because America and Israel shared concrete interests, which would inevitably bring them together, regardless of "Labor Zionism," the result of a given US election, etc. "The stuff about settler colonialism and so forth" is me explaining the interests they shared (which weren't totally unknown at the time; the General Jewish Labor Bund was a socialist organization that was also anti-Zionist, and anti-imperialist language was common among some leftists at the time, from Luxemburg, to Lenin, even to James Connolly in Ireland), and why these interest go deeper than the professed ideologies of particular politicians.	1642164134.0	hsmdwli	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmcbf8	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmdwli/
f6avfqpv	"Settler colonialism" is a parallel about the histories of the two countries, it is not a concrete geopolitical interest. And by 1948, virtually no Americans thought of the United States as a "settler colony" in any meaningful sense. They'd have said "well, that was true on the Western Frontier in the 1860s but that's about as relevant to today as the age of powdered wigs and pantaloons." Nor did any American political leader believe that their job was to "maintain settler colonialism" in the United States. It makes no sense to say that the US "shared an interest" with Israel in this sense.   In reality, much more influential politically were (a) the fact that Nasser sought support from the USSR, because the USSR was an adversary of Britain when Britain was Egypt's chief geopolitical foe due to the Suez issue, and (b) the influence of the organized Zionist lobby in the United States, which President Eisenhower and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, repeatedly stated acted against the best interests of the United States.	1642165621.0	hsmgldj	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmdwli	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmgldj/

9muiw	I called israel a settler colony, and said it shared interests with the US in arresting any more equitable distribution of land/wealth among the colonized/ex colonized people of the world. All the talk about whether the US is/was also a settler colony, what americans think of colonies, etc you invented on your own, bit freudian there my friend    >much more influential politically were (a) the fact that Nasser sought support from the USSR, because the USSR was an adversary of Britain when Britain was Egypt's chief geopolitical foe due to the Suez issue, and (b) the influence of the organized Zionist lobby in the United States    A is explained by Egypt's postcolonial status, and B, by the shared interest I mentioned last paragraph. I also don't think The Israel Lobby acts against America's interest, I think that's a way to shift the blame onto Israel (and, imo, jews). We can see how America reacted to other postcolonial, vaguely leftist countries and leaders for proof - it wasn't the Israel Lobby that got us to back a military coup and mass killing of Communists in Indonesia or Chile, for example, lol.	1642167864.0	hsml62z	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmgldj	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsml62z/

That's up to u in the end, but I think you know that there is profanity filters even for WORDS in many online games so we should label the devs as Muslims? Dude stop with this mentality.  Kids play as well and not every parents accept that his 12 yo kid sees a naked man/woman or wants to see blood or other things that's why you got age ratings for video games and filters in place to even turn off blood.

9k3699ws	Who said Kuwait should not be paid? You keep resorting to things I never said lol. Explain to me how is it fair for a county whose ass is saved by another country expect the other country to repay the money while at the same time keeping the price of oil down which is the main source of income? And where did I mention that Kuwait should be invaded? Those borders are disputed. Kuwait will remain. I can clearly tell who you are just by your lack of understanding of the whole geopolitical situation. You think of this as giving your friend lunch money and expecting it back. No. That’s not the same. Iraq lost 500,000 soldiers and a hurt economy while fighting a war Kuwait was desperate Iraq would win. Now that Iraq guaranteed their safety, Kuwait overproduces the oil and doesn’t engage to solve the issue? Clearly I mentioned that Saddam should not have taken the whole Kuwait. That’s dumb. The border region was reasonable because that was already in dispute and Saddam exhausted EVERYTHING to bring the Kuwaitis to the table and they refused. Like I said, this isn’t lunch money you give to your friend and expect them to pay it back.

1tbtx4f7	I can understand your idea that Kuwait has a duty to help Iraq after the war as the war helped Kuwait but I don't agree as the war would have happened either way as the main reason was that Iran was a huge threat to Iraq, so Kuwait being safe from Iran wasn't a main reason for the war so Kuwait doesn't have a responsibility to help Iraq after the war. If you could prove that the war wouldn't have happened without Kuwait then I would agree with you.

9k3699ws	Nobody has any responsibility to help anyone. Everyone has self interest. But if your interest is to strengthen the Arab nation as an Arab against regional rivals, then engaging with a reasonable plan to solve the debt issue with an Arab neighbor who sacrificed so much against that regional rival (Iran) so you wouldn’t be surrounded by them. Then you ask:   > so Kuwait being safe from Iran wasn't a main reason for the war so Kuwait doesn't have a responsibility to help Iraq after the war.   Iran was destroying Kuwaiti oil tankers. If Iraq lost the war, Kuwait would have a border with Iran if not be surrounded by them. If Kuwait was so safe, why was Kuwaiti government so scared? You seriously know little on this topic it seems.  > If you could prove that the war wouldn't have happened without Kuwait then I would agree with you. Also you’re poor  If only Saddam let Iran take Kuwait and see how you would like that situation. Lol. “You’re poor.” I knew you’re pampered. Once the oil price goes down, you’re irrelevant.

7lrof8uq	Don't know where you got your info from but your info about Oujda is completely wrong. The dialect is not the same as even Tlemcen. Only the dialect spoken in Maghnia, cause it was Moroccan, sounds like Oujdi. And culturally it's not a continuation of western Algeria. Even though Amazigh is not widely spoken there, the culture there is the same as in Berkane. You could call it eastern rifian. Only difference is that there are more arab tribes around Oujda.	1642370130.0	hsyepwo	t3_s5arma	t1_hswlsnb	/r/arabs/comments/s5arma/موسيقى_المغرب_الأقصى_حسب_المناطق_لائحة_غير_حصرية/hsyepwo/

29kuoigx	لمّا كان الهدف من هذا العرض القيم تقديم ابرز القادة المسلمين من العرب دون سواهم ربما كان من الضروري توضيح انّ موسى بن نصير لم يفتح الأندلس بوصفه قائدا عسكريا ميدانيا وإنما كحاكم على أفريقية مقيم في مدينة القيروان  أما القائد العسكري الذي فتح تلك الربوع الأندلسية فهو طارق بن زياد المنحدر من قبيلة وفرجومة البربرية. ولم يحط موسى بن نصير الرحال على إسبانيا الاّ حين تأكد مما حققه طارق من نصر وكسبه الفاتحون من غنائم.  وقدخلّد المؤرخون تلك القصة الشهيرة التي تثبت انّ بن زياد هو القائد العسكري الفاتح للأندلس ؛ ومفادها انّ طاولة سيدنا سليمان كانت ضمن الغنائم النفيسة التي أهداها موسى إلى الخليفة الأموي الذي لم يمنعه جمالها من الاستفسار عن سبب  ضياع احد أرجلها الأربعة؛ فعجز بن نصير  على شرح السبب فيما اعترف طارق انه المسؤول على خلعها وإخفائها كدليل يقدمه إلى امير المؤمنين على انه الفاتح الحقيقي للاندلس وانّ موسى بن نصير وصل في وقت لاحق لكنه سعى إلى التضليل ليغنم بالشهرة .  وقد ادى كشف هذه الحقيقة إلى مزيد سخط الخليفة على موسى بعد ان كان تحامل عليه في وقت سابق لعدم انضباطه لأوامر سرية كان أسداها له اثناء رحلته من الأندلس نحو الشام فعزله من منصبه على أفريقية وما لبث الاّ أن أعدمه.	1642397521.0	ht05z3h	t3_s4ikjn	t3_s4ikjn	/r/arabs/comments/s4ikjn/بعض_من_أعظم_القادة_العرب_في_العصر_الإسلامي/ht05z3h/
kbbvo	I wouldn't say your face looks feminine, you just look rather boyish and "adolescenty." It might also help to think more about grooming and styling. The beard helps to masculinize your face, but it's also scruffy and thin in some spots so growing it out makes your face look messy. Having a well groomed and styled face can help you look more mature and masculine. I think you look best in pictures 8 and 10. Your beard is short but it helps to make your face pop and gives some more definition to your face.	1642399635.0	ht09m7g	t3_s5pgh0	t1_hszef9c	/r/arabs/comments/s5pgh0/monday_majlis_open_discussion/ht09m7g/

3j3dj	One of the things making me lose my faith in humanity is following Arab groups on social media that are interested in genetics. It's non-stop shit fest 24/7. Even the accounts themselves can see it. Check out [this meme](https://twitter.com/Archeoanthropo/status/1482348819220160518?s=20).   You have these massive arguments about who is really Qahtani and who is a dirty immigrant. You have groups dedicated to specific tribes banning people and shaming them for belonging to different paternal branches and then trying to find out "the original" branch of that tribe. You have others [building family trees based on  y-dna](https://www.facebook.com/groups/genomena/posts/1252287371848974/). All these ppl [accusing each other](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJLJO2uWYAEsBLM?format=jpg&name=large) of being Zagros Iranians or Afro-Abyssinian-Berbers don't have the required historical context to understand that these are haplogroups that emerged 20 to 40 *thousand* years ago. Then you get tweets that [literay say](https://twitter.com/ArabEM35/status/1482444501499138051?s=20):  في الاخير "E" المنتصر   The thing is that 99.9% of these people do not understand that autosomal results only pertain to less than 10 generations back. Some Jordanian guy msged me because i left a comment somewhere, and i told him i think his haplogroup is from southern Europe, and he got furious with me and sent me an image of his autosomal results.

8eqky01c	Operation Wealth had a successful first year. I clocked in 2,900 hours last year at my job for a gross total of 261k. (Commission Job). Worked essentially 7 days a week. And this was done with me legitimately starting my role in March. So 2 months weren’t fully at play. I still ended 5th out of 2,000 people in my region. And that includes all the vets that have been there for years.   I made way more $$ than I had anticipated. I have 120k in liquid cash. The next steps of the operation is to get into real estate. Apartment buildings specifically for now.   But first I put an offer on a home friday that is a triplex (3-unit home). The home got appraised for 350k and I offered 275k, just waiting to hear back today. Reason this is important is because I don’t plan on being stuck on the small side of real estate forever. A lot of guys buy 1-4 unit homes one at a time before finally moving to apartments after a decade. Reason this triplex im buying is key, is because it’s actually giving me access to more capital I can tap into. I can open a line of credit against the home for 50k+ because of the fact the home appraised for 350k and has built in equity. Also, I’m only putting 3.5% down, so only 10k of my reserves is being used. Reason I don’t need to put the normal 20-25% down is because any property that is 1-4 units can be qualified under a primary home loan if you plan to live there. So its a way to get the benefit of an investment property without putting the 20% down payment. 2 tenants already live there as well, and they will cover the mortgage. Living for free. Anyone can do this, but 99.9% won’t because you are trading comfortability for profitability.   So, the plan is buy that home. Get a line of credit for as much as I can. Take my cash reserves and put it into a crypto bank that can collect 10% APY. Cash in a traditional savings account is a waste. And finally im going to keep printing as much capital as possible at my job, while actively setting time aside to search for apartment deals. Which I already began.   I’m doing it yall. I will reach my goal.	1642451252.0	ht2zypo	t3_s5pgh0	t3_s5pgh0	/r/arabs/comments/s5pgh0/monday_majlis_open_discussion/ht2zypo/

Why does [حسين عبد الله](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFq4pOuTiZmfJyCxaYTT3Hg) make Arabic content on YouTube when Vsauce or Wikipedia articles are enough? Why do you post on r/syriancivilwar when the more general r/arabs sub covers all Arab countries including Syria?  I've seen your other comments here. You're not stupid. Stop pretending to be stupid on this issue. You and I both know how and why they're forming such Discord server community. Instead of acting confused, just say you don't like it.	1642464661.0	ht3xam4	t3_s67flh	t1_ht3q46o	/r/arabs/comments/s67flh/discord_server_for_arab_vegans/ht3xam4/

19pfx66a	What's the problem ? There are indeed eminent Arab actors like Ghassen Massoud, Aysha Hart, Lamis Ammar and Sami Bouajila and the story seems to be good and it's really cool that they picked an Arab country as their filming location.  OP reminds of those Greeks who disliked 300 just because it wasn't filmed in Greece even though the movie paints Greeks as the ultimate heroes who are fighting humanoid demons and "a thousand nations descend upon them".  I hope the movie turns out to be a great international movie because it'll help to destroy the wrong stereotypes about Arabs and gives a new, better image and spreads the Arab culture to the world.	1642491078.0	ht5fwsb	t3_s6jlbk	t3_s6jlbk	/r/arabs/comments/s6jlbk/hollywood_and_saudi_arabia_teaming_up_to_produce/ht5fwsb/

z7om4	> It’s 7th century, when Arabia is made up of rival, feuding tribes, disunited and forever at each other’s throats. Emperor Kisra (Kingsley) has a fearsome reputation for being utterly ruthless. But when the Arabian Princess Hind (Hart) refuses to become the emperor’s concubine, the stage is set for an epic confrontation. It is a battle that, by its conclusion, will have changed the region forever and echo throughout history. Escaping with her father, King Numan (Massoud) into the vast and unforgiving desert, Hind is pursued by Kisra’s seasoned mercenary Jalabzeen and his bloodthirsty troops.   Wth? Lol this is the most orientalist plot possible. "Middle Eastern man doesn't take no for an answer, starts war specifically to rape this one chick".  Are the Saudis in it because Kisra is Iranian?

I'm much less likely to play a video game with overly sexualised female characters though. It's not even sex itself that bothers me, it's the girls dressed like a porn version of their own character.

o484e	Or one movie where the Arabs are shown as human. The only movie that was close to showing the good side of Arabs in the 21st century is Kingdom of Heaven, but even then, the idea of showing Sallahudeen in a film was already being done by director Moustapha Akkad who unfortunately was killed before getting to make it.  Besides that, Arabs are always shown as the antagonists, the servants or at most portrayed in an unflattering light. And today, they technically don't exist in Hollywood despite the Zionists preaching 'diversity'.	1642527372.0	ht7a6g7	t3_s6jlbk	t1_ht64hhl	/r/arabs/comments/s6jlbk/hollywood_and_saudi_arabia_teaming_up_to_produce/ht7a6g7/

China was devided by warlords, fashist regimes, colonised by Japan and the west, and Mao lead an army of peasants and win both the civil war and the Japanese. He is was a true liberator, and a genius.  Most of chinese, these days, think he did some mistakes, wasn't good at management, but no one denies he was the founder of modern China.

Arabs have neglected the importance of our art and culture for so long. The thing that still pisses me off is how dogshit our television shows are and our non existstant movies.   Now we're moving to an era where western companies will come in to fill the void and portray us in a light that isn't very accurate or favourable but because they make it (in terms of cinematography, editing, etc) better than us and have and have a much better distribution they wills shape our popular culture in the decades to come.	1642532800.0	ht7ozia	t3_s6tgrb	t3_s6tgrb	/r/arabs/comments/s6tgrb/ختام_مقال_لغسان_كنفاني_بعنوان_إنقاذا_لكرامتنا/ht7ozia/

z7om4	>But these stories are famous in Arabia and Saudi, I'm surprised they didn't do dhi qar. If they wanted to do some anti Persian propaganda  Huh, if they make the whole movie about Nu3man's life I think I'll enjoy it a lot. Especially the friends to enemies part. I **adore** that trope. But choosing to center it around taking a woman by force .... is certainly a *choice.* And not like your average racist American, who can't point Saudi on a map, or tell it apart from Iran, will make that difference.

z7om4	Lmao life expectancy under his rule literally doubled. By the time the Brits and Japanese were gone Chinese life expectancy was *35 years.*  China alone was 1/4 of humanity on just 10% of the world's arable land with frequent droughts, and infrastructure that fell into disrepair under colonial rule. They had only one last famine in the early days post-revolution. Compared to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines_in_China)  >Between 108 BC and 1911 AD, there were no fewer than 1,828 recorded famines in China, or once nearly every year in one province or another. The famines varied in severity.\[1\]\[2\] China has endured six of the world's top ten deadliest natural disasters, including the top three  Imagine a famine literally every year for the last 2,000 years (the USSR was very similar) and it's the last one in it's history that you blame. Arabs are not allowed to regurgitate imperialist propaganda. Not after the lies on Iraq and Palestine.  If china got sykes-Pico'ed like Western countries **wanted and already planned** into 20 starving countries all the time, we'd be taking it for granted that "it's just like that" and they're doomed to starve, the way we think of Africa today.	1642541945.0	ht8dwoc	t3_s6tgrb	t1_ht6705q	/r/arabs/comments/s6tgrb/ختام_مقال_لغسان_كنفاني_بعنوان_إنقاذا_لكرامتنا/ht8dwoc/

Lebanese producers have also put out some very good film/TV. Not to mention some quality shows from the 5aleej.   There many, many new independent Arab artists that are pumping out innovative & authentic music of all genres, only now starting to get exposure.  There is soo much potential and the state of our entertainment industry is inadequate at best, but I feel like you’re being somewhat unfair. We just need more deliberate, coordinated efforts on local, regional, and Arab World levels.  The Mao comparison certainly does not foster a sensible discussion.

236n78qc	Baswd on my experience in the witcher wild hunt, just cause 3 and far cry 5 I think the following will lead to optimal translation:  First: use fusha always, im as an egyptian read newspapers, books and websites in fusha as the dilect in egypt itself differs from place to place.  Second: never translate from the english script, niether translate the words or expressions them selves, you must reproduce the script in the arabic culture. You should read arab literature to achieve this,  people like nageeb mahfouz, mahmoud darwish,  nizar qbbani and abou alqasem elshabi.

3j3dj	As a rule, these articles are always confused about the issue of bedouins.  "these roads would have led Bedouin people and their animals to water"  Then 2 paragraphs later:  "The sheer number of Bronze Age tombs built around them suggests that populations had already begun to settle more permanently in these favorable locations at this time."  Yes, because these were settled people living around oases.  "By bouncing from one oasis or desert spring to another, ancient Bedouins could traverse much larger areas in search for better lands and climates"  Again: these are people trading with one another, conquering one another. Like any other place on earth. They're not "bedouins". Many of these burials won't even be the ancestors of modern Arabians. Humans were crossing through Arabia and into Arabia throughout this period, and like most other places on earth, Arabia saw an enormous demographic revolution in the Bronze Age. If these burials are "prehistoric" then most will be earlier than the domestication of the camel.	1642597250.0	htb9edy	t3_s7cuap	t3_s7cuap	/r/arabs/comments/s7cuap/spectacular_lost_highways_of_ancient_arabia/htb9edy/

g12rh7	English article from the nytimes:  The Syrian doctor tortured detainees — opponents of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad — by beating them with sticks and kicking them, and even set one on fire, German prosecutors say. In one instance, they allege, he killed a prisoner with a lethal injection. The accusations against Dr. Alaa Mousa — at least 18 charges of torture and one of murder committed between April 2011 and the end of the 2012 — amount to crimes against humanity, German prosecutors will seek to prove in Dr. Mousa’s long-awaited trial, which began on Wednesday in Frankfurt. The proceedings started less than a week after German prosecutors won a guilty verdict in the world’s first trial prosecuting state-sponsored torture in Syria. Dr. Mousa, is accused targeting Assad opponents in military facilities. According to one charge, he doused the testicles of a teenage boy with alcohol and set him ablaze in a military hospital in the summer of 2011.  With this and other cases, Germany has emerged at the forefront of prosecutions against Syrian government officials.  In the case that ended last Thursday, a former intelligence officer was convicted in Koblenz, Germany, of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison — a verdict welcomed by human rights lawyers as a milestone in the search for accountability for war crimes in Syria. Dr. Mousa was not in as high a position of power as the intelligence officer, Anwar Raslan, who oversaw the torture of prisoners in a detention center. But indictment for his alleged role in Syrian military facilities was “a clear signal that Germany takes this fight against impunity very seriously and it will continue to commit itself to the international criminal justice system,” said Stefanie Bock, the director of the International Research and Documentation Center for War Crimes Trials at the University of Marburg in Germany. It demonstrated, she added, that last week’s verdict was not a “once-in-a-lifetime event.”  Image  Credit...Constantn Zinn/EPA, via Shutterstock  The trial of Dr. Mousa is expected to shed further light on abuses committed by the Syrian government during the ongoing conflict, and on mistreatment in the medical system, said Roger Lu Phillips, the legal director of the Syria Justice & Accountability Center in Washington D.C., which interviewed several witnesses involved in the case.  “In Koblenz, we saw glimpses of the mistreatment of the Syrian government within the hospital system,” said Mr. Phillips, adding that this case would offer more insights into such abuses. The challenge for German prosecutors, Mr. Phillips said, was that they would have to prove Dr. Mousa was acting under the direction or orders of the Syrian government for the accusations to be considered crimes against humanity. If convicted, Ms. Bock said, it was “almost mandatory” that Dr. Mousa would receive a life sentence. An assistant doctor who served in military facilities in Damascus, Syria’s capital, and the central city of Homs, Dr. Mousa stands accused of kicking and punching detainees in the head, torso and groin, and operating on someone without sufficient anesthetic. After one prisoner in Homs protested against a beating, prosecutors say, Dr. Mousa restrained the man and injected him with a substance that killed him. Dr. Mousa left Syria in 2015, alongside about a million other refugees who crossed into Europe, and settled in Germany, where he worked in a hospital in the city of Kassel. He was arrested in June 2020 after other Syrian refugees who recognized him reported him to the authorities. “This is quite shocking: the idea that someone who might have committed heinous torture has practiced as a doctor in a German setting,” said Ms. Bock. For many in Germany, the case of Dr. Mousa conjured memories of the Nazi regime, when doctors worked in concentration camps as part of the torture and genocide machinery. Initially, the Frankfurt higher regional court only accepted some of the charges. After federal prosecutors appealed to Germany’s Federal Court of Justice, that court ruled on Tuesday that all charges included in the initial indictment would be heard.  Human rights lawyers have begun seeking justice for victims of the Syrian government through the legal concept of “universal jurisdiction,” which holds that any nation’s courts can try people for grave atrocities committed anywhere. In the absence of avenues through the International Criminal Court in The Hague or a special war tribunal established by the United Nations, universal jurisdiction cases offer “a last bastion of justice” for many Syrian victims, Mr. Phillips said. Rights groups say that prosecuting less prominent offenders like Dr. Mousa is crucial in identifying witnesses and building an evidentiary record that might some day be used against higher-ranking officials. But prosecuting a case in Germany for acts committed against Syrians by other Syrians presents difficulties, like creating trust with the community and getting witnesses to come forward, partly because many fear retribution from the Syrian government. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, for example, have called for wider Arabic translation of court proceedings, warning that a lack of interpretation marginalized those who did not speak fluent German and did not understand legal language. The trial that began Wednesday was conducted in German. “To be meaningful, justice should not only be done, but be seen to be done,” said Balkees Jarrah, interim international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “Court authorities should make Arabic translation more widely available for these cases involving the world’s worst crimes committed abroad.” As a way of creating an unofficial public record, Mr. Phillips said that trial monitors for his center would be translating notes taken at the trial on Wednesday.  “This case is undeniably a matter of international justice and it has enormous historic import,” he said. “Those individuals who are most impacted by these crimes should have access to the proceedings.”   https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/world/europe/germany-syria-war-crimes-mousa.html	1642626882.0	htdclxx	t3_s80k4w	t3_s80k4w	/r/arabs/comments/s80k4w/18_قضية_تعذيب_محاكمة_طبيب_سوري_في_ألمانيا/htdclxx/

If Muslims ever became ~10% of the population in the United States and were perceived to be a political threat of some kind, you bet you that they would find some ways of passing laws that target Muslims. I’m not sure legislating the hijab would be the first law to come out, but the law is a matter of interpretation, and all it takes is 5 people (majority in the Supreme Court) who don’t think the First Amendment applies to allow laws like these to be passed.	1642674020.0	htfxa8q	t3_s86zfa	t1_htf4hms	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htfxa8q/

f6avfqpv	The text of the First Amendment coupled with multiple centuries of precedent plus the fact that the Supreme Court does not need to make voters happy would present a much greater obstacle than you're making it out to be. Muslims are in fact not the first religious minority in American history. In fact, if they ever become more than 10%  of the population (they're half a percent of *Congress* right now), they wouldn't be the first religious minority to become  that big of a share of the population.	1642682101.0	htg8qmj	t3_s86zfa	t1_htfxa8q	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htg8qmj/

Both in Algeria and in France, on people it considered its own citizens. And that’s without mentioning that the way we mistreated a lot of our colonies, nor the inherent racism of colonialism in the first place.   My point was not to say that France was not racist nor that it doesn’t have a trouble past (some it still hasn’t acknowledged to this day), but that calling it the most racist or arrogant country in the Western world is factually incorrect, especially coming from an American.   Also, the further I went back with my examples were segregation and Jim Crow which were still a thing 60 years ago.	1642683508.0	htgb7eh	t3_s86zfa	t1_htg2qrs	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgb7eh/

The fact that Egypt accepted a ceasefire with Israel is in itself very disappointing. Egypt had all the factors that could lead to much favorable goals. They have the military capabilities, the population, the Syrians, the Soviets, the element of surprise, and the strategic depth. However, they only took back the Suez with 80% of Sinai in Israeli hands. Worst of all, Egypt ended up recognizing Israel in exchange for Sinai. Which in itself, a much more favorable diplomatic win for Israel.	1642684620.0	htgd9zs	t3_ruah5z	t1_hqz9b98	/r/arabs/comments/ruah5z/why_do_arabs_keep_calling_1973_a_victory/htgd9zs/

q5bon	As a French with Comoran origins, I understand why they do it: France has always hated religion. The three monotheist religions. Anti-judaism has been a thing until 1945, protestants were hunted for centuries and even Muslims. Why is it the only country to say "Mahomet"? Because they have belittled him by saying he's not worth the praises by Allah.	1642685913.0	htgfv82	t3_s86zfa	t1_htf4hms	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgfv82/
f6avfqpv	In my view, anti-clerical sentiments in France have always been a tool by the bourgeoise elite to extract their own form of power in French culture/politics and destroy opposition to it.   You are correct that anti-Judaism has deeper roots in France than the French realize. Napoleon permitted the Jewish community to practice their religion in France only under the supervision of a state religious body oversaw the Jewish community's religious practices, and French Jews were often suspected of disloyalty to France because of their religion. The Dreyfuss Affair, of course, caused many Jews to believe that the idea that they could ever have a place in a "secular" France was impossible, and that they would always be suspected of disloyalty in Western Europe.   There is much to admire about France and there are chill French people for sure, but there are many dark, horrible undercurrents to traditional French culture as well.	1642686646.0	htghe51	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgfv82	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htghe51/

It's that you presented them in an stark and oversimplified, sensationalistic manner that the media tends to present (hence they're "well documented" by sensationalists) and implied that they are part of a fundamentally nefarious American national character -- kind of the same way that someone could say that it is a "well documented fact" that Arab society is patriarchal, encourages terrorism, and so forth. If it is wrong to do it in one instance, it is wrong to do it in the other.   >And at no point did I make any judgment on the US or the Middle East.  Don't play coy about this, it is the conclusion that any reader of what you wrote would draw. We can go through the misleading, incomplete, and exaggerated portions of what you said point by point, but do not pretend like you didn't know how the position you articulated would be interpreted.   >My point is that it’s silly to call France the most racist, arrogant or embarrassing, let alone the most, when your very own country has also taken very controversial actions not so long ago.  I'm talking about the present; I am not talking about the past. And I'm not even detailing all the efforts that France took over the centuries to chase out non-French minorities so that it didn't have to address the problems that diverse countries all inherently face.   If you want to know whether or not French attitudes towards foreigners are the most prejudiced in Western society today, invoking Jim Crow in the Old South isn't going to help your argument. This story is about the French legislature taking a prejudiced measure that would never fly in the United States *this week*; the American legislature outlawed Jim Crow in 1965 and an anti-Hijab law would never pass at the federal level in the US (and would immediately be struck down in the Courts of the United States at the local level.) And I am sure the Muslim delegation of the United States Congress would applaud these measures; they wouldn't in France because they have no Muslim elected officals at the national level.	1642687228.0	htgimo4	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgehq0	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgimo4/
obxaun0	It comes down to the french view of secularism.   English secularism is a church, mosque, synagogue, temple &c on every street corner, worship whatever you want, show it with pride just don't force me to follow it.  French secularism is religion is a private affair that has no place in a public space.     this is where they're coming from, that being said it's a bit hypocritical because the french have a softer/more tolerant spot for Christianity due to it's cultural/historical significance.      Just wanted to share this to help make sense of why the french keep doing this (quebec and france)	1642690440.0	htgpxtp	t3_s86zfa	t1_htero7z	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgpxtp/

15yztx	Thanks for the reply.   I understand that the examples I listed are oversimplified, but are any of them wrong?  >> implied that they are part of a fundamentally nefarious America national character  It’s not really what I meant to imply, but I’ll go in bit more details later. With that being said, there is a bit of truth there, although I don’t believe it is intentional as much as it is because of the consequences of fucking up reconstruction.   >> Don’t play coy about this, it is the conclusion that any reader of what wrote would draw.   You may have heard it. I may have thought it. But I didn’t say it. But yeah fair enough, although my point was that you were in no position to call France racist or arrogant because of your recent history.   >>I’m not even detailing all the efforts that France rook over the centuries to chase out non-French minorities   This, I am legitimately curious about, because unless you are taking about the treatment of the Jews in the 12th or 13th century, the Hughenots (who were French) in the 16th, or the collaboration with the Nazis, I don’t know what you are talking about but would love to know more.   >>This story is about the French legislature taking a prejudiced measure that would never fly in the US this week  Just like the Muslim ban was promptly overturned by Congress and not upheld by the Supreme Court, right?  >>they wouldn’t in France because they have no Muslim elected officials at the national level  That’s just straight up false. We have about 15 members of Parliament who are muslim. Now that’s only 2,5% of the assembly, when French muslims are about 8% of the population, and while it’s not great, the number is increasing with each election and our Parliament is becoming more representative. But on the plus side, we don’t have anyone like MTG or Boebert calling them terrorist or the number one TV network trying to convince half of the country that they are unFrench.   I get why you are being defensive. I reacted the same way when you wrote that France was the most arrogant, racist, etc. My point is not to say that the US is the most racist country. If I were to name a country, Austria, Switzerland, Italy or Australia would be better candidates in my opinion. But I don’t think you have any lesson to give to France, nor the right to call it the most racist country.   Feel free to criticize this law. It is unnecessary, targets muslim and, more cynically is a blatant strategy that has been several times by various governments to mobilize their conservative electorate. Just get down from your high horse when you do it.	1642702130.0	hthl8du	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgimo4	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/hthl8du/

The Arab world has a high GDP thanks to oil producing countries. In fact over half of the Arab league's GDP comes from the GCC countries.

3fv6juvz	The point isn't just about the GDP itself,  but that it allows you to leverage your market power to influence or force other nations and foreign companies  into making deals with better terms for the United Arab states.   Want to sell cars/electronics/ hi-tech across the entire nation? well you need to  build manufacturing plants inside the country and employ X percentage from the local population. Or you have to hire developers from the country if you want to sell your software/subscription services.  Countries and companies will want to make any deal happen because there's so much revenue to be generated that would make it worth it to comply.  ( Assuming there's no corruption involved,  unfortunately right now Arab leaders say you can win this contract or sell this product as long as you give me my cut ---  and this happens in the oil-rich gulf countries as well, just as  frequently)	1642730396.0	htjinuh	t3_s8rcl3	t1_htjf0a4	/r/arabs/comments/s8rcl3/what_happens_is_the_arab_united_shocking_facts/htjinuh/

82sdnzop	 دراما تحدث حالياً بين الجزائريين والمغاربة على التويتر..    * بنت مغربية نشرت صور وفيديو لرسائل خاصة بينها وبين حساب المعلِّق الجزائري المعروف حفيظ الدراجي. [الرابط للفيديو](https://twitter.com/LightoMA19/status/1484252358901125122).    * المغردون المغاربة بدأوا يهاجمون الدراجي بشدة وشراسة على التويتر    * الدراجي غرّد ودافع عن نفسه قائلاً أن الفيديو والصور كلها مفبركة. [تغريدته](https://twitter.com/derradjihafid/status/1484274458953228296)     * الكثير من الجزائريين والآخرين شككوا في مصداقية الصور والفيديو    * في تقديري أرى أنها فبركة واضحة لسببيَن: أولاً، البنت بعثت رسالة الساعة 19:10 وردّ عليها حساب الدراجي في نفس الدقيقة 19:10 بفقرة كاملة. لا أحد يستطيع أن يرد بتلك السرعة إلا إذا جُهِّزت الرسالة في وقت مُسبَق. ثانياً، توجد فروق شاسعة بين الرسالة المنسوبة للدراجي وتغريداته المعتادة. الرسالة الخاصة معبأة بالأخطاء الإملائية، وإذا دخلت في صفحة الدراجي لن تجد أي أخطاء إملائية في تغريداته نهائياً. وليس متوقع من رجل بفصاحة الدراجي أن يرتكب أخطاء إملائية كتلك الموجودة في الرسالة.    مع ذلك يبدو أن الأغلبية لم يكترث للتدقيق في هذه التفاصيل وقرروا أن يهاجموا الدراجي من دون أي رحمة. يعني بالعقل هل تتوقع من رجل بعمر وخبرة ورزانة الدراجي أن ينزل لهذا المستوى ويرسل رسائل مثل هذه إلى حسابات غريبة؟   أرى أنها محاولة دنيئة لإشعال نار الفتنة بين الشعوب.. شيء مؤسف أن كمية الحقد والكراهية عند بعض الناس دعتهم للتصرف بهذه الطريقة الواطية. ما رأيكم؟	1642755665.0	htksl7o	t3_s84ku4	t3_s84ku4	/r/arabs/comments/s84ku4/درر_المخارج_في_العامي_والدارج_نقاش_حر_بالعربي/htksl7o/

It makes some sense when you think about it. Nowadays Andalusia is (economically/culturally) one of Spain's more irrelevant communities whereas during Arab Islamic times it was the center of the entire world.

l84e04d	You're getting more downvotes than you deserve, but besides the "official explantation" (that you yourself described as hypocritical). There is absolutely no doubt that French Islamophobia is based on racism and prejudice towards Maghrebi Arabs and Sub-Saharan Africans.  I am French, I have many friends that are White French, I debate this a lot: of course justifications about secularism and freedom of religion are thrown around all the time, but from the history of these "secularism measures"  and of the relationship between France and its colonial subjects in general, and from the examination of the sociopolitic profile of the people who promote these measures, you can see the discrimination pattern behind the justification.  The fact that the measures against Muslims are becoming tougher and tougher through time is also explained by the actual empowerment of French Muslims (culturally but mainly economically): when the hijabis were the cleaning ladies who lived in the "Banlieue dortoir" \[poor and densely populated suburbs\] and could barely speak French, nobody bothered. But now, some hijabis are actually French born, they speak perfect French, they are capable of defending both their national (French) and their religious identities, they are doctors, engineers, consultants, accountants, and maybe executives in the futur. Now the presence of non-whites in such an obvious fashion in the economic elite is problematic.	1642765623.0	htl5f8w	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgpxtp	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htl5f8w/

8g2fp9gl	Being a nationalist can mean many things. At its simplest level it means being a person who strongly identifies with the interests of his/het nation. When the interests of your nation are in stronger integration with the rest of the Arab world, nationalism and pan-Arabism (or whatever  you want to call it) are not really mutually exclusiv. I know that's not a very widespread view in many Arab countries but it is in places like Jordan for instance. And I frankly find it very odd that someone would think that 100 years after borders were drawn you would need to be "brainwashed" to strongly identify with your country and its borders. History moves on.   The best chance pan-Arabism has today is in stronger integration between the existing countries. The pan-Arabism of yesterday where you get to erase everything that happened in the last 100 years and start over is a bit like "world peace"; something naive beauty pageants say they want, but which nobody has the slightest clue how to achieve.	1642768581.0	htla2rn	t3_s8rcl3	t1_htjysm1	/r/arabs/comments/s8rcl3/what_happens_is_the_arab_united_shocking_facts/htla2rn/

People on r/lebanon claim that they just don't want to help Palestine anymore. Which is fine. But it's weird how many people are getting angry on the pipe line ON BEHALF of israel. And keep insisting that everyone else must normalize. OP is adamant that we should all normalize. A guy is saying he would rather the pipeline not be build so the government can fail. Ignoring the negative affects it would have on his own country.  Those people don't talk like lebanese people. They talk like israelis. Wishing the worst for lebanon. Getting angry when good things happen to lebanon because it's not happening to israel. It's seriously madness.  Those people are seriously brainwashed minority. Or a true representive of lebanon. If it's the latter then lebanon has a much bigger then hezballah. It's own people who seem to care more about the well-being of israel then their own country.	1642801991.0	htnnmot	t3_s8cm1j	t1_htk1svx	/r/arabs/comments/s8cm1j/map_of_the_arab_gas_pipeline_egyptian_gas_deal/htnnmot/

357k12ya	Herod case is nowhere near a stretch. What every modern scholar 100% agree upon is that he was half-Nabataean (which is half-Arab) from his mother side. (ex. [Rome and the Arabs](https://books.google.com.om/books?id=W4H97SA6pMAC&q=Idumaeans&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=herod&f=false) describing him at least as a semi-Arab) So, this alone is enough to not make it a stretch. On the other hand, his father Antipater is Idumean. Now while not every modern scholar describe them as Arabs, there are many reliable works who do so, ex. [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herod-king-of-Judaea) and [The Myth of a Gentile Galilee](https://books.google.com.om/books?id=YrrRaeP5po0C&pg=PA44).  The OP did make a stretch though in the case of Amir al-Din (or Yeheidie'erding), who is only described as a Muslim and no indications of his ethnicity. Or maybe OP can provide a source  that I'm not aware of, supporting his point of view.	1642822912.0	htp37qq	t3_s9be8t	t1_htmwnt3	/r/arabs/comments/s9be8t/العرب_والعمارة/htp37qq/

I would be fine with a Palestinian state on the 67 (or even better, 49) borders. But I'm not comfortable speaking for the millions of Palestinians who want to return to their particular village and currently live in camps. I think they will be the deciding factor.

Iran, for example, an Islamic country, would rather ally with Christian Armenia over its Muslim Shia neighbor Azerbaijan, some countries in the GCC also would rather ally with Israel if it meant they can guarantee protection from their neighbors.

9sfh0	Fascinating lecture, thank you for sharing. I think the most interesting thing to come out of this is his hypothesis for why the Nabateans’ adapted Aramaic script eventually won out to later evolve to Arabic script— basically he argues that the other scripts which were used to write Arabic were used mainly by nomads and almost exclusively for religious purposes, which fell out of favor with the spread of Christianity in the region. Meanwhile, the Nabateans used their script not only for religious purposes—but since they were non-nomadic, they used it for business and administration. This kept it relevant even after Christianity spread, since it had other uses.   This is so fascinating to me because it almost seems to be a fluke that the abjad we have today and the cursive won out. If the Nabateans just happened to be using Greek at the time, or any other alphabet that had vowels, we would see an Arabic alphabet. Or maybe the most powerful kingdom at the time used a Chinese-like character-based language— in which case, Arabic might be represented in that way.  Do you think that the Arabic script/abjad is well adapted to the language itself? At the end of the day, every alphabet can be used more or less to represent sounds, but personally I don’t believe that the Latin alphabet represents Arabic well—there are too many changes you have to make to get it to work. But perhaps this is just a matter of getting used to it and the historical development. After all, the Nabatean script eventually had to be heavily modified, with dots and tashkeel to ensure correct pronunciation. Any thoughts?	1642849809.0	htqb9qf	t3_s9ys9h	t3_s9ys9h	/r/arabs/comments/s9ys9h/fantastic_conference_about_the_history_of_arabic/htqb9qf/

22m5u362	My shiddo lived in Tiberias a little town on the westside of the Sea of Galilee. It was pretty peaceful for all faiths, Muslims, Christians (which is what he was) and Jews. Then 1948 when the Arab and Israeli war started the Zionist settlers new to the area tried breaking into my shiddo’s home. Him and his parents, uncles, relatives had to barricade the doors. Soon they knew the IDF was going to come and ransack every Palestinians home (which they did) because they had already killed some distant relatives in south of them. So my great grandparents left everything, their home, their hotel, their other family members who dispersed to Jordan. This all happened to my shiddo at 14 and he had to move to Damascus with nothing. Meanwhile my Teta 4 years old at the time had already seen her neighbors bodies mutilated on the street near her house, probably done by the settlers or idf I’m not sure. I’m not too sure what city she was from, but I think she mentioned wasn’t too far from shiddo. She moved to Beirut Lebanon with her family then several years later my shiddo at a camera shop. It’s really a small world.   They had to move to the UK when my dad was a kid though because the civil war going on in 1975. There were missiles going off all the time in their town, my dad told me once he was knocked off his bed by just the missile that hit their next door neighbors apartment building. They had to hide in bunkers, at this point my grandparents didn’t care about Palestine becoming independent they just wanted to be safe and didn’t pick sides. So again, they left which is super lucky because according to their neighbors a missile went straight through my dads room two weeks after they left. It was fired by the westside side of Beirut Muslim group who were supporting the Palestinian cause… which is ironic because they were also killing fellow Palestinians as well, but didn’t realize it. As my baba describes the situation, they were mad at Pierre Gemayel a real bad Christian Phalangist who’s party killed innocent Muslim Palestinians in retaliation of fighting Israel or supporting the PLO. It was a shit show which my family were very lucky to survive/get out when they could. My dad, uncles, and Teta almost got murked too though when going to the airport. They were stopped by a Muslim checkpoint basically interrogating our family friend (who thank god was Muslim) covered for them saying everyone in the car was Muslim, while my uncles are trying to keep calm seeing a guy holding a big machine gun in the back of their truck.   So… yeah that’s my family’s story. Even after the Nakba they had to flee. I mention this because it’s very important to know where you com from; this is how people lose their identity, their culture, and an entire ethnic group. I’m first generation and I barely speak the language so clearly I’m a product of that. It’s not a good feelingPeople say (that’s a fair price for safety), but I beg to differ. You’d never say that about any other group of people especially Israelis. There’s an interview with Ghassan Kanafani (one of the head leaders of PFLP and famous author) who says “maybe to you, but for us it’s not. To liberate our country, our people, to have dignity, to have respect, to have our mere human rights… is something as essential as life itself.” And I keep that in mind because to me it boggles my mind that our existence is still controversial today. So here I am trying to learn Arabic in my dumb American accent, but that’s alright. I think my shiddo would be happy I’m learning.	1642899772.0	httgg8e	t3_omvfcd	t3_omvfcd	/r/arabs/comments/omvfcd/looking_for_descendants_of_nakbanaksa_survivors/httgg8e/

Your personal inability to focus on more than one enemy a time is your problem.  I literally cannot comprehend the idiocy in your line of the thinking. We’re literally talking about Iran. It’s not like we started with enemies and Iran was the first one mentioned spontaneously. Iran is the whole subject. And it has perpetrated heinous crimes in Arab countries.

h4q6j721	Stop using moralism, ffs.   I don't care about Iran. It's not the main problem, not even close. You're using Iran to excuse your sectrian bias, that's all. Iran has zero power in our region and how do you imagine them taking Arabs under control? By using magic?   Everything what Iran does can be explained by western attempts to instal their loyal regime there. And unlike in Arab lands, Iranian regime is mostly popular in Iran itself, so they have legitimacy.   If Iran won't stop playing in the region after fall of Arab regimes and the end of presence of non-Arab forces in the region, we will talk. For now it's just nonsense. Iran's role in Arab problems is so small that you have to be, like I said, delusional to put your focus on them.   Also, you tried to blaime Palestinians for supporting Yemen. What's the point here? Hoothies get closer to Iran only after Salman and Zayeds attacked them. They are literally defending themselves. And you want us to do what? To support position of these Arab sellouts like Salman, Zayed and the rest of these rats? Are you fucking serious? 😂  If Iran is going to help us to kick out western militaries and all their pigs from our lands, I'll support them. I don't care about "Shias\\Sunnies" or any of these r\*tarded terms and groups. And if Iran will help us to destroy gulf regimes, I'll support it as well, I have zero respect for these parasites and don't care what people who support them feel or think, they would sell their own mother to get some easy and free money.	1642980737.0	hty39uh	t3_sacony	t1_hty1ol0	/r/arabs/comments/sacony/مسيرة_وسط_غزه_يتظاهرون_دعما_لإيران_والحوثي_وحزب/hty39uh/

14u9g8	I disagree,although I am here for arabic culture more than a political stance I personally dont believe in anything past a trade and infrastructure union.  As an Egyptian who is socially active and constantly gather people's opinions and see how they perceive things in my community,and lived 10 years in saudi arabia with a group of arab speaking migrants from sudan syria south Egypt yemen etc, can see that the nature of the area really cant be maintained by one huge empire or union or identity   You think since we all have the same language and share similar religions we will be very close but thats not true,historically the maghreb,Egypt,the levant and arabia have always broken back to independence from whatever empire was in control,or have an empire based on one of these areas,and even now you can see how the major dialects,countries,populations,culture generally revolve around those centers. A united federation in the region on any strong cultural basis will simply break again,its better to maintain our independence and national identity and shared identity for stability,also an Arab union would delete and persecute minorities such as copts and berbers and I simply cant stand by that.	1643031498.0	hu0memf	t3_s8rcl3	t1_htjysm1	/r/arabs/comments/s8rcl3/what_happens_is_the_arab_united_shocking_facts/hu0memf/

17dxv4	The problem is, your “independence” and “identity” were made the west. I mean, what the hell is “Jordan”????? In every literal sense of the word, Jordan is a made up country that was supposed to be a buffering zone between Arabia and Israel. What about Lebanon? Lebanon is literally a failing French project.   If doesn’t matter what the average person think. People are so easily brain washed. And it’s hard to blame them. I mean, imagine you’re from Arab country X. You go to school, where you see the flag of your “very real” country. You learn in history class -that was approved by the government- that your country is a very real country, look here’s a national hero [insert name of person who did something semi-great].   All in all, the average person is a lot dumped than you think. Look at what happened to the UK after they left the EU. Why did they voted to leave? Because the leave campaign worked a lot harder. Meanwhile, the stay campaign didn’t think that people would be so stupid to vote for something that will hurt them.

China was divided by the same "differences", Germany was nothing but a bunch of random kingdoms(and their lingual differences were much-much deeper than with Arabic dialects).  Also, there are countries like USA, Canda, Australia, Russia and so on. Somehow you don't question rationality of their existence(while at least 3 of 4 shouldn't even exist as they're colonies, unlike Arab lands).   The fact that we live in different "countries" instead of living one large country is insane.

3j3dj	What company is this with? Never seen results presented like this. The results themselves are also totally bizarre. Fennoscandia and Tuva and southeast India and Orkney islands and Austronesia and Greenland Eskimos.... a7a  Generally speaking, these are autosomal results. They represent the last 7-10 generations, or about 128 grandparents. [This table](https://i0.wp.com/dna-explained.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Generation-percent-DNA.jpg?ssl=1) illustrates it very well.  For people who are highly mixed, the algorithms make certain assumptions and can vary a lot. For example, my mother is Nordic, and on some sites I get a big chunk of Hungarian or Slovenian or northern Italian, and on other sites I get zero from those areas. On Gedmatch you could view your results based on 2 parents from the same country or 2 parents from different countries, or all 4 grandparents from different countries. When I set it to both parents from the same country, I [would get Slovenian or northern Italian or Ashkenazi Jewish](https://imgur.com/ncwlyhu) + a confidence percentage (lower is better). When I set it to 2 parents from different countries, [I would get](https://imgur.com/HqL1B5y) 50% Palestinian or Jordanian or Yemeni and 50% Swedish or Finnish. And [when I set it to 4 grandparents from different countries](https://imgur.com/w7iEJlw) I'd get 25% Yemeni 25% Lebanese 25% Swedish 25% Finnish.  On 23andme I get nothing from central or eastern Europe, but in Familytreedna I get like 30% "Magyar". So it's important to keep in mind the limitations of these tests. FTDNA is most likely conflating some of my Nordic and some of my Arab ancestry as central European because Hungary and Romania and Italy are the most likely European areas to find a mixture of both Nordic and Middle Eastern genes.  For a look into more ancient ancestry, ask him what his Y-haplogroup or subclade is. If he gets something like J-M267 or one of its subclades then the story will become very clear for him. For example, [these Moroccans and Algerians](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/252896110_903917030509920_3941351554602171907_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b9115d&_nc_ohc=8cGCRsHmsc8AX-d5irs&_nc_oc=AQnSYNGV-bvRRpL6t_nHCNg12fHsybkuJiTM62YNKnQUX_OWQsxvvYTp4FL3DWIMBCY&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=00_AT84hFxUelXYxxTS40i0Gzzwhj5_CHv58RRBsCPUartCVw&oe=61F3FB82) all belong to recent subclades of an Arabian haplogroup. Or for example, [these Germans and Austrians](https://scontent-lhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/271715454_446531553617183_7163904013559452753_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=825194&_nc_ohc=ZORZkhhn2TQAX_CIxrh&tn=FUj98UTFgkSNrdxm&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&oh=00_AT_RU-j7ypm8xLp0mQCkuwM0onACk9zDOxFY8l6bm_GJeQ&oe=61F5CFF9) have crystal clear evidence that they descend paternally from an Arabian person. Their TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) is precisely 1,500 years ago, so i think quite strong evidence of Islamic invasion period through Spain. But lots of people get random haplogroups with no clear point of origin, groups such as T or I or G and certain subclades of E that are argued about endlessly. So if he's lucky he'll get a major group with a strong link to an ethnic group or region. If he's unlucky he'll get a weird group that's still unclear.  The mitochondrial haplogroup, or Mtdna, is also interesting, but it is less informative because maternal haplogroups are much less tied to ethnicities than y-haplogroups are.	1643113935.0	hu58oye	t3_sb7uhn	t1_hu4yj6h	/r/arabs/comments/sb7uhn/monday_majlis_open_discussion/hu58oye/

I am inspired by this book https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56913497-a-year-of-pagan-prayer and I want our book to be something like it but also a founding document for reconstructed Arabian paganism.

cth60tv	The Urheimat of arabic is the Syrian desert. Qahtan myth really needs to die, people would be surprised just how much of Arabian peninsula was arabized, esp the more south you go. I feel its getting better with the new generations as they are better informed but I've seen lots of new gen kids get deep in genetics and open a new can of worms from there. I remember a historian noting that in ancient times Arab used to refer to a Semitic nomad. The fact that Arab identity revolves around culture and language is how it became it so vast. Its funny because you get two kinds faces of the same coin. People outside the Arabian Peninsula who try to distance themselves from Arab identity with obscure examples and Hyper nationalist gulf arabs in recent times who profess that they are pure and everyone outside the peninsula is a fake arab. It was surprising to see it uttered by a Kuwaiti friend in my friend group esp. since he says that because he is related to the Prophet Mohammed (saw) that he is pure where I had to educate him that its well known that the Prophet (saw) himself was arabized (which doesnt make him any less of an arab) and not a pure arab. He is better now and doesn't spew these things. Probably realized its all silly.	1643126241.0	hu5zpmc	t3_sbsak5	t1_hu4xlxe	/r/arabs/comments/sbsak5/why_do_we_assume_levant_al_sham_had_no_arabs_in/hu5zpmc/

h81t44ek	> Intresting. So did you write these prayers or are these based on real pagan prayers?  There's nothing new under the sun. Even when I write a new prayer, it is still inspired by past inscriptions, or by current prayers in other religions. The book will feature both new prayers, as well as ancient inscriptions copied as-is but in modern Arabic script and orthography to make it more accessible.  This is a good source for Old Arabic inscriptions, a database of thousands of Safaitic, Hismaic and other Old Arabic inscriptions http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/index.php/database  I also make use of these works by Ahmed Al-Jallad  https://www.academia.edu/45498003/Al_Jallad_Pre_Print_Draft_The_Religion_and_Rituals_of_the_Nomads_of_Pre_Islamic_Arabia_A_Reconstruction_based_on_the_Safaitic_Inscriptions  https://www.academia.edu/53492951/Al_Jallad_Pre_Print_An_Outline_of_the_Grammar_of_the_Safaitic_Inscriptions_second_edition  > Also are you intrested in other pagan gods from the region, like phonecian gods or mesopotamian gods?  Yes. I do external syncretism. It is part of my practice as Arabian pagan. Not only do we find inscriptions of Arabs invoking the gods of neighboring nations, but also examples of syncretism (equating an Arab god with a foreign god, and worshiping them as one). For example, we don’t know a lot about Alkutbay but we know about Thoth, and they share some characteristics, and so I utilize our knowledge of Thoth when worshiping Alkutbay. Similarly for other gods who have a well-known counterpart in other pantheons, e.g. Aluzza and Aphrodite, Nuha and Shapash.  What's possibly the oldest Arabic poem is about the Baal Cycle. (see it here http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/corpus/pages/OCIANA_0023086.html)  The following is my attempt at inscribing it in modern Arabic:  حجّ موت و لاظّ ثرام  فميكان لياليه و أيوامه  و ها بعل يبيت و لاه بات و ما نام  The following is a poem I wrote about Ninkasi inspired by an ancient Sumerian hymn:  في النبيذ حكمة وفي الجعة حرية وفي الماء بكتيريا  أ ننكاسي تي صلاتي أصليها  حين تصب الجعة المصفاة من وعاء التجميع  كأنه تدفق دجلة والفرات  أ ننكاسي أنت من تصب الجعة المصفاة من وعاء التجميع  كأنه تدفق دجلة والفرات  سلام عليكي واهبة الحرية	1643127109.0	hu61zm3	t3_sb7uhn	t1_hu5xmgk	/r/arabs/comments/sb7uhn/monday_majlis_open_discussion/hu61zm3/

9k3699ws	I thought people would be more receptive to it especially people from Syria. Turns out, there’s some who are willing to ignore 1000 years of history prior to Islam to larp as “Caananite,” which is a very ancient died out obscure culture. I’m surprised people don’t just identify as Neanderthals. I get it there are Arabists out there that deny minorities like Berber history, but this does not apply if you are Syrian, Jordanian, Iraqi, Saudi, or Palestinian. Check out my last comments on r/Syria. I post countless sources and I’m somehow a bigot for bringing up the [Tanukhids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanukhids). But if I brought up some foreign Romans, they wouldn’t have minded and would celebrated it. 😂 The irony is a ancient Syrian Arab queen [Mavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavia_(queen)) defeated the Romans in Syria. Meanwhile her descendants on Reddit are larping as the enemy 😂. Obviously this is a minority, but it’s still sad. I didn’t even get into the post-Islamic history that followed for the rest of the Arab world. But if the people of [Musa Ibn Nusayr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_ibn_Nusayr) are having a identity crisis, this is not good. 😂   And Gulf nationalists are in a whole other delusion. The funny thing is the Gulfite’s ancestors did not come from Yemen. Their pre Islamic culture are all Mesopotamian from Iraq like [Dilmun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun) and [Magan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magan_(civilization)).

9k3699ws	It’s normal to despise a government, but many idiots I’ve noticed are acting like Saudi Arabia is this other universe. They think a country 5 times bigger than California is a monolith. Northern Saudi Arabia shares with Jordanian culture. Southern Saudi Arabia is Yemeni culture. Eastern Saudi is Khaleeji culture. There’s this racist undertone with these weirdos. Jamal Khashoggi is a Saudi whose ancestry is from Turkey. There’s a whole bunch of them as well as other descendants of migrants from as far as Nigeria and Morocco in the west to China in the East. They took their idea of Saudi Arabia from Family Guy. Tabuk Arab Bedouins share the same tribe as those in Jordan, Palestine, Syria and even Sinai in Egypt. The pick me levels of these people.	1643140389.0	hu71ls7	t3_scjxwc	t3_scjxwc	/r/arabs/comments/scjxwc/levantine_arabs_syrians_and_lebanese_which_one_do/hu71ls7/

l84e04d	I just finished it. I liked it, it was a nice moment to spend. I would say 15/20: not an excellent film, but a good film.  But it never pretended to represent Lebanese or Egyptian society as a whole, it was clearly and from the get go about a very westernized and  upper class group of people, and I think it represented these kind of people quite accurately.  I would've loved Tunisian cinema to produce such a film, but for some reason Tunisian producers are stuck in the serious strongly left leaning "we live in a society" genre. Ok I get it you are an engaged producer and I support your message, but if I wanted to be depressed about the situation of the country I would've just watched the news.	1643141425.0	hu74dmg	t3_sb7uhn	t1_htymylr	/r/arabs/comments/sb7uhn/monday_majlis_open_discussion/hu74dmg/

3j3dj	I haven't tried them all, and there are a lot of them out there now. It depends on what you're after. For autosomal ancestry testing like in your screenshot, i think 23andme is the most accurate. For y-haplogroups, Familytreedna is better because of the research groups. Another option is Yseq, a German company, but I haven't tried that.  But no matter what you choose, you'll end up having to do a lot of your own research. They just give you the barest information and you have to dig deeper	1643145250.0	hu7em1e	t3_sb7uhn	t1_hu6cmwu	/r/arabs/comments/sb7uhn/monday_majlis_open_discussion/hu7em1e/
3j3dj	I second /u/elmehdiham in recommending Abelaziz al-Douri. I read one of his books (الجذور التاريخية للقومية العربية) and thought it was much better than this Egyptology book. Other than that, I haven't read much history in Arabic, so can't recommend. I really want to find a serious book on Egyptology in Arabic but so far no luck. But if you're in Egypt, I follow Fatma Keshk, an Egyptologist educated at Freie Universität Berlin, and she sometimes posts about Arabic talks on Egyptology, [like this](https://twitter.com/fkeshk/status/1485950482535399425).

h4q6j721	No one is saying that zionists is the only problem. We are saying that zionists are part of Western neo-colonial structure that helps them to maintain status quo and all those regimes. The only reason Saudi, Zayed and other "royal" families are still alive is protection of those neo-colonists. If it wasn't for them, we would be a one Arab country 70-80 years ago.   This neo-colonisalism works through so-called "family capitalism" because it's easier to control those families who contro the population, then controlling the population itself.   Do you really think there are any sane Arabs who want to have a bunch of USA\\UK or any other non-Arab pigs with weapons in their lands? Or they want to live in tribial based borders? Or having monarchy in 21st century? Or spending all the money we get from selling oil and gas outside of the region("investing outside" as they call it)?

It's amazing how you guys always twist the fact that no one supported Assad himself, they supported him only as the least evil option in this mess.   FSA lost not because of Russia, but because of: 1)them being sectarian lunatics(most of them are just ISIS in suits); 2)taking money and stuff from USA, and letting USA to use them as an excuse to occupy the country; 3)having ties with zionists, 4)taking resources from gulf regimes.

echcbgjw	>You're delusional if you think FSA was better than Assad at the moment.   I didn't sey that, they're all war criminals.  I said some of them were, the In fighting began after Nusra (funded by Turkey) claim that everyone is a funded by foreign forces so they were the enemy, I think they single-handedly destroyed and eradicated 15 other groups, which severely weakened thier fighting capabilities.  They turned on each other when they were defeated in late 2012 [Battle of Damascus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Damascus_(2012)), the lack of funding & supplies, made them turn on each other.  >USA supported them and so-called "SDF" because they wanted to destroy Syria, not to take out Assad. If FSA won, we would have had a zionist-loyal dog as a head of Syria now.  No, the USA only supported the SDF (which is made up by Arabs, Assyrians and mostly Kurds) to fight ISIS (which the US also allowed the Saudis and the Emiratis to supply with guns and weapons with no consequence), after that the US betrayed the SDF by allowing turkey to invade them.   The US only supplies the most radical with guns & weapons; That's why you find the most radical succeeding in the war especially after 2013 and until 2017 or 16 (when's that funding stopped; because ISIS became a real threat to US interest in the region, I know it's an oxymoron Because the US doesn't want one single group to dominate everyone it prefers different warring factions).  >It's amazing how you guys always twist the fact that no one supported Assad himself, they supported him only as the least evil option in this mess.  What?! Are you an idiot? The ones that supported Assad where the ones to benefit from keeping him in power, from Russia that had a base in Syria to Iran that has vested interest in making a direct influence line in the region (fertile crescent) & from the people (Are the other Allawi's who benefited from keeping their guy in a position of power).  No one thinks of the "least evil", everyone looks out for their interest.  >FSA lost not because of Russia, but because of: 1)them being sectarian lunatics(most of them are just ISIS in suits); 2)taking money and stuff from USA, and letting USA to use them as an excuse to occupy the country; 3)having ties with zionists, 4)taking resources from gulf regimes. These things turned population away from them and it is well deserved.  They lost in March 2013 because of lack of funding and weapons, disorganization And of course the Hezbollah supporting Assad when he was cornered, that made them turn on each other even more and their United Front was crushed.  They were on even footing (Even controlled more cities and provinces than the Syrian regime) until 2015 came with the Russian support.  Then the Gulf States succeeded in funding ISIS in July 2013 making them grow faster than any other group.	1643178922.0	hu9igx1	t3_sbkmii	t1_hu7p06l	/r/arabs/comments/sbkmii/assad_regime_tortured_over_653_palestinian/hu9igx1/

892g5dlb	Did you forget the Gulf exists? Even now Saudi is a run by theocrats who get their inspiration for law from Shari'a. What's more, Saudi is the base for something called Wahhabism, considered the most radical and restrictive school in the Muslim world. That's a prime example of the entrenched Islamic influence right there.   As to the rest of your comment, I'm at a loss to follow your logic. The islamist groups attacked everyone—Westerner and local bystander alike. They smash statues and destroyed temples, and generally draw from a population of people that's easily susceptible to radicalization. And they're so susceptible to radicalization, I think, in big park because Islamism is already so pervasive in society to begin with. You can't recruit locally or from a region that doesn't already halfway buy into the basis of your ideology. It just doesn't work that way.   Irrespective of nepotism and authoritarianism, Islamism is still very much present. Those dictators often work within the religious status quo to maintain power, after all.	1643195423.0	hua3v79	t3_s8kz8l	t1_hu33f40	/r/arabs/comments/s8kz8l/this_video_is_a_vocal_representation_of_what_the/hua3v79/

13d3h8	Why? I voted for KSA but I don't think it's so clear cut, it's a good question. Depending on where you are from in Syria/Lebanon and what you count as Turkey/KSA you will answer differently.  If we're talking about Antakya, Gaziantep, Adana, or Mardin and you're from Aleppo or Hassakah then Turkish culture is closer to you.  If you're a Bedouin Syrian then you will definitely feel closer to Najdi Saudi culture and will likely have tribe relatives there. Also, if you're southern Syrian you will feel closer to Hijazi Saudi culture.  Keep in mind Syria shares 900KM border with Turkey and no borders with KSA... an artificial border does not create a culture barrier.  Either way the question is stupid, I don't understand why they removed Jordan and Palestine from the Levante, which if you include would make the Levante as a whole much closer to Saudi culture. Either way, the next closest thing is definitely Iraqi culture (sometimes depicted to be Levante/greater Levante).	1643196509.0	hua5cqv	t3_scjxwc	t1_hu6se66	/r/arabs/comments/scjxwc/levantine_arabs_syrians_and_lebanese_which_one_do/hua5cqv/

17dxv4	🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️   You’re average “Islam is bad” think tank.    Since forever, western scientists have been coming to the region and discovering stuff here and there! Even Tunisia, the country you praised for being a beacon of secularism has had western scientists exploring its history, meanwhile, the Tunisian Secular government didn’t do anything.   Saudi Arabia, the wahabbist country, have always had western scientists exploring the Great desert, and some historical areas.  Do you see how your thesis “because of Islam” doesn’t really match reality? How come Saudi Arabia -in the name of religion- prevents local scientists from exploring the history of the region, but at the same allow western scientists to do so?   You’ll say, it’s because locals can be religious, therefore you can’t trust them.

6x4b0pee	I completely agree with you. The movie’s not amazing, but it is enjoyable.   As for representation, I do not have a strong opinion one way or another. Most Egyptian movies make no attempt to represent the average Egyptian anyway, so I’ve honestly been pretty dismissive of the whole “it doesn’t represent us!” argument.   I came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thebigpharaoh/status/1485674785812234260?s=21) that I think perfectly summarizes why the movie is so controversial in Egypt: a gay character who’s not completely dehumanized, a cheating wife (not husband), and the daughter’s openness regarding her relationship.	1643207753.0	huaqf47	t3_sb7uhn	t1_hu74dmg	/r/arabs/comments/sb7uhn/monday_majlis_open_discussion/huaqf47/

b55grtnk	I am solo developers, working alone for 2 years now on a strategy board game, set during the syrian civil war.        The gameplay is here : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dlndf8Q6NM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dlndf8Q6NM)         You use cards (Espionage, Political, Military) in order to dominate the region.        You can play 2 teams :        \- the Resistance: Syria, Russian, Iran, Hezbollah, Palestine (and some help from Algeria)        \- the West: USA, Israel, syrian rebels, and some other groups        I am looking for beta testers right now, it's on Android and PC (Android beta is already uploaded and ready, but PC is coming soon, when Steam accepts it)                Anyway, Algeria is part of the game, because, playing as the Resistance player, you can visit "Foreign Capitals" (Astana, Ankara, Geneva, Algiers....) and when you do it you can gain powerful cards to add to your deck.                Also, Algeria , it is not known that much, but had a very important role supporting the Syrian Governement in the war.                Anyway, I would love some support, critics or help on that ,        Discord : [https://discord.gg/V6fzx932TY](https://discord.gg/V6fzx932TY)         ya3tikum al 3afiye	1643213998.0	hub6j1i	t3_sd9p54	t3_sd9p54	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/hub6j1i/
yomja	No offense, but why? Most Gulf countries are economically well off enough to help each other. Other countries that aren't fortunate enough wouldn't help the union.  Hopefully, though, I'm hoping for another union that involves the Levant, one for Egypt and Sudan, Maghrib countries etc, which would form a bigger Arab union.	1643214129.0	hub6w7y	t3_sd2rit	t1_huavji0	/r/arabs/comments/sd2rit/saudi_arabia_calls_on_gcc_to_speed_up/hub6w7y/

yomja	Well I think you should've pointed out that your objection was to the name, not the union itself.  If the union was called "Arabian Peninsula Union", then probably, although it feels pedantic to choose a longer name just because it's been used before. "Gulf" is clear, and everyone knows what it refers to, and that's the whole point of having a name.  I don't understand this loyalty to the Arabian Peninsula name.	1643218921.0	hubkf3f	t3_sd2rit	t1_hubjaln	/r/arabs/comments/sd2rit/saudi_arabia_calls_on_gcc_to_speed_up/hubkf3f/
d3vyj9a8	Iirc this was often considered and proposed in GCC Council meetings, but some member states repeatedly objected to the proposal, citing Yemen's internal situation as being too volatile and too risky to join. 20/20 hindsight, not including Yemen led to more corruption and poverty, ultimately exacerbating the situation there.  It was announced sometime ago that a GCC membership was in the works for a post houthi Yemen. I'm hopeful this time it happens. Honestly, given how close Iran was from establishing a permanent stronghold in the Arabian peninsula, I don't think it's a matter of choice anymore.	1643219160.0	hubl3uv	t3_sd2rit	t1_huaxwry	/r/arabs/comments/sd2rit/saudi_arabia_calls_on_gcc_to_speed_up/hubl3uv/

Where are the opportunities?  do you really think the common people have anthing or any power in their nations to do anything beneficial when these nations are ruled by monarchies and dictators ?  they just leave a big majority of their youngsters to rot in coffee shops past their 30's withou any hope for a future.  why do you even think the arab spring happened? So peoples can get rid of their corrupt governments and rulers, but what happened is that these rulers got replaced with similarly corrupt rulers, so it's understandable how some of those who try to immigrate feel? Do you think it's easy for them to make that decision?  sorry but your sentence is really unrealistic with what's actually happening in poor arab nations and saying things like 'unpopular opinion' is  a way from you to use reverse psychology on people in this thread to persuade them to support you.	1643220985.0	hubqak4	t3_nh9mj5	t1_gyveyxb	/r/arabs/comments/nh9mj5/images_of_spanish_soldiers_beating/hubqak4/

Gulf countries are similar enough in terms of wealth, culture and ideals which makes building a union easier, more reasonable and practical.  In a perfect world, there are countries that are rich enough to carry the whole region.

3fv6juvz	Thanks for the reply, I appreciate the time you put into it. I don't want to take more of your time, as I agree with a lot of what you said. With some comments  1. Mentioned the monarchy in Jordan because they are Jordanian soldiers (and their sacrifice was valiant despite the overwhelming odds against them... That has to be clear).  2. Abdl Hakeem 3amer was the idiot that ordered the general retreat. Creating even more losses for the Egyptian army and screwed over the Syrian Jordanian side. Sadat did a similar selfish maneuver in 1973 where he decided to stop advancing/pushing as a political play which allowed Zionists to divert attention and demolish Syria (and then went back to Egypt to finish off Egyptian army to the point of surrender.  3. Knowing that the Jordanian army was not ready ( and to be honest without enough funding they would have never been ready), The King ( If he wasn't worried about his throne) could have worked with Arab allies in the region to arm Palestinian villages and towns to the teeth in anticipation of the next battle (everyone knew it was coming). Instead, he went on to ensure that people are further subjugated on both sides of the river Jordan. With a weak army, You have to be able to fight your enemy in different ways. If you're going to have the balls to annex the west Bank as part of Jordanian Territory, then you better have the know-how to figure out how to defend it properly... If not then you put your ego aside and You enable others to defend it. The problem with Arabs leadership is that if they are not able to do something righteous themselves then they do not want anyone else to do it.	1643232162.0	huclr0c	t3_sd2pri	t1_huc2nzr	/r/arabs/comments/sd2pri/كتب_على_هذه_الشاخصة_مدفون_هنا_17_جنديا_أردنيا/huclr0c/

9srrslse	It's a nice chord progression. He is using a strange tuning I think. I work these out by just picking out the bass notes first on the freboard. Then listen for the rest. You can hear that the arpeggiation seems to switch from two chords with different bass (root) notes.  It sounds like G#m - Amaj (inversion) - G#m add 3rd on root,  C# dim minor, D#  I play it like this:  G#m on 4th fret bar  Amaj inv: 6-5-6-3 on the top four strings  G#m root 3rd: Normal 4th fret G#m but add B on 7th fret 6th string  C#m dim: 4th fret bar, like a c#minor but don't fret E on the 2nd string  D#: to sound like a harmonic climbing bass line you need to play this a  5th string 6th fret, 4th string  5th fret, 3rd string 3rd fret, 2nd string 4th fret, shaped like an open position C major.  Then just arpeggio them. Sounds pretty close but there are probably a couple of wrong notes. This would be easier to play with a capo at 4th fret using open chords, or transposed lower.	1643264162.0	huenuy7	t3_sdqgoo	t3_sdqgoo	/r/arabs/comments/sdqgoo/any_guitarists_in_the_house_trying_to_find_out/huenuy7/

u45ys	You really need to rethink this. This is trivialising a very complex and very traumatic situation.  You mentioned below that the syrian government are the 'good guys' in this game because there has to be two opposing sides in any board game. In that you expose how this isn't about education or information, its just about making a board game.  The war is still ongoing. People are still dying and you're already drawing up plans to profit from it. If you want to use the excuse of "artistic license" or "spreading information" then your board game is, by definition, not going to be fun. It will have to convey the trauma, the sadness, and the despair of the Syrian people.   The way you act is brushing away anything felt by Syrians who have lost family in this tragedy. Extremely poor taste.  Some people have the patience to explain to you why this is such a terrible idea. Some people don't so they'll tell you to fuck off. Please listen to both.	1643267359.0	huesscz	t3_sd9p54	t3_sd9p54	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/huesscz/
u45ys	Shame on you for trying to shame how people communicate. Telling someone to fuck off is a perfectly reasonable way of providing feedback to someone looking for it. It really conveys how shitty the idea they are presenting is while also declaring that you dont believe they are worth the time of constructive critisism.   If they were presenting a board game about a generic civil war in MENA then it would fine.   But no. They specifically picked Syria AND for the sake of "gameplay" have defined the Syrian government to be the "good guys". The conflict is still ongoing, people have lost so much family, and your concern is "hey be nice - be constructive".  Imagine telling someone who's lost relatives in the Syrian war to be nice to the wannabe board maker who wants to turn it all into a joke.	1643268051.0	huetsas	t3_sd9p54	t1_hue7znk	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/huetsas/

echcbgjw	Yeah bro, he's critiquing how the US is biased. They shouldn't interfered with Bosnia/s  Yeah uninformed, But where?! Saudi Arabia and the coalition has failed miserably in this conflict killing almost 400k people and the numbers are rising, they're rich in bashar al-Assad level (400k - 600k).   If you think this is uninformed, look at this map of [the population density of Yemen](https://images.app.goo.gl/LuZsLJihK2Xe8HH37) & The map of [Houthi controlled area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yemeni_Civil_War.svg) in green.  Just take one look at this [Human rights violations during the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_violations_during_the_Yemeni_Civil_War) & This record stops at 2017, Not giving any other human rights violations from 2018 onwards.  Both sides are war criminals, But you have to be an idiot not to think that the coalition has a major impact and the sole perpetrator of those human rights violations, imperialism never works, foreign intervention will always fail and will come back to haunt you, unless you of course holding your countries wealth at your hand and don't care just like the monarchs of the GCC, Even the Jordanian monarch pulled out of this conflict in 2019, It just tells you something.  Saudi Arabia has spent over a hundred billion in this conflict, You could have spent that building game and up and gaining support from your fellow Arabs, Not starving them and bombing the sh*t out of them.   But this will come back to haunt you; Because [Saudi Arabia won't survive the future](https://youtu.be/l8rxNeLfD0I).

137j1z	>- the Resistance: Syria, Russian, Iran, Hezbollah, Palestine (and some help from Algeria) >- the West: USA, Israel, syrian rebels, and some other groups  Yeah, pushing your propaganda/one sided-ness on the game? Resisting who exactly? While the civilians are getting annihilated by Russian/Syiran airstrikes and American airstrikes alike. No wonder your 'Syrian friends' like it.  Look at your cards "massive rally" "political problem" are all somehow related to foreign influence? America did hijack the war for its own benefit, but that does not mean the Syrians were not fighting against a regime also for their own reasons.   This world war in a single country would never be one sided as you push it in the game. There a different rebel factions fighting for different causes yet somehow they all fall under 'one side'. The world is not black and white. The game assuming one side is right (regardless if it was West or East) is very delusional.	1643270584.0	huex97d	t3_sd9p54	t3_sd9p54	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/huex97d/

The "other side" is free to make a game, a book, a documentary on CNN, an oscar-winning Netflix special (https://www.netflix.com/title/80101827) ....that's life. 3. There are Syrians fighting on both side. At least you acknowledge that MANY Syrians support the government. 4. You are right, civilians are the real victims, because they are here in the middle of a war between powers. I need to find a clear way, well written, on the first screen, to say that and acknowledge that harsh reality. But if ones want to make a "political" game, even biased, he should not be forbidden.... that's exactly what "the regime" (as you call it) would do.	1643272773.0	huf035u	t3_sd9p54	t1_huex97d	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/huf035u/

I for one think that the very fact that we let COD do it, we give it a pass, is actually also too easy, because COD's propaganda is very insidious. because, even though no ones say "COD is art", you are wrong thinking that it does not "raise awareness or invoke discussion", it actually invokes THOUGHTS and sets a narrative into the mind of millions of player.  About the educational/inform part. I have my personal analysis of this war. I want to convey it to others. I could write an article or make a video documentary about White Helmets ? I chose to make a game to present MY opinion. That's a choice, a liberty and the "other side" is free to do it too.	1643273601.0	huf14ty	t3_sd9p54	t1_hud06eo	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/huf14ty/

u45ys	>I started the project as a pure strategy game, and did not go in the direction of a "serious moral game"  You're taking a serious moral issue and turning it into a game. You keep saying in other comments how this is to "spread information" and "educate". Which one is it?  If its just a game or "art" as you like to put it, then accept that people are going to find your art in bad taste and call you an asshole. Just because its art doesnt mean its above being hated.  If its not just a game and its about spreading information about the Syrian war, then you're doing a piss poor job of it and you should focus your skills on something less controversial and more positive.  >If I want to portray the Syrian Gov as the "good guys" that's my choice and my freedom.

What if they made money out of the same war, profiting from emotional narrative ? How is that ok ? Because it's anti regime ? If Netflix can make a propaganda documentary and make money out of it , at least let me do my game.   You are being worse than the so called regime you despise telling me what's right and wrong.  3. I don't exploit the martyrs and civilian suffering. It's a strategy game , and the core idea is conflict between powers and geopolitical forces. I know I didn't adress the civilians horrors. But many games don't. Many documentaries don't. There are documentaries and articles about the war that only touch the conflict aspect of it. And it's OK. Not everything can adress every issues.

54ofoeft	This is why we are reclaiming the label name of Palestinian Electrical Recording Co. Ltd. Here is the story of the Palestinian record label from 1947 that one year later was taken by the Israeli to be renamed to Tslil" (bx) -one of the three oldest Israeli recording labels. The name means "sound, musical note, melody". The company was founded in 1947 as "Palestinian Electrical Recording Co. Ltd.", and since Israel's independence (next year) it was renamed to "Israeli Electrical Recording Co. Ltd." (But its name in Hebrew never contained the word "Palestine", instead it was "Eretz Israel", i.e. Land of Israel). Equipment of the company was used during the recording of the Israel Declaration of Independence (May 14, 1948; direct cutting on Tslil blanks). The company operated at least until mid-1970s. --Mike G. Jurkevich.	1643280801.0	hufa3po	t3_sdvlht	t3_sdvlht	/r/arabs/comments/sdvlht/palestinian_electrical_recording_co_ltd_details/hufa3po/

1tfwpixd	It literally says Palestine in English and Eretz Israel in Hebrew, which implies this record is from the time the company was still called "Tslil - Palestine Electrical Recording Company Ltd" Since Israel was not founded yet, and the land was named mandatory palestine.   "Tslil - Palestine Electrical Recording Company Ltd." was founded on April 21, 1947 in Tel Aviv (then part of Mandatory Palestine) and specialized in the recording and marketing of commercial records of music of Israel and classical music. The name "Tslil" means Melody. After the state of Israel was founded in May 1948, the company was renamed "Tslil - Israeli Electrical Recording Company Ltd."   Turkey just changed its name to Turkiye, in all official sites and such, probably there's a turkish label company which also just changed name.   Anyway point is, what am I missing?

9srrslse	Just saying his hand position doesn't match what I'm playing. He seems to be playing more open notes, but there isn't a good view. I definitely hear some sustained and augmented chords though. I think it is just noodling with some simple chords and a harmonic ascending bass progression. I don't hear a 7th chord in this though.  I didn't bother tuning my guitar first. It's possible I'm a half step flat causing me to miss the Am version.  I think the bass note intervals are correct in your chord suggestion. There is a root A, a 2nd (b), a minor 3rd (c) and a fourth(d), but also lastly a 5th (e) at the end. In open position there are a lot of chords the might be formed with that root B that might be right. You'd just have to listen for it. I'm too lazy to downtune and try it out.	1643303640.0	hugn5ph	t3_sdqgoo	t1_hufhhs6	/r/arabs/comments/sdqgoo/any_guitarists_in_the_house_trying_to_find_out/hugn5ph/

Up to the 19th century, speakers lived as far north as the central part of Oman.

fv8bxha6	To be Arab is to be based  Jokes aside, Arabs are a pan ethnicity from Mauritania to The Ahwaz.   In the olden days Arab were just a normal ethnicity, now arabs are A pan-ethnicity that encompasses, non arab people who are now “Arabized” like the Copts of The Nile Valley aka The Egyptians.   That’s why i say Arabs are Different people, one Nation.   Also Islam is large factor of unity whether you like it or not, since alot of ethnic groups had their ethnogenesis through religion.   Also Islam is what Arabized said peoples in the first place.   تحياتي لكل الإخوة العرب   To be an Arab is to Speak arabic and to belong to an Arab Country or an Arab People; Sudan, the sudanese  or Algeria & the Algerians.	1643330071.0	huilggh	t3_sebgbo	t3_sebgbo	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/huilggh/

6x4b0pee	Here are some excerpts from Eugene Rogan’s *The Arabs*, which touch on the influence of Levantine Christians on Arab identity and nationalism; these excerpts are by no means comprehensive, but maybe they can serve as helpful starting points:   >Beirut and Cairo emerged as the two main centers for journalism and publishing in the Arab world, and they remain so today. Lebanon in the mid-nineteenth century was in the midst of a major literary revival, known in Arabic as the nahda, or “renaissance.” **Muslim and Christian intellectuals, encouraged by the power of the (often missionary-owned) printing press, were actively engaged in writing dictionaries and encyclopedias and publishing editions of the great classics of Arabic literature and thought.**      >   >The nahda was an exciting moment of intellectual rediscovery and of cultural definition, as the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire began to relate to the glories of their pre-Ottoman past. T**he movement embraced all Arabic-speaking peoples without distinction by sect or region and planted the seed of an idea that would prove hugely influential in Arab politics: that the Arabs were a nation, defined by a common language, culture, and history. In the aftermath of the violent conflicts of 1860 in Mount Lebanon and Damascus, this positive new vision was particularly important in healing deep communal divides.** Newspapers played a key role in diffusing these ideas. One of the leading luminaries of the nahda, \[Lebanese Christian\] Butrus al-Bustani, declared in 1859 that newspapers were “among the most important vehicles in educating the public.”  &#x200B;  >Two critical works appeared in the immediate aftermath of the first Arab-Israeli War that set the tone for Arab self-criticism and reform. **The first was written by \[Syrian Christian\] Constantine Zurayk, one of the great Arab intellectuals of the twentieth century. . . . He spent his life between academic and public service in Lebanon and Syria, and wrote a string of hugely influential works on Arab nationalism.** It was Zurayk who gave the 1948 war its Arabic name, al-Nakba, with his influential tract Ma’nat al-Nakba (or, “The Meaning of the Disaster”), published in Beirut at the height of the war in August 1948.   >   >   The second landmark book was written by a Palestinian notable named Musa Alami. The son of a former mayor of Jerusalem, Alami studied law at Cambridge before entering service with the mandate government in Palestine. He rose to the rank of Arab secretary to the high commissioner and crown counsel before resigning in 1937 at the height of the Arab Revolt, to enter private practice and support the nationalist movement. Alami represented Palestinian aspirations in the London conferences of 1939 and 1946–1947 and served as Palestinian representative to the formative meetings of the Arab League. His March 1949 essay ’Ibrat Filastin (“The Lesson of Palestine”), reflected on the Arabs’ total defeat and the route to national regeneration.   >   >   Both authors recognized that the loss of Palestine and the creation of Israel opened a dangerous new chapter in Arab history. “The defeat of the Arabs in Palestine,” Zurayk warned, “is no simple setback or light, passing evil. It is a disaster in every sense of the word and one of the harshest of the trials and tribulations with which the Arabs have been afflicted throughout their long history—a history   marked by numerous trials and tribulations.” Arab failure to confront this new danger would condemn them to a future of division and rule, not so unlike the colonial era from which they were only just gaining their independence. Given the similarities in their diagnoses of Arab ills, it is not surprising that Alami and Zurayk recommended similar cures. The spectacle of Arab divisions impressed on both men the need for Arab unity. The post–World War I settlement, and the partition of the Arab world between Britain and France, had fragmented and weakened the Arab nation. **The Arabs, they argued, would only realize their potential as a people by overcoming the divisions of the imperial order through Arab unity.** They recognized the contradictions between narrow nation-state nationalism (e.g., the distinct nationalism of Egyptians or Syrians) and the broader Arab nation to which they aspired. Zurayk believed formal union was impossible in the short term, given deeply entrenched national interests among the newly emergent independent Arab states. **So, in the first instance, Zurayk called for “far-reaching, comprehensive changes” to the existing Arab states in advance of the long-term goal of unity. Alami placed his hopes in an “Arab Prussia” that might, through force of arms, achieve the desired unity.** The role of Arab Prussia would appeal to a number of nationalists in the upper ranks of Arab armies, as the military men prepared to take their place on the political stage in the aftermath of the Palestine disaster.   >   >   **In their response to the Palestine disaster, Alami and Zurayk both called for nothing short of an Arab renaissance as prelude to Arab unity, and as a prerequisite for the redemption of Palestine and Arab self-respect in the modern world. Their books enjoyed wide circulation and were hugely influential, precisely because their analyses reflected the spirit of their times. . . . Hence the remedies proposed by Alami and Zurayk, of a greater Arab nation composed of empowered citizens facing the challenges of the modern age with the strength of unity, struck so many Arabs as the obvious solution to their present weakness. The lesson of Palestine was that divided, the Arabs were sure to fall, and only if united could they hope to withstand the challenges of the modern world.**  &#x200B;  >The two most influential parties in Syria in the late 1950s were the Communists and the Arab Renaissance Party, better known as the Ba’th (literally, “Renaissance”). **The Ba’th was founded by \[Syrian Christian\] Michel ’Aflaq and Salah al-Din Bitar in the early 1940s as a secular pan- Arab nationalist party. Their motto was “One Arab nation with an eternal message.” The Ba’th eschewed smaller nation-state nationalism in individual countries in favor of a greater Arab nationalism uniting all Arab people. The ideologues of the Ba’th held that the Arabs could only achieve full independence from outside rule and social justice at home through full Arab unity—a utopian vision of a single Arab state freed from the imperial boundaries imposed by the 1919 Versailles settlement.** Branches of the party had cropped up in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq in the late 1940s.	1643332612.0	huiriny	t3_sebgbo	t1_huiidla	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/huiriny/

Chadian Arabic is also used as a lingua franca in the country, at least half of the population can speak it. It is also the language of the capital.  In Niger, Arabs account for less than half a percent of the population, Strangely, most bus lines in the country are owned by Arabs, and the current president, Mohamed Bazoum elected in 2021, is also an Arab, the first Arab to be elected president in the country.	1643343843.0	hujgvht	t3_se9v32	t3_se9v32	/r/arabs/comments/se9v32/saw_this_on_wikipedia_on_the_arabic_language_page/hujgvht/
4tj7cxko	You've already had a lot of good responses but I just want to add that on the history front the commonality goes back a long way, at least to the bronze age. The regions that are the Arab world, Mesopotamia, the Levant, the Peninsula, North Africa have been interconnected by trade, cultural, marital and language exchange for thousands of years. The degree and nature of that shifted over those extremely long periods but overall we have developed a lot of shared identity, philosophy and culture, especially when contrasted with the rest of the world.	1643344993.0	hujj6un	t3_sebgbo	t3_sebgbo	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/hujj6un/

8g2fp9gl	Language is simply a vessel for culture and the history of a community. It's a useful heruistic to determine who is Arab, but it is not what makes a person Arab. What makes an Arab and Arab is cultural attributes (including language) and shared history with the Arab community.   Ancestry matters on short timescales (e.g. if your parents are Armenian that means your shared history with the Arab community does not go back far even if you speak the language), but on longer timescales it becomes irrelevant. Nobody cares if your 50th grandfather was Arab or not, and it doesn't matter. Your only relevant history is one shared with Arabs.	1643348281.0	hujpdvh	t3_sebgbo	t3_sebgbo	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/hujpdvh/

4tj7cxko	I think things can and will get better because there has always been a grassroots drive and yearning for unity and feeling of cultural cohesiveness. We know it is not only outside forces that try to keep us divided and many of the very people who espouse ideas of unity will also push bigoted ideas that divide us, but over time these frictions work through and smooth out. It's never easy, but it can be instructive to look at the history of other unities. The German or Italian unifications for example, neither of these were considered inevitable before they happened, many tried to prevent them, there was a lot of infighting, religious and ethnic bigotry, etc.   It is a real key element to remember how recent our independence as an Arab people is. We were under the Ottomans for over 600 years and then almost a century of European colonisation which hasn't completely ended. The people who grew up under those conditions often had a lot of immediate concerns to worry about and were purposely less interconnected. These timescales matter because this was the period the other nations we are comparing against were building their social institutions, and these things typically shift on the scale of generations. In my opinion the goal is to be a positive link in the chain not to expect that we will totally change things overnight.	1643357296.0	huk3egs	t3_sebgbo	t1_hujqwu1	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/huk3egs/

I think everyone is having a shit day. Correct me if I wrong. What you mean by christians being second class citizens today is that christains do not feel a connection to this arab world. Christians feel isolated from the rest of the arab world and they feel more connection to christian west. This is due to a difference in religion, culture, day to day habits etc.   Also something about citizens. Arab countries are fake political entities created in early 20th century and got independence in mid 20th century. So we have had 60-70 years of some kind of independence. In these 60-70 years we have tried to fight imperialism, religious reactionarism, secterianism etc. What I want to say is that we are a new nation, a new countries and we still need more time to settle things. We still are not able to form a real citizenship. So no one is really a normal citizen with more rights than the other. Except if you are a politician. France was not created in one day or one year.   >It’s hard to feel like “one people” when you have a lot of your people looking down on you because of your religion.  Well we are not "one people". We are different people with different religions, cultures, dialects etc. No one said that you as a christian lebanese and a muslim from egypt should feel like "one people".  >your people looking down on you because of your religion.  I understand you. I also come from a religious minority group(to some extent) and yes it could be very annoying but hey people will always find a way to look down at someone or something. Don't mind them.  It is a hard subject and someond could talk about it for hours without getting anywhere. This tells us that we have a huge identity problem or we are just trying to create an unified identity.   In the end I want to ask you, What do you think is the best solution for this problem? What is your goal?	1643358380.0	huk4vtk	t3_sebgbo	t1_hujxdlm	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/huk4vtk/

pcfrqjd	Derailing a bit but as for 4:  - Palestinian authority is almost never looked at as a proper representation of the people and their decisions. It's always viewed as the Palestinian person versus the Israeli state - Palestinians are rarely looked down upon by Arabs. There are exceptions, like most Druze living in Israel and other fucked up individuals, but for the most part most Arab people sympathize with their Palestinian fellow. You might be thinking about, for example, the UAE; that is also a case of government not representing people. The UAE collaborating with Israel was a frowned on decision by most of the population and the rest of the Arabic people	1643365892.0	hukeh74	t3_sebgbo	t1_hujciv0	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/hukeh74/

48bhilp6	No, Pan arabism is about building a unified Arab country that was to be based upon 'unity, liberty, and socialism'. It took root after the Arab world failed to unify and the Hashemites were turned into British puppets. People began seeing a socialist revolution as the only way we could be free from western colonialism. Most of them tended not to be Marxist Leninists but there were groups like that.   As it was socialist, most countries rejected Islamic influence in their laws seeing it as a very right wing thing that is not relevant to current society. Pan Islamism is the idea that Islamic countries should unify whether it is in one border of geo political. Saudi sponsored the latter to try to take down Pan Arabism during Nasser's era.

azwjy	No disrespect but I really, really dislike this barometer. None of these on their own should make someone an Arab. I love Greece, the Greek language and sympathize with the Cypriot cause for example, that doesn't and shouldn't make me Greek. Despite these things, my family have no ties to Greece, no (direct) aspects of Greek culture in us, and don't speak the language. This would go for any other ethnicity Japanese, Italian, etc. Should it not be the same for Arabs? A white person could say yes to 2-4 and be considered "Arab", or even yes (as in generations ago) to 1 but no to 2-4 and be considered Arab as well  At this point "Arab" becomes more of a philosophy than an Ethnicity.	1643380008.0	hul345e	t3_sebgbo	t1_huj1q0c	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/hul345e/
azwjy	Can't speak for everyone but I will say in my family for example, if we had to choose one, my parents, even my mom who is a very religious Muslim, would prefer we (all sons) marry Christian Arabs rather than non Arab Muslims. And personally, I agree. As members of the culture we look at things on a microscopic level but when you really "zoom out" we have more in common with each other than with other cultures who share religion.  Drinking and religious practices are really the only major differences. Other things like sense of humor, music, entertainment, way of thinking (yes, despite religion) are  pretty much the same. My parents for example used to get meat from a Lebanese Christian butcher, which is something many of the Pakistanis I knew were uncomfortable with. I'm guessing because there are very few Christians in Pakistan.  That butcher moved and more recently we've been getting it from a Lebanese Muslim guy, who was recommended to us by many of our Palestinian Christian friends as they prefer halal meat. I don't think I need to even say "halal meat" freaks non Arab christians out as they think we poison it or something. This is anecdotal obviously but I think it's a good example of the neighborliness between Arab Muslims and Christians   Sorry for the wall	1643381033.0	hul5jt3	t3_sebgbo	t1_hujqwu1	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/hul5jt3/

echcbgjw	There is a rule that says:  "كل من تكلم العربية وتحلى بأخلاق أصحابها فهو عربي"  Anyone who speaks Arabic & considers himself an Arab is an Arab, it's a linguistic identity not a racial one, that's why Arabs  differ in their shapes and colors from one region to another.  I guess you being a Lebanese Christian (Maronite) has something to do with it, smooth brain idiots are pushing for a racial difference between the Lebanese people and Syrians (which is not true, historically or racially) And the Lebanese must call themselves Phoenicians although they are distant from Phoenicians (Jordanian Christians have more Phoenician DNA than Lebanese ones), It's a fake national identity to keep the status quo in power & a new way to push thier political agenda and create a fake national identity; Because Lebanon before that never had one, as a nation Lebanon is a collage of different people who call themselves different by names.  Even if we identified as Phoenicians, that wouldn't change the fact that we for the last 1300 years spoke Arabic, traded with Arabs, identified as Arabs from Bilad Al-Sham, etc...  And some, especially people living abroad are afraid to identify as Arabs to not link themselves with Saudis or terrorists, which is not the way, even Sikhs are defending Arabs; Because they know that If the racism didn't stop it will haunt them also in the future.  [Are the Lebanese people Phoenicians or Arabs?](https://youtu.be/dSZHxz6cTSs)  It's a linguistic identity after all, So be proud of it, be proud of who you are, be proud of your history, be proud of your own language.	1643393583.0	hum2zus	t3_sebgbo	t3_sebgbo	/r/arabs/comments/sebgbo/what_does_it_mean_to_be_arab/hum2zus/

9k3699ws	Did Zimbabwe speak English for 1000 years? Were they a center of English learning? Or do they only speak English because of English settler colonialism? Maghreb speaking Arabic is a product of locals themselves and served as one of many center of Arabic learning same way Aramean became a linguistic identity as it spread across the Middle East in the ancient times. Also, there were people in Maghreb who themselves identified as Arabs. People in Zimbabwe don’t. English reached them in the 1800s and nobody went to Zimbabwe to learn English. It’s because they were a direct colony of English. Maghreb wasn’t a colony of anybody.	1643399160.0	humhww0	t3_seuvsu	t1_hum9hwq	/r/arabs/comments/seuvsu/are_libyan_bedouins_arab_or_amazigh_or_both/humhww0/

3gafz17e	A 1500 years ago no one spoke arabic in north Africa. And arabic was only introduced to North Africa due to the ismaic invasions. So the situation is more or less the same. The only difference between the two is time. Secondly Arab nationalism, pan-arabism and the concept of arabness itself was invented in Europe, and was promoted and financed by the colonial states to tear the Ottoman Empire apart. The first arab nationalist group was created in paris with the help the french grovremnt, the first "arab congress" meeting that  established the basis of arab nationalism was also held in paris. Even the arab revolt nationalist flag which is a base of almost all the arab flags in the middle east, it too was created by a British man. even the word "Arab" was barely used before the European colonal influence. Without the British and the French influence there would be a big Muslim country called the Ottoman Empire that would be like a sick great power and the people who call themselves Arabs today in the middle east would likely call themselves Turks and get insulted if you called them something else, or if you told them that their culture isn't Turkish. And same goes for modern day moroccans, without the colonial creation of arabism and arab nationalism, the arab nationalist in my country would probably would be mad and upset if someone called morocco an arab state instead of a moorish nation.	1643400268.0	humktxz	t3_seuvsu	t1_humhww0	/r/arabs/comments/seuvsu/are_libyan_bedouins_arab_or_amazigh_or_both/humktxz/

i1cqgtfw	Nothing new 🤷‍♂️, But still people aren’t aware of this. I’m not against Arabic or something, I love Arabic and I’m a proud Arab but there are facts we can’t deny. Some people believe Arabic started in south of current-day Syria (Huran Area) and in Jordan, because maybe some of the oldest Arabic scripts were found in there but even if this is true, the majority of Ancient Syria still spoke Aramaic. That’s why most of our Arabic dialect consist of Aramaic words and even our accents, these old languages are why we all have different dialects. ~ I’m not denying that there were people who spoke Arabic in this area at that time of history, there were no precise borders and immigrations happened frequently to these lands. And by the way there are still few Bilingual-Villages in Syria that still Speak Aramaic like the villages of [Sednaya ܣܝܕܢܝܐ](https://www.anediblemosaic.com/sednaya-maaloula-syria/) and [Maloula ܡܥܠܘܠܐ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maaloula) and other less famous villages.	1643784779.0	hv8vzhp	t3_sihgqi	t3_sihgqi	/r/arabs/comments/sihgqi/super_interesting_read/hv8vzhp/

5ndhxkna	The Arabic language was formed from the Aramaic language. Initially as a dialect and then evolved into a separate language. Most likely the Arabic language was different dialects, but the dialect that survived is the dialect in which the Qur’an was written. The Arabic language also benefited greatly from the Persian language, the Greek language and the Latin language. But Aramaic remains the most influential on the Arabic language, without it arabic would most probably have different writing system from exampel.  That's as far as I know. I might be wrong.   >And by the way there are still few Bilingual-Villages in Syria that still Speak Aramaic like the villages of Sednaya ܣܝܕܢܝܐ and Maloula ܡܥܠܘܠܐ  Would love to visit those villages.	1643788992.0	hv91qsy	t3_sihgqi	t1_hv8vzhp	/r/arabs/comments/sihgqi/super_interesting_read/hv91qsy/

3j3dj	Aramaic was just the lingua franca of the region. They used Aramaic in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman at that time as well. All the northern kingdoms in Saudi also used Aramaic. That doesn't make them Aramaeans, all the people throughout the region identified mainly by the kingdom they lived in. In Syria, clearly Arab groups also used Aramaic.   This is not to say that everyone identified as Arabs, but there are **clear** indications of Arabs living across Syria. Not just the south. Syriac authors refer to northern Syria, Iraq, and southern Turkey as Beth Arbaye. When the Persians conquered it they named the province Arabayestan. The actual territory of Syria was just the coastal area. You can see a map [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Syria#/media/File:Roman_Empire_with_provinces_in_210_AD.png) of the Roman provinces in Syria. And you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Prima#/media/File:Dioecesis_Orientis_400_AD.png) a map of Byzantine Syria. Around 330 BCE when Alexander the Great was laying a siege on Tyre, the writer Erasthothenes wrote of Arabs attacking from Jabal Druze. That's 900 years before Islam. The Qedarites also conquered Damascus nearly 1400 years before Islam.	1643796798.0	hv9bnyl	t3_sihgqi	t1_hv8vzhp	/r/arabs/comments/sihgqi/super_interesting_read/hv9bnyl/

3j3dj	>It is hard to determine what ethnicity the majority of Syria have  Yes it is, but mainly because people did not think in terms of ethnicities the way we do today. They identified by kingdom, tribe, region, religion, etc. And this did not always map neatly with a language or culture. For example, everyone today refers to Nabataeans as Arabs, or proto-Arabs. But according to Arabs and Empires Before Islam, from over 5,000 Nabataean inscriptions, there isn't a single mention of Arabs. We refer to them as Arabs because the Romans invade them and call it the province of Arabia. We *do* get references to Arabs at this time in northern Iraq and Syria, however, thanks to the kings of Hatra calling themselves the kings of Arabs.  A great example of this cultural mishmash is the Jewish King Herod. He was of clear Arab origin, and many Jews at that time were simply Arab converts:  > Strabo, a contemporary, held that the Idumaeans, whom he identified as of Nabataean origin, constituted the majority of the population of Western Judea, where they commingled with the Judaeans and adopted their customs.[18] This is a view shared also by some modern scholarly works which consider Idumaeans as of Arab or Nabataean origins.[19][20][21][22] Thus Herod was ethnically an Arab from both sides.  These people identified as Idumaeans, and Herod's father was referred to as [Antipater the Idumaean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater_the_Idumaean). Edom was a kingdom, not an ethnic group.  Also during the Roman and Byzantine periods many Syrians, Egyptians, and Levantines became fully Romanized and Hellenized and may have referred to themselves as Greeks. They adopted Greek or Latin names and wrote in Greek and Latin. For example, we still have [the will of Flavius Sergius](https://twitter.com/NaqadStudies/status/1241223551518224384). He was a Ghassanid Byzantine soldier. We have another inscription that Ahmad Al-Jallad once posted about (he deleted his twitter account now), left by Titus bin An'am of the lineage of Al Kbr'. It was left in Hawran, Syria, and other inscriptions refer to the lineage of Al Titus. آل تيتوس  Bit of a sidenote, but in Arabia there were two or 3 northern kingdoms, Dadan and Lihyan and Tayma, who often warred against one another. They all used Aramaic as the official language, and all had their own local languages. The inscriptions left by the Lihyanites refer to themselves as a kind of ethnic group, ie: Al-Lihyani. The Babylonians conquer the whole region, and the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, sets up his court at Tayma, in what's now Saudi Arabia. So there must've been a bunch of Babylonians traipsing around in northern Saudi.	1643799846.0	hv9fqi3	t3_sihgqi	t1_hv9cg0o	/r/arabs/comments/sihgqi/super_interesting_read/hv9fqi3/

dwcsih2n	The Ottoman Empire ruled over the majority of the Arab world through local Muslim Arab governors. Additionally, the Caliphates (ruled by Arabs) did enforce the dhimmi system and Islamic jurisprudence in the Arab world has defended the dhimmi system.   Here’s a more detailed response I wrote to someone that addresses current inequalities as well, which can be read about at the Open Doors website, and which you can fact check to confirm the truth claims. That being said, here’s my comment to another person that goes into a lot more detail:  Please understand this response is meant respectfully, and is only meant to provide evidence to highlight the historical and current oppression that in speaking of. I appreciate your thoughtful responses.  The dhimmi system didn’t allow Christians to build new churches, forced them to wear different clothes, and was designed to humiliate non-Muslims (Khadduri, Majid (2010). War and Peace in the Law of Islam. pp. 196–198). Coptic Egyptians today have a blue and green cross tattoo on their wrist in reference to the historic fact that under Islamic authority, they were forced to wear heavy iron crosses that bruised their necks before tattoos became acceptable, and chose to have a bluish green color to remember this fact (https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.826.6892&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Additionally, while in theory jizya wasn’t meant to be overly burdensome, there’s overwhelming evidence of jizya being extremely harsh where it threw many families into poverty and starvation. People literally sold their children into slavery just to pay the jizya.  Here’s a quote of an early Christian bishop discussing his eyewitness account of Islamic invasions: John of Nikiû, the bishop of the Nile Delta and an eyewitness of the invasions. According to him, “Whoever surrendered to the Muslims [alternatively referred to as “Ishmaelites”] was slaughtered, and no mercy was shown to the elderly, the women or the children… the Muslims [then] plundered the possessions of the fleeing Christians, deeming the servants of Christ as enemies of Allah.” Abu Yusuf, the second “rightly-guided” caliph maintained that “Muslims eat them [Coptic Christians] as long as they live; if we perish, the children of our children eat their children.” (Ramelah, Ashraf. 2017. “Copts of Egypt: History of Repression through Today.” Secure Freedom Quarterly (1st Quarter): 4–8.).  The fact is though that the many Muslims don’t speak up against these historical acts of injustice and many support the current oppression of Christians (look at global rates of support for Sharia, which inherently involved making non-Muslims second class citizens https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/). For example, I would be imprisoned or even executed if I preached the Gospel on the streets of Mecca. This would never happen to a dawha in any modern Christian country. Additionally, the majority of countries that top Christian persecution are a Islamic countries (https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/world-watch-list/).  I don’t bring these up to try to put down Islam, but only mention these to give concrete examples of the type of oppression that I’m talking about. I believe the relation of Black and White Americans can serve as an example for the Arab world for Christians and Muslims to move beyond this painful history towards a shared common existence.	1643805497.0	hv9odpa	t3_sia0gb	t1_hv9jsgs	/r/arabs/comments/sia0gb/how_should_pasthistorical_mistreatment_of/hv9odpa/

3j3dj	If anyone has any sources on Aramaean self-identification inscriptions I'd be very interested to read them. There's an enormous confusing rift between the small Aramaean kingdoms of the coastal area such as Aram-Damascus, and the Aramaic language. The Assyrians conquer the Aramaeans and adopt Aramaic as the language of their empire. After that it becomes a lingua franca everywhere. The original Assyrian language was Akkadian and Sumerian. These languages die out as Aramization spreads.  The thing that confuses everyone is that Syria takes its name from Assyria, which takes its name from Assur, which is today in north-east Iraq. But the Assyrians were not Aramaeans, despite Assyrians speaking Aramaic today. They adopted Aramaic. Arameans were only a tiny set of kingdoms in the Levantine coast. In later Roman/Byzantine periods the entire Assyrian homeland becomes heavily Arabized (for ex: Kingdom of Hatra), while the coastal area becomes synonymous with 'Syria'. So the location of 'Syria' shifts entirely from east to west into the place where people had been Aramaeans and Luwians and Phoenicians.  I think people are also confused by the fact that modern Assyrians speak Aramaic, so there is a common assumption that the entire region outside the Arabian peninsula were ethnic Aramaeans.  Edit:  Coincidentally just found this passage on wikipedia that confirms what i'm saying:  >The Persian Achaemenid Empire (539–332 BC) overthrew the Babylonians and conquered the region. They retained the Imperial Aramaic introduced by the Assyrians...   >In 332 BC the region was conquered by the Greek ruler, Alexander the Great. Upon his death in 323 BC this area became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire, at which point Greek replaced the Assyrian introduced Imperial Aramaic as the official language of Empire, as were the names Eber-Nari and Aramea. This area and other parts of the former Assyrian Empire to the east (including Assyria itself) were renamed Syria (Seleucid Syria), a 9th-century BC Hurrian, Luwian and Greek corruption of Assyria (see Etymology of Syria and Name of Syria), **which had for centuries until this point referred specifically to the land of Assyria and the Assyrians, which in modern terms actually covered the northern half of Iraq, north east Syria, south east Turkey and the north western fringes of Iran, and not the bulk of modern Syria and Lebanon and its largely Aramean and Phoenician inhabitants...**  >**It is from this period that the later Syria vs Assyria naming controversy arises**, the Seleucids confusingly applied the name not only to the Mesopotamian land of Assyria itself, but also to the lands west of Euphrates which had never been part of Assyria itself, but merely Aramean, Phoenician, Neo-Hittite and Sutean inhabited colonies. When they lost control of Assyria itself to the Parthians, the name Syria survived but was dislocated from its original source, and was applied only to the land west of Euphrates that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, while Assyria-proper went back to being called Assyria (and also Athura/Assuristan). However, this situation led to both Assyrians and Arameans being dubbed Syrians and later Syriacs in Greco-Roman culture.	1643807168.0	hv9rfht	t3_sihgqi	t1_hv930q5	/r/arabs/comments/sihgqi/super_interesting_read/hv9rfht/

Tragically, over the past few decades its become bits and pieces of what it used to be, infested with slums and trash all around it. Thankfully, Egypt is now working to revive the area. Here are a few pictures of this effort as part of a greater plan to bring back the charm of old Cairo and move people from slums.

Since you're very "educated" on the topic I'll save you time, the best you'll find *within* religious logic is that you *could* execute apostates but don't "have" to (اي تعزيرا لا حدا) so you could choose a more lenient punishment. Like say, 20 years in jail or something. However leaving Islam being a crime in and of itself is a given, it's not questioned by anyone.  >When you find a personality that appeals to people.

z7om4	>If the believer were not to follow the religion's teaching religion turns into an identity.  It's an identity either way. "Identity" has nothing to do with it.   >I am saying that I don't see how both coincide because you are saying freedom of religion necessitate not following the teachings of religion  No, I said freedom of religion necessitates freedom from religion. Because if religion A dominates law, politics and cultural life then someone of religion B, or no religion, really don't have the choice *not* to practice. Let's say you, a Muslim, have to live under a christian theocracy. Everyday you go to school and must recite bible verses and at lunch must pray with them. If you want to marry, you must observe Christian laws on marriage and can't divorce because the church doesn't allow it. You could go to a mosque and wear hijab and pray at home, sure, but in practice you are not free to *not* practice Christianity and observe it's commands. You are not free from Christianity under Christian theocracy therefore you're not really religiously free.   Only if the state is secular can you be Muslim in peace and not have to follow these laws and regulations that you don't believe in.   Same applies if someone is Muslim and doesn't feel like fasting, wearing hijab or wants to drink. Even if they're Muslim they should still have the freedom not to practice religion if they so choose.  You're only free to do option A if not doing it is also possible. Otherwise it's not a choice to begin with.   >On the issue of marriage I said that while it's important to discuss it I just don't think freedom of religion relates to it  It objectively does.   Look, I never lived in a non-Arab country I'm familiar with these views because most ppl around me hold them. I must've had this conversation hundreds of times by now. And every time it's like a rhetorical whack-a-mole game. They think they're pro "freedom of religion" (they're objectively not) you ask do you support the right to leave Islam? No. Marriage outside shariah rules? No. Other religions preaching their faith here? No. Muslims preaching in other countries? Yes! Restaurants not forced to close in Ramadan? No. Decriminalize eating outside in Ramadan? No.   Then it's the agonizing game of them trying to argue every life choice outside of shari3a is not in fact "freedom of religion". Can a Muslim woman marry a Christian? "No" then she's not free to *not practice* Islam? "No, she's free" How is she free? "She's free to marry within Islam only". And it goes on, and on, and on and on.  In (at least Arab) Muslim heads, freedom of religion is choosing which mosque but not no-mosque. Freedom of religion is confused with freedom "within" religion, and if you're outside the religion you must never challenge it's rules and accept your lowered ranking lest you're disrespectful and (very ironically) get told "you don't understand REAL freedom" [insert 5k likes].    >Islam doesn't deny your human rights.  It absolutely does. It has no concept of legal equality between genders and faiths. Again, see the diyyah example from last time. I only chose that one because it has numbers and I don't have to write a paragraph dismantling it.

357k12ya	Yes and that does NOT make the Arab ethnicity 'new' because it dates back to the 9th century BC no matter how small the group is at one point of time. I don't get why only Arabs as an ethnicity gets singled out many times as if it's something new and confusing when every other ethnicity in the world went through the same process of assimilating other peoples with different ancestries.   Germanic **Anglo-Saxons** conquered and immigrated to the Southern Britain and they assimilated all other pre-existing Celtic people and now they are called **English** regardless of their ancestry from centuries ago.   Germanic **Franks** ruled Gallia and absorbed all other Gallo-Roman, Celtic population and others under their culture, and now they are one people called **French** regardless of their ancestry from centuries ago.   **Turkic** tribes immigrated from Central Asia and conquered Anatolia and absorbed all Greek-speaking inhabitants to their culture and now they are all called **Turkish** regardless of their ancestry from centuries ago.   Italians becoming an ethnic group only in the 18th century after unification of Italy. Yet, we don't see as many posts expressing confusion about them as we see for the term Arab. And so many examples...	1643824102.0	hvaxwo3	t3_sihgqi	t1_hvapj77	/r/arabs/comments/sihgqi/super_interesting_read/hvaxwo3/

7k696ni	For those who are looking for someone to blame; please understand the situation first   #Syrian war Summary   TL;DR a peaceful revolt was turned into an armed rebellion which turned into a civil war which turned into the biggest proxy war the history of the middle east   Below you’ll find a summary of what happened but before you check that out, you have to know a few things   1. Syria is home to a lot of different ethnic groups, the majority of them are the Sunnis, Sunni is a sect in Islam not an ethnicity but since they are indeed Sunnis, thats what the media calls them...they are basically a mix of different ethnicities only they no longer don’t identify themselves on ethnic terms but religious ones.   ***   2. The government is controlled by a minority ethnicity called the Alawites, who identify as Shia, the government claims to have the principles of Secularism, Anti-sectarianism and equality, while in reality its the opposite of that, its basically a Tribalist-Sectarian government, anybody who isn’t connected to the elites doesn’t have the political power to be successful and so they are usually bullied into giving their influence, those who don’t budge are either killed or driven away by extortion.   ***   3. Syria is a very corrupt and dysfunctional place (#3 on the world corruption index) its like a mild version of North Korea, with its very own means of state repression and intimidation conducted by 4 intelligence agencies with over 45 different branches, these agencies oversea a series of detention centres and Gulags in which hundreds of prisoners die a week from torture or malnourishment, most of those prisoners are innocents who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time   So, This is a summary of what happened, I tried to make it as short as possible while including important information;   **(Note; references are available in a comment below this one)**   •⁠Stage 1. 2011;   Mass breakout of anti-government protests which were met with aggression from state thugs (Syrians call them Shabiha), gunfire by security services, as well as the army and state aligned paramilitary militias   •⁠Stage 2. 2011-2013;   Army Defectors and civilians form the FSA (Free Syrian Army) and start fighting the government, meanwhile in the North-east, the Kurds form the YPG (People’s protection Unit) and start fighting both sides (The YPG wants to create their own country, the goal later changed to creating an autonomous region; google “Rojava revolution” for more info)   *Note; YPG is the acronym for the People’s protection units in Kurmanji (Kurd language) which is “Yekîneyên Parastina Gel”*   The regime makes an official pardon to all rebels and ask them to cease their activities, out of good intentions they release thousands of political prisoners who were allegedly “arrested in the protests”   In reality, the regime released dangerous sectarian terrorists who have been locked up before the uprising, they did so knowing that these people will join rebel groups and cause chaos among rebel ranks, among the prisoners is are Al Qaeda (and future ISIS) operatives; Amr Al Absi, Zahran Alloush, Hassan Abboud and Abu Khaled al Suri   Meanwhile...the actual opposition activists, protesters and leftists are not released and left to rot in the state prisons   The ones who have not been arrested start leaving the country fearing for their lives...but this fear is not from the regime only, some armed opposition groups start going after activists for reporting abuses and atrocities committed against civilians by these groups   Iran starts sending military advisors and IRGC sponsored militias in order to help their allies in the Syrian regime   •⁠Stage 3. 2013-2017;   Too many radicals flood in through Turkey and join rebel groups, some of the radicals were Syrian but most of them were foreign, the foreigners had no respect for the land or the people (Syrians are tolerant people because of the multi-religious and multi-ethnic environment of the country) this only furthered sectarianism and caused conflict among the old moderate rebel groups and the new radical ones   The conflict escalated when the Radicals started committing more atrocities against other Syrians because they were not Sunni   In the East, fighting broke out amongst the radical and non-Radical elements of the rebellion, the non-Radicals won....until ISIS formed in Iraq and expanded into Syria, most of the surviving radicals joined ISIS while others joined Al Nusra, which is an Al Qaeda affiliated Salafist group, founded by a former Al Qaeda operative who calls himself Abu Mohammed al Jolani; Al Nusra considers both rebel elements and regime elements as enemies, Al Nusra has done a lot of harm to the rebel cause by going after prominent rebel fighters and activists, in addition to that, they have also targeted prominent Sunni families for not rising up against the regime which only resulted into aligning these families with the regime   ISIS (Daesh) fought the Rebels, the YPG, Al-Nusra and the regime, capturing half of Syria...mostly from the rebels   *Note; Daesh is the acronym for ISIS in Arabic*   Around this time, (2014) the US-led coalition intervenes, they conduct anti-Daesh Airstrikes while secretly sending in US special forces units to conduct search and destroy type of missions   The BGM-71 TOW Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) started making their way into Syria as of April 2014, probably to combat Daesh's SVBIED attacks, the regime capitalizes on this and uses it as a main talking point to show the world that the revolution is being sponsored by the west   The FSA’s reputation is quickly deteriorating, their ranks became flooded with extremist radicals which made non-Sunni Syrians see them as no different to ISIS   In the North-East, a group of nationalist FSA fighters left and formed an alliance with the Kurdish YPG, they named it SDF (Syrian democratic forces) more leftist, Christian and secular militias followed and joined up with them, it became a multi-religious and multi-ethnic force, which claims to fight for democracy, equality and anti-sectarianism   At this point (2015) the Regime is on the brink of collapse, Russia “officially” gets involved to assist the regime, they bomb rebel groups more than ISIS   SDF focuses their efforts on ISIS, they slowly start liberating cities with the help of the international coalition against ISIS (operation inherent Resolve) while sometimes collaborating with regime forces against ISIS   On 2016, Turkey mounts its first offensive in Syria which was justified by increased ISIS presence on the Syrian-Turkish border   The FSA is no longer a thing, although all rebel groups fight under the opposition flag, they sometimes fight against each other, HTS is causing most of this and is doing a lot of harm to the rebel cause ( HTS was formerly known as Al-Nusra, Jolani changed their name so they could distance themselves from Al Qaeda)   Russian airpower and Iranian funded pro-regime cannon fodder militias continue to capture major Rebel strongholds   Raqqa which served as Daesh's capital, is finally liberated by SDF   •⁠Stage 4; 2018 onwards;   Turkey realizes that the rebels will lose and invades Northern Syria, an act that was enabled by Donald Trump as he pulled US troops from the area, thus enabling the Turkish invasion   Turkey excuses this invasion by saying that they hold 4 million Syrian refugees and they want to avoid hosting more, the last rebel stronghold; Idlib is holding another 4 million Syrians who escaped as the regime captured their cities   Turkey’s strategy includes fighting with merged rebel factions which they trained and organized (Syrian National Army) while providing support when its needed   Note; the Syrian national army is basically a gang of thugs loyal to the Turkish government, there is evidence of former Daesh presence in these groups   The Turks mainly fight SDF whom they see as PKK in Syria (See Turkey-PKK conflict) there is truth to this but it only applies to some units within the YPG...though the YPG itself is filled with PKK emphasizes   Above, I explained that Turkey justified their invasion by saying that they want to avoid hosting more refugees, yet they are fighting the wrong force, its not SDF who caused the refugee crisis, its the regime   Turkey cant fight the regime because they are protected by Russia, they can however fight SDF because as I said, it has a lot of PKK emphasizers   Turkey is displacing the ethnicities who live in the North, which are the Kurds, Assyrians and Armenians, Turkey is doing that so it could resettle the refugees in there   SDF makes a compromise with the regime and allows its forces to help it hold the Turks   In 2019, Daesh officially lost all of its territory and went underground, their activities had been restricted to kidnapping and/or extorting civilians, IED assassinations targeting regime or SDF officials, and low level skirmishes in the desert with the regime followed by Russian airstrikes, this was until the 2022 attack on the SDF held Sina'a prison  Biden is sworn in as the new POTUS and begins resending US troops into the “Rojava” region    A few things that I didn’t mention;   1. The US sanctions on the members of the Syrian regime, later on, on Syria itself; the sanctions first targeted individual war criminals, but then later on also included the prohibition of importing or extorting goods by US citizens   2. The weak US support programs for the rebels which are always a primary talking point by Syrian state media   3. Israelis conducting airstrikes on Iranian forces and militias   4. The unspeakable atrocities which happened in this war   5. The massive looting which happened	1643827842.0	hvb81r0	t3_sin202	t3_sin202	/r/arabs/comments/sin202/من_سوريا/hvb81r0/

I'm still optimistic for the future, especially because of how our infrastructures were built : the east-west algerian highway take you directly to a few meters from Oujda and the border.  Even "Oujda" can be seen in some Information panels on the highway in the western part of the country.  It feels like we just need to have a political impulse to make everything work. A few decades ago, you could take a direct train from Oran to Oujda. What a dream	1643842242.0	hvcar0d	t3_si292n	t1_hv9ndzg	/r/arabs/comments/si292n/the_perspective_theyre_trying_to_erase/hvcar0d/

That said, there are multiple recent examples, as well as needing to honestly talk about the existing Muslim chauvinism.

89g7jv3y	This thread was created in response to another discussion on literacy rates in the Arab world.  Here's the full 'thread' that I linked:  >Arabic is diglossic: the way it's written is very different from the way it's spoken. Myhill (2014) argues that this is the major explanation for lower-than-expected literacy rates in the Arab world. In this thread I show how he both overstates and misunderstands the problem.  >The article starts with a faulty premise: based on UNESCO data from 2007-2008 he argues that "of the 16 Arabic-speaking countries for which there are data, 14 have literacy rates which are lower than the average for the 180 countries listed." But this isn't actually true!  >In 2008 the global average adult literacy rate was 83.4%, so half the Arab countries he cites were above average, and some were significantly above average. It also matters WHICH countries were above average, and which below.  >His claim that "the Arab states taken as a whole are slightly above average in terms of the % of GDP spent on primary education" is misleading. The significantly different levels of development bw Yemen & Qatar is erased by treating them both as undifferentiated "Arab states".  >Yemen (70.1% literate) spends more of its GDP per capita than Qatar (97.8% literate) does on education, but because Yemen has 10x the population of Qatar but only 16% of its GDP, this means that Yemen spends $40 per citizen on education vs. Qatar's $1621 per citizen.  >This is also a great example of why I insist we have to consider state capacity. Even if Yemen were to take a brilliant approach to diglossia, other factors (war, blockade, famine, economic crisis) would still be much bigger barriers to education.  >He notes that Persian, like Arabic, features 'frozen' diglossia, meaning the written language is not based on how anyone currently talks but instead tries to preserve a 'frozen' older form of the language. But Iran is actually a good counterexample to his thesis.  >Iran went from a 30% literacy rate in 1968 to 85% in 2008 without changing anything about diglossia. If it could raise the literacy rate that massively without addressing diglossia, then diglossia must not be the biggest issue for literacy!  >To be clear, Iran's pedagogical approach (which is very similar to the Arab countries) is outdated and it absolutely needs to change. I agree with Myhill on the need to better address diglossia in education, and on many of his policy recommendations.  >Overstating the role of diglossia while downplaying material factors doesn't advance educational reform in the Arab world; it only mystifies things, so we can't understand why Jordan (98% literate) & Mauritania (53%) both speak Arabic but have such different literacy rates.  >Myhill never answers that question. If we want to close the gap, addressing diglossia will be part of the solution, but we can't assume that diglossia is the most important problem to address when so many of the barriers to literacy are material, not linguistic.	1643879418.0	hvedk1i	t3_sjeo1m	t3_sjeo1m	/r/arabs/comments/sjeo1m/a_thread_on_arabic_literacy_and_diglossias_impact/hvedk1i/

7mtqnwpf	Thanks for this.  I didn't even realise that diglossia was considered a problem until I left the Arab world. Does any Arab child ask their mother: "Mama, why am I learning a different version of Arabic at school?" I surely didn't, and to me having two different registers of a language is all I grew up knowing. We know at the time of Jesus Aramaic was spoken on the streets, Hebrew for religious purposes and Greek and Latin were administrative languages, and those were different languages entirely.  Here's a crazy thought, why don't we fully immerse ourselves in our beautiful language, Arabic? Someone in my sub r/learn_arabic was regretting learning Arabic before moving to Saudi Arabia because all business was conducted in English, and broken English at that. When I visited Poland, a country of about 40 million, absolutely everything was in Polish, all the labels on the supermarket shelf, all the promotions and menus in McDonalds and Starbucks were in Polish. Hollywood movies were broadcast in Polish (not even dubbed Polish, a narration track in Polish was overlaid on top of the film's original track) Why? Because the government insists that all imported goods and services are properly and clearly labelled in their language in order to conduct business in the country. In other words if you wanted to sell to Poles, you had to speak Polish, creating a thriving translation industry and more employment for Polish translators and interpreters. Let's compare that just to the GCC a region of 50 million people with an estimated retail market size of $300 billion (compared to Poland's $150 billion) a vast growing market that doesn't expect nor demand the minimum respect from retailers or foreign importers to translate their products and marketing into Arabic.  And while we're talking about retail shouldn't we talk about the insistence of these countries to seek foreign labour from the Far East at the expense of many poor Arabs who are risking life and limb in international waters right now looking for the most menial jobs? These Arabic speakers are currently refugees in Europe stacking supermarket shelves or shining shoes and they're doing it with pride and a solid work ethic, and they don't care for politics or political activism (a major fear of Arab leaders). A relative of mine has risked his life going from Syria to Germany and now has a job spraying disinfectant at a door of an office building. He is ecstatic, he can finally earn a living and feed his family. Shouldn't he have been offered the place of a Filipino who is currently doing that in Dubai or Kuwait or Riyadh? With the added bonus that our children who are learning Arabic at school get to actually hear and use Arabic when they're buying their Happy Meal at McDonalds or buying candy from the supermarket or whatever, reinforcing the language they are learning in school.  Also I want to warn everyone about the implications of listening to critics of diglossia, what they are actually alluding to and campaigning for. Can you imagine a world without the beautiful Syrian dialect, or the entertaining movies in Egyptian dialect, or your favourite Kuwaiti tv shows? Or if you prefer, can you imagine a world where our kids can't read and understand the Quran or 1500 years of classical Arabic literature in fosha? Because that's the world they want you to live in.  In short I agree with the author's statement that "*we can't assume that diglossia is the most important problem to address when so many of the barriers to literacy are material, not linguistic.*"	1643883117.0	hvei8si	t3_sjeo1m	t1_hvedk1i	/r/arabs/comments/sjeo1m/a_thread_on_arabic_literacy_and_diglossias_impact/hvei8si/

3j3dj	>American—and evidently Israeli—academics  Man I don't think people understand the extent of this.  I'm interested in modern Egyptian history, and the more I dug into sources the more staggered I became by the extent to which Israel controls American academia in Middle East history and policy departments.  Safran Nadav has many books on Egypt, and he was an Israeli-American Egypt expert at Harvard. He was even the director of Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Then they discovered that the CIA was literally paying him. He resigned from the Middle Eastern Studies director role but stayed at Harvard till his death. His books are still popular though somehow. Apparently being funded by the CIA doesn't end your career as an objective historian.  'Pan-Arabism Before Nasser' by Michael Doran. He isn't Israeli but he was a senior fellow at Haim Saban's Center for Middle East Policy. Saban is the Israeli-American billionaire who funds democrats and republicans to prostitute themselves to Israel. Saban has said of himself: “I’m a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel.” Gee, I wonder if his policy institution is trustworthy?!  Israel Gershoni has a few popular books on Egypt. 'Egypt, Islam, and the Arabs: The Search for Egyptian Nationhood, 1900-1930', and 'Redefining the Egyptian Nation: 1930-1945'. He's a professor at Tel Aviv University.  'Egypt from Independence to Revolution, 1919-1952' by Selma Botman. Not Israeli, but provost at Yeshiva University  'State and Society in Mid-Nineteenth-Century Egypt' by Ehud Toledano.

If we had 2 eggs each they'll cost 800 liras, that's 2,400 liras total and I need bread for 1,000 liras so a single meal can cost 4,000 liras. A kilo of tea has never been so expensive, we can't afford a kilo of tea, it costs 50,000, 60,000 liras. This (handful of) tea costs 500 liras, it's never happened before. This current situation of ours is unbearable, for God's sake we wish we could just die, I swear every night at bedtime I pray to God a missile comes down from above to kill me and release me from this torture. The situation is really bad, we have nothing left to sell. Yesterday I had to burn our blankets just so I can cook. We pick these (scraps of wood) from the streets so we can burn them in our stove. And it's everyone, 85% of people are like this, they're picking scraps from the street to burn so they can cook a bite to eat. Some people are crying because they can't feed their kids, they are smacking their kids just to stop their cries of "my God, I'm too hungry, I want to eat" and telling them "we'll get some later, we can't afford to buy food, maybe tomorrow we'll manage." There are people are going to bed without eating all day. They can't even buy enough for a single meal a day. This condition is excruciating.

wtg1y	> And while we're talking about retail shouldn't we talk about the insistence of these countries to seek foreign labour from the Far East at the expense of many poor Arabs who are risking life and limb in international waters right now looking for the most menial jobs?   this is speculative on my part, and largely based on comments i vaguely remember reading on reddit, but I think the gulf states largely employed palestinian  refugees in those positions before the gulf war, and after saddam invaded kuwait, and the gcc monarchies were worried about being next, they noticed (so the comments went, i haven't verified it myself) that the palestinians they were employing were sympathetic to saddam because of his opposition to israel.  after the gulf war they had an incentive to get rid of a potentially revolutionary (or at least restive) population by bringing in cheap labour from a different part of the world, with the added bonus of a language barrier and different culture/nationality, making it easier to otherize/separate them from larger society, and repress them.	1643953476.0	hvizh5r	t3_sjeo1m	t1_hvei8si	/r/arabs/comments/sjeo1m/a_thread_on_arabic_literacy_and_diglossias_impact/hvizh5r/

You just concentrated on this sentence that I will of course debunk it but I wasn't shocked when you couldn't respond to me about how is the Shia state of Iraq because you know its an embarrassing country!  About Saudi-Arabia, oh women rights ohhhh , first off Saudi-Arabia government prior to making women's drive, Womens had rights way more than any other women in the world, the government gave them passive income anything from $900-$2.5K as passive income.  Oh not having cinemas causes a havoc 😂, please bruv, Saudis had enough money to go to Dubai or a drive to Bahrain to go to the cinemas in that country. Thats a first , second of all as if Netflix doesn't exist , ohhhh.  Oh musicial concert as public , I agree but don't deny the Saudi Singers that are among the best that came out of Saudi-Arabia, from Rashd Al Majed, Rabh Saqr , Abdul Majid Abdual and a-lot of others.  Now look at Women's how they are being succesful and making up for what they couldn't do , remind me how is Women rights in Iraq, are they even comparable to current Saudi-Arabia 😂😂😂.  Don't get me started on how many women's in Iraq get killed by so called "honor killing" ,  we never hear that in Saudi-Arabia or proper ocuntries , why do we keep hearing that only in Iraq.     Remind me how is the stability in Iraq ?, how is the economy , are people affording to live a decent life in Iraq? , did you guys persecute the Shia Solider who killed a whole Sunni-family in Diyala or did you guys get him out of Iraq ?  &#x200B;  I would love to hear your response.	1643958112.0	hvj6zfi	t3_sjxsil	t1_hvj5r50	/r/arabs/comments/sjxsil/تصوير_نادر_عام_1995_رد_فعل_فيفي_عبده_عند_سماع/hvj6zfi/

jdcjbgw	So you went to Wiki, checked etymology, find out this:   >It is of Semitic derivation\[22\]\[21\] and is probably etymologically related to the name of the West Semitic god **Attar**, who is mentioned in later inscriptions from Ugarit and southern Arabia  and you checked the Attar page on Wiki and you saw:   >Aṯtar (**Arabic: عثتر**; Musnad: 𐩲𐩻𐩩𐩧)  But if you checked just a little bit more in the same page   >The name appears as Attar (Aramaic), Athtar (South Arabia), Astar (Aksum), **Ashtar** (Moab), Aṯtar (Ugarit)\[1\] and **Ištar** in Mesopotamia.   So two of the Semetic pronunciation are the عشتر   The عثتر you are citing is South Arabian (Yemen) and not necessarily Arabic.

jdcjbgw	Man, first the source you are sharing is a conference I've watched it twice and post it in this sub just recently [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/arabs/comments/s9ys9h/fantastic_conference_about_the_history_of_arabic/)  I said Arabic *as we know it* emerged in the 4th-5th CE, and It is the same thing said by Ahmad Al-Jallad, and  you can see from the conference how Arabic will emerge feature by feature starting by that Old Arabic inscription.  One interesting thing from that old Arabic first inscription, is that the people were praying to Canaanite gods.. and there are Canaanite  letters on the inscription itself that remains undeciphered. You can also notice the use of ha which was an important feature in Northwestern Semitic but the study of old Arabic showed that Ha was used and got abandoned later.  We should keep an open mind, Arabic was part of South Semitic languages, now it is Central Semitic. The current knowledge is probably not the ultimate truth.   I will share later a post after reading more and organizing my ideas.	1643965081.0	hvjghsr	t3_sjd5i1	t1_hvh0o7a	/r/arabs/comments/sjd5i1/areas_where_ancient_writers_said_there_were_arabs/hvjghsr/

The ambassador of Saudi Arabia to USA is a women , the ambassador to United Nation is a women. thats the least thing to say,  I am not going to start ranting on how Iran is supporting and all that crap, look at how many miltias Iran is supporting in just Iraq, [Iran in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_militias_in_Iraq), and to make things simpler is my next point .

You cannot deny the people in our country and even other arab poorer countries like Egypt , Syria, Yeman, and etc envy them on how high their standards are and they are still living in the same standards till this day, may I ask you this are we living in the same standards as our grandparents , I really don't think so (as we are both Iraqis ) , I can assure you if our grandparents seen us how low our standards have become they would literally kill us right on the spot so don't act as if anyone is better than the GCC Citizen , you would be bluffing and everyone knows this.	1643965663.0	hvjh7se	t3_sjxsil	t1_hvj66hm	/r/arabs/comments/sjxsil/تصوير_نادر_عام_1995_رد_فعل_فيفي_عبده_عند_سماع/hvjh7se/

Many socio/historical/political theories as to why that is, but could be just a coincidence.  >I found older Arabic Christian music is stronger than modern English Christian music.  Yes, for a reason. In the west it got modified down by so many political changes, not faith related purposes. You had louis 14 claiming to be a descent of god for instance and the entire lutheran church being a political psyop.  The faith was changed there. Here it didn't. Eastern Christianity is the closest you'll ever get, with the closest of them being the Syriacs (not syrians) in my opinion.  Islam is not really that far off from Eastern Christianity.

61t0a12x	I am kinda the opposite , I am an Iraqi-Canadian , and my mum is Egyptian, I lived in Canada for a good two years and half and it was the worst experience in my whole life till this moment , I was born and raised in Kuwait and left for Canada in 2013 , (keep in mind the world-wide events that used to happen in that specific time), and a little background context I used to live in a town so the nearest mall is a good 50 to an hour , the only thing we had close to us was a Timmy's and a supermarket thats it. Imagine this if your in early teen years and nothing is around you and coming from a country that everything was accessible to nothing; like bro the only thing that we can do was walking up and down a hill thats it ! That was the entertainment that I had  + the disgusting reality is that a block away , a-lot of the corrupted Arab-governments bubble were escaping from their countries and coming to the west, so in results those f\* had expensive cars to literal mansions , so I literally got disgusted, because they were living off our the vulernable people money !. I regretted that I had to go through it , I cannot regret the move because I personally didn't have any power in the decision of moving to Canada, but if I had any power I would have stayed in the gulf 1000000%  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  >If you have a college degree from the west, did that help with your job search at all?  I am currently heading back to it in April-Mayish and I am freaking out , of how boring and disgusting life is , people need to realize the west is nothing glamrous, you cannot sugarcoat it , like life is really expensive, like if your an average dude in your country , there IS NO WAY IN HELL, you will survive a month in Canada or the west, if your an Arab (non-khaleeji) but lived in the gulf , don't expect the things in the gulf to be in Canada, your going to get an ultra-shock the min you land in the west, and by the way the average people in the west are not rich and concentrate in the following fact , THE STANDARDS IN THE WEST IS WAY LOWER THAN WHAT YOUR USED TOO!  Simple things as going to the Bakala thats under. your building there is nothing like that unless if you live in the downtown then maybeee!  Going every weekend to the mall, that doesn't exist , and hanging in the mall doesn't exist (Life for real it doesn't exist) , for the people who don't know this and this is coming from a Canadian, malls in the west is built (system is built ) by going into the mall to buy and leave , thats it !!! Nothing like the gulf , were you go out and start cat-calling or hanging around the mall , nothing in that sort.  Everything is way more expensive than in the gulf , just to make things straight for the people   who doesn't know this, do you want to enjoy weekend, its basically going to your friends house THATS IT ! NOTHING ELSE.  Thats the dark reality of the west don't believe what you see in the movies, its a MOVIE FOR A REASON!   Thats my 2 cents.	1643969624.0	hvjm51e	t3_sk8srb	t3_sk8srb	/r/arabs/comments/sk8srb/any_diaspora_in_the_west_that_wish_to_return_or/hvjm51e/
fl3vadkj	Funny that you say that. I'm iraqi American but was born and raised in the United States. Where I live its super cold but luckily I'm in a decent sized metro area. One thing I do like about visiting iraq is how lively and social things are. Here in America everything is "cold", you don't know your neighbors, and with living in the suburbs everything is just so far apart from eachother. Don't even get me started on how dangerous and ghetto inner cities are here.   Regardless of all that I still chose to live in the states because we'll, I've never lived in the gulf lol. Compared to Iraq we have clean streets, good hospitals, decent schools, and I can land a decent job after I graduate.	1643969987.0	hvjmlig	t3_sk8srb	t1_hvjm51e	/r/arabs/comments/sk8srb/any_diaspora_in_the_west_that_wish_to_return_or/hvjmlig/

Don't get me started with how s* and unprofessionals schools in Canada were !😂   You need to realize the west compared to Poorer Arab Countries , YES the west is way better , but comparing the west to the gulf that's an insult to the gulf and you stated the points of why the west is way better than poorer Arab countries and that what make us reliying on the west unfortunately!	1643970510.0	hvjn9e7	t3_sk8srb	t1_hvjmlig	/r/arabs/comments/sk8srb/any_diaspora_in_the_west_that_wish_to_return_or/hvjn9e7/
fl3vadkj	No not Dearborn, that place is just as corrupt and trashy as iraq lol. It's a bit more north, alot colder, has a decent economy, and was in the news a few years ago if that gives you a hint.   Yeah I've been to the gulf before and know how it is over there lol. The thing is living in America is pretty boring but I really have no other option, personally I'm not gonna kill my career and suffer in Iraq. If iraq was somewhat developed ill definitely move over there, I probably can't even move to the khaleej because I'll either get a low salary or no job at all with the major I'm going into. So I guess I'm stuck in the USA for now lol. As for Canada, it has some interesting places. You said you lived in a pretty boring town but that doesn't mean you can't move to a place like Toronto later on.	1643970874.0	hvjnptk	t3_sk8srb	t1_hvjn9e7	/r/arabs/comments/sk8srb/any_diaspora_in_the_west_that_wish_to_return_or/hvjnptk/

9k3699ws	Fact check:  > blockage of trading routes just to cause famine in Lebanon, Iraq, Medina  The Allied powers especially Britain and France [blocked the trade routes](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/760795/Cummings_georgetown_0076M_12996.pdf;sequence=1) that caused famines especially in [Mount Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_Mount_Lebanon). I don’t think you understood what Seferberlik was. [Seferberlik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seferberlik) was mobilization of resources to the Ottoman military that worsened the shortages CAUSED BY THE ALLIES.  > selling Palestine to UK  Complete nonsense. Palestine was sold the second the British with the help of SOME Arabs took over Palestine from the Ottomans. The Ottomans did not “sell out” Palestine.   > Arab countries who are of Turkish origins and they are more attached to Ottomans and modern day Tukey than to their countries...   Way to fear monger and demonize people of a certain origin.   The Ottomans or Turks did despicable things like the [Armenian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide), [Assyrian genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayfo), [Greek genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide), as well as pre-WWI massacres of Christians and other minorities. But this Arab Muslim demonization of the Ottomans is so disingenuous and even exaggerated. The main victims of Ottoman oppression were not Muslims, but Christians. Even by WWI, majorly of population of the Middle East did not support separation from the Ottoman Empire because nationalism didn’t catch on just yet. People saw themselves as just Muslims. If you look at the [First Arab Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Congress_of_1913), Arabs only wanted reforms within the Ottoman Empire. The Arab revolt wasn’t a “popular revolt.” It was British bribing a bunch of Arab tribes to join the Hashemites who would be their puppet rulers of the Middle East. And most of the fighting was done by the British and French.

2y70gkbn	I was born and raised in Kuwait and moved to the US as an adult. Getting my masters here definitely helped me start a decent career. Do I regret moving? No. Would I want to go back to Kuwait? ABSOLUTELY! Theres no place like home where I rarely got misunderstood because I was surrounded by people who have similar experiences. In the US, I moved to the south, multiple states in the last 4 years and I still feel like a stranger. People here treat me like a shiny new toy when I go out. Work ethics here are ridiculous, its almost like they don't care as much about quality but rather how many hours I've worked and what I've done during it. Doing anything in a more efficient novel way is considered lazy and I have to really watch how I phrase things.   I found some places like arab hookah lounges where I can go and actually relax for a couple of hours without the need to constantly be doing something. My American friends have this attitude of the more we can shove into the weekend, the more fun we'll have but its exhausting. My American wife gets me tho.  What I miss the most is the food. Kuwait has tons of places to eat high quality diverse foods. Here theres a few Indian places but their best dishes are mild butter chicken. I have to try 10 times as hard to find good ingredients/restaurants.

The textbook, was funding in part by the U.S government. I always found it strange how different colleges would use different textbooks for languages like Spanish, German, even Russian. But when it came to Arabic it is all the same textbook.   You learn military terms, political terms, UN terms, how to say "My mother is a translator", "My father works for the U.N" long before you learn colors, animals, or even pleasantries like "Hello" or "How are you?".	1643982887.0	hvk7a81	t3_sjeo1m	t1_hvf3kyo	/r/arabs/comments/sjeo1m/a_thread_on_arabic_literacy_and_diglossias_impact/hvk7a81/

You just need to focus better so you’ll understand why the Ottomans “barred crops” from entering Mount Lebanon because the crops were meant for the soldiers on the front line.	1643990727.0	hvkqfcy	t3_sk6977	t1_hvk6fs4	/r/arabs/comments/sk6977/the_ottoman_massacre_against_aljawazi_arab_tribe/hvkqfcy/

9k3699ws	What a response. Nothing to offer. Arabs like yourself are the biggest losers. How the hell the Ottomans “sell out” Palestine when they literally [deporting Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Jaffa_deportation) out of Palestine? The people who sold out Palestine were the ARABS like British puppets [King Abdullah I](https://israeled.org/golda-meir-secret-meeting-king-abdullah-amman/amp/) and [King Faisal](https://israeled.org/faisal-weizmann-agreement/) as well as your [King Mohammed VI](https://www.timesofisrael.com/moroccan-king-says-he-hopes-ties-with-israel-will-encourage-regional-peace/). I don’t like the Ottomans, but they are just your scapegoat for being LOSERS. This bullshit is getting really old. I read enough history to know this anti-Ottoman stuff is mostly Arab propaganda because they can’t cope with fact the “Arab Revolt” [was a lie](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4283869) and their puppet Hashemis were lied to by the British.	1643991483.0	hvksgib	t3_sk6977	t1_hvk5d5l	/r/arabs/comments/sk6977/the_ottoman_massacre_against_aljawazi_arab_tribe/hvksgib/

Note the Jawazi massacre is listed, but that’s only because Libya was part of Ottoman Empire by name only. The Ottomans in Constantinople had no control over Libya by then. That’s why it’s important to read each one in context as well.

We have words from latin, greek and persian languages.

e0rprq9n	As a 2nd generation Egyptian living in the US I have been contemplating the idea of moving and living in Egypt for the past couple of years since finishing college. My immediate family living in the US is the main thing holding me back.  I am contemplating moving for 3 main reasons: I don't want to continue to plant my roots in the west. My work is youth and community development and want to do it in Egypt. Like if I am going to labor for the next 30 years, I want it to be an investment in my people and homeland. and lastly, I have not felt a sense of belonging in all my years living in America.  A lot of my friends who are also 2nd gen Egyptians have made the move back to Egypt and are happier. Granted, they moved back with savings in dollars and American degrees to earn them decent wages to live well in Egypt. They all work in education. On paper America provides a better quality of life (higher wages, better quality education and healthcare) but the way people are hyper individualized and constantly working really gets you to feel that you have no life outside of feeding capitalism.	1644006539.0	hvlx596	t3_sk8srb	t3_sk8srb	/r/arabs/comments/sk8srb/any_diaspora_in_the_west_that_wish_to_return_or/hvlx596/

82y4tjw7	Its not so much that it’s difficult to understand but that it doesn’t really make sense to me. From what i’ve been told is that Jesus, God, and the holy spirit are all God but different persons.   What does that mean exactly, is God is 3 persons yet 1 at the same time?   Jesus and God have coexisted together since forever ♾ in a father and son role even though they both are equally God?   Sorry no offense but this feels like polytheism, but because Judaism which is the religion that Christianity broke off from is monotheistic, were one God and only one God is worshipped and also that polytheism has a negative image in the middle east.   But because one of the authors of the gospels in the bible said that Jesus said that he was God and that he was the son of God, so they had to come up with a doctrine (The Trinity) to keep Christianity monotheistic were God the father, Jesus the son, and the Holy spirit are all God yet different persons.

fcsdo	The short answer is a lot of women here in Britain are keen to, because it is easier to raise children with decent morals in an Arab country and to be a visible muslimah with hijab, but only women are keen to do it because it is not their responsibility to provide for the family. They just gloss over the well paying job part.  I've known a couple of people go to the gulf back in the good old days and settle down, a couple go to Egypt / North Africa and come back after a short stint because even with money you can't stand the incompetence, nepotism, corruption, instability, insecurity, lack of healthcare and education if you don't know someone and have the cash to pay. In Europe you buy internet. In Egypt good luck. List your blessings while you have them and be thankful.  The whole Arab world is wonderful but there is a reason people are getting on boats and risking their life. If you're not with the criminal class it is really impossible to live in much of it as a normal person. I'm talking my aunt dying of cancer having a nurse steal her things levels of societal dysfunction in Egypt, for example. What quality of life and security for your children does that offer?	1644012402.0	hvmcia0	t3_sk8srb	t3_sk8srb	/r/arabs/comments/sk8srb/any_diaspora_in_the_west_that_wish_to_return_or/hvmcia0/

3dwnuceh	Definitely. I think change in the Arab world would start from Egypt. But Egypt isn't as influential as it once was, at least among it's Arab neighbors. Egypt was basically the leader in a way because it was modernized at that time (after gaining independence from Britain), every Arab wanted to get education from Egypt, the Egyptian forces were central in the wars with the zionists, Egyptian media was in every Arab house (music, movies, shows...), etc... And I don't think Egypt is as influential because the Gulf, specifically UAE somehow, gained all this sway, cutting Om Addonya's power.

9k3699ws	Fact check  > Jewish population was 43000 in 1890 and became 94000 in 1914 [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region))  Let’s break this misconception down because you seem to have this belief that “Jew = Zionist.” I’m not going to argue over exact numbers. The period you are referring to up till 1914 is what’s known as the [Second Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Aliyah). Zionism had little to do with the Second Aliyah. And once again, you failed to explain how the the Ottomans “sold” Palestine when it was the British themselves who explicitly mentioned in the [Balfour declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) of supporting a Jewish state. Ottomans did have such a policy. So you failed again to prove that other than Jewish migrations which btw was mostly not Zionist inspired or supported by Zionist organizations. Ben Gurion‘a biographer said during the 1904-1914 period that there were only a few hundred idealists. That’s not enough to create a state. Also, it’s funny your arguments is the populations when the Ottomans were deporting Jews. So that alone just destroys the argument of Ottomans “selling out” Palestine once again.  > Most of it after 1931 as a result of Nazis rise to power as I already noted.  The British had a policy of creating a Jewish state that they spelled out in the Balfour declaration. The guy who they made as the first governor of Mandatory Palestine was [Herbert Samuel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Samuel,_1st_Viscount_Samuel), the guy who the Balfour declaration originated from. Britains intentions couldn’t be more obvious. They could have ended the Mandate prior to 1933 before the Nazis got to power. Mandatory Iraq ended in 1932. Why not Palestine? Contrast with the Ottoman Sultan who was [bribed](https://www.anumuseum.org.il/blog-items/the-1901-case-how-herzl-tried-to-bribe-the-sultan/) and flat out refused Herzl’s offer. Here’s the World Jewish Congress [stressing how important the Balfour declaration was](https://youtu.be/2TCniyKPXkA).   > Uganada was only very briefly considered at the start of Zionism and was discounted for reasons that have nothing to do with the Ottomans.  Uganda was literally brought up in Sixth Zionist Congress in 1903 because they failed to get Ottomans to agree and who refused Herzl’s offer for Palestine. Here’s his [letter to the World Zionist Organization](https://www.raabcollection.com/theodor-herzl-autograph/theodor-herzl-reports-failure-negotiation-turkey) in 1902 talking about failed negotiations with the Ottomans. The British offered parts of Uganda in 1903 and this was being debated because they couldn’t establish a foothold in Palestine. Throwing people in Palestine is one thing. Establishing a STATE with resources is another. Do you understand?   > Zionists did set foothold during Ottoman era and Ottoman land laws allowed the dispossession of tens of thousands of Fellahin from their lands which is how Palestinian antagonism to Zionism started  The last sentence you just made up. [Ottoman land code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Land_Code_of_1858#1858_Land_Code) was taken advantage of by rich Arabs forcing Fellahin to debt. Because rich Jews found a loop hole to buy land from the rich Arab owners does not mean it was an Ottoman policy to “sell Palestine to the Zionists.” That was by rich Arab land owners who were mostly based outside of Palestine like Beirut and Damascus. As matter of fact, the Ottomans did their best to [limit Jewish settlements](https://ismi.emory.edu/documents/Readings/Mandel,%20Neville%20J.%20Ottoman%20Policy.pdf).  > That is dumb. According to this logic since the US backed Russia and Britain during WW2 then they are one and the same. Alliances are made based on the intersection of interests. It was in the interest of Arabs to ally with the side that won WW1, regardless of any other considerations.  The US didn’t install the Communists in Russia. The British didn’t subsidize the Russian Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution. Britain subsidized the Arab Revolt and installed the Hashemites who were unelected by the Arabs. The fact you’re defending the Hashemites is really pathetic.  > Did you just unironically link to a paper by Efraim Karsh kid? There was no myth; the tribes in hijaz rebelled backed by organizations in the levant.  Did you read the article kid or you just saw a name and had a hissy fit? According to British historian David Murphy, the Bedouins would not fight unless paid in advance with gold coin and by the end of 1916, the French spent 1.25 million gold francs subsidizing the revolt. By 1918, the British spent 220,000 pounds a MONTH subsidizing the revolt. Wow. What kind of revolt needs France and Britain to pay people to “revolt?”   Edit - also I need to remind you that it was the British and French who were doing most of the fighting. Not the Arabs who were supposedly “revolting.”  Even when the British were occupying Palestine, the Palestinians showed their allegiance to the Ottomans. The British military governor of Jerusalem asked the local Mukhtars who they hated - the British or Turks. The Mukhtars replied “I say I hate you and I love the Turks…because of my religion, my culture, my principles. You are our enemies, how can I love you?” [Source Page 28](https://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/JQ_36_Landed_Property_0.pdf)  Sorry to burst your bubble.

We are living now in one of the healthiest, most educated (even up to 60/40 more women to men ratio education) in the Arab world, one of the safest centuries (yes there is terrible war in Syria and Yemen but compared to what the Arabs had in the past these are minor wars). Also the healthiest with abundance of food. This is arguably a way better time. Hell, Isra;el's crime is the most exposed it ever been since 1948.  This boy, may god bless his soul and ease the mourning of his parents, managed to unite Arabs together, gave us the feeling of one Ummah, Muslim/Christian/Athiest alike.

At least we merely assimilated the indigenous people instead of ethnically cleansing them. Plus, it is absurd to hold us accountable for something that even if happened was 1400 years ago.  Let me put it this way, there are more indigenous languages spoken with more native speakers in the Arabian Peninsula than in the USA and Canada; Mexico I think still has a significant number of indigenous languages' speakers.	1644157657.0	hvtbh94	t3_slinxt	t1_hvsvvt4	/r/arabs/comments/slinxt/this_is_a_really_fascinating_map_languages_of/hvtbh94/

Illiteracy is bouncing back as the education system is collapsing. We do not have a proper banking system yet; we do not have a modern mailing system. My house is in a residential complex that is unfinished because the investor refuses to continue the project, plus she is constantly threatening that she will disconnect us from the main national grid and force us to pay for the electricity. There is literally no future for people as the industrial sectors are underdeveloped, and universities are shit.

hboevltl	>5000 Moroccans swam to the Spanish cities, right?  Not really there has always been problems. Morocco and Spain signed agreements since like for ever which seeks for close partnership. Morocco isn't really the one which gets the best deal out of these agreements but its something nontheless. But Spain has always misused or lowered Morocco's hand in this agreement so once Moroccan intelligance got info abt an warcriminal being entered in an Spanish hospital by choice of the goverment with an Algerian passport they right away turned back from their agreements stating that they aren't taking illegal immigration serious and putting people in danger and undermining the victims of this warcriminal. Morocco stated they would pay for this and lowered security to get the EU's attention it just showed how badly in need Spain was for Morocco's help and the EU stated that Spain should protect their own borders instead of letting Morocco do it thye also accused Spain of supporting an warcriminal and kicking minors out of their borders. Morocco also got involved and blamed for using humans for political gain. I am not sure Spain fired the foreign minister because of the failed co-operation. The after mathes is that Morocco still doesn't protect their borders and infact has cut any transports to the cities meaning Spain needs to provid them with products Morocco used to and the cities aren't making money of Moroccan markets any more.	1644185326.0	hvv74ce	t3_skopw0	t1_hvv22a8	/r/arabs/comments/skopw0/how_influential_do_you_think_your_arab_country_is/hvv74ce/

8g2fp9gl	>Let’s break this misconception down because you seem to have this belief that “Jew = Zionist.” I’  lol what?  >The period you are referring to up till 1914 is what’s known as the Second Aliyah.  Aliyah is not a period. It is just the act of immigration  >Zionism had little to do with the Second Aliyah.   Wtf are you on about? All immigration to Palestine was motivated by zionism    >you failed to explain how the the Ottomans “sold” Palestine when it was the British themselves who explicitly mentioned in the Balfour declaration of supporting a Jewish state.   I never once used the phrase "sold Palestine". All I argued was that Ottomans allowed Zionists to settle in Palestine; an indisputable fact to anyone with half  a brain.  >the Ottomans were deporting Jews.  Already dealt with the point. They deported Jews on a very limited scale in the latter years because of Turkish nationalism. Nothing to do with Zionist aspirations in Palestine   >The British had a policy of creating a Jewish state that they spelled out in the Balfour declaration. The guy who they made as the first governor of Mandatory Palestine was Herbert Samuel, the guy who the Balfour declaration originated from. Britains intentions couldn’t be more obvious. They could have ended the Mandate prior to 1933 before the Nazis got to power. Mandatory Iraq ended in 1932. Why not Palestine? Contrast with the Ottoman Sultan who was bribed and flat out refused Herzl’s offer. Here’s the World Jewish Congress stressing how important the Balfour declaration was.   what does any of that have to do with anything? I did not argue the British did not attempt to create a Jewish home. All I said was when you compare Jews population growth under Ottomans and under the mandate the difference was mostly due to the rise of the Nazis. Had the Nazis rose to power when Ottomans were in control their policy of allowing Jewish settlement would have had a similar effect.  >Uganda was literally brought up in Sixth Zionist Congress in 1903 because they failed to get Ottomans to agree and who refused Herzl’s offer for Palestine.  Exactly brought up and immediately rejected. it was not a serious scheme. Stop pretending the Ottomans were some kind of bulwark, they literally gave Herzl a medal.  >The last sentence you just made up.   You literally just confirmed you know nothing about the history of Palestinian cause  >The registration laws and the corollary concentration of land-title holdings contributed to the conflict between Jews and Arabs in several ways. Eisenman notes that the frequent failure of individuals to gain recognition of their land rights (when eventually they discovered they needed such recognition) was an important root of "hostile sentiments and antagonisms that were later to erupt between Arabs and Jews during the Mandate."32  >These "hostile sentiments and antagonisms" developed not merely as a result of the "numerous and prolonged lawsuits" fought over land ownership33  but even more directly as a result of the eviction of hundreds of tenant families from lands they considered their own when large landholders sold their holdings to Jews. Most of the two million dunams (200,000 hectares) of land owned by Jews at the end of the Mandate were acquired through purchases from large landowners    >does not mean it was an Ottoman policy to “sell Palestine to the Zionists.”   you keep saying that as if those are word i used. You even place them in quotation marks like a fucking liar.  >Ottomans did their best to limit Jewish settlements.  No they didn't. Even the British took steps in their 1939 to restrict Jewish immigration, that doesn't change anything with regards to their overall policy.  >The US didn’t install the Communists in Russia. The British didn’t subsidize the Russian Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution. Britain subsidized the Arab Revolt and installed the Hashemites who were unelected by the Arabs. The fact you’re defending the Hashemites is really pathetic.    Who the fuck is defending the hashemites? Stop putting words in my mouth you pathetic loser. You made a retarded claim that a country supporting two different actors made them indistinguishable from each other. I gave you a counter example. The distinctions you are making are irrelevant.  >Did you read the article kid or you just saw a name and had a hissy fit?   Efraim Karsh...lol   >According to British historian David Murphy, the Bedouins would not fight unless paid in advance with gold coin and by the end of 1916, the French spent 1.25 million gold francs subsidizing the revolt. By 1918, the British spent 220,000 pounds a MONTH subsidizing the revolt. Wow. What kind of revolt needs France and Britain to pay people to “revolt?”   Soldiers expect to be paid. Particularly bedouins who were rebelling on behalf of settled populations in the hijaz and levant. The same thing happened when ibn Saud sponsored bedouins to join his movement with British money. Doesn't mean his conquest was fictional. What kind of a retarded claim is that? And fyi the Ottomans tried to pay bedouins and failed to attract them. Arbs in the Ottoman army also had a notoriously high desertion rate. so it wasn't as if they were invested in that...  > I need to remind you that it was the British and French who were doing most of the fighting. Not the Arabs who were supposedly “revolting.”  Nonsense. Arabs were exclusively fighting a guerilla war in the hijaz. Most the port cities in Hijaz, Aqaba all the way up to Jordanian territories were taken exclusively by Arab forces. One of the largest battles was the battle of Tafileh fought almost exclusively by Arab forces. Allied efforts intensified in the final stages  >Even when the British were occupying Palestine, the Palestinians showed their allegiance to the Ottomans. The British military governor of Jerusalem asked the local Mukhtars who they hated - the British or Turks. The Mukhtars replied “I say I hate you and I love the Turks…because of my religion, my culture, my principles. You are our enemies, how can I love you?” Source Page 28  lool you little Ottoman dick sucker. So according to you because the Mukhtars preferred their co-religionists over a colonial power that was "allegiance to the Ottomans". That's your standard lool  Fact: The Arab revolt happened after nearly 50 minor revolts and decades of nationalist Arab sentiments rising.    Anyway...Honestly i wasted enough on this nonsense. You are either a dishonest prick or a retard who can't even comprehend the simple point I made.

And you didn't say or indicate what country you were from…boy, but thanks for putting it out there.  Secondly, the following caricature was made prior to the child's death and it wasn't used to utilize anything, and as I stated it was an observation based on the reaction the incident generated throughout the region. Nothing is said about political beliefs except for maybe the حديث used in the drawing, which is put aside from its religious significance it has truth into it that what affects a place reverberates in others with such ties to some degree.  Again there was no moral lecture and it is true that you don't have any interest for it, so you can spare me your edginess.	1644195401.0	hvvu81z	t3_slhnyi	t1_hvvo036	/r/arabs/comments/slhnyi/الحلم_ma3bs_على_instagram/hvvu81z/

9k3699ws	Zionists could not establish a Jewish state under the Ottomans. But I will stand corrected on your thesis that the Zionists were able to establish a foothold. However you failed to prove it funny enough. So I will help you despite your sad pathetic insults. This is more for other people to read and learn than you really. So I sent you detailed [link](https://ismi.emory.edu/documents/Readings/Mandel,%20Neville%20J.%20Ottoman%20Policy.pdf) regarding the Ottomans limiting settlements in Palestine. The Ottoman sultan banned Jewish purchases in Palestine in 1905 after the [Seventh Zionist Congress](https://israeled.org/timeline/the-seventh-zionist-congress/). Remember the [Uganda proposal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Scheme)? The people who insisted on Palestine rather than compromise on another place won the debate and persisted for Palestine in the Seventh Congress. Then the 1908 [Young Turk Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution) happened against the Ottoman sultan and the Zionists were finally able to get things moving. Zionist organization opened an office for the first time in Istanbul. I personally don’t like the dictatorship of sultan Abdul Hamid, but he didn’t “sell out Palestine.” But even with the Zionists establishing a foothold, it was useless because they couldn’t establish a state while Palestine was under Ottoman control.   You referred to the [White Paper of 1939](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939) that limited Zionist immigration. That paper also said that a Jewish must be formed within 10 years. Not to mention that this occurred right after the [1939 Arab Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936–1939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine) that was put down by the British with the help of Zionist militias. So idk how that’s supposed to help your point exactly.   As for the Second Aliyah, the overwhelming majority were not Zionist. That’s why I had to correct your premise that Jewish immigration = Zionist. That’s lazy. If you read about the [Second Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Aliyah) you would see it says:  > There is a large misconception that Zionism played a major role in the immigration of Jews to the Land of Israel during The Second Aliyah. While Zionism may have had some influence, it cannot be viewed as a substantial factor of influencing emigration to Ottoman Syria when looking at the greater context of Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe. The two major reasons for Jewish emigration were poverty and persecution and Ottoman Syria did not offer a respite from either.  Now for the [Ottoman Land Code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Land_Code_of_1858). You don’t seem to understand what you read. So I’ll try to help you understand a little better because you seem to believe what was not written at all. The land code allowed rich Arabs to take advantage and force Fellahin to be landless. The Zionist organizations realized a loophole in getting land in Palestine by buying from the rich Arabs. Once the Jews were buying up land especially after 1908, the landless Fellahin were rightfully frustrated that they worked so hard on the land all these years only for it to be give to foreigners. And the foreign owners discriminated employing Jews. But this wasn’t the primary problem as it affected it affected a small portion. The majority of the problem with Zionists was nationalistic. So blaming on Ottomans is again very lazy.   Also there was no massive Arab uprising. That’s made up. The [Arab Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Congress_of_1913) showed that the Arabs only sought more rights and autonomy, but not separation. Not separatism. The Bedouins did NOT rise up and would not fight unless being paid. Al Saud’s [Ikhwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhwan) warriors weren’t some artificial creation by the British. The British did give Ibn Saud a monthly allowance later on, but the Ikhwan did the fighting and conquered the Arabian Peninsula. The Allies did NOT join late. The British were [conquering Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamian_campaign) in 1915. The supposed “Arab Revolt” started in 1916. And the Arab Army did NOT do much of the fighting. An overwhelming majority was done by the British [Egypt Expeditionary Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Expeditionary_Force). The only battles that can be credited to the Sharif was in the Hejaz. The rest were done by the British. The [Battle of Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba) was just a little private adventure of Sharif without the consent of his British overlords to fight 300 Ottoman troops with his 5,000 men who were all massacred after surrendering. However [Amman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Amman), [Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jerusalem), rest of Palestine, Syria including the final [Damascus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Damascus) were captured by the British. The Arab Army just did guerrilla attacks. Any paid mercenary can do that especially when your agent TE Lawrence is leading them. It’s not revolutionary.   Cursing and insulting does not help you. Ir shows you’re desperate. Facts do not care about your feelings or mine. Focus on the facts.	1644210232.0	hvwp4uz	t3_sk6977	t1_hvvivkk	/r/arabs/comments/sk6977/the_ottoman_massacre_against_aljawazi_arab_tribe/hvwp4uz/

It's a conversation about an interview with the Egyptian footballer's (Abou Gabal's) mother, where she says dabal instead of gabal.  ‏‎‎‎‎ابويا بيقولي زمان في الانتخابات كانوا بيقولوا والرادل الدد يحب الدد .احسن ناس حقيقي<  And apparently Abou Gabal's mother also asked her son:  ‏‎ اصابتك واعره يا ولدى ؟   What on earth is going on here with this dialect...

3j3dj	> Do you think those highways were inspired by the ring system in Kuwait?  Not inspired by, but both masterplans were by British modernist planners. Dubai was by a guy called John Harris in the 1960s, and Kuwait's masterplan was by Minoprio, Spencley, and Mcfarlane in 1951. The 'old' parts of Dubai around Bur Dubai / Al-Karama, etc are a lot like Salmiya/Hawally, and Jumeirah / Umm Suqeim is very much like Jabriya, Salwa. After that the urban development changes drastically between the two countries. Kuwait sticks rigidly to the 1951 DNA. If you compare the 1951 masterplans' block/street layout with modern Kuwait it's almost identical. Whereas Dubai exploded outwards, but it didn't follow Harris' masterplan, it followed some kind of weird oligopolistic urban model that's unique to the GCC where a development company like Emaar or Nakheel just take an enormous tract of land and put a themed development on it. So as soon as you get out of 'old' Dubai you find yourself in places like Palm Jumeirah, Jumeirah Lakes Towers, Jumeirah Village Circle, Sports City, Motor City, Arabian Ranches, Damac Hills, Mudon, Al-Barari, etc. etc. These are themed and mostly gated and completely disconnected from one another.  For example, let's say you want to walk [from the entrance of Sports City to Jumeirah Village Circle](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sports+City,+Dubai+Cricket+Stadium+1+-+Dubai+Sports+City+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/Jumeirah+Village+Circle+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/@25.0586009,55.2125439,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6ddba5b95e07:0xad25a4ff383643ed!2m2!1d55.218086!2d25.043674!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6c36babd2c79:0x675853b2595d1a65!2m2!1d55.2093505!2d25.0601975!3e2). Google Earth tells me that's 1.8 km. That's about a 23 minute walk in any normal city on earth. In Dubai, Google Maps gives you a walking route of 13.2 km that's nearly 3 hours, and the route requires you to literally walk on a highway and overpass that have no pavements. You have to put your life on the line and walk with the cars or something. Totally dysfunctional system.  By comparison, you could walk from [Jabriya Co-op to Surra Co-op](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Al-Jabriya+Cooperative,+Jabriya,+Kuwait/Al-Surra+Cooperative+Society,+Tariq+Bin+Zeyad+Street,+Kuwait+City,+Kuwait/@29.3185017,48.0166281,17z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3fcf9c4321c84e85:0x8fb0cd01251ce6a3!2m2!1d48.0235588!2d29.3208411!1m5!1m1!1s0x3fcf9c778865b9a7:0x2182bb9cc6e9faa6!2m2!1d48.0032119!2d29.3132265!3e2) in 2.5km and 31 minutes.  For an urban planner, if you wanted to rehabilitate Kuwait, you have something to work with. The baladiya can issue new guidance on setbacks, pavements, street furniture and shading and cycling/jogging lanes. They could make that Jabriya-Surra walk wonderful. But much of Dubai is fucked. There's nothing you can do to make that walk from Sports City to Jumeirah Village Circle manageable unless you just build an underground pedestrian tunnel beneath all the highways.	1644231858.0	hvxjhqn	t3_sk6pp2	t1_hvr805f	/r/arabs/comments/sk6pp2/why_adam_something_is_wrong_about_dubai/hvxjhqn/

14gv6g	Stop saying “we”. Bosnia has had relations with Israel for decades. You are wholly ignorant and blinded by your obsession with Israel. The actual “we” have proposed time and again full Arab normalization with a return to pre-1967 borders and a partial Palestinian right of return. Reasonable, pragmatic terms that Zionists opposed.   The only reconciliation they accept is that in which they have to do zero compromise and we have to give up everything. Best evidence being the so-called Abraham Accords wherein Arab gov’ts normalized enthusiastically without Israel having to change anything about its settlement building and brutalizations of Palestinians. Plus Abbas being in their coalition as a mere poster-boy. He literally said the land has singular Jewish identity when historical Palestine is in fact ~49% Arab, ~48% Jewish. Jerusalem is for all of us, yet its Muslim and Christian character are constantly subject to Zionist erasure. Your mind is so thoroughly fucked.

[Source](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eh3vcK_XYAAtaUY?format=jpg&name=small). Arab states also offered full peace treaties in 1971 and 1976. The 1976 offer was when Egypt, Syria, and Jordan offered a full peace agreement & recognition on basis of UNSCR 242, with the PLO officially supporting the resolution. Called for full territorial guarantees & peace. The US vetoed it. From Chomsky, Understanding Power p.127. See [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eh3s-dNXsAA0T5k?format=jpg&name=small) and [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eh3tKe2WoAAaAzl?format=jpg&name=small).  Palestinians also offerred full peace and recognition in 1993. And the entire Arab League offered normalization in 2002 in exchange for Israel adhering to UNSC resolutions. Israel refused. The 1993 offer is even on Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website [here](https://mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/israel-plo%20recognition%20-%20exchange%20of%20letters%20betwe.aspx).  The Right of Return for Palestinian refugees is enshrined in the Geneva Conventions and multiple UN resolutions. Israel was allowed into the UN in 1949 on condition that it allow the refugees to return it has never complied.  Meanwhile, Israel makes offers such as [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1mYExWXoAEW6zY?format=jpg&name=small). 5 non-contiguous bantustans for Palestinians where they cannot have an army, nor control their water resources, nor control their airspace.

The only factions with a seed of humanity tend to be pretty left—namely Meret—but even they fall short frequently. Have the lowest expectations for Israelis and they’ll never disappoint you. You should know that as an Arab.   Not Mahmoud, Mansour, a faux Islamist who’s out for political clout. The Arab coalition was like the second largest in the Knesset for the first time last year before he left it because both Bennet and Netanyahu fought over him with political offers. He’s a full-on traitor who’s paraded around by extreme anti-Arab Zionist as representative of their benevolence toward us, just like that piece of shit Albanian “Muslim” is doing.

g77w1ho1	>support the algerian revolution  We fought for ourselves, nobody did.  It's quiet the opposite,they stand with france back there. ( their king and some of them)   In 1847, Emir Abdelkader, under pressure and strikes from the French army, was forced to withdraw with part of his army towards Moroccan lands, seeking the help of the Sultan of Morocco, Abd al-Rahman bin Hashem, and he told him by letter that the fall of Algeria means the fall of Morocco, asking him for help , but the Sultan of Morocco did what was not in the mind of the prince, he was prevented at first on the pretext of his preoccupation with putting down some village rebellions, but he went and sold the prince and made an agreement with the French army and tightened his siege on him from all sides until the prince found himself in the jaws of an enemy crawling towards him with a tractor army and a Moroccan brother stabbed him in the back and handed him a bite  palatable to his enemy.  U can find a lot of sources for this one, just Google  "خيانة أمير عبد القادر"  And one more thing, please if you don't know shit about Algerian revolution and who stand with it and not, Don't start throwing words.	1644276577.0	hw0efzc	t3_sn24yq	t1_hw055gc	/r/arabs/comments/sn24yq/footage_of_moroccos_king_hassan_2_recognizes_the/hw0efzc/
ia09b8hv	Oh come on, don't do it like that, provide some context of the events..  Tell the class about the agreement and promise the GPRA (provisional government of the algerian republic) made to Morocco, when it was newly independent and helping the algerian revolution.  The agreement was to return Moroccan land france took from us over the decades and kept as a separate entity from algeria and Morocco until 1952 when it knew we were getting independence, then it added to algeria thinking it was safe.  Tell the class how France offered all of it back to us in exchange for stopping the help to the FLN and we refused, counting on the agreement we had with our neighbors.  Tell them about how ben bella and Boumediene (that spent the entirety of the revolution in Oujda, Morocco. Never fired a single bullet) entered the capital with the "border military" and they overthrew the GPRA then refused to honor the deal, counting on backing from Egypt and Cuba.  The sand war started when Morocco sent auxiliary forces, unarmed to take back border posts back (tinjoub, hassi beida...)  These are the 50km2 algerians brag about winning in the sand war, thereby admitting the whole thing..  These are different from the area i mentioned before to be clear, these are border posts we controlled after independence, and allowed the algerian border military to use to fight France, the moroccan auxiliary forces were attacked by the border army (under Boumediene command, still practically unknown to algerians, because again he was in Morocco during the revolution)  Now we go on a Tangent and discuss algerian post independence politics, after the independence day coup, ahmed ben bella (one of the political leader of the revolution, seems like a good man but dumb af for a president) became president with military backing, revolution leaders were getting assassinated, some ran away and some took up arms against the coup (hocine ait Ahmed ) And our boy Boumediene still had a problem, he was unknown so no legitimacy to rule.  Convientlty, the sand war started, hocine ait Ahmed joined the army to fight along them, nobody questionned the leadership anymore... And a certain Houari Boumediene (originally Ibrahim boukherouba) became the savior, a year later he launched another coup and became president, nobody questionned it because he was the sand war hero... Needless to say actual revolution leaders kept getting assassinated, disappearing or going to exile.. or ruled by a man that never fired a bullet at france yet milked the revolution so hard..  Anyway, let's talk about elkhadir elhamouti, a Moroccan revolutionary that fought against france, after our independence he focused on the algerian revolution, he financed and armed, gave up use of his two ships to smuggle arms, plus his contacts with arms dealers amd smugglers.. he hosted the Oujda geoup (members include Boumediene and Bouteflika) in his house, they shared food and life, he named his son Boudiaf after one of the oujda group (Mohamed Boudiaf, became president for 6 months in the 90s until the military killed him)  Anyway, once Boumediene became president, hassan 2 sent elhamouti as an envoy, nobody better right? He just fucking disappeared once he landed in Algeria...  Fast forward to the 70s (were nearly there i promise) Franco is dying and everybody knew Morocco was claiming the then "Spanish" Sahara (since we got independence)  Mauritania was claiming a part too, so Hassan 2, Boumediene and moukhtar ould daddah of Mauritania met the discuss the situation, Boumediene agreed to stay away from the situation in exchange for Morocco dropping the claims we talked about earlier.  What do you think happened, of course he broke his word again and stuck his nose where it didn't belong.  He was then outmaneuvered by hassan 2 with the green march, he lost. Did he take it gracefully? You already know the answer, a month later, during the morning of Eid al adha, he rounded up 350k moroccans that were living in Algeria and threw them at the fucking border with clothes on their back, not a single thing other than that, he practically stole the belongings of 350k people (same number as the green March he was taking revenge for ) and to get more spiteful, he called it the black march المسيرة الكحلة.  These people included some that fought with the revolution, one case i know of, a guy had a card from the Algerian government attesting to him fighting the revolution بطاقة مجاهد، and pictures in FLN uniform. Mixed couples were ripped apart too, if the man was algerian they kept the children and kicked out the wife, if the wife is Algerian they kept her and kicked out the father and kids..  Again, nothing but love for people, despite believing Boumediene lies, but algeria as a government has been and extremely shitty neighbor since independence until today.

9k3699ws	Sorry this is just click bait. Israel isn’t going downhill. It can afford to occupy Palestine for generations to come. The Arab neighbors have been cucked into submission. They have control of the narrative. Amnesty’s report means nothing. Both China and the US have deals with Israel. The Arabs have failed and are continuing to fail.   Iran means nothing. Hezbollah mean nothing. They talk big but will do nothing. Israelis will not commit “suicide.” Palestinians have done plenty of it in the second intifada and it meant nothing. Israel is now more powerful day by day. Either an Arab Spring overthrows these stupid regimes and Arabs are free and prosperous or this will continue on.	1644281191.0	hw0p33i	t3_smzli2	t3_smzli2	/r/arabs/comments/smzli2/محلل_إسرائيلي_الكيان_إلى_زوال_ووقع_على_شهادة_وفاته/hw0p33i/

9sfh0	Why are you criticizing and (at least other people) downvoting our friend here? He is speaking the truth. There is no point in burying our heads in the sand and acting like Israel is weak or doesn’t have power. Such underestimation costed the Arab world and the Palestinians a lot, leading to things like النكسة.   What he is saying is true. Israel has a long history of attempting to make friends in Africa. Usually by sending money in order to buy votes at the UN, deploying soldiers to aid in “counter-terrorism” operations to test their weapons so it can be used later on Palestinians and Arabs, and of course their is its infamous collaboration with the apartheid state in South Africa in the field of nuclear technology (also ideological similarities).   All this does not mean it should have observer status, of course I am against this, and Morocco (the government, not the people, الله يحفظهم)  should be ashamed of supporting this. But if I had my way Israel would not even be recognized at the UN much less in the AU.	1644289269.0	hw17lhl	t3_smx5zn	t1_hvzxdzk	/r/arabs/comments/smx5zn/african_union_creates_committee_to_review/hw17lhl/

9sfh0	مرحبا بك. ساحاول ان اجاوب باستخدام الفصحى، لكن اكيد سوف اخطئ بالكتابة كثير، ارجوكم ان تسمحون لي.   ١. بنسبة لي مستواي باللغة سيئة كثير، خصوصا بالكتابة والقراءة. وانا من الاقوياء من الناس مثلي بنفس الوضع، لانني استطعت ان ادرس بشكل رسمي اللغة والقراءة والكتابة. والسبب هو ان تعليم العربي سيئ جدا بالغرب. لكن على الاقل بالحوار انا مرتاح، انا مازال اخطئ كثيرا ما لكن ممكن اتكلم بالعامية حوار عادي. اذا الموضوع انقلب الى موضوع سياسي او اكاديمي، سيكون الامر صعب لي. ولكن كما قلت، بالمقارنة مع غيري هنا فالغرب، انا احسن بكثير، وهذا نتيجة الدراسة خلال سنين، واهتمامي بالثقافة واللغة، واكثرية الناس ليس لديهم هذة الفرصة.  اصلي سوري، وللاسف لم استطع العودة الى بلدي منذ ١١ سنة. لكن علقتي مع الثقافة السورية قوية جدا. احب اللغة، الشعر، اطبخ وصفات سورية. لكن هذا ايضا نتيجة اهلي؛ هم يحبون سوريا بشكل هائل، وكنا دائما نحضر الاخبار بالعربي ونستمع الى الموسيقى العربية.   ٣. انا من عائلة مسلمة، متدينين لكن معتدلين ايضا. اذهب الى المسجد كل جمعة، ولا اشرب، واحب الدين الاسلام لكن ليس دينيا فحسب، بل لانه جزء من الثقافة العربية. لكن لا استطيع ان اقول لك ان الدين هو اساس هويتي، مثل بعض الناس هنا. بنسبة لي، الدين هو فقط جزء من الحياة، ليس كلها.   ٤. انا اعتقد ان فقدان اللغة هو تقريبا أمر محتوم. في بعض المدن بالغرب، ممكن تجد مجتمع عربي، ولكن الولد سيذهب الى المدرسة الاجنبية، ومستواه بالعربي لن يوصل الى مستوى المحليين (؟)، يعني العرب. ربما كان يختلف الوضع قليلا لو استطعت العودة الى سوريا كل صيفية، كما فعلت قبل الاحداث، لكن لا اعرف. انظر الى كتابتي، وقرر لنفسك، بالاعتراف ان هذة الكتابة تأتي من شخص دارس اللغة بالجامعة.   بنسبة للثقافة، هو حسب ما تعتبر انت الثقافة. اذا تقصد الطبخ، والموسيقى، وبعض التقاليد، ممكن الحفاظ عليها. بنسبة للدين، هو اكيد ممكن الحفاظ عليه، لكن سيختلف عن الدين الذي نشهده بالبلدان العربية.	1644298572.0	hw1qejc	t3_snay9n	t3_snay9n	/r/arabs/comments/snay9n/أربعة_أسئلة_لأولاد_المهاجرين/hw1qejc/

12bl7x	1. For context I'm originally Algerian born in France. My reading comprehension > speaking > writing (my handwriting is especially bad). I went to full-time Arabic schools in the West from ages 3 to 12 then studied in English/French from then until the end of my education (post graduate), even though I lived in Qatar between the ages of 13 and 24. Living there definitely helped my عامية but school, uni and work were mostly non-Arabic.  I can read a novel in Arabic, albeit less comfortably than English or French. I can speak عامية from الشام as well as Algerian دارجة, and broken فصحى. But I can't write a professional email in Arabic.  2. I'd rate that a 6.5/10, I'm more connected than not. I don't listen to Algerian music or watch Algerian TV, I don't really cook Algerian dishes for myself, and at home I don't speak too much Algerian دارجة with my wife (like 30-40% دارجة), but I actively keep other aspects of Arab culture with regards to how I talk to my elders/family members, taking off shoes at the house, hospitality. I also keep some more Algerian habits subconsciously, such as the way I deal with people in a business environment (direct and to the point), walking in the middle of the street even when there's the pavement, haggling when in a shop, and the concept of النيف, which roughly translates to "self-worth" and "personal honour" in Algerian culture and means not letting people put you down and sticking to your values.  3. I'm actively religious but more on the liberal side, i.e. I pray 5 times a day I sometimes add سنة afterwards, along with all the other 4 pillars of Islam, I give to charity outside of just zakat, I avoid swearing, lying, backbiting etc etc etc, but I don't hold the same orthodox beliefs about non-muslim friendships, the hierarchy between men and women, LGBT issues are less black and white for me. I don't always agree with many imams in jumu'a prayer.  4. I want to say no, but I don't really know. I live in the UK now and I see people around me from 3rd, 4th, or even just 2nd generation that have mostly lost all things that make them Pakistani/Indian/Arab/etc, but I also see others that have come to (imo) a healthy balance between UK culture and their family of origin's. I think language is the most difficult one to preserve and culture is the easiest, even if it means preparing your own traditional biryani as a Pakistani or wearing traditional clothing on your wedding day. Religion is tough, imo, because our society, both in the West and in the Muslim world, is generally drifting away from religion as we've known it the past few decades. I do think that religion is something that changes along with humans, and I don't think that, given enough time, everyone will become atheist. Think about people that claim to be atheist/agnostic but still believe in ghosts or spirits or energy; in my opinion, humans have always been and will always be drawn to the supernatural, either through organised religion or more "personal" belief systems. I myself am not as adherent to orthodox Islam as my parents are for example. For my children, I'd like them to be Muslim similar to how I am Muslim, but only time will tell how they will receive that education and what they'll believe. Inshallah kheir.	1644305086.0	hw20g7w	t3_snay9n	t3_snay9n	/r/arabs/comments/snay9n/أربعة_أسئلة_لأولاد_المهاجرين/hw20g7w/

di7fd7pj	You're implying that Ibn Saud is the only purpose that the Ottoman Empire fell, not the fact that it has been stagnant for its last 100-200 years (it was even called the "sick man of Europe"), not the Young Turks secret society that wished to create a nationalistic Turkic nation, none of that, Ibn Saud just came out of nowhere and destroyed the Ottoman Empire.    Also ever wondered why the Saudi-Ottoman rivalry existed? In the Hejaz and Aden Vilayets, and in the Arabic peninsula in general, shirk was widespread. In the 1700s Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abdulwahhab, a bookworm when it came to Islamic sources, noticed the gravity of the situation and started a campaign to spread Islam. After trying for many years eventually Imam Mohammed bin Saud (Prince of Diriyah) asked if he could back his campaign, the Sheikh agreed. Here started the call of Monotheism and ending all practices of shirk. The Ottoman Empire opposed this and waged war upon them, calling them "Wahabbis" even though Sheikh Moahmmed bin Abdulwahhab didn't add anything of his own to his writings, everything he preached was from the Quran and Sunnah.    Also the Ottoman Empire legalized homosexuality in 1858, which is far worse than anything Saudi Arabia has done in its history.	1644309250.0	hw25w1k	t3_sh6ffo	t1_hvvaiu4	/r/arabs/comments/sh6ffo/the_state_of_arab_unity_in_2022/hw25w1k/

8ldow	Good questions!  1. I did some school back home but I intentionally stayed away from Arabs so that bit me in the ass and now my arabic isn't as good as I want it to be. That said, I can still read, write and speak it fluently.  2. Very. In fact, more than they are. We always celebrated Palestinian art, beauty and folklore and arabic poetry and literature... I'm hooked for life!  3. I am an outlier in this segment. Not the best to answer this particular question.  4. Yes and no. We lived in a very one dimensional and non diverse world in Jordan. Being exposed to so many cultures, languages and traditions is a beautiful thing and it waters things down. That said, it is the responsibility of the parents to keep the culture alive. Unfortunately, they often use extreme measures like 7aram everything and make their kids hate the culture by shoving it down their throats. The most successful strategy I found is making culture, language and religious events fun! Give them a reason to look forward to them. Also accept the fact that they will likely not be homophobes, they'll embrace equality between men and women and consider hijab a personal choice and believe that parents earn their respect by respecting them... What I'm saying is, you can have the best of both worlds. I can't imagine life being better anywhere else than where I currently live.	1644316207.0	hw2e9di	t3_snay9n	t3_snay9n	/r/arabs/comments/snay9n/أربعة_أسئلة_لأولاد_المهاجرين/hw2e9di/

3im7aiaw	 >Yes, i know that, you're great-grandfathers helped us during our fight against France but at the end of the day Algerians were the one who clashed with France troops not Moroccans.   Wrong, many Moroccan fought France with Algeria. Just read about Abdelkader's emir and how many people from Moroccan tribes (Beni znassen, Moroccan Angad, etc) were fighting with him. And I'm not even going to talk about the case of Bouamama.   Respect their souls by not ignoring what they did to your country.   >Morocco stopped helping him, because the king back there made some sort of agreement with France, and they turned him in.   The king stopped because the 3 main Moroccan ports were bombarded by French which led to main riots and Abdelkader was unable to contain the french in Algeria, they easily crossed to Morocco and even beat a Moroccan and Algerian army inside Morocco.   We don't call this  "خيانة" we call this big support followed but a but defeat, Morocco itself was directly threatened to be occupied by the French. Morocco risked its own independence for you. A real "خيانة" is what the ottoman elite and people did to you, by fleeing with treasures and money and letting Algeria to its own destiny. And they didn't even sent an army to support you. But it's funny you never complain about this. You only complain about the side that actually helped you.   >That's the full image   >https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.youm7.com/amp/2021/9/6/%25D9%2582%25D8%25B5%25D8%25A9-%25D8%25AE%25D9%258A%25D8%25A7%25D9%2586%25D8%25A9-%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D8%25B1%25D8%25B6-%25D9%2584%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25A3%25D9%2585%25D9%258A%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25B9%25D8%25A8%25D8%25AF-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D8%25AF%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AC%25D8%25B2%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A6%25D8%25B1%25D9%2589-%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B9%25D8%25B1%25D9%2581%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7/5451760  >https://aljazair1.dz/%d8%b5%d8%ad%d9%8a%d9%81%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d9%85%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%83%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d9%81%d8%b6%d8%ad-%d8%ae%d9%8a%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%ba%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d9%84%d9%84%d8%ac%d8%b2%d8%a7/  Please don't share with me your regime propaganda, because I already know it.

g77w1ho1	Ah okay, i see what are u trying to do here.  Just throwing words, u just refuse to read, and keep believing that nonsense,  you said he didn't participate in the Algerian war of independence and i am genuinely correction you, and yes he did participate in the war in the war independence,  sand war and he led Algeria when it did participated in the Arab - Israel war ( Algeria fought with Egypt in Sinai, and Iraq joined Syria)   I am here saying the truth and u can find multiple sources of it , u gotta just read a article sometimes.   Houari Boumédiène :   1) Originated   The son of a simple farmer from a large  family,  He was born on August 23, 1932, Guelma City (chawi).  In the year 1948 he completed the Holy Qur’an and began teaching the people of his village the Holy Qur’an and the Arabic language.  2) The outbreak of the liberation revolution   Abdelhafid Boussouf, along with Larbi bin M'hidi, were governors who headed the fifth term.  In 1956, Larbi Ben M'hidi left the leadership of the fifth state to join the National Council of the Algerian Revolution, and in September 1957, Boussouf left Algerian soil, so Houari Boumediene took over the leadership of the fifth state.  3) Ranks he held in the army   With the outbreak of the Algerian revolution and on the light of November 1954, he joined the National Liberation Army in the western region and his military life developed as follows:   1956: He supervised the training and formation of military cells. He received training in Egypt, where he and a number of his comrades were chosen for the task of carrying weapons.   1957: He became famous since this year by his military name "Houari Boumediene", leaving his original name Boukhrouba Mohamed Ibrahim and taking charge of the fifth state.   1958: Becomes Commander of the Western Staff.   1960: He oversaw the organization of the National Liberation Front militarily to become the Chief of Staff.   1962: Minister of Defense in the independence government.   1963: Vice-President of the Revolutionary Council.  As a military official with this scientific balance, he occupied an advanced position in the National Liberation Army and rose through the ranks of the army until he became the commander of the Algerian West region.    He commanded Oran from 1957 to 1960, and then served as chief of staff from 1960 until independence in 1962.  4) One of the symbols of the Non-Aligned Movement.  He played an important role on the African and Arab arena, and was the first president from the Third World to speak at the United Nations about a new international order.	1644317075.0	hw2fciy	t3_sn24yq	t1_hw0myq4	/r/arabs/comments/sn24yq/footage_of_moroccos_king_hassan_2_recognizes_the/hw2fciy/

Algeria writes to the United Nations and several international organizations and they already confirmed that three Algerian got killed and they found the remaining of the trucks.

" We can now confirm that the (bombing) site is located in the eastern part of Western Sahara near Bir Lahlou, "   According to the Assistant Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, this inspection was confirmed by a MINURSO patrol that was sent to the site of the attack on November 3, 24 hours after it was notified.

8p3cio9	Very fluent because I went to private school to learn the language & visited the country a lot as a kid  Not religious at all, but my family is still very religious  My parents (mom mostly, dad didn’t care) tried very hard to connect us to culture. I understand it and appreciate parts of it, but I find it relatively more toxic, homophobic, sexist, misogynistic, patriarchal, oppressive, and propaganda-fueled than western culture. So my choice was western culture.  The loss of language, culture, and faith isn’t inevitable, but frankly, when ~~military dictatorships~~ retired army generals are the alternative to a broken democracy, broken democracy is the more ethical choice. I know people who stayed very connected as immigrants or children of immigrants. They usually end up being corrupt bullies, so it’s a good warning sign for me!	1644333791.0	hw3ad0u	t3_snay9n	t3_snay9n	/r/arabs/comments/snay9n/أربعة_أسئلة_لأولاد_المهاجرين/hw3ad0u/

9sfh0	Sure, that’s the situation at the moment. But that doesn’t mean Israel is actively trying to change the situation, and maybe already has friends in certain places. Like you said, big countries with larger economies are less susceptible to influence from Israel, because a small amount of money or counter terrorism assistance doesn’t mean much. But smaller countries are influenced by this.   The second thing to keep in mind is that all this can change. Morocco was once against Israel, but now they are with them. And this is because there was maneuvering behind the scenes and deals with the US. So we should always be on the lookout for that.	1644334402.0	hw3bw4g	t3_smx5zn	t1_hw2qs38	/r/arabs/comments/smx5zn/african_union_creates_committee_to_review/hw3bw4g/

4feikk23	1st gen immigrant here ( moved to the US When i was 13). Honestly, from my observations on people my age or 2nd gen kids i can start to spot the cultural differences between them and same age categories back home. One of the issues is no matter how much the kids will know arabic they’ll still prefer english in their daily lives making the barrier thicker in terms of understanding religion and culture. The barrier just keeps getting thicker down the generations. Unfortunately, we’ve seen cases where parents tried to keep their kids muslim and arab like they’re in home countries but that almost always didn’t work and sometimes took a reverse direction in the internal personalities of these kids because they see something very liberal in schools and with their friends but the exact opposite at home.   Don’t ever expect to see your children acting and thinking like your cousins children who stayed in their home countries. I’m not saying it’s necessarily a negative thing but usually it’s. Trying to maintain the goods of both cultures will make you a great human being but chances of that happening is slim. I tried to that with myself and fortunately it worked but i still missed out on many experiences during my childhood during my time in the US because I wanted to stay away from haram things which to most friends sounded like the norm. I came out of high school and college with zero real friends and not much memories.	1644336403.0	hw3h3er	t3_snay9n	t3_snay9n	/r/arabs/comments/snay9n/أربعة_أسئلة_لأولاد_المهاجرين/hw3h3er/

fv1vvkwo	Because the idea that the land is stolen and all the Arabs want Palestine to be free is false. Algerians were forced to conscript while Israeli Arabs volunteer to do so, a large majority of Arabs stated they prefer to live under Israeli and not Arab rule. 77% of them to be precise, they prefer to be under Jewish rule than Arabic. A 2007 poll showed 75% of them support Israel as the Jewish state with full minority rights. 30% of them volunteer for military and police service, and stated they would fight and die for the Jewish state. You want them to have a good life yet you fight the only country that allows them that life in the region, while they suffer horribly under Arab rule in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza and the PA.	1644410347.0	hw7uaaa	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7s0hv	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw7uaaa/

1c3fctig	I might do something like that and make it in both Arabic and English. Anarchy wouldn't just help Arabs, it will help everyone except the politicians. I will explain how anarchy would function, in summary, the state is an inefficient monopoly on protection and justice, there is no protector other them or their agents, and no judge other than their judges, they have the final say, and you can't opt out, they will extract the money they need using force like a protection racket. Obviously since it is a monopoly it is very inefficient and expensive, the "protection" they provide in most cases is very low quality and in many cases they do the opposite of protection, to ensure they are the only ones that can "protect" they disarm the population to make it harder for people to fight back. If the state makes a bad choice or something bad intentionally, they rarely get punished. So the obvious solution is to abolish all states, let people live their lives, the government is not good at planning and individuals know what is best for them more than any central planner. People can organize and live freely, there is no monopoly planner or state to dictate how they live their lives for example some people want to live in communes where everything is organized democratically (as long as no one is forced to join) some want to live a traditional life in a rural area. What matters is the individuals to live free from aggression because initiation of aggression is illegitimate. many of the issues we see today are caused by wars between states, state indoctrination, some of technologies that we have created, and state policies that make people a high time preference (care only for the present and not about the future) Once the state is removed there will be an increase in wealth and quality of life, competition between individuals and firms to provide a better service for a lower price without government regulation to create monopolies or unfair conditions, no one will be forced to participate in this, since not everyone likes the way these firms operate or wants to live a different lifestyle. Of course this will be very hard as more and more of our lives is being controlled by the state, if we don't stop this we are heading towards a tyrannical dystopia and we might reach a point of no return of statist slavery	1644410457.0	hw7uhb3	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7q40f	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw7uhb3/

fv1vvkwo	Deir Yassine was done by Jewish militias that were later totally excluded from the IDF and not allowed in to the government. It was also denounced by all of the Jewish leadership in the country, there was even a case where the state sunk a war ship owned by one of the organisations that commited the murder. And Sabra and Shatila was done by Christian Arab militias who were supposed to go in and get the PLO fighters out but instead decided to murder the Arabs in the camp. Should the IDF have stopped it and helped, maybe, but is it the IDF's job to save Palestinians? I don't think so.	1644410668.0	hw7uv2e	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7so1a	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw7uv2e/

jdcjbgw	No some Algerians wanted to stay with French Algeria, and even joined militias with settlers to fight the liberation army. The referendum of independence results was a 4x percent voted No to independence.   Arabs in Israel proper have better conditions than people in Gaza, or the West Bank or Syria or Lebanon, that doesn't mean Jewish settler colonialism is a good thing, or that Palestine is not an occupied Arab land.   This strategy of dividing native population into different fractions with different life conditions is not new, it's a straight taken from the colonialism book.	1644411100.0	hw7vnbd	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7uaaa	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw7vnbd/

Your state is perpetuating neo colonialism in places like Lebanon, Syria, Sudan, etc. How dare you look at your Palestinian brothers like that? Why are you so willing to serve a genocidal entity. Do you not know what is happening in Gaza or the West bank? Do you not know how many millions of people who you are related to are thrown in camps with no food, electicity, or basic human rights?

fv1vvkwo	Also no. Most of the Arab population was removed with the order of the Arab armies going to destroy Israel. Did Israel do some terrible things? Yes. We're not denying it. But also I fail to find a country that hasn't.  It was a long time ago and a lot of Arabs and Jews have moved on, I'm going on Saturday to meet my friend is Kfar Kassem and have hummus with him, we both served as officers in the IDF, his family (who's grandfather was here in 1948) and I get along great and they're dear to me.  We just want to live here bro, we gave the Arabs all we could for peace and get rockets and terror. Also you so valiantly defend the Arabs yet I see you make 0 comments on Assad butchering half a million of his people (around 6 times than all the Arabs who died in conflicts with Jews since 1948). You guys hate Israel more than you love Arabs, and the fact you want to "free them" by putting them under Arab rule and making them as miserable as their neighbours really shows.	1644412317.0	hw7xwxv	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7x228	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw7xwxv/

jdcjbgw	Tankie is a word used by communists (incl. Marxist-Leninist), anarchists and socialists to describe people who supported soviet untion bringing revolution on tanks to east European countries like Hungary. It doesn't mean comnunist or socialist.   And so what if I crossposted from a communist sub? do we have a policy against crossposting from communist subs in r/arabs?   The point, the picture has nothing to do with socialism, but the desire of Westerners to decide borders of other nations and their fate. I don't see any relevance of socialism here?	1644415251.0	hw83zdm	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7x95q	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw83zdm/

"In a 2006 patriotism survey, 56% of Israeli Arabs were not proud of their citizenship and 73% were not ready to fight to defend the state"This survey included druze and bedouins so the numbers are even higher among the first and last percentage lol  Stop using us as "we arabs love israel" token, because based on personal experience, that is definitely not true especially since what we did last may and how our social media exploded against you lmao     Also we're very much different from 20 years ago     "Surveys in 2009 found a radicalization in the positions of Israeli Arabs towards the State of Israel, with 41% of Israeli Arabs recognizing Israel's right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state (down from 66% in 2003), and 54% believing Israel has a right to exist as an independent country (down from 81% in 2003).     And this is only from 2009, imagine how much it changed since then lol     From 2010:  "66% say they reject Israel as a Jewish and Zionist state, while 30% opposed its existence under any terms. 63% saw the Jews as "foreign settlers who do not fit into the region and will eventually leave, when the land will return to the Palestinians".     it's been 12 years and nationalism has only risen since since that poll, so numbers right now are more than you expect      oh also all these polls include bedouins and druze so even at that time they were higher than was presented	1644415323.0	hw8453b	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7uaaa	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw8453b/

1c3fctig	Roads and highways can be built by individuals, if you live in a village it will be better for everyone if someone built a road of some sort, so people are willing to pay or volunteer to build such thing, when it comes to roads between cities, there are many ways they can be built, for example a firm can build a road and charge toll for people to use it, and to compete they can provide services like lights at night etc or a non profit organization can build a road free for anyone to use, if using roads costs money less people would buy cars which is good. Airports and ports can exist in a similar, for example airport A owned by a firm that charges planes money to land and enjoy their services, it is not fair for the state to tax people who probably are not going to use airports.  Murder can be punished in many ways, I will explain some of them, let's say person A killed person B, person B had insurance from insurance company Y that insured that if he's killed the firm will punish the killer, Y has an incentive to find and punish the killer because if they don't their customers are more likely to leave and subscribe to a competitor so they will try to find enough evidence and tell A, A will deny, so they will go to a respected 3rd party to see the evidence and decide, if the 3rd thinks that A is guilty B will be able to punish him, but if A can prove his innocence later, he can sue them because he was punished for something he didn't do. Another way is for some people to band together and protect each other, these are just predictions there could be other ways to deal with these things. How and why would a "group" attack another group? It is very risky for people to do that because if they get caught they will be caught, unlike the government which commit massacres all over the world without being punished most of the time.  There is not much difference, we have the same goal the difference is what we want do in an anarchist society and how we expect such society to function, I prefer a more traditional and simple lifestyle	1644418232.0	hw8auvj	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw7x0ai	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hw8auvj/

jdcjbgw	It morphed into calling out anyone who oppose US propaganda. So it lost its meaning, same as when Algerians start using 3iach(a word for king lovers) to describe any moroccan, the word become an empty insult.  Most leftists (excluding liberals) don't buy US propaganda about China, it is not just /tankies/, people can be skeptical of China, and the same time see the propaganda the US is playing, and where it is leading, to conflict and wars and destruction of livelihood of people in China inc. Uyghur and also people in the whole world.  You should ask yourself why this subject become relevent only during the trade war (which is weird, because terrorism in Xinjiang stopped in the recent 5 years).Before, Terrorism was rampant and especially inter-race violance (not talking abt fight for liberation, no, just hatred and pure violence incidents). But things got better in recent years especially when the provaince started to take-off economically and people are less poor and well connected to the east and so on.   But just in 2017, Turkey started to liberate ISIS Uyghur terrorists (that were under interpole arrest and were in Turkey prisons) plus there is no hard evidence  for what US media is claiming (2 million arrested??) there is evidence of 5000 people in / de-radicalisation camps/  or whatever china call them and that's it. Other claims like they are forcing muslims to eat pork and drink alchool are just laughable for anyone who have visited china and saw muslim restaurants everywhere with a clear sign to respect to costums of religions of ethnic groups and not bring nonhalal food or alchool to the restaurant.   The sub is cool actually, not about international politics, but especially for putting into light ironic Liberal ideology that is rampant in US political discourse.

fv1vvkwo	So basically this is what I'm hearing.  "Please give us a state because we can't make one of our own". Jews worked hard to make this land what it is today, it was a deserted wasteland and it became an agricultural and technological paradise that gave the world that same technology you use now to bash it relentlessly. We're not going to give it away because just like Gaza and the West Bank it's going to revert back to a hell hole. Also what does Israel have in it's power? Did you know that the PA makes arrests for Israel inside it's own territory sometimes? Because the PA has a police so it does the work.  You can't built 2 terrible states and accept Israel to come in and fix the problem.

Gaza was one of the richest regions in Israel under it's control. It's GDP was close to the national average for the Arabs living there.

15m8ii	Peace,   Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, communism, liberalism and nationalism are all secular because they and the people that bring them to life exist in this world. They also all care about what humans do in this world. But the first three are non-secularist, since they do not exclusively care about the material world, but also about the hereafter.   There existed “secular clergy” (et clergé laïque), without any issue. That is the neutral, standard and original centuries long use of the term “secular” before political materialists assumed secularism inside secular.

Jordan is a poor country, there is no money to invest in education hence our for-profit private schools way better than public ones in terms of quality of education and extracurricular activities, the Church run schools they are more affordable than private ones so more students are able to join them.   the whole "subversion of the whole purpose of Laïcité" should be irrelevant because its a French internal issue, are we gonna refuse school funds out of principle because the French constitution separates church and state?	1644484783.0	hwci4fr	t3_soopdy	t1_hwcb3gs	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwci4fr/

Burkini is banned.  Prayer halls are forbidden in universities, and praying is too.  They are planning to ban it in sports, in university and even accessing to public service (like a Muslim women should remove it before going to a school, town hall, etc).

3im7aiaw	Check my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/pkasm6/francophone_vs_anglophone_africa_read_first/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) this.  Francophone African countries are less developed on average than anglophone countries. (Excluding North Africa for obvious reasons, we owe nothing to France and we are arabophone or berberophone).  The reasons are many, firstly France never tried to emancipate its colonies, they created a long run dependence, and all executive where French. Meanwhile the British favorised autonomy, which led colonialists to hire locally. By 1960, British colonies were sufficient enough to get independence, the France only decolonised under American pressure (fear of the growing communsm).	1644488861.0	hwcn6es	t3_soopdy	t1_hwb01od	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwcn6es/

67uzw	There is obviously money to invest. It's just not public money and it's going into the private system, not the public, which is one of the reasons education inequality in the Middle-East is so severe.   It's also one of the reason sectarianism persists since institutions of certains sects amass absurd power beyond what they should actually have. Not incidentally, the French were themselves in this situation 150 ago – the Church had tremendous power by subsidising their schools while the public ones were completely underfunded. Hence the creation of the modern French education system in response:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Ferry_laws  I'm not saying "we" should refuse the money – my point is that we don't have a say in it at all. An imperial power donates hoards of cash to a private religious institution for geopolitical reasons while pathetic puppet governments are powerless to do anything about their own crumbling public schools, even if they wanted to. Everything about this is miserable.	1644489685.0	hwco7ob	t3_soopdy	t1_hwci4fr	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwco7ob/
bci24ojc	**[Jules Ferry laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Ferry_laws)**     >The Jules Ferry Laws are a set of French laws which established free education in 1881, then mandatory and laic (secular) education in 1882. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l'école républicaine). The dual system of state and church schools that were largely staffed by religious officials was replaced by state schools and lay school teachers. The educational reforms enacted by Jules Ferry are often attributed to a broader anti-clerical campaign in France.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/arabs/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1644489712.0	hwco8vv	t3_soopdy	t1_hwco7ob	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwco8vv/

67n8y	Just want to clarify I am not downvoting or anything, genuinely having this conversation.  What you are describing is basically the extreme case of a free market economy. You are removing the power from a centralized entity comprised of people who are chosen based on what a majority of the people want, and just giving it to people who are rich. Basically the first to get rich will be the new government. When you just let things happen like that money and power tends to accumulate (because money and power breeds more money and power) and if anyone wants to take an undertaking like building an airport then they will have to ask for help from the same minority at the top. And ultimately they will have the final say in most big decisions. So I’m not sure you will reach that ideal you are describing if you go down that path.   Also there will definitely be violence. And, just like you say gvmts do, the people at the top will dominate. Your solution will not fix the problem, I don’t really understand why you think it would. Society would create a hierarchy and the people at the top will be able to have more resources and force their will on the people under them.  Another point is: what is your chance of social mobility in the society you just described? If you are born in a rich family you will be rich your whole life whereas if you are born in a poor family you will have a very uphill battle if schools aren’t free, or hospitals or your village doesn’t have roads…   I guess my whole point can be summarized into: what you are describing is removing the power from a centralized entity voted in by what a majority of the people want and replacing it with a group of rich people. I understand the free market reign in an idealized world where competition would push people to be better but that’s not reality. Reality is that if they are left alone, these markets actually become very controlled. Just look at big pharma, MIC, big oil… in the US. Or actually, just look at any Arabic “government” and you can see what that looks like.	1644495830.0	hwcwuld	t3_so6d0c	t1_hw8auvj	/r/arabs/comments/so6d0c/westerners_stop_drawing_other_peoples_borders/hwcwuld/

This means that the individual rights of people to express their religion in public is suppressed by the state. The state, in other words, controls religion in the French culture.   In the English-speaking countries, there is free exercise of religion and it is views as both an individual right and a minority protection issue.   Thus, in the United States, a public ban on the hijab would immediately be struck down by the Courts as a blatant violation of the First Amendment.	1644503661.0	hwdcnx6	t3_soopdy	t1_hwacd49	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwdcnx6/

But that irrelevant though. Half of the Kuwaitis don’t even know about this.   But why are turning this into a competition of who suffered the most? Well obviously you’ll suffered the most because your population was a lot more, and your tyrant brought it to himself. I’d blame saddam for trying to dare the world, and I blame bush jr for escalating the decision of whether or not to invade.  If I go choose the lesser of two evils, I’d rather not choose at all.  Either saddam is in power but oppression and Persecution will increase and uday will take his place later   Or  Kill him and let militias pour hell everywhere.  Both are bad choices, rather just leave it be.

d4utf	Again, how many Kuwaiti civilians died in the Gulf war?  .....Are you trying to justify the 2003 Iraq War? Saddam was very cooperative, got rid of all of the Iraqi Army's effective weaponry and "WMDs", allowed inspectors to roam every inch of Iraq, returned POWs, and did everything he could've to move on. But the US accused Iraq of hidings WMDs and having Al-Qaeda training camps in Iraq, both of which are lies even more hilarious than the baby incubator story.   I'm not a Kuwait hater, but enough is enough, you've been bitching about the invasion which killed 1,000 people for 30 years now, you got your "reparations" which are multiples of what was really lost, Iraq lost 2 million of its people, all innocent, many don't even like Saddam, and Kuwaitis are still bitching and moaning. Your country's role in what happened to Iraq, all the way from betraying Iraq in the 1980s by stealing oil and purposefully destroying its economy just so that your American masters can be pleased, to hosting the Americans and letting them use your country as a military base to this date is something which will never ever be forgotten. The Americans will sooner or later leave, have you thought then what will happen after that? You complain about tyrants, what about Americans whom your leader deepthroat? You hate Iraq - fine, but what about Afghanistan, Vietnam, Syria, Somalia, Libya, and countless other countries where they mercilessly murdered millions?

3im7aiaw	I partly agree with you.   I lived in many European countries and there are indeed differences.  While I totally agree with you on US and English speaking countries. I disagree for France, because the original law was actually quite clear, secularism was mean to protect state from religion and religion from state. French secularism was meant to make the state blind about religions, everyone would be treated equally, the religious dress won't be seen as a religious sign but rather as a dress like any other.  In the last year the original law started being reviewed and its becoming more what you said.  But it's clearly targeting Islam. I mean no one ever complained about the kippa in the French congress.	1644512540.0	hwe030o	t3_soopdy	t1_hwdcnx6	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwe030o/

jdcjbgw	I am not rationalizing anything, I am just putting input to counter what is being published by mainstream media. So two information are better than one information. Don't you think?  I am for deportation of terrorists, and by terrorist I mean any member of a Djihadist movement like ISIS, Nosra, ETIM... I care about Uyghur people, and met maby and I don't want their lives to be destroyed like their neighbors in Afghanistan. I also care about the billion of Chinese people who their nation is clearly threatened by the US and its CIA games.   I am obviously against, chinese government following activists whether inside china or outside, but Chinese autorities have also the responsibiliy to preserve security in their country, by catching terrorists that are being trained in Syria in order to come back and fight (this is what the terrorists are saying not me) and there is almost no mention of Uyghur fighters in the mainstream media, making it look like China is a crazy atheist country hate islam and ao on while hundereds of millions of muslim chinese living their lives peacefully.   Finally, you didn't respond yesterday about my comment, have you seen by yourself the evidence of Uyghur genocide? that become cultural genocide when you read the article then become bilingual teaching and han/non-han mixed education in order to foster ethnic group collaboration?   China is not Europe in term of humab rights, sure,  but it is not the dystopian picture they are portraying in the media, it is what it is, and it is better than what the west is offering. With economic progress, people will start to ask for other rights and so on. So it is a progress than a dictatoriship that will be supported by the US because it sells the country to the white man.    To push the logic further, I would support any geniune emancipation of Central asian countries including a true nationalism, that will seperate some land from china but what is happening now is a shitshow of US interests and Islamist extremism.	1644515276.0	hwe7lc2	t3_sp1e2i	t1_hwdw590	/r/arabs/comments/sp1e2i/china_uses_black_sites_in_uae_to_target_and/hwe7lc2/
