qn6e0	I'm still "confused" (yeah I must be dumb or something :) ).  This comment you linked is like me saying *"the sound between "change" and "lion" is not the last "e" of "change" being pronounced in a weird way, it's actually the word "en" that is in-between these two words"*. How is that helping?  Plus, there are subtitles in this video. It's up to you to match the words based on what you hear and what you read. If they weren't there, I would understand that (some, not all) comments would need to explain things more deeply. But that's not the case.  Again, I insist, the *"nous"* is clearly NOT spoken fast, u/Dietzgen17 was completely right about that, and he did not deserve to be flamed and downvoted like that.  To put things in their original context, he was merely replying to a comment *"yes it is \[spoken\], just very fast"*. He only said *"no, not that fast actually"*. He did not directly reply to the OP. So, why does it deserve such hatred?  Also please note that the *"yes it is \[spoken\], just very fast"* comment is not explaining **anything** else either, but it still got lots of upvotes, which debunks your *"comment not being helpful"* argument. It was not a constructive/helpful/explanatory comment, but it got lots of upvotes because for some reason it was pleasing/flattering to some people having difficulties to understand French.	1641552828.0	hrmedjn	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrjqmiq	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmedjn/
qn6e0	Mmmh mmmh... I can see that you removed a comment because it was allegedly "confusing" or "wrong" or something... So why can't you remove the comments of the flamers who massively downvote someone just because he doesn't flatter them enough?	1641553120.0	hrmerbj	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrjm0rg	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmerbj/
qn6e0	Again, the comment from u/Dietzgen17 was replying to a comment from a user saying *"It is \[spoken\], just very fast"*.  He was **not replying to OP** and in that way dismissing OP's own issues about that video.  And even if he were, the comment is (IMHO) sufficient, given that there are subtitles with the video.  Proof is that the *"It is \[spoken\], just very fast"* comment, which was **a direct reply to OP**, is not explaining **anything** either, but still got lots of upvotes and still did not get any sort of criticism from you.  However, you **openly criticized** u/Dietzgen17 's comment, whereas it is exactly of the same fabric than the *"It is \[spoken\], just very fast"* one.  Yet again, double standards...	1641554626.0	hrmgtr1	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrjogds	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmgtr1/
qn6e0	And yet again, *"no, it's not that fast"* was a reply to *"it is \[spoken\], just really fast"*.  I don't see why the author would have needed to explain things more deeply, and why you had to openly criticize him (and me for supporting him and sharing his opinion as a native).  I invite you to read some of my other comments, especially the one I wrote to u/kiwigoguy1 or to u/eternalgreen yesterday. I can, too, write constructive and argumented comments.  What I don't like is when people criticize other people who didn't do anything wrong (and also gang up on them via a massive downvoting).	1641555194.0	hrmhm2m	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrjqpft	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmhm2m/
qn6e0	I don't agree that slang is important to learn. You can be understood (and "survive" :) ) without speaking slang, and natives can also speak to you without needing to resort to slang.  Also, you take the risk of inadvertedly using slang in a situation when you should definitely NOT (e.g. with business partners or a superior or a kind stranger in the street and whatnot)  Plus, there are many levels of slang. Which one should you stop at?  French is hard enough that you don't need to add another layer of difficulty (although you seem to master it quite well as it is! **very** impressive! 😎🤩👍 honestly)  Also, *"ognon"* is not slang (not sure if you thought it was), it's a new written form of the word *"oignon"* and the work of some bureaucrats being bored and reinventing the wheel.  It's the same thing with "nénuphar" that got changed to "nénufar" because of alledged arabic origins and because there was no "ph" in arabic, only "f" (oh, but there were "é"? \^\^). But if you scratch the surface, you discover that:  * the latin (*"nuphar"*) and greek (*"noupharo"*) origins of the word go back to the 4th century, which is more than old enough in order to consider this form valid and keep it, especially since French is very deeply rooted in greek+latin * before the arabic origin, there also were the persian origin and even before that the sanskrit origin of the word, so why not rather base the spelling of *"nénuphar"* on these origins?  >qu’à mon avis, personne ne sait jamais et devait être définitivement effacé de la pédagogie du FLE  Sorry, what did you mean there? If you feel "so-so", you can **perfectly** say *"comme ci comme ça"*, I would not qualify it as slang at all. *"mouais"* might be... but it would be a very very very light form of slang (as *"ouais"* is hardly slang, unlike *"meuf"* would).  PS: "différencier", "comme ci", "donc" is better than "du coup", also you really should (must) use "vous" with people you don't know (like me) unless they are kids (which I'm not :) )  PS2: I also deeply appreciate that you put a space before punctuation signs composed of two parts (unlike in English); most natives don't know/apply this rule	1641556632.0	hrmjpir	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrjqrhu	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmjpir/

qn6e0	>Now you're asking me to REMOVE comments that you don't like.  I said *"remove the comments of the flamers"*, not *"remove the comments that I dislike"*.  >Wrong.  Oh, so what does *"you obviously misunderstand what the other person said"* mean, then?  >Now you're on the verge of being rude.  Yeah sure, if disagreeing with you is being "rude", then I sure am. Proof is that you censored several of my comments for false reasons like "disrespect" or something.	1641563585.0	hrmwcnh	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrmg19m	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmwcnh/
qn6e0	>your opinion isn't better than theirs  It sure means to me that I am not allowed to talk. Otherwise why would you bother writing this to me whereas I didn't say anything disrespectful or rude?  Or, please, quote where I was rude in the said comment. As a reminder, my comment was: *"(French native here) I wouldn't say "not very audibly". It is not spoken "slowly-for-educational-purposes", but it's very clearly audible nonetheless."*. Where is the "rude" part in here, please?  Hell, I did even upvote this person's comment. I was just adding my 2 cents, because I thought I was allowed to speak without automatically getting a gratuitous criticism from a moderator (who is clearly overstepping his duties btw). I guess I was wrong.	1641563862.0	hrmwym4	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrmh3m6	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmwym4/
qn6e0	Oh, you sure are allowed to criticize whomever you want. But:  1.  you are overusing your moderator powers to censor multiple comments I wrote based on false pretext (or please, do tell me where exactly I supposedly insulted people in all these comments of mine that you censored) 2. you criticize someone based on some pretext, that you curiously don't apply to another person when it goes in the same direction as you, therefore applying double standards, which should be forbidden for moderators  IMHO, you are not behaving like a responsible moderator, as you are overstepping your rights and showing a clear lack of neutrality.	1641564549.0	hrmyhov	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrmh8kp	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmyhov/
qn6e0	Yes sure, keep avoiding to reply to the content. Keep censoring. You sure are doing a great job at being an impartial moderator...	1641564769.0	hrmyzb6	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrmhx25	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmyzb6/
qn6e0	u/Dietzgen17 you got criticized and downvoted, and I am being censored (3 comments so far) and threatened of a ban (*"Keep it up and I'll ban you"* is the threat I received in a private message)  It seems like moderation is not really neutral here...	1641564994.0	hrmzib6	t3_rsrboa	t1_hritznx	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrmzib6/
ims8kr5	Thank you for your support. It's a shame it's necessary. No, the moderation is not neutral. If you don't tell people what they want to hear regardless of the objective truth they get angry.  Unless it was the moderator, the person you responded to may have been threatening to block you, that's different. You can also block him. I've blocked a lot of people who aren't arguing in good faith or who are rude.	1641565750.0	hrn1ain	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrmzib6	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrn1ain/
qn6e0	I share your opinion.  But it does not seem to please some higher authorities here (and I genuinely can't understand why...).  Which is sad, because a wise philosopher (hum! \^\^) once said: *"with great power comes great responsibility"*, and I am quite sure it included neutrality and silly things like that :)	1641565835.0	hrn1hvv	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrn0ux3	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrn1hvv/
qn6e0	You think *"comme ci comme ça"* should be erased from the French language? Mmmh why is that? It is not bad language or slang or anything. I'll look it up more deeply, but to me it is perfect French here.	1641565970.0	hrn1t7x	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrn0w4l	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrn1t7x/
qn6e0	Thank you for explaining things like that. I always reassess myself, and ask myself if I did something wrong, because I aim to be honest and forthright. But in that case I really can't find why this moderator is criticizing us.  And indeed, you are right, should it be a "normal" user, it would not pose a problem, everyone gets to have his own POV.  But being a moderator should imply a certain neutrality, at least IMHO. And being threatened of a ban is quite harsh, if I may... :(	1641566290.0	hrn2l2g	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrn1ain	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrn2l2g/
qn6e0	Oh, so you're not a native? I think you were! And the moderator seemed to think so as well.  Yes, this thing here is really getting blown out of proportions... Simply giving one's opinion (without being rude or insulting or anything, I agree that it's a prerequisite) and it still leads to this...  Regardless of the moderator's behavior, you still were downvoted by like 80 people, it's a lot. People come here for help, and when you don't cuddle them and tell them what they want to hear, you get downvoted to oblivion.  Downvoting rude or blatantly wrong comments is fine by me. But it should be limited to these use cases, or to polls too. It should not be (over/mis)used in the situation at hand.  It's things like that that put me off helping other people. I really like (love!) helping people, but when I see things like that, I want to give it up completely and not waste my (somewhat precious) spare time.	1641566722.0	hrn3n7m	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrn1xbv	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrn3n7m/
qn6e0	*"connaître parler"* => *"savoir parler"* (common mistake with the *"to know"* verb)  *"bander"*, except from *"bander une plaie"* (*"dress a wound"*), *"bander les yeux"* (*"put a blindfold"*), and *"bander un arc"* (*"draw a bow"*) really means *"to have an erection"* if you just say *"je bande"*. It **cannot** mean anything else. So, I get why your friend was surprised \^\^ A classical French movie (*"La vie est un long fleuve tranquille"*) has this very famous line: *"vous m'faites bander, Marielle"*, spoken by a "high society" man to his wife :) (the movie in itself is a bit slow, and long, but remains a classic)  For *"mec"*, yeah it's something you may use when speaking about a stranger *"j'ai vu un mec avec un joli chapeau"* (*"I saw a guy with a nice hat"*) in place of *"man"*. But unless you are quite close with your interlocutor, you can't call him (or other people in front of him) "mec". In your specific case, you could have just said *"si les autres sont d'accord"*, it's perfect. Or, if you were specifically talking about guys as opposed to girls, *"si les autres garçons / gars sont d'accord"* ("gars" being a little bit like "mec", so "garçon" is better if you need to be formal when speaking about not-so-old men). You must know the French humorist Coluche (who passed long ago, God rest his soul), who always started his jokes with *"c'est l'histoire d'un mec"*. It is veeeery famous in France :)  As for *"foutre"*, please don't use it at all, unless you actually plan to be rude. It never brings anything shiny to the conversation. Using "faire" instead won't make you look like a dandy or something. It's the go-to choice here :)  >no one actually responds with \[comme ci comme ça\] in real life practice  Last but not least, *"comme ci comme ça"* could be a valid answer to *"comment ça va ?"* if you feel "so-so". Of course you would not say it in a formal meeting (because, for starters, your interlocutor does not care at all how you actually feel :) and you would reply with *"très bien merci, et vous ?"*), and of course there are many other possible answers (*"ça peut aller"*, *"j'ai connu mieux/pire"*, ...). One clearly informal answer (close to *"comme ci comme ça"*) would be *"couci-couça"*. It is not rude at all, but it is not elegant either. It is more for private/family/friends use and would be a good fit for "so-so". But with friends, you will more often hear *"bof"* (which would translate to something like "meh") or *"mouais"* or even *"mouais, bof"*. There are so many possible answers to *"comment ça va ?"* that it's hard to find a clear tendency here.  I'm glad (and relieved \^\^) that we agree that slang should not be learned, at least not right-away. Of course, if you already know some French and you are able to distinguish slang from formal language, then be my guest, I'll teach you a few words! \^\^ (by "you" I obviously mean "people", I don't reckon you and I are here for a slang lesson \^\^)  If you (yourself :) ) want to learn some (dated, but still cool!) slang, you can read some of the 175 "San-Antonio" books. Even for a native there are a few parts that are somewhat hard to precisely understand because of the intensive use of dated slang. It is not especially rude language actually, but rather language used daily by some commoners (working-class) in the "old" France (post-WW2).  A good example to illustrate that kind of language would be the word "pébroque", which means "parapluie" (umbrella) ([https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/p%C3%A9broc/58866](https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/p%C3%A9broc/58866)).  But be ready to suffer, because you will have to learn many "slang" words, that are (more often than not) no longer used today. But it is still a great series of books to read from time to time if you feel curious :)	1641570202.0	hrnclxn	t3_rsrboa	t1_hrn4mlq	/r/French/comments/rsrboa/why_is_the_nous_not_pronounced/hrnclxn/
