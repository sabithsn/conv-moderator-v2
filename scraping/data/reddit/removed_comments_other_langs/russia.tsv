2rzwuerl	Random side note from a Baltic viewpoint: Sweden is worried about 3 extra amphibious landing ships on the Baltic Sea. They raised the alert level of troops on Gotland, called reservists to service on that island, and [sent]](https://www.dn.se/sverige/militar-utryckningsstyrka-landsatt-pa-gotland/)  additional troops to Gotland by air transport today.  Translating:  > "On Friday, the rapidly deteriorating world situation prompted the Armed Forces to deploy its operational contingency unit on Gotland. Equipment and personnel flew with an American C-17 plane, an international collaboration in which Sweden has a share. The plane took off from the base Papá in Hungary and flew to Kallax in Norrbotten."  Sweden is neutral - has been neutral for many generations. Last participated in a war in 1814. It does not depend on foreign tech, produces its own energy, makes its own planes and boats... it has no reason to bluff for anyone.  I am concerned. If non-aligned governments are making defensive moves that cost significant effort, serious miscalculations might be about to really happen. :(	1642193197.0	hsodgtd	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsodgtd/

They either use the threath as a lever for negotiations or then they are just preparing on full scale war.	1642194972.0	hsoi2sz	t3_s3uhcm	t3_s3uhcm	/r/russia/comments/s3uhcm/us_warns_drumbeats_of_war_are_sounding_as_ukraine/hsoi2sz/

Because when you say supplying what you mean is selling  And let me get this right, if a hobo steals your home, do you keep on paying for water and electricity? I don't see how Crimea is any different, sure the Ukrainians consider it theirs but it's just mental to spend tax money on something that is actually not theirs since 2014   And please...Russia recognises human rights? Isn't that something the Americans say right before they bomb shitholes in the middle east? That they would never, but then videos and leaks come out, ofc russian media is much more censored so you get to hear about these American war crimes but never the Russians ones, after all, why should Russia speak shit about Russia?	1642195053.0	hsoia77	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hsogc8t	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsoia77/

No country needs permission to amass its troops by the border, but given recent history, Russian threatening rhetoric and the drive Russia has shown to de-estabilize by any means necessary the status quo in the western bloc, people are obviously suspicious of what may happen next.  I mean other countries like the US and China do that using similar methods, that's true, but to try and whitewash Russia's aggressive, disruptive foreign policy under the guise of "muh western media brainwashing" is questionable at best.	1642195783.0	hsok6hx	t3_s3b2in	t1_hsoitgn	/r/russia/comments/s3b2in/does_the_russian_media_portray_the_united_states/hsok6hx/

Many of the former Soviet countries are decades away from the governance reforms required for (voluntary) membership.  many russians know how corrupt ukrainian institutions are, they are decades away from the transparent accountabity stsndards of nato membership.

ojfghsq	1. A key difference between US and Russia's governments, despite how corrupt the US might be, is we don't have Presidents in power for however long they wish to be. Putin is coming close to a dictator at this point.  2. The influence of the wealthy over Putin is incredible and the lenghts putin goes to silence his critics is well known. video for proof of what I mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrORwk\_RZLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrORwk_RZLM)    1. How many times do we see in the news some ex russian dying of mysterious circumstances and the chemical found usually being tied to russian spy/government agencies. 3. Russia's government seemingly backs the worlds most corrupt countries whether its North Korea or supporting military take over of African nations like what is currently going on in the country of Mali. Or they send troops over to quell the uprising of citizens and the dismantling of their own corrupt government like we just recently saw with Kazakhstan.

xouob	Ehh.. Your military force are in an country where they don't belong, killing innocent Ukrainian people. For what purpose? What right does a country have to invade a neighboring country? What right does Russia have to interfere with neighboring politics?   The whole purpose behind Nato is to be a collective force against this unpredictable militaristic behavior, from a country within Europe that still hasn't turned into a true democracy, despite all cultural influences through mass media and all the revolts during the former Soviet Union. The  leader still elects himself by changing the law.   We could have thousands of years of peace in Europe. We could buy your Gas, respect your cultures, visit your country, learn from each other, come closer, connect infrastructure, take away the mistrust. But this paranoid military behavior drives us millions of kilometers apart. It even forces us to seek an ally on the other side of the world, who touches some of our cultural values, but is a whole different nation, and sometimes pushes it too far.   There is however 0 intent throughout Europe to attack or invade Russia. Nobody has that need or urge to make your country smaller, to take a square centimeter of your soil. Russia belongs to the Rus, as it has been for hundreds of years.   But breaking these laws, where you steal back lands that previously belonged to you (krimea) (without asking for international permission, how it should go) And now attacking Ukraine, or any possible other country, could ignite World War 3, thousands could die by this stupid bluffing game. In an era where we agreed to never use wars again to solve diplomatic differences. But here we are today, one paranoid country that has trust issues, disrupting an entire continent. Europe cannot let this go, nobody wants war anymore, but there are lines no country should cross for the sake of our own safety. Borders are there to be respected, countries have formed and shouldn't be altered anymore, especially not by external force and demand, this is what we agreed upon after World War 2, *"This no more"*. Apes fight for territory and power, we're hopefully smarter than that.	1642208124.0	hspdlqy	t3_s436k4	t1_hsooawi	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hspdlqy/

gapfvci3	Salad "VINAIGRETTE"   Thoroughly washed potatoes, beets and carrots boil in a saucepan, and then peel. In addition to the mentioned vegetables, you will need:   pickled or pickled cucumbers - 2-3 pieces of medium size;   half a can of canned peas;   150-200 g sauerkraut;   juice of half a lemon;   herbs and spices to taste;   vegetable oil.   The order of preparation:   The cooled vegetables are peeled, cut into cubes, put in a convenient salad bowl.   Sauerkraut get rid of excess liquid, wringing it out with your hands beforehand, add it to other vegetables.   We discard the peas on a sieve, letting the excess liquid drain, pour it into the other ingredients of the vinaigrette.   Now we proceed to the preparation of the dressing, for this we mix lemon juice, spices, herbs, green onion feathers and vegetable oil in a separate bowl.   Fill the vegetables with dressing and mix thoroughly.   Let the salad stand in the refrigerator for about half an hour.	1642223810.0	hsq9yh8	t3_s47lsn	t3_s47lsn	/r/russia/comments/s47lsn/looking_for_recipes/hsq9yh8/

gapfvci3	"I think it also brings me to Putin. ... in our country, we don't have much love for our leaders. My God, how much shit our prime minister gets is just unbelievable. I'm curious why there is a protective culture around him. Is it just because you can't really change anything?"   You see, my friend, some things can only be understood in the context of some distant events. Imagine that some person saved your life when you were in imminent danger of death. Well, let's say you were hanging over the abyss on a bunch of blades of grass, and realized that another minute or two, and you were already flying into the abyss and this is the complete end. And all your emotions about it. And there is no hope, no hope at all. The only reality is death at the bottom. Introduced?   .   That's about the state in which Russia was suspended over the abyss after the collapse of the USSR.  It is necessary to describe what was going on then for a long time and in detail. But how the enemies of Russia triumphed! Here is a quote from Brzezinski: ""The New World Order will be built against Russia, on the ruins of Russia and at the expense of Russia."   That is, he has already buried all of us - it was assumed, apparently, that we would all really die of hunger, and there would be stacks of our corpses and the corpses of our children on the streets of our cities. And I'm not exaggerating, we all felt the approach of something like this.   When I saw a university professor selling some spoons taken out of the house at the market to buy food, and old veterans selling their orders... And terrorist attacks almost every day! And the war in Chechnya, which seemed endless. And the salary that has not been paid for months. And complete hopelessness - where to get food?   And then Putin came to power. The war in Chechnya ended two weeks later with the complete destruction of the bandits. They started paying off their salary debts. There were still terrorist attacks, but less and less, and then they stopped altogether. They started paying off pension debts. In short, we suddenly felt a timid hope that this fall of the country into the abyss would stop.   And then suddenly roads and bridges began to be built, emergency housing in cities was replaced with new comfortable high-rise buildings, whole streets and neighborhoods were built. And then suddenly it turned out that the eternally unprofitable agriculture began to make a profit, and we went from food importer to exporters...   No, you won't understand. Young people here who did not live at that time, they also no longer understand   But those who survived that horror - they will hold on to Putin with their hands, teeth and claws. Because we have always remembered that "the safest place is behind his back."	1642238605.0	hsqvu4z	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsqvu4z/
g80r0	These issues can't be separated from anything else. In my opinion, Russia has huge potential. But it's wasted on confrontation and dumb things. We should be trying to take over the world economically and culturally. But instead of that we're trying to take over Ukraine and letting our corrupt politicians and oligarchs to take over our country. All things protected and built by our great ancestors belongs to oligarchs now. Things like Norilsk Nikel and Magnitogorsk MMK was built by generations of soviet people whose grandchildren live in (or close to) poverty now. Even our "great culture" now belongs to a bunch of wank stains who can gatekeep everything. And the country is moving to be even more closed and more authoritarian. And it will make all that terrible people richer and the population even poorer. Saint-Petersburg will be filled with trash continuously from now on.

lna0b	Ah, I see.  I get that your messages are targeted for the "internal audience" of Russia, but it's really interesting to read as an outsider.  Apparently you claim to have been a Finnish citizen, and yet, you don't seem to understand even the basics of a Finnish society. Talking about gods and being fascist, which are something Finns never talk about but know that Russians do.  And it's somewhat silly to say that only Sweden and Russia genuinely like Finland. Where did the "little brother", Estonia go? Or Norway? Or Denmark? Or Iceland? Or Japan? And just that you know, Sweden is often considered to like Finland the least, of Nordic-countries. You should know at least these if you claim to have lived in Finland.  Also, you should tone down the book quotes. It's an another clue that you have no knowledge about Finnish people. Finns don't take those seriously and avoid quoting people -- because quite frankly, it's a bit dumb.  I wonder if an average Russian citizen sees you as a troll as easily or are you targeting the less educated only? Most of your comment history seems to be about propaganda.

In general if American writers need a big bad enemy they choose Russia as the next major super power for two reasons.   1) The cold war so people are already fairly familiar with Russia.   2) It's believable   3) Putin has done lots of shady things on the international stage to keep Russia in the forefront of everyone's minds as potential bad guys.   4) China would be the next obvious Country but they're a huge film market and will block anything that makes China look bad so American film makers don't want to make them the bad guy.	1642603661.0	htbn1va	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbkgp1	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbn1va/

The film maker has to apply, they don't need to refuse support from this office.   They have fake military vehicles they can use and CGI. They don't need real tanks and airplanes.

4qgbb	> You my friend are an exception, until the last couple of years, I was largely taught the Soviet horde myth by television and school.  I dunno what you're watching because I watch tons of documentaries and WWII movies and didn't really see that as widespread doctrine. What I did see was underequipped (generally not rifle wise as portrayed in Enemy at the gates) Russian forces, especially early in the war, in far superior numbers go against German army's and get beaten back. Not all the time, but some of the time. It's not a secret that Germans at the start of the war had better weapons, training, strategy and more supplies.   So seeing Russian forces lose with much larger numbers on the battlefield field and experiencing much higher casualties is not really a myth. It's also not the whole picture of the whole war either. By the end of the war the Russians were pumping out great tanks in the T-34 and other designs, had better strategies to counter the Germans, and frankly steamrolled them all the way back to Berlin.   But to deny that there were battles, especially early in the war in which the Russians had far more people, and lost to much smaller German forces due to inferior weapons and tactics is just denying history. We only learn from history when we study the good and the bad. Not just that which makes us feel proud of ourselves and our people.	1642606394.0	htbtpzj	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbs0qn	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbtpzj/

This sub is weak for giving into this on the daily. Looking back to the taking of Berlin in 1945 does nothing for the current struggles of the Russian people yet they buy into it like sheep.

eahhpais	I can with an honest heart say I love the russian people, in so far as I've had any experience with them. And I see little use in joining NATO. But as a swedish soldier and teacher, I see no use in lying. I see little use in lies and thinly veiled threats.   Why should we not react when the Russian state makes such provocations? It's not like we are in a position to attack you. So these silly quips about "Estonia and Sweden are hightening the aggression"? Come on! It isn't 1698 or something! And yes, I do understand NATO wants to use us as pawns, I get that. But does that make threats directed at us any better?  And honestly, if it came to blows, to me it matters little to me that you would kill me in the end. No matter what, my native soil is mine. And no amount of death can turn wrong into right.  I don't want to rob Russia of your sovereignty, your rights, or your beauty and life. I live in the hope that the Russian people feels the same about me.	1642617402.0	htcmw92	t3_s6ul55	t3_s6ul55	/r/russia/comments/s6ul55/it_feels_so_safe_and_comfortable_now_that_were/htcmw92/
i7lavsor	Maybe this is partly true. But satelite pictures do show large russian forces mobilized at the border to Ukraine. It is no wonder that there now are talks between Russia and a lot of other nations to calm down the situation. Its not just all headlines. Yes, western media is biased to put Russia forward as the bad guy. But the same goes for Russian media, just the other way around. No matter how you put it there is no wonder about the situation being very tense right now - perhaps the most tense since the cold war… 150 k russian troops at the border to Ukraine aint a joke. Especially when it involves a lot of tanks. And Ukraine importing equipment from Britain and the US… Sweden mobilizing their troops… Russia sending drones to inspect swedish nuclear factories… the situation is no joke…. I think the people of Russia and Europe should stand together.

1hfahrj4	Yes, fucking absolutely I'd want that to become an asset if I were Putin. It'd provide a buffer from the west.

dj1wcws2	American here, yes. But its interesting to know that Russians are simultaneously desperate to turn Ukraine in to Russian territory, while decrying how no one would ever want them (literally just means the west to you) to be THEIR asset. And then cites nord stream to say why.   The reason nord stream occured is because Ukraine is between Russia and Europe and can tax the oil being sent through its territory. Obviously and naturally, this pissed Russia off. But then to turn around and claim "SEE! WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM!" While you're actively doing the exact opposite on the ground. Ok, then give back Crimea and never deal with Ukraine again, then? Hell, that'd even get the western sanctions off your back.  Seems like it SHOULD BE a  win win from a russian's perspective.   Furthermore, Russia has a smaller GDP (1.29 trillion, though i think thats up to 1.4 now, $8,735 per capita) than a single US state, Texas (1.7 trillion gdp, $58,000 per capita). With around 5 times as much population (29.3 million vs 144million) . So why is it the case that the same shouldn't ALSO be said of Russia, if it should be said of Ukraine in the first place?   The cold hard truth is, Russia put its self in the position its in. The cold hard truth is russians are a bit wrapped up in a superiority complex. And the cold hard truth is, the world needs the Russian people to stand up to their own government. No ill will friend, just a frustrated plea for sanity from a fellow human on this planet.	1642629703.0	htdkf88	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htca8l0	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htdkf88/

wtelx	You really think that the NATO nations are interested in invading Russia? I will tell you that at least from an American perspective the last thing we want to do is get into a shooting war with Russia, much less try to invade and hold it. It would be a nightmare and cost way, way more than it's worth. We honestly don't even care much in general how you conduct your internal affairs.   But invading Ukraine does not go over well. Once you start expansionism it typically doesn't stop, and we had a deal with Ukraine to defend them from this exact scenario in exchange for them giving up their nuclear weapons to y'all.  Bottom line, stop fucking around and we'll leave you alone.	1643320926.0	huhyq1w	t3_se6xra	t1_huhsqyu	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/huhyq1w/

6x0lnpoj	I can see Putin's logic when it comes to geopolitical issues like Ukraine, Georgia, etc. Having lived in Russia in the early '90s, I can also appreciate that Putin has brought wealth and stability to Russia, and that Russians like that. As an American, I also know better than to blindly trust whatever agenda American media is pushing.  However, what I can't excuse Putin for is shutting down independent media and murdering journalists. That alone is enough to make me believe he's a dictator, regardless of how many dogs he pets.   I personally know several Russian people who worked as journalists and had their offices raided by Putin, were threatened and beaten by State forces, had to leave the country for their own safety, and had their friends and colleagues murdered. These people were not "tools of the West." These people were following the money and reporting on State corruption, and had their whole lives ruined.   If Putin is such a clean, upstanding leader who has Russia's best interests at heart, why does he shut down independent media? Why does he murder journalists? If he really has nothing to hide, he should have no problem with Russians reporting on their government.  And yes, I know the West is also corrupt. I know they also lie and cover up. But that is not the question I'm asking, here, so "the West does bad things, too" won't be a satisfying answer or absolve Putin from murdering multiple journalists and closing all independent media outlets.   I'd really like to hear an answer to my question that is not "well, America did a bad thing too." How can you believe that Putin is a good, honest leader when he murders the people asking him questions?  Thank you for your input. I hope we all have a safe and healthy year.	1643322154.0	hui1y2x	t3_se6xra	t3_se6xra	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/hui1y2x/

6cy7fth1	Russia is still declining on all aspects though, especially democratically and economically. Providing it doesn't end the world in all out nuke attack, it will probably break up in the next decades.    I feel the West is baiting them to invade Ukraine just to accelerate that process.  Also, when Putin goes, that country will tear itself appart like it always has   If Russia had no nukes, nobody would care about that economic midget which has a smaller GDP tham Canada.    Can you imagine if Spain or Canada started acting like superpowers 😅😅😅  (I am canadian btw)    In that regard, Russia is just a bigger version of North Korea.  An irrelevant country that acts up because it has it has nukes.     Look at Russia's GDP over the years, it dropped and has been stagnating since 2014.    If Russia behaved normally and focused on its shitty standard of living, highly corrupt institutions and outdated politics, it might have slowly (over decades) turned into a major player and ally itself with the West.  Instead, it chose to isolate itself and all of that is because their dictator wants to shift the blame on external forces when he is the actual problem.  Russians turn their back on their western  roots and act like an uncivilsed wasteland...let them 👋👋👋	1643343236.0	hujfm7w	t3_se99f3	t3_se99f3	/r/russia/comments/se99f3/this_2001_cover_didnt_age_well/hujfm7w/

hg49scms	I mean it’d be great if the world could just move past pretending like any western country should have any genuine interest in invading another of its neighbors ever again. I don’t really understand Russia’s concern over Ukraine and NATO, *at least* with respect to the understanding that there really isn’t any world on which the US or NATO members have any interest in threatening Russia’s territorial integrity.  It genuinely confuses me why Russia and the West still insist on being enemies. Seems like it’s purely habit and Putin’s dream of building a larger territorial empire. Again, maybe this is just ignorant of me to say, but what the hell does anyone care anymore? Not to be provocative, but there’s not much excuse for annexing new territory in Europe in this era.  If leaders (especially Putin) could chill out and just focus on productive trade and cultural relations, what the hell should anyone be worried about. Putin says it’s just western scaremongering but putting 100k troops on the border is pretty overt and doesn’t reasonably look like anything other than a pending invasion. That’s the way it’s always worked.   My longstanding belief is that Russia and the West should be allies. Seems this isn’t the case for literally no other reason than stupidity and tribalism.	1643816821.0	hvadywb	t3_sirntb	t3_sirntb	/r/russia/comments/sirntb/havent_you_had_enough/hvadywb/

7pr208pz	It's easier for the europeans to be just "critical" of a nation with an extremely scarce history of conquest, that also resides on the other side of the world with only peaceful neighbours. Than it is to just be "critical" of a historically expansionist country that only recently (historically speaking) occupied or puppeted half of them, and said state has also been seemingly returning to that policy. Georgia and now the Ukraine. You can't really compare the two as equals, as they aren't. The US has been the leading hegemony for a long time now, and they haven't expanded militarily at all during that time.   I'm not saying that russia is some crazy imperialist like so many countries were a hundred years ago, but even if one might not like it, the different responses the US and Russia gets is understandable.  Oh and it does not help the fact that one country is led by what is basically a dictator (even if the other ones "democracy" is faaaar from perfect).	1643832990.0	hvblmgy	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvae8d4	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvblmgy/

If I feel that I would much rather live under the economy of country B instead, then I would do my best trying to move there. Maybe country B even wants me to move there, and might offer me help in the moving process.   It makes no sense at all to silently watch as country B "step in" with military forces (ie **invade**) into sovereign country A under the pretence that some of the citizens of country A needs protection. They can simply move to country B. Country A being Ukraine here, and country A being Russia, naturally.   Also, it makes no sense in comparing Crimea with the rest of Ukraine like you seem to do. I have seen internationally independent surveys done within Crimea indicating that many of the people there wants to be part of Russia.

And the fact that Russia is still attempting to move West could be the argument that means NATO is still relevant.	1643841670.0	hvc99uu	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvc5z0a	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvc99uu/
hib7osf8	Hola hermano colombiano, soy Argentino. Te recomiendo unos canales de youtube como Bald & Bankrupt (este va cuidad por cuidad de paises slavos no solamente Rusia y en muchos videos hace la mitica pregunta ed que si vivian mejor antes en la URSS, muy resumidamente el sentimiento por la URSS es algo meramente nostalgico pero no era mejor y nadie con menos de 30 años piensa que la URSS era mejor)     Arielosky es un chileno que literalmente copia el estilo de Bald & Bankrupt hasta inclusive la font de los subtitulos pero debo admitir que el chileno tiene su caracter que lo hace unico y se informa muy bien a cada cuidad que va, Ariel solo visita cuidades de Rusia al contrario del pelado ingles que va por muchos paises slavos.  &#x200B;  Luis Romviro es un español que hace mas videos comunes como de preguntas y respuestas sobre Rusia, esta bien para informarse un poco pero no sale de Moscu y creo que la mentalidad que tiene otra gente que vive en otras cuidades es distinta.  &#x200B;  Yeah Russia es una chica que vive khabarovsk y esta bueno para ver otra parte de Rusia mas del lado este, digamos que el este de Rusia no es nada que ver con el oeste y los sentimientos que tiene ella hacia su pais no son muy buenos, aunque ultimamente esta mucho mas positiva hubo momentos duros de "depresion" hacia su pais, me gusta porq es como ver la contra parte y no quedarse con la mirada de una sola moneda     NFKRZ es un chico que ahora mismo esta viviendo en ST Peterburg y hace videos sobre cultura moderna en Rusia, trata temas politicos y de la sociedad comun como artistas memes etc, No me gusta mucho de los que nombre aca me parece el peor pero tiene algun que otro video que es interesante, sobre todo el que va a una feria en ST Peterburgo que venden cosas sovieticas con Bald & Bankrupt     Si tenes alguna duda o queres saber algo capaz que te puedo ayudar en español, todavia no visite Rusia pero es mi plan a futuro vivir alli, las cosas como bien sabras no estan muy bien en Argentina y mi destino se que es ir a vivir alla asique estoy peleando cada dia con el idioma	1643843469.0	hvcdvwy	t3_sifrmq	t3_sifrmq	/r/russia/comments/sifrmq/just_my_think/hvcdvwy/

The issue in Ukraine is the Russian military is massed at the border and specifically the types of units they are massing would be the types you would have in the event of an invasion. I'm sure the world would be alarmed if the US started massing tanks and armored vehicles at the Canadian border too, especially if they did so relatively recently after annexing Quebec or something.	1643853609.0	hvd2cyc	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvadad7	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvd2cyc/

fnpcn31r	I can do the same in Spanish…  Think of a world where most people learn a language of a bordering country that they frequent quite a bit with. For instance, the US with Mexico (Spanish), English with France (French), France with Germany (German), etc. then you have Russia that borders no English speaking countries other than maybe Magadan with Anchorage and English is taught frequently in Russia. That right there proves that Russia is at a failed state in the world sphere.  Russia has a rough history and I really wish we all could be friends, but when your country has the same GDP of Florida…it’s hard to take it seriously in a conventional war. Russia is not the USSR of the late 40s-60s, sure it could get back there. However, it would have to take multiple acts of aggression that NATO + the US will not allow in this day and age.  Sure, hold on to the glories of the past and take over territories forcefully rather than working on making your country prosper and have a higher GDP of fucking Florida.	1643859795.0	hvdguve	t3_sj6rmi	t1_hvdfhfu	/r/russia/comments/sj6rmi/imagine_thinking_you_can_go_to_war_with_russia/hvdguve/

Historically (this is just from experience), when Russia invades you, or "protects their interest" - whatever you call it, their soldiers bomb and kill civilians. People in my country still have living memories of being exiled, killed and tortured by Russians. I'm sorry to all the pro Russian people, but subjectively, your troops on any border are a horrifying prospect to most.	1643867875.0	hvdwsyy	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvab32u	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvdwsyy/

Parroting Putin's "historic and cultural experience" as a legitimate reason to conquer Crimea while ignoring international law, hell even criticizing legality altogether, shows you're spewing agenda.  If you think the sinocentric worldview consists of "harmonious relationship", then you don't understand what harmony even is. China uses its dominance to achieve that shroud of harmony. Seeing you celebrating "status hierarchies" also shows that dumbness of yours.   It's very clear that Russia and China are worse than the west, even US in most regards.

Who is inviting the enemies of Russia? What kind of "enemies" are you talking about?   >Russia isn’t doing a thing wrong.  Russia threatened invasion if their absurd demands are not fulfilled. What do you mean they aren't doing anything wrong? Amassing troops in your border is one thing, threatening invasion with thoss troops is another.   >Look at bay of pigs for a western example of this.  We are not living in 1952. It was wrong at that time, it's wrong right now. The US doing something bad in the past or present doesn't give Russia the right to do the same. We are not living in the 1800s now.  >Sure they’re preparing for war but the west is too and actively pushing for one.  Russia started this whole fiasco. The west, including Ukraine, is very clear that they are not pushing for war. They are pushing for defense, not offense. Russia is the one pushing for war by threatening to invade Ukraine. Blaming the defensive party equally for a war is peak brainwashing.   Never thought I have to say all these things to an Irish person. You guys literally are the one of the worst victims of this kind of agendas by invading nations.	1643879574.0	hvedr43	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvecb8i	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvedr43/

jb2et2k4	Defending is one thing, invading is another. Russia is not trying to defend here, it is trying to attack through invasion. You guys are conflating "defense" with "offense", which is ofcourse due to the propaganda. If the west pushed for an invasion of Russia, I would have cheered for you guys for amassing troops.  Ukraine, just like any other neighbouring nation, has the sovereign right to invite american troops and build bases. Russia, being a sovereign nation, has the right to oppose such steps on national interest grounds. It can threaten sanctions, severe ties, etc to stop such things from happening. But threatening to invade or use violence is a declaration of war. It can't use violence in an offensive mode to serve its political goals.	1643880253.0	hveeltv	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvecqnm	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hveeltv/

11bzk6	Not a russian but a finn here.  From my perspective it looks like Russian goverment tries to play the victim and tries to convey the story where the Big Bad US is pulling the strings and tries to oppress Russia with NATO.  The narrative however completely forgets the fact that in the last 100 years Russia has occipied or tried to occupy most of its western neighbours and those nations were not treated that well during the occupation.   So maybe its not that NATO is being a dick and trying to aggressively expand near Russia borders but that the countries near Russia actively seeking protection so that history could not protect itself.	1643881083.0	hvefnqg	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvefnqg/

jb2et2k4	Why surprised? It's obvious that normal russians transformed into nationalist and brainwashed dumbos with a blinding support for Russia due to the humongous propaganda against their country by the west. They see this as a defensive mechanism against the west, which I can sympathise with, until they are rallying for invasion and violence. The west in a way created them by lacking the nuance to deal with Russia and allowing their own state sponsored propaganda against Russia. These assholes lack nuance and are too proud of their motherland to see the problem in them.   They don't consider the crimean invasion as an invasion. They see it as correcting a mistake. For them it was a legitimate invasion.	1643881904.0	hvegp6y	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvee8n2	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvegp6y/

hvp2lljs	hello american! I'm interested in another question. how in the most "democratic" and richest country (the US debt today is 30 trillion dollars) country in the world in the 21st century, there are still reservations and ghettos?   The Indians of North America, once brutally driven from their native lands by European colonialists, have been forced to live on reservations for several generations.   There are 2.5 million American Indians today.   At the entrance to the reservation there was an impressive poster: “Do not invade! Violators will be shot. The survivors will be shot again!" What is this, 17th century?   By the way, links to the website of the US Bureau of Statistics, access from the territory of the Russian Federation to the site is closed!!!!!! How is it not democratic?   Now about the ghetto.   Ghettos and slums in America, a mistake of the authorities or a pattern? What is the San Francisco Heroin Ghetto?	1643893839.0	hveynjp	t3_sfnrwx	t1_hur03gs	/r/russia/comments/sfnrwx/the_moscow_times/hveynjp/

NATO's military actions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia, which marked the beginning of the bloc's modern operations, have become an example of gross violations of all norms and laws, including the Organization of the North Atlantic Alliance itself. First of all, NATO violated its own Charter, the Washington Treaty, the 1st article of which states that the member states of the Alliance must “resolve all international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in a manner that does not endanger international peace, security and justice, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”   The American TIME magazine of September 11, 1995 was published under the heading “Taming the Serbs.

First, shells with a low uranium content were used in Yugoslavia. This type of weapon is not only high-precision, but also radioactive and highly toxic weapon, dangerous for humans and the environment.

odo1j	So what's the deal, you think the US is the one pushing Russia into war, but you also think Ukraine should be controlled by Russia?

14765o	Of course it can, but amassing a huge number of soldiers on a neighbour's border is an aggressive act. If China suddenly placed thousands troops and a large amount of heavy weaponry on the Russian border that would obviously raise eyebrows in Moscow and around the world. Moreover, Russia hasn't kept its troops within its borders. It currently has troops in Ukraine*, Moldova** and Belarus*** and many of these are recent arrivals.  *I understand that from a Russian perspective Crimea is formally part of Russia - despite a near total lack of international recognition - but the same cannot be said of Donbas where Russian troops are known to operate. **Yes, Transnistria is not under the control of Chișinău, but it also not part of Russia. ***Definitely not part of Russia.	1643899884.0	hvfbxp5	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvf1xti	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvfbxp5/

Does Russia see NATO as talking behind Russia's back with Russia's close friends, trying to get those friends to abandon Russia and side with NATO? If so, who are the close friends?	1643900047.0	hvfccag	t3_sjkii6	t1_hvf8wow	/r/russia/comments/sjkii6/can_anyone_explain_why_nato_expansion_is_seen_as/hvfccag/

hvp2lljs	My dear European friend, do you know the history?   maybe you are afraid to speak or in the west it is forbidden to know and remember the history of the west?   how was NATO created? - this will be the next course of history (if you ask me to tell you)   But let's start in order, who fought for Hitler and the Wehrmacht?   The answer is the whole "civilized democratic" fascist Europe!   Every year on June 22, we remember the sad date:   On that tragic day, a war began between the great Eurasian power - the USSR and another coalition of European states, since, together with the Wehrmacht, the troops of Romania, Finland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria, in total 15 European countries invaded the territory of the USSR !!!   Russians will never forget this historical memory!   you forgot to mention the other armies of Europe!   Who fought for Hitler and the Wehrmacht?   The answer is the whole "civilized democratic" fascist Europe!   In total, more than 3.5 million people from 15 European countries fought in the Wehrmacht troops (more than half a million - the Romanian army, almost 430 thousand - Hungarian troops, more than 270 thousand - Mussolini's troops!).   Of these, during the war years, 59 divisions, 23 brigades, several separate regiments, legions and battalions were formed.   Many of them were named after state and nationality !!!   Blue Division - Spain   "Wallonia" - the division included French, Spanish and Walloon volunteers, the Walloons were in the majority. The "Blue Division" was the only unit of the Wehrmacht awarded its "own" medal established in its honor !!!   HUNGARY (MAGYARS) 430 thousand - Hungarian troops   In total, 513,767 Hungarians were taken into Soviet captivity during the war years.   "Galicia" - Ukrainians and Galicians   "Bohemia and Moravia" - Czechs from Moravia and Bohemia   "Viking" - from the Netherlands, Belgium and the Scandinavian countries   Finland was an equally important ally of Nazi Germany.   From the end of June 1941 to September 1944, there were sixteen Euro-fascist infantry divisions on the Eastern Front, a total of 740 thousand soldiers and officers, 3047 guns and mortars, 186 tanks and 407 aircraft.   "Denemark" - Danes   "Langemark" - Flemish Legion (Holland)   "Nordland" - Scandinavian SS division   "Nederland" - Dutch collaborators who fled to Germany after the Allied occupation of Holland.   The "French Infantry Regiment 638", since 1943, has been merged with the newly organized "French SS Division" Charlemagne "- the French.   Army of Bulgaria   This is not complete data, Europe is afraid to voice the archives because the numbers will increase by 2 or 3 times!	1643900845.0	hvfebc6	t3_sjecqu	t1_hveu40x	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfebc6/

It is true that both NATO and the US did bad things, still, Ukraine should be free to join or not NATO or the EU, while the russian governament is trying to avoid that for political reasons.  Of course this is all about politics for both sides (Russian and NATO), but ukrainians should be free to choose where to stand, and the fact that they prefer to stand with NATO and EU says a lot about Ukranian-Russian relationships.  It is not about "UnItEd StAtEs BaD, RuSsIa GoOd" or vice versa, is about letting an independent country do its own choices and avoiding another conflict on Europe soil.	1643906333.0	hvfsv2u	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvecrmu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfsv2u/

hvp2lljs	>Би-би-си  HAHAHAHAHAHA   BBC Fake News!!!!   BBC Cookbook: British fakers are torn between lies, self-censorship and secret duty!!!!   The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC admitted that filming the aftermath of the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma in April 2018 is nothing more than a staging. However, the staging is bloody - since the virtual "chemical attack" of Bashar al-Assad became the reason for another US cruise missile attack on Syria!   The search for "Russian influence", like obsessive Russophobia, has become a trademark of BBC news stories.   when the theme of the “hand of the Kremlin” began to be pedaled in his materials in the French anti-government speeches of the “yellow vests”. Earlier, Olga Ivshina, correspondent of the BBC Russian Service, admitted in a personal correspondence with one of the Russian correspondents in Paris that the channel’s management requires any evidence of “Russian interference” in the “yellow vests” protests in France from employees.   “The editors demand blood,” Ivshina told the stringer.   By the way, this is the same Ivshina who was noted in the story of the Boeing MH-17 flight crash in the sky over the Donbass and the subsequent BBC self-censorship. In her report from the crash site, she blabbed that local residents saw combat Ukrainian aircraft in the sky shortly before the crash.   As a result, this video was very quickly removed from the BBC Russian Service website under the pretext of "imperfect structure and due to incomplete compliance with editorial values." Not a fake - but a very characteristic feature of the British handling of information.

i7ougkwm	Do you know why changing of ruling parties and having political opposition are important for the people? Because ruling party without opposition staying for too long in power is not so interested in doing what people elected them to do. As a result the government can do what they want regardless of people will. Authoritarian regimes tend to suppress opposition and control media since they can become dangerous for ruling party. That is why I think it is absolutely reasonable to treat current government form in Russia as regime. It has all criteria met to be called like that. On the other hand I do not state that presidential election in USA is a democracy in a nutshell. But USA has way more mature political institutions in states and lower level. If district or number of houses do not have water supply citizens usually do not call Biden to solve it.

You only need to look at everything that's been posted on this sub over the last few weeks to know how everyone here is already going to answer.  It's propaganda cartoons and anti-Nato memes as far as the eye can see.   It's good that you're trying to broaden your perspective and be empathetic. We need more of that. But r/russia probably isn't the most reliable source for a *neutral* perspective on the Ukraine situation.   I don't know where a better place would be, but maybe it would be a good idea to ask r/ukraine what they think, and whether they agree with the opinions you see here? It would be good to include them and the European NATO countries ( + the CIS ) in any conversation about whether this or that country is being a dick.   This whole idea that the Ukraine situation is only a US and Russian concern, and that negotiations shouldn't include other NATO and CIS members, is complete and utter bullshit.	1643907652.0	hvfwiih	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfwiih/

hvp2lljs	HAHAHAHAHAHA   BBC Fake News!!!!   BBC Cookbook: British fakers are torn between lies, self-censorship and secret duty!!!!   The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC admitted that filming the aftermath of the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma in April 2018 is nothing more than a staging. However, the staging is bloody - since the virtual "chemical attack" of Bashar al-Assad became the reason for another US cruise missile attack on Syria!   The search for "Russian influence", like obsessive Russophobia, has become a trademark of BBC news stories.   when the theme of the “hand of the Kremlin” began to be pedaled in his materials in the French anti-government speeches of the “yellow vests”. Earlier, Olga Ivshina, correspondent of the BBC Russian Service, admitted in a personal correspondence with one of the Russian correspondents in Paris that the channel’s management requires any evidence of “Russian interference” in the “yellow vests” protests in France from employees.   “The editors demand blood,” Ivshina told the stringer.   By the way, this is the same Ivshina who was noted in the story of the Boeing MH-17 flight crash in the sky over the Donbass and the subsequent BBC self-censorship. In her report from the crash site, she blabbed that local residents saw combat Ukrainian aircraft in the sky shortly before the crash.   As a result, this video was very quickly removed from the BBC Russian Service website under the pretext of "imperfect structure and due to incomplete compliance with editorial values." Not a fake - but a very characteristic feature of the British handling of information.   In order to fabricate the material required by the BBC management, Ivshina unashamedly admits that "the editors are demanding blood." The situation turned out to be so hopeless that she began to sort out the most absurd options.   Even before Trump's official inauguration, the BBC released a full-length "investigative journalism" with the telling title "Trump: the Kremlin's candidate?".

z5eio	>How about the number of NATO troops near the Russian borders?  I was curious and after googling, it says that the only NATO troops deployed in countries that border Russia are in the Baltic States and that there's currently a total of 4000 troops across the 3 nations.  I could be wrong but is that not quite a big difference between  to the 100,000+ stationed by Russia on the Ukraine border, a country that has no NATO combat troops?	1643909175.0	hvg0pgl	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvfvrwh	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvg0pgl/

19xvztxc	You understood nothing of what I wanted to convey with my answer, let me explain it better so you get my point straigth this time.  1) Both Russia and US/NATO are doing this kind of stuff for political reason, as I stated in my previous reply "It is true that both NATO and US did bad things" I do not think that NATO is sinless, quite the opposite, but the same could be said for the russian governament (I do not want to say russians, because there is a difference between one country's population and governament).  2) Ukrainians should be free to do whatever they want, if they want to join the NATO or the EU they should be free to do so. If they want to have more close relations with Russia, than they should do that, they are free to do whatever they want.   3) As I stated here ("and the fact that they prefer to stand with NATO and EU says a lot about Ukranian-Russian relationships.") it seems to me that the russian governament doesn't really have a diplomatic way to approch this kind of problem with Ukraine, and the only thing it can do is to blame the West and use hard manners. If instead of invading and provoking Ukraine in the past Russia had done otherwise maybe we wouldn't have this kind of situation now.  4) Both Europe and Russia do not need another silly war just because of some political reasons and tension between Russian and the US. Let Ukraine decide where to stand and let's avoid another useless loss of blood and people.  Bonus) I'm in no way russophobic, I do like russian people and culture, I used to study russian to be able to speak with them. Anyway, I do make a clear distinction between the russian people and the russian governament. While I do not like what the russian governament is doing, I enjoy russian traditions and speaking with people from the biggest nation on Earth. I have nothing against russians, they are great people, and I'm sure that most of them just want to live in peace with all the rest of Europe.  Please feel free to respond, but keep in mind that just because people are from the EU/USA doesn't mean we are brain dead and we just follow blindly what our media tells us, quite the opposite. Anyone has its personal opinion about what it is happeing, but saying that disagreeing with what the russian governament is doing is "russophobic" is just bs imho.	1643909547.0	hvg1qom	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvfvrwh	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvg1qom/

19xvztxc	You know that saying Russia's or Ukraine's border is the same thing, right? It's the same thing as saying "a glass half full" and "a glass half empty".  Futhermore, as for the 200k US troops in Europe you probably googled it and you just wrote the first (wrong) result you found, in reality they are WAY less than 200k, and let's not forget that they are not all stationed at the Russian border.  Anyway, it is not about US/Russia is bad or good, it is about letting Ukraine do its thing and its decision. As for last but not least, just because there are NATO troops in NATO countries it does not justify placing 100k troops near another NON NATO country's border just because your governament its at constant "war" with NATO.	1643919843.0	hvgtosq	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvgrduf	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvgtosq/

The sanctity of national borders is well established international law.   And we will see what happens with the current situation. I am not at all qualified to have an opinion but I would not be surprised if, this time next year, much of Donbas will be part of Russia. And there will be more sanctions against Russia...hurting the Russian people but not those that have made the decisions that affect them.   And to what end? How has taking over Crimea helped the Russian people? Improve their lives? How will taking over Donbas? What is the point of the rivalry between Russia and Western Europe?

The US government can't order US citizens in general to leave their place of residence without a substantial legal reason.  Just look at how we deal with Hurricanes.  Generally, there are several days warnings of imminent danger.  The smart thing for everybody to do is to Get Out of The Way.  State and local authorities will strongly suggest that people evacuate the area but many people don't.  Instead, we wind up wasting a lot of resources fishing them out of the area that's been flooded and destroyed.

hvp2lljs	Many remember the monstrous intentions of Nazi Germany in the defeated states of Europe. However, the plans of the Allies after the victory over Germany, which had been developed since 1943, were no less cruel. How did the United States and Great Britain see the future of the German people, and why did they prefer to forget about this plan?   The program for the post-war organization of Germany by the Americans was called the Morgenthau plan.   The program forever deprived Germany of independence, divided it into many states and destroyed all the industrial achievements of the Germans over the past 400 years.   The division of the Central Bank of Germany into 11 banking districts, a ban on interaction between them. A complete ban on foreign trade, import restrictions, a ban on sea fishing. The destruction of all heavy industry.   True, in 1948 the program to destroy the German nation had to be curtailed. The Morgenthau program was replaced by the Marshall Plan, which, on the contrary, was aimed at the restoration of Germany.   What influenced this decision? Cold War. The Soviet Union was not aimed at the destruction of the Germans, despite all the suffering they caused. On the contrary, the country focused on the development of German industry and the creation of a pro-Soviet government.    Franklin Roosevelt proposed the creation of five autonomous states instead of a united Germany, Winston Churchill also advocated the dismemberment of Germany, emphasizing the need to separate Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg from Germany. Churchill proposed to include these territories together with Austria and Hungary in a separate Danube confederation. Stalin opposed the division of Germany. Here are his words: "The experience of history says that the Hitlers come and go, but the German people, but the German state remains!"   https://sun9-24.userapi.com/impf/veNCmWcfxej2tDjMGOnlZgqs3TNYPkwX-3YkVQ/9myKZrmLNcQ.jpg?size=0x0&quality=90&proxy=1&sign=a3ea5b4509acad362d7102e08da6736d&c\_uniq\_tag=8awo4o7aEq-tg8kd6e9mcYVw1dNOhfg\_5xR0EVEv2vY&type=video\_thumb	1643946857.0	hvimm88	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvi0ov8	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvimm88/

hvp2lljs	>we have a long history of Russian interference in our affairs.....?   are you serious ?????   In the occupied lands of the USSR, the Romanians unleashed a policy of genocide and terror against the Gypsies, Jews, "Bolsheviks". Antonescu supported Hitler's policy of "racial purity" and considered it necessary to clear the territory of "Greater Romania" from "Bolshevism" and "racially unclean" peoples. He said the following: “I will not achieve anything if I do not cleanse the Romanian nation. Not borders, but the homogeneity and purity of the race give strength to the nation: this is my highest goal. A plan was developed to exterminate all the Jews of Romania. First of all, they planned to “clean up” Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transnistria, after their “cleansing”, they planned to exterminate the Jews in Romania itself, in total there were about 700 thousand people in these territories. The process of creating ghettos, concentration camps began, the largest of them - Vertyuzhansky, Securensky and Edintsky. https://cont.ws/uploads/pic/2019/2/Romanians%20fascists.jpg   https://pastvu.com/\_p/a/i/v/2/iv277fa2zo7qpzsph3.jpg   During the occupation, the Romanians established laws that were supposed to clean out everything Russian from Odessa and other settlements. All books in Slavic languages ​​were confiscated from libraries and private collections of the city, which were later burned on a huge fire. A strict decree was issued prohibiting the use of the Russian language by civilians.   The Romanian secret police of Siguranza had instruments of torture, as did the German Gestapo.   The Romanians got the name - "Death Marches": they marched in the winter, those lagging behind and unable to walk were shot on the spot, pits were dug for every 10 km, where they buried the half-dead and the corpses of the dead. The camps of Transistria were overcrowded, a huge number of people died from hunger, cold and disease, before their execution.   The district of Golta was called the "Kingdom of Death", the largest concentration camps in Romania were located here - Bogdanovka, Domanevka, Akmachetka and Mostovoye. In the winter of 1941-1942, large-scale mass executions of prisoners were carried out in these concentration camps. Romanian executioners shot 40 thousand unfortunate prisoners in just a few days, another 5 thousand were burned alive in Bogdanovka. According to some reports, only during this period, 250 thousand Jews were destroyed here !!!!   Of the 18 Romanian divisions stationed in the southern direction, 16 suffered heavy losses, were actually defeated. In total, during the war, Romania lost 800 thousand people, of which 630 thousand people were on the Eastern Front (of which 480 thousand were killed).   However, later the USSR returned the former Romanian conductor (leader) back to Romania, where, after a trial in Bucharest, he was sentenced to death as a war criminal.   Under the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947, the USSR established an unlimited military presence in Romania.   Over the past 130 years, Russian-Romanian relations have gone through serious trials. Two world wars swept over Russia and Romania. We had to restore diplomatic ties twice. Thanks to the generosity of SSSR Transylvania finally returned to Romania.   We must remember the bloody tears of fascism, we must prevent its restoration in new forms. We must understand that any fascism is a threat to human dignity and the right to freedom!	1643950749.0	hviufk4	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvetu3d	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hviufk4/
hvp2lljs	Hey dude, did you escape from the asylum?   What is communism?    The communist government uses this idea. There is public ownership and control over industry and resources (mines, factories and factories). The goal is that there should be no different social classes, that there should be neither rich nor poor.   All people will be equal.   To be effective, communism requires a delicate balance and the equal participation of all people. This may seem simple enough, but it can actually be very difficult. That is why it has failed in many countries that have tried to do so.   The main principle of communism: "To each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"   Capitalism (fuck it) is a social system in which one class of the population (capitalists 10 percent of the population) owns enterprises, factories, firms, industrial enterprises and even the bowels of the earth) and profits from the fact that another class (wage workers are modern slaves 90 percent) of the population) serve these capitalists    The inevitable companion of capitalism is unemployment, since the main goal of the capitalist is to extract the greatest profit!   don't be an idiot!!!!!!!!	1643951773.0	hviwcrn	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvidorx	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hviwcrn/

The girls remained bald, bearded, breastless, ovarianless, with a permanently lowered voice and distorted genitals, at risk of a myriad of physical and mental problems, and their feminine identity was erased.   About 5% of all American girls can now self-identify as transgender or non-binary. About 50% or more may have a diagnosis of autism or undiagnosed autism. Some suffer from mental disorders. But gender transition is so popular right now, and the risks are so well hidden, that many young people without major mental illness or autism may be involved in it.

d0vulrjn	Nah Ukraine was so unstable because its economic was so connected to Russia it has to start over. Im polish and i know that Krimea historically belonged to Russia, but instead of marching your troops right away dis you ever negotiate. If eastern Ukraine is populated by russians then why not just talk about it. Make them autonomous by negotiating. NATO intervention in Yugoslavia happened too late to make Yugoslavia fall (after Tito’s death it was already falling apart) not even talking about the fact USA helped Yugoslavia When USSR wanted yo incorporate it to the eastern block. Honkong is a part of China that i can agree with, Taiwan is debatable. You can have your opinion but id you tell me that Ukraine wants to attack Russia you would be an absolutne idiot.	1643959486.0	hvj8ygq	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvj7y8q	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvj8ygq/
32nd3	At no point did I even remotely hint to that.    But the casualties before 1941 (the point where Soviet and Nazi Germany became enemies) and after 1945 where not committed by German Nazis.  If you check that at a certain date the population should be X and it turns out it significantly less than that then its hard to distinguish when or where that happened. The official sources claim 1.5 - 1.8 million died in Gulags but that number is extremely uncertain and not every political "dissident" lived to see a Gulag. Not to mention starvation in the 1930's and post war (which could be seen as Nazi casualties).    Is this making things clearer for you?      I do not think Nazis wanted to ethnically cleanse the Soviet Union much like the Soviet did not want to cleanse Poland. But the treatment of the civilian population and captured armed forces where extremely cruel and harsh.	1643959516.0	hvj8zze	t3_sij237	t1_hvgvp6e	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvj8zze/

The content of the agreement was first made public by Churchill in 1953 in the final volume of his memoir.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1643967795.0	hvjjv9e	t3_sk5k7k	t1_hvjju3f	/r/russia/comments/sk5k7k/me_after_spending_1_hour_in_reurope/hvjjv9e/

32nd3	Bravo, almost all copy pasta from the wiki and I am well aware that not all types of labor camps in Soviet belonged to the same organisation.      Another quote from the wiki: "English-language speakers also use the word gulag to refer to all forced-labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union"     18.000.000 people passed through the camps between 1923 to 1961 with little to no trial. That qualifies to "quite a lot". Is that the world record? I have no idea.  10% of them died. That is pretty bad, again, is it the worst? Again have no idea.       The point I was making before you felt the need to beat your chest was that quite a lot of people died there not all of them on record. So when calculating who died of what in that time period, this is needed to be taken in to consideration.    The exact numbers does not exist, which was my point.	1643974697.0	hvjstci	t3_sij237	t1_hvjfc3c	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvjstci/

Gamalei   A series of pseudo-analytical investigations and eyewitness false testimonies about the alleged danger of the Russian vaccine are being prepared on social networks and Russian-language Internet resources funded by foreign grants.   The West is driven by banal envy and fear of competition - the Russian vaccine, registered the first in the world, turned out to be the most effective among all the analogues being developed, which means it will be more in demand.   The plans of the West to discredit the Russian vaccine not only exist - they have been actively implemented over the past few months. First, it is necessary to continue and actively promote the very noteworthy Russophobia that exists. Russia in the image of absolute evil, where, in principle, there can be nothing good, and even more so there is some kind of vaccine, the first in the world, for a second. The second point, no less important, is that the West needs to clean up the market for its vaccines that will someday appear in this way. So that they do not have competitors, they must behave in a similar way. Here they are doing it all.	1643975749.0	hvjud9n	t3_sjkzzn	t1_hvj3x83	/r/russia/comments/sjkzzn/russia_announces_retaliation_over_rt_de_ban_in/hvjud9n/

hvp2lljs	(ISS) is a joint international project involving 14 countries, including: the USA, Russia, Canada, Japan, as well as several European countries acting under the auspices of the European Space Agency. Its design began in 1984, with the order of US President Ronald Reagan, who ordered NASA to develop and build a new orbital space station in 10 years. By the beginning of the 90s, it became clear that the scale and high cost of the project would not allow the United States to create it on its own. The actual construction of the station began in 1998, when Russia, which joined the project, launched the first element of the ISS, the Zarya functional cargo block, into orbit.  Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and American astronaut Robert Cabana were the first to board it.   On July 26, 2000, the Zvezda service module docked with the FGB. It is these three nodes that have become the basic blocks for the start of space cooperation for more than a dozen countries of the world.   In order to fully fulfill their mission, Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd underwent four years of training and education at NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City and at the training center in Munich in Germany to refine the technology conducting many scientific experiments.   Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd established contact with mission control centers in Korolev and Houston. The ISS-1 crew ensured the docking of Progress M1-4 cargo ships in November 2000 and Progress M-44 cargo ships in February 2001 with the station. They also met American shuttles on the ISS - Endeavor in December 2000, Atlantis in February and Discovery in March 2001.

hvp2lljs	The "civilized" Western world against great Russia!   The war will continue until the “Russian question” is completely resolved, that is, the destruction of the Russian superethnos and Russian civilization with its unique “Russian matrix” – the idea of ​​justice and life in good conscience. Only by destroying the Russian people and the Russian language, by physically destroying Russia, can the West receive the main prize - the planet!    Papal Rome remains the spiritual ideologist of the “onslaught on the East”, on Russia and the Slavic-Russian civilization from the early Middle Ages to the present. The other two "command posts" of the Western project are London and Washington.   Therefore, the Western "elites" have always looked with great surprise, misunderstanding and fear at the "mysterious" Russians, who always, having superiority in military skills (warrior people), did not colonize, did not rob, did not ruin neighboring nationalities, as Western peoples did. .   in particular, if it weren’t for the revolutions, wars and “reforms” of the 20th century, then there would be about 500 million Russians now, that is, we would be the third ethnic group on the planet in terms of numbers, as at the beginning of the century, after the Chinese and Indians), with each round of development, the Russian super ethnos and Russia are becoming more and more powerful and great nation and power.   Hence the clue to Western Russophobia. The current Russophobia is not due to the fact that the West does not like "bad Putin or Stalin", it has millennial roots. This is the fear of the Russians (“Russians are coming”), which was known both in Ancient Rome and Constantinople, preserved in Paris, London and Washington, which inherit the ancient traditions of confrontation between Russia and the West. This is hatred for Russians, hostility, which expresses the inferiority complex inherent in a less perfect culture in relation to a more perfect one. Misunderstanding and inability to understand a more developed culture, while militarily a more powerful people (the Russians more than once defeated the western hordes, but did not raze Warsaw, Berlin and Paris to the ground as they could), generates genetic, biological fear and envy. The Westerners are afraid of the militant Russians and envy them, they greedily want to take advantage of the riches of the Russian land.	1643986159.0	hvkeqi6	t3_sjnmv0	t1_hvk7w0a	/r/russia/comments/sjnmv0/question_from_an_american_about_the/hvkeqi6/

hvp2lljs	Are you really from another planet?   And this is not only in Germany, this applies to all homosexual Europe!   In Spain, an 8-year-old girl, with the support of a lawyer, won a gender reassignment trial! probably today she sewed a man's dick!   why are you surprised, alien?   A British hospital has advised its staff to refer to mothers as "birth parents", fathers as "second biological parents", and breast milk as "human milk" or "breast milk". It was decided here that too explicit indication of gender could offend people of the so-called non-binary gender, that is, who do not identify themselves as either men or women.   One of the first to get excited was female athletes. Many remember the very recent scandal with the New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard. Previously, her name was Gavin, and after the sex change, Hubbard began to compete in women's championships, immediately taking several gold and silver awards.   In Germany, Switzerland, France, Austria, Scandinavian countries, unique methods of sexual education are generally practiced: they don’t just talk about it in class, but encourage children to experiment with same-sex as early as possible, that is, first “please yourself”, and then - “ The age of sexual consent needs to be reconsidered." In Holland, a few years ago, a party of pedophiles was officially registered, which intended to participate in elections: it called for reducing the age of sexual relations to at least 10-12 years. And in Switzerland, they have already launched the production of condoms in children's size, that is, for ten-year-old boys. The argument that we, as traditionally oriented people, consider all this to be unnatural, means little to “them”. On the contrary, the more unnatural, the more desirable it is to be put into practice.	1643988244.0	hvkjwfe	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvk95ec	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvkjwfe/

Russian & Chinese expansion is by force as evidenced by Crimea and Hong Kong and potentially Ukraine and Taiwan in the future.

hvp2lljs	Crimean War (1853-1856)   The reason for the Crimean War was a dispute over the keys to holy places in Palestine between Catholics and Orthodox. The Sultan handed over the keys to the Bethlehem Church from the Orthodox Greeks to the Catholics, whose interests were protected by the Emperor of France, Napoleon III. Russian Emperor Nicholas I demanded that Turkey recognize him as the patron of all Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire. On June 26, 1853, he announced the entry of Russian troops into the Danube Principalities, declaring that he would withdraw them from there only after the Russian demands were satisfied by the Turks.   On July 14, Turkey addressed a note of protest against Russia's actions to other great powers and received assurances of support from them. On October 16, Turkey declared war on Russia, and on November 9, an imperial manifesto followed on Russia declaring war on Turkey.   The Allies planned to land the main landing in the Crimea in order to deprive the Russian Black Sea Fleet of its bases. Attacks on the ports of the Baltic and White Seas and the Pacific Ocean were also envisaged. The Anglo-French fleet concentrated in the Varna region. It consisted of 34 battleships and 55 frigates, including 54 steam ones, and 300 transport ships, on which there was an expeditionary force of 61,000 soldiers and officers. The Russian Black Sea Fleet could oppose the Allies with 14 sailing battleships, 11 sailing and 11 steam frigates. The Russian army of 40 thousand people was stationed in the Crimea.............

32nd3	Thank you learnt that some 25 years ago in school.   Ok, so you missed the point or somehow failed to grasp it.   As mentioned above, and what I replied to:     >According to some modern Russian historians, not 27 million inhabitants of the USSR died during the Second World War, but almost 40 million. This was calculated on the basis of the fact that in 1946 the USSR had 170 million, and the estimated population should have been 209 million .  My point was and still is that there are probably more to this 39 million discrepancy than just the German invasion (although no doubt the main culprit directly, or indirectly) but none the less. It doesn't matter how you define the Gulags. It was one of many alternate non-German related ways of dying in Soviet times.   And I know that this is the wrong part of Reddit for critical thinking. But a lot of numbers back then was manipulated to fit the political narrative true on both western and eastern sphere. I can imagine that such as the true number of East block civilians escaping to the west would not be publicly reported. 20 million extra dead during 34 months is quite noticeable as it would be almost 600 000 more dead per month.	1643997550.0	hvl93bn	t3_sij237	t1_hvkmmai	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvl93bn/

fs3n7	It's inaccurate to say that they have evidence if all they have is what their intelligence told them. But it is also silly to demand a proof. Obviously they cannot say how that information was obtained without endangering the source. Ultimately it all boils down to how credible the US government is and how competent their intelligence is. Definitely not pristine history, but compared to Russian government (Putin denying with a straight face that he has anything to do with the little green men is a classic) they are credible. Their intelligence is probably the best in the world. I also fail to see what they could have to gain from lying about this. Nobody is putting any sanctions before something actually happens anyway.

Pull out your little green men, stop massing troops at the border, an respect h sovereignty of your neighbors.''  Look. I get that English is probably not your first language, so now and then things can get a bit lost. But at least have the intellectual honesty to admit that to yourself and ask what I meant.   If you can answer me why the NATO countries would want to force a war with Russia and are the aggressors here please explain, because to me it seems that most European countries are divided and there is no universal 'push against Russia'. The build up of European troops and materials has only happened AFTER Russia has been starting to amass troops there. Does Russia fear an invasion?  &#x200B;  Explain to me why it is impossible that Russia is the aggressor and why they would have no benefit in taking Ukraine, and tell me how NATO countries are the aggressor and what benefit they have of it, including how  the conflicting stances of EU countries align with that assessment.	1644080009.0	hvpsysv	t3_sl556l	t1_hvpk7au	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvpsysv/
lzzq0	Russia has no reason to fight unless a 'defensive war'' of occupied territory belonging to a different sovereign country?   And the consensus is that Russia fears his grasps weaken because of the energy transition and wanting warm ocean ports for trade, and it wanted the industrial power of Ukraine. Of course the last being destroyed by the Russian offensive, but that is besides the point.   &#x200B;  If you think that Ukraine would willingly attack a greater force than itself in an offensive manner without hope of success, and that that will legitimize a full hostile takeover of Ukraine than I am really curious how the information you are getting through your media coincides with your rational thinking.	1644080223.0	hvptikx	t3_sl556l	t1_hvpnjwi	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvptikx/

America and Russia starting a war with specifically the other one would have to start in like the Bering Strait, and wouldn’t make any sense whatsoever.  America and Russia have always avoided conflict because it’s just not worth it, so any start to war between the two would almost have to be a Russian invasion of a NATO state or NATO aligned state like Finland because America isn’t gonna invade Russia or Belarus any time soon.

hvp2lljs	Russophobia is actively inspired by some   Western media and even governments to achieve   their political or economic goals through   Russia.   A great example is Nord Stream 2.   Any use of the term “Russian aggression” is   Russophobia.   The most striking example of Russophobia was the mental   illness of the United States Secretary of Defense   James Forrestal. Yes, this is the famous “Russians are coming”.   Russophobia refers to a deliberate attempt   blame Russia for all the troubles in the world, based on   lack of hard evidence or evidence,   distorted half-truths or even outright lies. USA   are the epicenter of Russophobia, followed by   UK, Canada, Holland, Australia, countries   Baltics and Sweden...   Downed MH17 aircraft over eastern Ukraine, before   after the plane hit the ground, the US blamed Russia,   even Putin himself! John Kerry gave a press release   which said: "We know where the rocket came from,   we know who launched it, Russia was involved in   this."   !!!!!!   Russia intervenes in 2020 campaign to help Trump   and Sanders! Apparently, the House Intelligence Committee   representatives were instructed by Intel that   Russia intervenes   CNN and MSM immediately played the Russian   interference!

hvp2lljs	I want the British to know more about their country!   James Le Mesurier - British military man, founder and   sponsor of an organization known as the White Helmets!   (TERRORISTS ASSISTANT!)    cooperated with militants of banned terrorist groups such as Tahrir al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra), participated in sabotage and even executions, spread disinformation against Damascus, staged attacks using banned poisonous substances and filmed fake videos “from the scene”, to blame them on the Syrian government and army.   https://img.projektn.sk/wp-static/2018/04/syria-hoax-I.jpg?fm=jpg&q=85&w=2400&h=1260&fit=crop&fm=png&markx=10w&marky=5w&markpost=bottom-right&markw=15w&mark= 2019/06/sk.png   the entire Syrian government arsenal of chemical weapons was eliminated a few years earlier - under the supervision of the OPCW and the world community, and even with the direct participation of the United States, Great Britain and other Western countries.   And this is where the White Helmets with their fakes came in handy. Footage of civilians killed and suffocated by poisonous and nerve-paralytic gases by this organization regularly appeared in the global media space. The White Helmets churned out videos with fake “bombed out hospitals” and “killed civilians” due to Russian and Syrian air strikes. However, when checking, it turned out that the footage was a production, for participation in which money was paid, and the “victims” from the video were wearing makeup.   Russia and Syria signaled the staged nature of the content of the White Helmets, presented evidence to the UN and the Hague Tribunal, systematically exposing these British terrorists!   These combined efforts have paid off. In particular, due to the fact that a large number of facts indicated that the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma was in fact an act of fraud, Washington decided in 2018 to suspend further funding for the White Helmets project. As Bild wrote, at the request of the United States, Canada and a number of European countries, Israel then evacuated hundreds of NGO employees and their families from Syria to Jordan, from where they were later taken to the UK, Canada and Germany. The Americans were forced to rethink their military, political and media strategy in Syria.	1644430132.0	hw96b3y	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw96b3y/

I'm a socialist, and don't support US imperialism, but this doesn't mean I'll remove 90% of my geopolitical knowledge to just abandon the countries and issues that we created. Ukraine is a bulwark to Russian aggression, and so is the rest of eastern Europe. If you allow Russia to invade Ukraine and annex the territory, then what happens when they target the Baltic states? Are you gonna sit on your isolationist ass? Sorry, but the revolution deserves to be spread in as many independent territories as possible, and allowing Russia or even China to expand without check is a massive mistake, because they'll just do the same we have done, and much worse, because they don't believe in limitations.	1644449430.0	hwaloam	t3_so9fun	t1_hwakb2i	/r/russia/comments/so9fun/azov_battalion/hwaloam/

hvp2lljs	The USSR occupied Poland in 1939?   September 17, 1939 as a representative of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the USSR   Polish Ambassador to the USSR Vaclav Grzhibovsky was   a note was read out and handed, where the entry of Soviet troops   explained by the need to "protect life and property   population of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus"         In a note of the Soviet government, handed on the morning of 17   September 1939 in Moscow to the Polish Ambassador to the USSR,   The reasons for starting the operation were:   Polish state and its government   actually ceased to exist. Thereby   the treaties concluded between   USSR and Poland. left to itself and   left without leadership, Poland has become   a convenient field for all sorts of accidents and surprises,   capable of posing a threat to the USSR. Therefore, being hitherto   neutral, the Soviet government can no longer   be neutral about these facts and   defenseless position of the Ukrainian and Belarusian   population. In view of this situation, the Soviet   The government has ordered the Chief   command of the Red Army to give orders to the troops   cross the border and take life and   property of the population of Western Belarus, Western   Ukraine.   The operation was attended by formations of Kiev and   Belarusian military districts, reinforced by units   Kalinin and Moscow military districts.   England and France, which concluded with Poland   allied treaties and also preparing for combat   actions, instead of providing the promised military assistance   Poland continued the search for ways of appeasement   Germany!   After the end of World War II,   Nuremberg trials former head of the Supreme   Command of the Wehrmacht Jodl argued that "the process   similar to Nuremberg, did not start in Germany in 1939   only because approximately 110 French and   English divisions that were stationed during our war with   Poland in the West against 23 German divisions,   remained completely inactive!      Contrary to the assertion of a number of authors about the preparation   partition of Poland between the USSR and Germany, nor the Soviet   special services, nor the top leadership of the USSR before the invasion   Germany was not placed in Poland on September 1   information about the preparations for such an invasion and themes   no longer coordinated with her any actions.   Relations between Poland and Nazi Germany from 1934 to   early 1939 were great! Poland, like   known to have taken part in the division of Czechoslovakia after   "Munich agreement", and Lipsky took an active   participate in this process!   Jozef Lipski was bitterly disappointed   survive in 1939, when yesterday's "dear   Berlin friends" showed territorial   claims against Poland concerning the so-called   "Danzig Corridor"!   Lipsky survived World War II and finished   your days in Washington!   Polish Foreign Minister Beck after the defeat of his country   Germany moved to the territory of Romania, where he was   arrested. In 1944 he died of tuberculosis.	1644471280.0	hwbyom7	t3_smc9fa	t1_hw93pr6	/r/russia/comments/smc9fa/this_is_how_history_is_rewritten_by_hollywood_and/hwbyom7/
hvp2lljs	Occupation of Poland!   Now it is fashionable to say that the Russians did not liberate Poland, but captured it. An interesting occupation is obtained if Poland received a quarter of the territories of Germany for free: moreover, hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers shed blood for this land. Even the GDR did not want to give Szczecin to the Poles - the issue with the city was finally resolved only in 1956 under pressure from the USSR.   Jozef Lipski (Polish diplomat. In 1934-1939 he served as ambassador to Germany.)   \- If Hitler solves the Jewish question "we will erect a beautiful monument to him in Warsaw."!!!!! September 20, 1938   Already during the German occupation in December 1939, the Poles staged a Jewish pogrom in Krakow. In 1940, the Jewish Easter pogrom in Warsaw was marked. In July 1941, in the village of Jedwabne in the Bialystok region of the BSSR (now Poland), where the main population was Jews, the Poles living in the same village as a result of a pogrom organized by them killed, as witnesses stated, more than one and a half thousand Jews. Most of them were burned alive in a barn.   By the way, the Germans paid the Poles money and groceries for every Jew they caught: tobacco, sugar, liquor. In Warsaw, one head of a Jew was estimated by the Germans, in addition to everything, also at 1-1.5 kg. apple jam. And not a single Polish “Jew hunter” had anything sticky in the ass from this jam !!!   The Baltics are also greatly outraged by the occupation. It is worth remembering the current capital Vilnius also gave Lithuania to the USSR; the Lithuanian population of Vilnius was then 1%, and the Polish majority. The USSR returned to the republic the city of Klaipeda (Prussian Memel), which belonged to the Lithuanians in 1923-1939. and annexed by the Third Reich. The Lithuanian leadership condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact back in 1991, but no one returned both Vilnius to Poland and Klaipeda to the FRG.	1644471335.0	hwbysfe	t3_smc9fa	t1_hw93pr6	/r/russia/comments/smc9fa/this_is_how_history_is_rewritten_by_hollywood_and/hwbysfe/

It does not matter what army is in Ukraine. the allies could be every douchbag country (I mention this to state that I do not support any country in particular) and still Russia would be creating tension, since once again they would need to take fight on larger enemy. the so called glorious president is playing mind games. he’s a charismatic person and he knows that his statements have a huge (if not the largest in the world) impact not only in politics but also on people of all countries. consider to hold your conspiracies defending the one’s who sacrifies their own people life quality for their outrageous dreams of world domination ;)	1644489799.0	hwcocz3	t3_soupri	t1_hwcgtmt	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcocz3/

apf1esb9	Iraq was not a NATO operation. The only time the relevant NATO article has been invoked is Afghanistan, after 9/11  I don’t think anyone in Europe wants to somehow “invade” Russia, everyone knows Russia has a large military.  But as a free country, Ukraine should be allowed to choose its own path. IMO NATO would reject its request to join, as it has done so far  Nobody wants war. But action against Ukraine by Russia achieves what? IMO I think this is more about Putin halting Ukraines growing ties with the EU, as he’s worried about neighbouring countries succeeding economically, and then his domestic audience asking why he isn’t delivering the same results	1644490550.0	hwcpb13	t3_sp2itd	t1_hwco63f	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcpb13/

From my current understanding I only know how to frame it from a NATO-centric position (forgive me) so I'll lay it out and then please pick it apart. The US/NATO position is that Ukraine is a sovereign nation and should be able to dictate its own security, including whether or not it joins NATO in the future. NATO's aims have never been an invasion into sovereign Russian territory however the same cannot be said with regards to Russia and Ukraine given the annexation of Crimea.

5fale6tk	Russian government is a bully, it’s been a threat to their neighbours and their own citizens for a long time. History taught me they are mostly successful through scheming and backstabbing, they lose in all out wars to smaller opponents. They are also massively corrupt, and stupid. Like Lavrov just said that “Anglo-Saxons should leave Ukraine”. Anglo-Saxons! He doesn’t know what Anglo-Saxons are XD that’s hilarious, I guess Britons should check their ancestry because 1/3 of them may not be allowed according to Lavrov. Even less so for Americans. That was also quite a racist comment btw, reminding me of fascism.

fxbukkxo	Your post should not feature Russia, but the United States. That's when it will be true. Because this applies specifically to the US. The United States could not defeat Korea, or Vietnam, or Afghanistan. The United States has overthrown at least a dozen legitimate leaders of countries. The US claims world hegemony, and its lobbying system is institutionalized corruption. Lavrov said it right, because he was referring to the Anglo-Saxon advisers in the government of Ukraine who are fomenting the war. Neither Russia nor Ukraine wants war.
