This means the environment signal our genes . And everything in out environment is associated with an emotion . We have different for our parents for our friends for our pets . Break those emotional bonds you are just freezing your reality by thinking and feeling in the same loop. As soon as u break this chain of emotional bond .

nnael	Ah, of course you had to start with 'pedophile.' You know what a Pedophile is.. someone who rapes children in secret. These girls, and boys also if we're talking about the church, often grow up with mental issues, need years of therapy, etc. It's so common in America that it's a running joke to have a creepy, molesty uncle in the family.     However, when we talk about Aisha and her marriage to Prophet Muhammad, she reached puberty. This is the natural dividing line to start child-bearing age. It isn't some number drawn out of a hat from some old men in an office doesn't take into consideration each individual person's ability or identity. The Prophet died when she was only about 19 years old. Not only was she not a mental wreck, but she was proud of her position as the mother of the believers and continued on after his death for over 40 years teaching his message. She is responsible for about 30% of Islamic law that she continued teaching for many, many years.     So, say what you will.. if that's what you need to make yourself feel better about yourself.	1644081819.0	hvpxldv	t3_shmbyr	t1_hvpw7t6	/r/saudiarabia/comments/shmbyr/number_of_saudi_women_in_the_workforce_throughout/hvpxldv/

She wasn’t as mentally unstable as siderite would be in todays day and age as she thought what your prophet did was completely normal.   If a prophet were to come in this day and age and wants to marry your 6 year old daughter and fuck her when she’s 9 have fun living with that.   You are a fucking disgusting human.

I wonder where those ahadiths came from that say you can't criticize Muslim governments.(also I love KSA and an don't mind the whole modernization but what I do mind is intolerance). Also I don't care about Sufism and I am no scholar of Islam but I do know this I would put the Qur'an above anything else even ahadiths I believe ahadiths are susceptible to misinterpretations and misrepresentations ..and also if you want someone to come to your religion you should be a little more kind rather than mocking Their faith .. explain to them in a nice an polite way that this is not the way guide them .. do not criticize them for that may turn them further away from the religion..	1644223813.0	hvx9ldy	t3_smi9qv	t1_hvx1v5r	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smi9qv/this_cat_is_a_muslim_astronomer_this_is_the/hvx9ldy/

9ylk4pzb	Hello there, from your description of your present state of mind I think from my own experience in the same situations as yours you are probably having anxiety/ depression or under spell of black magic.Or it can be a combination of both...what I mean is that if you are affected by black magic over a long period anxiety/ depression may result.Because most of the symptoms of black magic are similar to anxiety/depression. It's best to get help for your black magic spell then followed with professional help from a psychiatrist.Or you can concurrently get help from both sides.Before seeing a psychiatrist you may need to see a GP and he may refer you to a mental specialist... I hope you would get well soon,InshaAllah....	1644299131.0	hw1rd9a	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw1rd9a/
