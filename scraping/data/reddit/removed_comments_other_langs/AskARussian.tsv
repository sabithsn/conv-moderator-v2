Nobody thirsty over anything or seeking validation from anyone this just your weak ass response to you being triggered 😤 by who the the fuck knows really. I’m say it again you biracials because you’re fucking biracial and it’s not racist to say that. I feel like you have a problem with black people lol because they way you say its always ok for black people to say or do anything and can’t be racist is really giving I have extreme identity issues and that’s your funky ass parents fault not mine lol 😂.   Also this conversations has been PG 13 no one has said anything about dick lol you the only person that got dick on brain 🧠 like you dickhead like seriously nothing sexual explicit has been said so you werid ass hell on that part. Look you need therapy to deal with your issues with black people to be honest. And I hope you look back at this in  future and say I was a dumb ass damn I really had some issues.

dv0kez5s	 У нас в Крыму при СССР наоборот была насаждение принуждение к украинскому языку , мы все  в классе русские и русскоговорящие, ненавидели уроки украинского языка в Школе и уж тем более украинской литературы . Это было чуждо ,казалось надругательством над ясностью и универсумом русского языка. Как это было нудно ,и уже тогда подозревал что не актуально для последующей жизни . Издавалось много украинской периодики и прессы .Моя  родная тётя была библиотекарем в сельской библиотеке и она получала буквально килограммами   украинскую прессу , но ей почти никто не интересовался и тётька называла её шлаком , которую иногда не распечатывая прямо в упаковке через некоторое время увозили в макулатуру . Но коммунисты упорно переводили лес и немалые средства в мовную периодику. Газеты на украинском ввиду их дешевизны и невостребованности уходили на растопку печек ,на кульки для семечек и обёрточной бумаги для продуктов. Мы в Крыму никогда не считали себя украинцами , мы были всегда русскими, в крайнем случае  советскими . Родня на Кубани вообще не задумывались об украинстве , а те кто говорил на суржике незлобливо в шутку называли хохлами.	1642461594.0	ht3q4ee	t3_s6gt95	t3_s6gt95	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6gt95/how_ukrainian_is_kuban/ht3q4ee/
b3z20xw3	Catherine populated the Kuban with Ukrainians And Ukraine with Russians, I understood you correctly? LOL  Only complete idiots can talk about the Holodomor, famine was all over the country.  For example, I can blame America for the Holodomor. LOL During the Great Depression, there was a famine in the United States because of it, America refused to defer the payment of debt to the Soviet Union for the supply of equipment. Which he paid in food, and when the famine of 1932 began due to drought, the Soviet Union continued to supply food to America, although it offered the Americans to pay this debt in gold.	1642466900.0	ht42ip1	t3_s6gt95	t3_s6gt95	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6gt95/how_ukrainian_is_kuban/ht42ip1/
6cg4g	>kuban used to be a majority Ukrainian area settled with Ukrainians by Catherine the great  Catherine the Great resettled there the cossacks from Zaporozhye. Those cossacks have always made a very sharp point of *not*, in fact, being Ukrainians, which can be seen, say, in Gogol's works.  >the Ukrainian language was the most spoken in areas like Kuban, Rossosh and Rostov  Southern Russian dialects used to be spoken in the South, and the still are. Literary Ukrainian is based on the dialects endemic further West, though. The dialect spoken in Kuban is called balachka, but suggesting to its users that they are not cossacks but cryptoukrainians is simply unsafe.  >before Ukrainian was banned by the soviets  Not only was Ukrainian never "banned by the Soviets", it was made mandatory in the Ukrainian SSR that they had created, and saw massive promotion efforts as a part of so called korenizatsiya - replacing ethnic Russian officials in the Soviet Republics with representatives of titular ethnicities.  >during the holodomor these eastern Ukrainians in kuban(but in donbass and dniepr region as well) were genocided  The very concept of Golodomor as an ethnic genocide is a malicious lie trying to capitalize on a tragedy. The failures of the Soviet collectivization efforts combined with a bad harvest produced a hunger from the Ukraine throughout the Russian Southern regions and well into Kazakhstan, claiming a large number of victims - both Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh. Russians were the most numerous out of these in absolute numbers, Kazakhs lost the largest share of population.  >Is this all Ukrainian propaganda?  Yes.	1642471374.0	ht4czek	t3_s6gt95	t3_s6gt95	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6gt95/how_ukrainian_is_kuban/ht4czek/

i6kdupde	I'm just about to learn this part of Russian history at school but looking through the book I've found that yeah, it is mentioned, not in extensive form and not necessarily dragging the USSR through the mud tho   There's a fair bit of info about the Soviet-Finnish war and that the Soviets decided to use power against the Finns when they disagreed to let the USSR move the border.     Also there's quite a bit of info about Bessarabia and stuff and that USSR basically pressured different countries to give them territory but the word "annexed" or "annexation" is never mentioned directly, which is, I'm pretty sure, just to not put too much bad light on the USSR   Check the screenshots out if you want to find out more yourself   [Screenshot from the book #1](https://paste.pics/3900ebb2550d37ed5df570807ec37438) [screenshot #2](https://paste.pics/a6f26099330f70b457b09ed5892fff58)	1642520808.0	ht6sock	t3_s6ymbc	t3_s6ymbc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6ymbc/is_the_annexation_of_the_baltic_states_and/ht6sock/

1z49bw33	Apparently present-day Russia has a lot of people—each of whom just loves to hide behind a «we»—who'd willingly trade in human lives for goodies on the excuse of «everybody else is like that» (even if a bare assumption). I am not surprised. Entire states like the Kingdom of Dahomey or the Aztec Empire or the Assyrian Empire were founded upon and were held together by the industry of mass converting the lives of their own denizens—as well as those of their captive nations—into wealth. The Early Modern era colonial powers like Britain, Spain or the Netherlands—or the somehow no longer reviled Romans of old—apparently belong to the same club.  It's just that justifying this in 2022 seems to me a terribly vile standpoint, and even by the moral standards of the early XXth century Stalin seemed like a prodigy in evil that would put Hitler to shame.  Like killing off thousands of non-Russian citizens (Poles, Koreans, German Communist immigrants, etc.) merely because they had the potential of a culture medium for spies from said minorities' mother nations hostile to the USSR?  Gunning down millions of ethnic Russians on anonymous tips?  Secretly executing orphanage kids who got there because their dads were earlier executed on bogus charges and mums perished in death camps sent there as convicted ЧСИРs?  What kind of mundane, materialistic good could be the justification?  Русня! Вы — охуевшие звери, и ваши кукареки про «оправданность» и «эффективность» действий Сталина — лучшее тому доказательство. Никто из вас бы не отдал бы по своей воле мать, отца или детей на удобрения для целины «ради блага всей страны», а вот когда речь про соседей по лестничной клетке — всегда пожалуйста!	1642851331.0	htqdf65	t3_s9qfks	t1_htqaf2c	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htqdf65/
1z49bw33	Всех, кто идентифицирует себя как русских, молится на Хуйло / Сталина / Гитлера / Дзержинского / Колчака / Унгерна (и любых и прочих любителей оправдывать средства целью), живёт от палки шашлыка до шайки спиртного, ищет и обязательно находит везде воображаемых врагов, обожает выступать с личным мнением от «лица всех русских», и, как полагается любому патентованному русачку, категорически не читает peer reviewed работ по истории, равно как и самих архивных источников (потому что на MMORPG и киновысеры от Marvel времени не останется).  Хотя, на самом деле, самый-самый надёжный способ вычислить тиблу/виблу (нужное подчеркнуть) — это их физиологическая неспособность к рефлексии второго рода, гомофобия, мизогиния, отсутствие интереса ко всему, что не связано с увеличением дохода и развлечениями, фиксация на all things «пися в попу» — от шуток до неформальных культурных практик.   Вот по этим фундаментальным, надкультурным признакам я считаю стопроцентной руснявой свинособакой «Bald and Bankrupt» с ютуба, кем он там сам себя считает — вообще не волнует, по сумме своих поведенческих паттернов это эталонный русак, по которому можно калибровать на манер камертона native Russkies. Я еще задолго до того, как всплыла его одержимость анусами, получением rimjob'ов, пиханием в зад другим людям предметов и долгим, обстоятельным обсуждением этого на форумах про секс-туризм, предсказал: этот британец — стопроцентный русский, и он по-любому все своё свободное время думает и шутит про «писю в попу», а так оно и оказалось. Вспомнил его, потому что этот тип для меня — соьиоателтный образ всего русского, только на стероидах.	1642853526.0	htqgldn	t3_s9qfks	t1_htqeocd	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htqgldn/

Because Germany and France did it - in such an obvious, childish and stupid way, that Lavrov (russian foreigm minister) even released to the general public the emails he exchanged with them concerning the issue.

The cost of parking is 450rub / hour around the clock. There are a lot of shops, depending on where and what. In the center, the same grocery stores are rare, but you, as a rule, cannot drive up to them by car either. On foot or by public transport.
