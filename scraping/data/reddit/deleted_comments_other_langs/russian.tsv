51qzut	Yep, I got a whole-ass degree in it. And one of the first things you have to accept is that you *can't rely on English*. Holding on to preconceptions of how languages work as if they were all word for word relexes of English will only ever hold you back.   Maybe that didn't come across in my tone so well, I've had a shitty work week which hasn't left me in the best mood, but that's what I was trying to say.	1641604856.0	hrpw5sh	t3_rygnab	t1_hrpvf0w	/r/russian/comments/rygnab/difference_between_я_тебя_люблю_and_я_люблю_ты/hrpw5sh/

bikgden7	You were right to be sorry it's completely wrong 😤😤  It's the opposite :) I spoke: completed action, so Я сказал. I am speaking: unfinished, so я говорю  When you use the continuous in English (I was/am/will be doing) it's always the imperfective (говорить) in Russian. And the perfect in English (I had/have/will have done) is almost always the perfective (сказать).	1641951081.0	hsag2no	t3_s1s2hg	t1_hsaeq5k	/r/russian/comments/s1s2hg/what_is_this_column_trying_to_show_me/hsag2no/

f9954fv3	I’m from Bulgaria and Russian is not taught in “almost every school”. In fact, I went to one of the few schools in Sofia that do teach it. Russian used to be taught in most schools back in my parents time, however nowadays the only mandatory language which is taught in all schools is English. To answer this threads question, knowing Russian and reading the Cyrillic will definitely help you in Bulgaria with reading signs and understanding simple things, but it won’t get you too far. People will mostly understand you when you speak Russian, but they’ll have trouble engaging in conversation, unless perhaps they’re a bit older. Overall, you’d have the same or perhaps even better luck with English.	1642076797.0	hsh8rds	t3_qqm6c9	t1_hk19jjk	/r/russian/comments/qqm6c9/which_of_these_countries_can_i_get_by_speaking/hsh8rds/

i647a	Your tip is great for a beginner, but your comment made me curious. I'm a native speaker of both languages and I'm sitting here paying attention to how I'm moving my tongue. I'm not making a yo sound in лёд, but I am in льёт. When I make the yo in льёт, my tongue makes explicit contact with my palette further back than the location of the l. In лёд, I make a papatalized l, which is closer to the roof of the mouth than a regular l. Then I move my tongue into position for the o. I believe what you are hearing is the tongue moving into position from soft l to o creating a brief y, not an explicit y sound that would require readjustment of the tongue. That's why it sounds so brief, and why you don't hear it after hard consonants which aren't close to the roof of the mouth.  In summary, I think it's technically not a y sound - it's the soft l sound that "spills over" into the vowel.	1642465123.0	ht3yd8l	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht1u7dg	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_е_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht3yd8l/

fsjl9	I had no prior background in learning foreign languages and started Russian 2 years ago at the age of 26. Literally everything is/was difficult. The pronunciation is hard, the cases are hard, the amount of information which gets packed into verbs is hard and just generally the fact that ideas are expressed very differently compared to English makes it so that it is difficult to get accustomed to the language.    I would say that the only 2 easy parts I can think of are:    1. the writing system (cyrllic is easy to learn and there aren't too many surprises in how words are pronounced based on how they are spelled).   2. Russian people don't speak too quickly. Obviously this varies by person, and I've seen some people speak the language very fast, but compared to Spanish, Japanese and even some English speakers, it seems to me like Russians on the whole aren't motor mouths.	1642721369.0	htixgf4	t3_s8cyn3	t3_s8cyn3	/r/russian/comments/s8cyn3/ask_english_native_speakers_what_are_the_most/htixgf4/

We have Высшее образованиe - you get your диплом о высшем образовании after 4 or 5 years of university   then you can go for магистратура - it's an additional a year or two and you're right, according to Wikipedia it's the equivalent of masters degree.   and after this you can go for аспирантура - and become a "candidate of sciences" or "кандидат наук" I believe it's the equivalent of PhD.   PS. Google says that honors degree is диплом с отличием,  which basically means the same высшее образование but all the subjects were passed with the best marks, 9 and 10.	1643144347.0	hu7c7ad	t3_scnbo3	t3_scnbo3	/r/russian/comments/scnbo3/how_do_you_say_honours_degree_in_russian/hu7c7ad/

3etfs3ys	As a native English speaker and a medium level Russian speaker I would say this -  You have translated the text literally. I would called it correctly technically but I would never say that sentence in English.  If you said that to me I would understand what you meant but it would be strange way to word it.	1643799404.0	hv9f4nj	t3_sifyzj	t3_sifyzj	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hv9f4nj/

n755g	This used to trip me up too. A sentence like "Russia has 20 million rabbits", although perfectly fine in English, doesn't work with the Russian construction for "having" things. A better parallel English translation might be "In Russia there are 20 million rabbits."   Basically, "have" has a wider (or at least, different) range of use in English.	1643836986.0	hvbwmgb	t3_sifyzj	t3_sifyzj	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hvbwmgb/
