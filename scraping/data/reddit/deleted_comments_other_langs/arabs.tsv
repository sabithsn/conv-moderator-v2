gnimv1v4	>predominantly Muslim  We're all Arabs in this server before being Muslims, Jews, Christians...etc. I'm not here to spare anyone's feelings because my own beliefs shouldn't affect anyone.   The phrasing was accurate because thinking about my life with a Muslim man down the line makes me want to pluck my eyes out. Not because Muslims are inherently bad but their belief system doesn't align with mine and neither would the lifestyle, boundaries, expectations etc. I mean I would know, I grew up here.

gnimv1v4	I appreciate the long and thoughtful comment. Religion doesn't serve any purpose for me whatsoever and that's the main reason I'm not a Muslim anymore. It's not because I've been abused or "don't know real Islam". It'd simply because I don't need religion in my life. Never did. It serves no purpose and no benefit. It's only a source of discomfort, anxiety and burden which the cons of far outweighs any pros (if any at all) for me.	1641553695.0	hrmfjho	t3_rwwsim	t1_hrl5fko	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrmfjho/
xlc6p	I just want you to know how great it is that you're putting in the effort to make their new home a welcoming place.  Maybe it's presumptuous of me to assume they're new to the country, but you are potentially setting them off on the right foot and providing hope by being a thoughtful neighbour.  Inevitably they will have experiences of racism (or have already), so it's great that you're doing this.   I think my parents were lucky enough that people did this when they came to Canada, and I can tell you they have such a positive view of the country overall now just because of their first years here, despite all the negativity they faced over the years.	1641567103.0	hrn4ljx	t3_ry61pl	t1_hrn3el6	/r/arabs/comments/ry61pl/welcome_new_neighbours/hrn4ljx/

I don't really have opinions on what the guy is saying, but I love the irony of how MEMRI (anti-Arab Israeli propaganda project) recorded and published the video so westerners would be outraged at the guy, but when the video was published pretty much everybody agreed with him, including westerners who are the target audience of MEMRI.

azmou57o	America is a particularly hyper capitalist society. Real estate is the primary form of wealth for the vast majority of the middle class. Real estate is the least productive form of asset, that the bulk of household wealth is tied up in. In less hyper-capitalist societies real estate ownership is not even a goal for ownership. Imagine spending all of your 20-50s earning a wage just to be able to own a house. If you lived in a society that valued housing as a public good (look up housing in Vienna, or even Germany which has a high proportion of renters), you would free up your prime life years in being able to choose work not based on monetary pressure of being able to own a home.	1642488424.0	ht5c25l	t3_s5pgh0	t1_ht4ox0w	/r/arabs/comments/s5pgh0/monday_majlis_open_discussion/ht5c25l/

He wants to have Saudi citizenship cause he is muslim? As a muslim, your benefits recieved from Saudi citizenship is basically nothing. I've met Saudi Muslims, Christians, and Athiests in my time in Saudi and they all had the same benefits regardless of religion.  My family isn't Saudi (nor even Arab), but my parents were born and raised in Saudi (so basically 45+ years), and same with my siblings (so 15+ years), and none of us are Saudi, and nor does Saudi citizenship interests us.   I'd say the only benefit of living in Saudi is being close to Makkah and Medina, but that is the same benefit all residents of Saudi recieve. Regardless of having or not having Saudi citizenship.   He should really enjoy his US citizenship in my opinion lmao.	1642835172.0	htpqis7	t3_s9rg3k	t3_s9rg3k	/r/arabs/comments/s9rg3k/what_a_show/htpqis7/

d9m2u8zb	Your first point is correct, what I'm disagreeing with is this high standing notion you have that this game is to educate and inform. Team A vs team B is different from villain vs hero, and you're ignoring the notion that your chosen 'good guys' aren't particularly good (and that's putting it very lightly).   "Do you get mad at COD for having America as the good guys....."  I don't get mad, but I don't take it seriously whatsoever. Everyone knows COD is all about American supersoldiers, heroic music in cutscenes, and Russian accented cartoonish villains. The difference is no one would ever, in anyway shape or form, paint COD as some art piece aimed at raising awareness or invoking discussion. If COD made a game about Yemen in that same fashion today, it'd be immensely insulting. COD is a nonsense shooter, you're trying to say your game is art.  Of course you're free to do whatever you want and pick whatever subject matter that interests you for your game. I think it's pretty distasteful and way too soon, but that's just me.	1643237518.0	hud06eo	t3_sd9p54	t1_hucy6zg	/r/arabs/comments/sd9p54/algeria_i_am_solodeveloping_a_strategy_boardgame/hud06eo/

d9m2u8zb	It's certainly not a dead language, and a few decades ago it was much more 'alive'. Berber languages (there are multiple) don't have a rich literary tradition, but there was writing using the Arabic script.  People don't realise how arabisation in Morocco really happened tbh, somehow people have the image that Moroccans have largely been speaking Arabic since Islam came over centuries ago.  Basically Morocco was majority Berber speaking until less than a century ago, at the time the French arrived most people were Berber speaking and living in the country side. It's only after independence with mass urbanisation and the new education system that Berber really started to be less spoken.	1643326116.0	huibyqg	t3_se9v32	t1_huibck9	/r/arabs/comments/se9v32/saw_this_on_wikipedia_on_the_arabic_language_page/huibyqg/
d9m2u8zb	Millions of people don't just stop speaking their language overnight. You can see in Morocco there are blobs of light green, these are the berber speaking regions where for the most part you can get by speaking only that language. So there's no urgent need, and alot of people grew up speaking it too.  It might completely fade out over the next few decades, who knows.	1643326355.0	huicjw3	t3_se9v32	t1_huica4c	/r/arabs/comments/se9v32/saw_this_on_wikipedia_on_the_arabic_language_page/huicjw3/

ec5qnwui	You're confusing some thing here, Pashto and Farsi are both Iranic languages - so both are closer in the sense they have a common ancestor. So neither is based on the other, but took different evolution paths. Urdu on the other hand is descended from sanskrit (although further down the line that merges with Old Persian as indo aryan, so words like Tu in the diagram is sanskrit but is also used in Farsi), but because of Urdu's heavy Persianization (taking words from modern Persian) the vocabulary is more similar to Farsi than Pashto and Farsi.  &#x200B;  Also Urdu cannot be basically Hindi because Hindi (Hindavi) was the old name for Urdu, and modern Hindi was artificially created in 1938 by removing Arabic/Persian influence from Urdu.	1643915055.0	hvgh3j1	t3_siwyb0	t1_hvbwutj	/r/arabs/comments/siwyb0/origin_of_all_the_urdu_words_in_the_pakistan/hvgh3j1/
ec5qnwui	Plugging what I said before, while technically correct it's chronologically misleading. There was a huge movement in India that created Hindi from Urdu.   Also Urdu cannot be basically Hindi because Hindi (Hindavi) was the old name for Urdu, and modern Hindi was artificially created in 1938 by removing Arabic/Persian influence from Urdu.	1643915112.0	hvgh92d	t3_siwyb0	t1_hvbxrok	/r/arabs/comments/siwyb0/origin_of_all_the_urdu_words_in_the_pakistan/hvgh92d/
ec5qnwui	That's inaccurate, the words are formally incorporated into Urdu from Persian and Arabic. It's like saying if a Persian calls someone agha he's speaking Turkish.  &#x200B;  Finally, the meanings and pronunciation have changed. For example 'paak' means more like hygienic in Persian and wouldn't be used in this context the way it is in Urdu. Similar to what some of the Arabic words here which have a slightly or majorly different meaning in Arabic, while the relation is obvious (hygenic/pure) they still have changed in meaning.	1643915271.0	hvghoea	t3_siwyb0	t1_hvdwm5e	/r/arabs/comments/siwyb0/origin_of_all_the_urdu_words_in_the_pakistan/hvghoea/

7mtqnwpf	It's always been a fear even before the (first) Gulf War, that Arabs would be more inclined to sow sedition and shake up the status quo in the Gulf.   Truth is Palestinians were given carte blanche in Kuwait to the extent that all the major newspapers were edited by Palestinians at one stage and the front page would always be about the Palestinian-Israel conflict, you'd have to get to page 6 before reading any local news. Many Arab nations back then saw the Palestinian-Israel conflict as a rallying call and a welcome diversion for their own local populations that would otherwise be eager to play a political role in their own countries.  I'm sure someone more read on the history could weigh in but Palestinians also had a massive chip on their shoulder, after all they've contributed to Kuwaiti society and economy many of them for 40, 50 years yet still had no permanent residency rights and were subject to forms of racism ("I'll deport you!" was a common threat from a Kuwaiti to a Palestinian for the most minor perceived infraction) so many were seduced by Saddam Hussein, a pan-Arabist saviour who would see them as Arabs, as equals, and grant them their rights in Kuwait or whatever Saddam wanted to call it - the 16th Iraqi Province? Furthermore the SCUDs that rained Israeli skies were like Cupid's arrows to their hearts. It's important to note that these were sympathies that didn't manifest themselves on the ground, in fact Palestinians in Kuwait were protecting Kuwaitis during the invasion and there were no incidents of Palestinians raising arms against Kuwaitis. But in a major political misstep Arafat flew to Iraq and was seen kissing Saddam in the irony of all ironies, a leader of an occupied nation supporting the occupation of another.  Kuwait's liberation was a calamity for the Palestinians, first revenge attacks on them by Kuwaitis and later in one fell swoop 500,000 were deported out of Kuwait and into neighbouring countries. Another bad hand dealt to the Palestinians by the course of history.  I digress, but the fears about Arabs political activism were already in place before the Gulf War, but the Gulf War did become a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Gulf regimes to maintain their policy of extreme caution towards Arab workers.	1643958886.0	hvj83oe	t3_sjeo1m	t1_hvizh5r	/r/arabs/comments/sjeo1m/a_thread_on_arabic_literacy_and_diglossias_impact/hvj83oe/

The chairman claims it is within his legal right to unilaterally admit observers.  The AU now has created a committee that will review the decision and give a verdict at the next assembly. Democratic Republic of Congo and Morocco are those that are in support of Israel. No surprise from Morocco as they are now openly allied with Israel, politically and militarily.  The issue has potential to cause a massive rift in the bloc tho. If the decision is not overturned, it is not unlikely that Algeria would withdraw from the Union altogether.	1644258852.0	hvz5h40	t3_smx5zn	t3_smx5zn	/r/arabs/comments/smx5zn/african_union_creates_committee_to_review/hvz5h40/

i14f3	I hate division and I feel as much as you nothing but love for Moroccan people. But, I love Algeria and I need to give another viewpoint to give a fair opinion to this sub:  This territory was not taken to Moroccan but to French through the blood of 1m5 Algerians. If Algerians didn’t manage to get its deserved independence, would Morocco declare a war to France as it declared to Algeria one year after its independence?  Claiming that this territory was Moroccan or Algerian in a concept before 1830 is a nonsense. Even the treaty of Lalla Maghnia explains that territory where there is no water source are not habitable and their border is superfluous.   The truth is that the position of this territory was unclear through >1 century between Morocco and Algeria (nobody knew and all maps contradict to each other). France finally decided to define a clear border in 1952 but you won’t find a conventional map before.  Let’s agree to disagree on that point.	1644274565.0	hw09n6x	t3_sn24yq	t1_hw055gc	/r/arabs/comments/sn24yq/footage_of_moroccos_king_hassan_2_recognizes_the/hw09n6x/

Saudi-UAE-America whomever you want to blame, they are only the after effect. It was Houthis initially who shot their missiles towards the north. Houthis started this war.  And so you don’t lose track of what I say here and succumb to illogical conclusions, I am not saying Saudi or any other power is free from blame. I am only pointing out the (other) major players of the war.	1644282097.0	hw0r4df	t3_smwr1c	t1_hvzmosh	/r/arabs/comments/smwr1c/war_in_yemen_targets_only_children_and/hw0r4df/

It’s not like Israel is opening its borders for all LGBTQ Palestinians. What’s funny is that this is literally what many Western countries do: they open their borders to LGBTQ people around the world through refugee programs. So the Zionists get to sell themselves as champions of LGBTQ rights while literally not even meeting the standards of LGBTQ rights around the world. But they want Arabs to give them a cookie because Arab Israelis had to put in the work to give Arab Israelis the rights that others in Israel had. This is an Arab accomplishment in the face of systemic discrimination. They’re literally co-opting Arab accomplishments to pinkwash themselves—accomplishments that had to be made because they themselves did not give LGBTQ Arabs the very rights they claim to be upholding.	1644296754.0	hw1n63f	t3_smbo0v	t3_smbo0v	/r/arabs/comments/smbo0v/monday_majlis_open_discussion/hw1n63f/

Doesn't it strike you as suspicious that no third party ever confirmed such a war crime? The UN itself investigated and did not come up with anything to blame Morocco with.   If it had happened the way the Algerian regime had painted it it would be a war crime, and no way they would have simply stayed quiet about it.	1644330581.0	hw32opr	t3_sn24yq	t1_hw28fba	/r/arabs/comments/sn24yq/footage_of_moroccos_king_hassan_2_recognizes_the/hw32opr/
d9m2u8zb	Ok, I wanted to address "Abdelkaders betrayal".  The Moroccan sultanate backed Abdelkaders resistance, both with material support and by providing safety in their territory. This continued until the French demanded that the sultan rescind his support and take actions against Abdelkader. As a result of Morocco's refusal the French attacked, bombarding two of its key trading cities and crushing a Moroccan army at Isly. As a result of the 1844 treaty of tangiers imposed on Morocco after this defeat, Abdelkader was outlawed and Algeria was recognised as part of the French empire.  "In 1844, the crisis in Franco-Moroccan relations, following Abd al-Qaders establishment of sanctuary in Morocco, led to the battle of Isly, in which the French completely routed the Moroccans."  "When Abd Al Rahman tried to help dislodge the French from Algeria by providing massive aid to Abd al-Qadir, the French made him, in 1836, sign a commitment to stop it. But the aid continued to flow, and from 1837 to 1843, the French applied heavy pressure on the sultan - through frequent notes transmitted through the French consul in Tangier, sometimes with the backing of French warships sailing along Moroccan shores - to cease all aid to Abd al-Qadir."  "In other words, Franco-Moroccan relations from 1836 to 1843 were characterized by the sultans continuous efforts to eliminate the dangerous French presence in Algeria - first with his own forces, and later through Abd al-Qader - and by heavy French pressures, reinforced by the powerful French navy, to thwart the sultans policy".

d9m2u8zb	You're missing the point buddy. They confirmed the killing of three Algerians, what's under debate is the narrative of the innocent civilians murdered by Morocco in foreign territory. Like I said, they investigated and did not come up with anything to blame Morocco with indicating that this is far less innocent than the Algerian regime claims.  Considering that this happened during a flare up in the conflict, and Algerian unconditional support for the Polisario who were at that time attacking Moroccan posts in the Sahara, it's not hard to see why the UN investigation didn't agree with the Algerian narrative is it?  One thing that's certain is that the Algerians have violated the UN mandated buffer zone.	1644332283.0	hw36o0z	t3_sn24yq	t1_hw35le5	/r/arabs/comments/sn24yq/footage_of_moroccos_king_hassan_2_recognizes_the/hw36o0z/

d9m2u8zb	If you're just calculating the GDP with the same numbers, then yes because the number of people it's 'shared' between would be lower.  In reality GDP is sort of a measure of total economic output, so you obviously would have a much lower economic output if the vast majority of your workforce left the country.	1644439579.0	hw9vqv0	t3_so77zu	t1_hw9h3r7	/r/arabs/comments/so77zu/arab_league_gdp_share_ppp_and_gdp_per_capita_ppp/hw9vqv0/
d9m2u8zb	This is a pretty poor way of thinking. It's not the responsibility of every civilian to 'prove' they're harmless. The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the west have never presented any threat, and are innocent if any extremist violence. This sounds alot like the whole right wing "Muslims might not be terrorists but they never condemn terrorism", when in reality nearly every Muslim association in the west and otherwise has condemned the likes of ISIS and Al Qaeda.  Wearing a hijab or a beard is not 'scary', and people who do so shouldn't stop just so they would be less visibly Muslim.	1644467534.0	hwbrcuo	t3_soopdy	t1_hwbityq	/r/arabs/comments/soopdy/macron_doubles_french_funding_for_christian/hwbrcuo/
