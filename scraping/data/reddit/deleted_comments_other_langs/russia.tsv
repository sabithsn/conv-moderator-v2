dz7cdv1m	Actually it does matter. There are studys that show that a large part of pedophiles are actually gay. The chance for a homosexual to be pedo is a lot higher than for a hetero. Thats why boys are more often molested than girls. Many countrys use that as reason against the right for adoption for gays.	1641548537.0	hrm8t2t	t3_rxh42x	t1_hrk7b82	/r/russia/comments/rxh42x/two_days_ago_in_kostroma_two_men_an_old_gay_and/hrm8t2t/
dz7cdv1m	Yes it does matter because gay people are more likely to je pedophiles than heterosexuals. Some countrys deny them adoption because of that reason.	1641548625.0	hrm8x8o	t3_rxh42x	t1_hrku0tn	/r/russia/comments/rxh42x/two_days_ago_in_kostroma_two_men_an_old_gay_and/hrm8x8o/

16vres	Your tinfoil conspiracy theory is straight up disinformation, no way around it. No evidence ever existed, nothing ever happened, you just "want to believe".  The american regime was defeated after their color-revolution completely failed, they have been raging about it ever since. But they can't do anything about it, hence the panic and propaganda. Have you noticed the propaganda about China too? same story, they can't do anything, as China defeated the american regime in the "trade war", the pandemic, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Taiwan, etc. Notice how in all these cases, the american regime is the one who can't stand the status quo and launches propaganda campaigns and interference to try to change it, only to be humiliated (be it Ukraine, Xinjiang or Hong Kong).  Why does the american regime fear the status quo so much? because america is in terminal decline and has no answers to it, that's why the propaganda you gladly consume exists, it's an expression of impotence. That's the harsh reality you are scared to admit.	1642195205.0	hsoiofe	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsobnxh	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsoiofe/

9f97d	> I mean Putin did lie that there were no Russians troops in Crimea  We rented space at Crimea for our fleet since 1997. But in reality there were no troops forcing anyone to vote for Crimea to join Russia.  Take a look at video footage from the streets of Crimea when it joined Russia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9AWGnFCi9U  . Does that look like they were forced by anyone or rather finally came home ?. Crimea was always Russian, only due to stupidity of Gorbachev overnight everyone living there somehow were now forced to consider themself 'Ukrainians'.    > Putin seems unsatisfied, so I'm scared he'll try another little war to heat up nationalism and revanchism.  By 'another' you refer to Georgia ?. Please educate yourself on that matter, this has nothing to do with Ukraine attacking its own russian-speaking territories of Donbas and Lugansk which happens now.	1642202496.0	hsp0rhr	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsp0rhr/

Any battle fought outside of China, only benefits China at this point. China collecting DNA from citizens across the globe by obtaining companies and using said DNA to develop bioweapons that only affect non-asian DNA is currently a very valid theory as to why China is doing the DNA collecting from medical chinese companies across the globe. Touching China would crash the entire world economy though.	1642209173.0	hspfw5y	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsob6l3	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hspfw5y/

4kcp6a11	>The average american is frankly sick of this and wars.   I want to believe you, but that's not the case if you follow popular subreddits) Anywhere you go - Russia IS just bad, nothing positive comes from that place. "Russia wants war and annex more lands". Your average american is completely ignorant about anything concerning russia - they don't know and they're not interested to know and go deeper, find out, research another party's point of view. Ask the simple question - WHY. All they do is blindly reiterate CNN, NBC and FOX primitive propaganda.   Look at the latest example: NO ONE in russia (officials) ever mentioned that they want to invade Ukraine, annex Ukraine or go to war or whatever, yet all the popular US media talk about it like it is a sure thing. And here on reddit every american reiterate this BS. "Putin wants to restore the Soviet Union, annex lands because he is a macho man". BULLSHIT! In my opinion putin is a crook and an asshole and he needs to go, but he doesn't need "more land", it's not that simple.   Yes, there are russian troops on the border, but did you (not you, but an average american) know that Ukranian president went from 75% supporting rate to 20% in the last couple of months? Did you know that they have political and economical crisis right now? Did you know that he was blamed of treason by the ukrainian people and journalists who actually brought him to power, not the opposition, but his core supporters? Did you know that there is a big oligarch fight going on right now in Ukraine? and the result of that fight could turn into the bloody mess?	1642229554.0	hsqjg2b	t3_s3b2in	t1_hsp4kjf	/r/russia/comments/s3b2in/does_the_russian_media_portray_the_united_states/hsqjg2b/

y2hmths	The fact is, while I can understand the need to feel more security near their border, in regards to Ukraine, the way Russia is going about it is not wise. If they truly want more security from the West they’re going about it the wrong way, they’re not contributing to any sort of peaceful diplomacy instead they’re straining the relationship and Putin knows this.  He’s be willing to lose millions of Russians in order to secure territory and resources from neighboring countries, of course it will be justified through patriotism and national security and many would die willingly for their country, just like America to its own military. We’re not so different.  Part of me wonders why the US and Russia do not work together to keep China in check, the enemy of my enemy sort of thing. We have more to gain from working together and more to lose from fighting eachother. No American wants the US to invade Russia ever, but I’m sure China would be plenty happy to relieve Russia of some territory and resources if they had the opportunity	1642242012.0	hsr0aw1	t3_s49wxk	t3_s49wxk	/r/russia/comments/s49wxk/mods_of_rrussia_arresting_a_bunch_of_western/hsr0aw1/

Imagine a gerrymandering on a country level, but instead of it being for voting, it was for administrative reasons, and/or to please the local “boss”.  We can turn it as much as we want, but Crimea and Donbass are better defined by the “Russian” adjective, not “Ukrainian”.	1642249229.0	hsra4fp	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsra4fp/

For your information, i was born there, i am a professional writer in finnish language, and i have one thing to say to:  Te kouluttamattomat maalaisjuntit ette tajua härmästä yhtään mitään, te yritätte tuhota meidän härmän ja te pellet annoitte pois Nokian, tuhositte meidän itsenäisyytemme 2000-luvun alussa ja teidän maanpetturien takia me elämme ja kirjoitamme maanpaossa. Kasvoin Eiran ja Ullanlinnan rajoilla Pietarinkadulla, kuuntelin Pietarinkadun Oilersin pottuilupuhelinta ja tiedän tarkkaan mitä mieltä Sakke ja kumppanit teistä maalaisjunteista on. Tiedän mitä Kaurismäki ajattelee, ja tiedän mitä te maanpetturit yritätte tehdä. Siinä on sinun vitun hinttis saatanan koulumattoman juntti. Valmistuin Helsingin Yliopiston yleisen kirjallisuuden linjalta H.K. Riikosen johdolla (siinä on yksi taas isänmaallinen koulutettu ihminen), ja teidän paskanaamojen ja pellejen valehtelun takia Suomi on menettänyt täysin pelin. Ja jos joku vitun maailaisjuntti, joka tuskin edes tuntee Haavikkoa, Tikkasta tai Veijo Merta vielä kerran täällä tai jossain muualla käy mun kimppuuni, niin tulee tupen rapinat. Ja sinä ja sinun vitun trollisi, kouluttamattomat juntit. Katotaan mikä pelle siellä on jostain saatanan Kärsämäeltä joka on varastanut näiden vitun käteisten, stuppien ja mariinien kanssa meidän maan. Onko selvä, vitun maalaisjuntti? Sinä olet se vitun trolli ja minä olen kirjailija, jota lukee yli 200 000 ihmistä joka kuukausi. Tommoset saatanan tavalliset pulliaiset, onko töissä vähän tylsää, onko se oma pieni siellä Kärsämäellä käynyt vähän tylsäki. Painu junttiin vittuun, ja nyt saman tien.

hy5g2klo	That's what I was talking . People use that movie as evidence of their nazi propaganda. Most of the casualties were civilians who were simply murdered because they were slavs, but people shift the blame and downplay what the Germans did with excuses like"human waves", "Stalin killed more people than Hitler" ect.

6ksc4euo	In honesty we were taught that they fought without (or with empty) weapons because the military budget ran out. Sometime in the early 40's brass became internationally scarce and soviet rounds were fitted with steel casings which work good enough for a while but destroy the "upper" and barrel over time. At the same time I can buy a mosin nagant at the pawn shop for $500 so idk just how bad they were. But I guess even then Russia had way more troops than they had bullets and we were taught that near the end, the eastern front was won by charging soldiers with empty weapons  We were also taught that the war devastated the russian male population, some 20 million casualties I think, which caused economic and population problems that can still be measured today  Is that different than what you are taught?	1642614274.0	htcefvs	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbk8e3	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htcefvs/

Today it is the West that projects its own sins on Russia in a bid to make Russia in its own image.

Its just kids ffs, and no children deserve to be shot. But they never change the gun laws, and to me that is admitting that guns are more important than childrens.  Its so weird and it is the single biggest reason I would never wanna live in the US.

3tr314my	Me, being from Poland, I'd rather if everyone calmed the fuck down. Actually, most of us Poles would probably love that   I know what I'm about to put here are just empty platitudes to many, but We're all slavic here in Central and eastern Europe. Our languages are similiar, we had similiar struggles. We're closer to each other mentally than the west or China will ever be. They don't understand us.  In my eyes, we're all brothers. We should stick together and use diplomatic means to solve our differences. Hell, invite Russia to NATO if it wants to join. Why the fuck not? Putin, even if he has antagonistic plans (because who the fuck really knows what's on his mind) towards the west, he won't live forever. Whatever our history was (fucked up, to say the least), we would be much better if we learnt from it and moved on. Everyone was a dick to another at some point. That's just how it was. We should be better than this.  The thing is: our post-soviet governments suck ass. Polish government always used Russia as a scapegoat, used everything what Soviets did against Poland to cover their shady business inside the country (and unfortunately, my Russian friends, it wasn't just saving our country from the nazis).   Putin and his team seems to do the same, painting us as a threat to Russia to push a narrarive, to gain popularity and create common enemy. But that's exactly what politicians do. It's a tactic old as the world.   But we as Polish people don't want to wage war with you, guys. But we sure are careful, because you're powerful.  And most importantly: there's far bigger threat to all of us: China. I know Putin sided with them, but in my opinion, he wasn't given any other option. US and the west basically forced him to Ally himself with China. And these cunts that currently run China, they don't care if whole world will burn. They want every little bit of power they can gain. Chinese people are already flooding Russian Siberia, aren't they? Do you really think they will just stop and live there in the frozen wasteland? No, they will move to more civilised places, to cities.   Chinese officials want to own us, economically and our societies. They want to overtake our businesses, to put shackles on our wrists and put us to work as a slave class. Just look what to they're doing to their own citizens. They don't see us as their equals.  If anything, we should stick together and stand against them and waste more time, fighting between ourselves.	1643147823.0	hu7lbls	t3_s9pr4r	t3_s9pr4r	/r/russia/comments/s9pr4r/ukrainian_crisis_megathread_selft_post_or/hu7lbls/

5zdwwjck	Yes, I think US is interesting in invading Russia. There is no other reason for US to keep building based in Europe after the fall of Soviet Union. This also explains why Russia was denied NATO membership.  US economy is built on the principle of endless expansion and ginormous US military only exists to support this expansion. Nobody threatens US due to its geography, the whole NATO idea is about offensive.  US needs Russia’s natural resources and land access to China because China will be next.	1643322676.0	hui3b8d	t3_se6xra	t3_se6xra	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/hui3b8d/

Everything I learned about World War2, Slavic countries were occupied lands, not allied with the Nazis, ever.   Pockets of locals who did what the Nazis wanted them to do did so as slaves at gun point, not out of their eagerness to follow a foreign dictator.

ihrckv8m	There are several thousand of these structures through-out the Caucasus region. Often they are referred to as tombs however it was not uncommon for burials to take place inside the floor of the structures while they were occupied. I dispute these theory, clearly them were meant to live in, they provided warmth, shelter safety while sleeping and for the females of a clan they offer protection during a women's monthly cycle when predators would be drawn far and wide by a females scent. Many people reject this due to it's just factor, but it is a mature view considering how widespread wild predators such as lions, tigers, wolves, bears, hyenas, etc. Even though they are very old there is no accurate measure to date them. People need a place to sleep at night, so they were homes.	1643871931.0	hve39e6	t3_sigqib	t1_hva5x2b	/r/russia/comments/sigqib/dolmens_of_russia_along_the_coast_of_the_black/hve39e6/

They’re on the border of Ukraine with tanks. They are a war machine run by Putin. It might be a great country but when does the next generation get to pick its own leader. It’s like having a corrupt cruel leader with KGB tactics for a president. It’s time for the younger generation of Russians to choose a new leader. My grandparents were Lithuanians I don’t think they like the Russians since they deported most of the family to Siberia and raided the churches.I’m neutral but I wish they’d work on their own problems and stay out of our elections. Everybody wants peace but you’ll never have it with the Russian government and Putin. Choose a young dynamic progressive leader it’s your generation not that of a lifetime kgb president. I’m in sympathy with the new Russian generation and their freedom. I don’t trust the current Russian government one bit.

It's just that politicians and their propaganda make us believe that Russia (and its people) have ill intents. Some people believe in this propaganda, and it sparks a conflict on the people's level too. But these people are already idiots for having bought into the messaging.

More people know about a TV show than they do a simple mathematical principle which will serve them their entire live time.

It could be as simple as man vs woman, young vs old, white vs black, the US populace is constantly fighting a running battle everyday. It is even parents vs children.  For many people it is a simple as an extension of early childhood development for the association of sports teams. This team vs that team, it then extends into everyday daily life involving everything. Often it comes down to, sure our own government is disgusting, but your government is more disgusting than mine.

6vk5m	What’s funny is that I refused to join the U.S. Army 5 years ago because I didn’t want to go to Syria, as I didn’t want to get in the Russian’s way. (Which ultimately we lost in Syria…) So 5 years later, I figured the air was clean and decided to enlist in our Air Force, and now the Ukraine situation is happening… I pray to sweet Jesus I don’t go over there and get involved with that. When it comes to Russian conflict, I turn anti-war real quick. A war with Russia is a guaranteed death. If I had a country of my own, Russia would be the last one I’d want to go to war with.  I’m very happy Moscow wants diplomacy. I feel like we can work something out.

Following the upgrades in 2016 to a “Class 2 year-round runway,” Nagurskoye Airbase is now capable of hosting fighter and refueling aircraft, notably Su-34 and MiG-31 fighter jets and Il-78 refueling tankers. Based on a 2018 Danish Intelligence Risk Assessment, Russian aircraft based at Nagurskoye Airbase are capable of reaching the airspace over northeastern Greenland with little prior warning. Supported by air-to-air refueling, Russian combat aircraft could reach Thule Air Base, a key installation in the U.S. space and missile defense architecture, while simultaneously enlarging Russia’s A2/AD bubble into the North Atlantic.15  Cool Base, good for Russia, good for development in the Arctic	1644091932.0	hvqhy5x	t3_sl3fay	t3_sl3fay	/r/russia/comments/sl3fay/arctic_shamrock_is_a_new_military_base_of_the/hvqhy5x/

In general, Russian women still prefer a man to be quite (respectfully), and the ways to court a Russian woman lie more with "old school" chivalry, strong&respectful character, and have a soft spot for a well hidden (Stoïc) sensitive side you only show to her every now and then.. but nothing too weepy.. just the right amount of passion..   Generally, Russian women (nor men) like to discuss or talk about nonsense "the birds and the bees".. so this also interferes with possible flirting/socializing, if this is your go-to move to break the ice..   And Russians only talk about their personal lives & feelings with very closely trusted people, and nearly never want to discuss it.. and when asked "how are you?" , it's considered a bit rude/inappropriate to say that you're not doing very well, and refuse to explain why.. you either say you're fine and move on, or entrust someone with feeling bad, and briefly explain why..   *(I'm Belgian, but these are my impressions of Russia(ns) from my travels & experiences there)*	1644455751.0	hwb0ifr	t3_sose5z	t3_sose5z	/r/russia/comments/sose5z/flirting_in_russia/hwb0ifr/

65n4soj1	I dont think they would have even that much. If you read The Economic History of Eastern Europe you will find that without Russia eastern europe would have been totally enslaved and colonised by the germans. Remember the habsburgs that kept half the place like czechs in darkness (temno) for 300 years. Kafka didnt come from nowhere. Almost all wealth that ended up in eastern europe was because of trade with Russia.	1644494578.0	hwcuvb6	t3_sp4oag	t1_hwctfbk	/r/russia/comments/sp4oag/lol/hwcuvb6/

c5xw98qk	The US uses the dollar (I.e, reserve currency) and it’s economic dominance as a key component of their military strategy. Ignoring this as part of their military strategy, sure, they are comparable when it comes to fire power. But to ignore it is to ignore a key manifestation of US military power.  For example, the US is withholding billions of dollars of Afghan assets. They’re doing this to project their power because the military has ostensibly left.  I think we could go back and forth for days and not agree, but if you say something new that proves my assertion to be weak or baseless, I will reply.	1644498101.0	hwd0t7b	t3_sonxg5	t1_hwcya58	/r/russia/comments/sonxg5/the_worlds_most_powerful_militaries_jan_2022/hwd0t7b/

g00r7	> We'll see. A ruling should come soon. However, anything that merely reprimands any Russian would be an insult to logic.  It's interesting how such a sweeping negative generalization can be  thrown at the Russians. I honestly can't think of any other nation, ethnicity or race, except for the Chinese maybe, that gets treated with such a disdain and open hostility in the West. They really make their grandpa Hitler proud.	1644503917.0	hwdd9xx	t3_sp7oey	t3_sp7oey	/r/russia/comments/sp7oey/report_kamila_valieva_tests_positive_for_banned/hwdd9xx/
