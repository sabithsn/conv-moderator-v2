g00r7	My bad, I was confused by your rhetoric:  > Rus = Ukraine, Mongols-Tatars mixed local Finns aka Moskals can fuck off.   > Moscow Church is sect, they are not recognized by World Orthodoxia. Ukraine has it's own independent Church which is part of World Orthodoxia and soon will Belarus.  Modern Russian language was influenced by invasion and a lot of foreign words were added. Moscovia remain vassal of Horde and paid it's dues to Horde until early 18th century. There were no books printed in Moscovia, until Belarusians came and print them.   > That's bullshit invented by Moskal occupants to brainwash people who they occupied. Belarusians and Ukrainians have nothing in common with Moskal pigs.    > Moskals clean shitters and suck dicks for 3 times less money. At Pidarashka. If someone is qualified to only clean toilets, they can at least get paid better than Moskal toilet cleaners. And it works for every profession.   > What a stupid Moskal. Your country lays in fucking ruins. People dying from poisoned vodka in bunches and he's worried about Polish people going to UK for top salary.

ajf56	>I thought white replacement meme was just in the west but its in russia too?  It's simply the attempts of politically illiterate people to conceptualize the cause of problems their society is facing. It isn't difficult to understand why this is the case - in the Russian context, it's far easier for Central Asian labour migrants to get into Russia than it is for people from the Russian diaspora in Central Asia to repatriate.   So what does that look like at first glance if you don't understand anything about the political and economic situation? It looks like the government would prefer to populate the country with foreigners who do not integrate and have a strong tendency towards aggression rather than Russians.  In reality it's an unsustainable model of oligarchs exploiting foreign workers from the poorest countries for the sake of profit margins, just like in the West. The end result **is** the replacement of entire cultures, but just like with climate change or any other problem driven by corporate greed, the end result is totally irrelevant to those responsible.	1641573297.0	hrnl5ij	t3_rxceto	t1_hri8zb6	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxceto/are_you_worried_about_the_future_of_russia_and/hrnl5ij/

avgpx	Yes.  They celebrate it on December 25, which is now January 7 in the new calendar.  It's not Catholics who switched to it, it was the whole world.  But Catholics went along with it, and Orthodox Christians did not.  Also, many Russians celebrate "the Old New Year Eve", which is January 14, as you can guess.	1641581980.0	hro9gh2	t3_ryeq77	t3_ryeq77	/r/AskARussian/comments/ryeq77/can_anyone_explain_in_detail_why_russian_orthodox/hro9gh2/
ajf56	> Somehow, she thinks Tatars or Bashkirs or any other predominantly Muslim ethnicity do not deserve to be Russians  The ones you listed happen to be the ones that are almost universally excluded from these judgements, because they're secular and have been getting along with Russians for centuries. I didn't see her mention them anywhere, so I'm going to assume that, like the rest of the country, she's judging based on behaviour and thus doesn't have any problem with either of them. Also, she didn't say anything about "deserving" to be Russians. What she said is these migrants hate Russians. People who hate Russians obviously will not become Russians.  >She did not get much of approval here, which is a relief, but what if her goal was to just plant the seed, the idea?  Leaving aside the fact that this sub is an extremely skewed sample of Russian sentiment, I have seen her discuss this issue before and the reaction can swing one way or the other. In my observation, her frustrations are shared by a huge majority of Russian people, but her way of framing the issue is unusual. I also think it's pretty clear that the impetus behind her posts is the fact that she's a woman who is distressed by how increasingly vulnerable the female experience is becoming in her country. Exactly the same thing has already happened  en-masse in the West and there's no reason to think it won't happen in Russia. The old 5 year rule holds true yet again.  >When somebody says some illegal shit  What did she say that's illegal? There's a law against criticizing religion but it only applies to broadcasting, not individuals on social media.  >I am not an ethnic Russian, so this hits too close to home.  Neither am I, but I don't see how that matters. In my view, if someone chooses to live among a particular group of people then they shouldn't want to see foreigners come and act like they are entitled to be the dominant culture. In Altai there is a problem with tourists, mostly Russians, defacing sacred sites with graffiti (literally carving "Illya was here" over 3000 year old rock carvings etc). I think any rational, decent person should be able to admit that this is a problem and accept that the Altains have every right to be angry about it. Even though these tourists are obviously a small minority, I think any ethnic Russian should be able to admit that these incidents show that there is a flaw somewhere in Russian society that is producing those people who have no respect for culture or history. Unfortunately, with Muslims, this is a pattern of behavior that goes back thousands of years and has touched every corner of the world by now - and although defacing cultural monuments is certainly part of it, there are much worse crimes that come with these kind of huge influxes of Muslim foreigners.  I think the problem you're having is that you have no ideological attachment to Islam, but you try to attach yourself to it in other ways. When Muslims are judged on an ideological basis, you can't make sense of it, because you consider yourself the target of this judgement, but in reality you're not because you don't believe in Islam and thus your behavior cannot be influenced by those beliefs.	1641582042.0	hro9mjw	t3_rxceto	t1_hrnurkl	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxceto/are_you_worried_about_the_future_of_russia_and/hro9mjw/

66y1jqr0	"I felt bad for him because he always pays".  Well, that's fine. Why did you only say, "I felt bad for you." Why not: "Oh, you're so pathetic, so pathetic.You're puffing up to play the majestic prince, but I know that you're a loser and all these expenses are burdensome for you."  It seems to me that it would be a better option to encourage him to feel sorry for you and explain that you feel uncomfortable when you are constantly being paid for. You have been brought up in a different culture, and this situation brings you suffering. And you are sure that he will understand you, because he is so wonderful and gives you a sense of security. A sense of security in everything except this terrible way of paying.	1642009589.0	hsdi0hx	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsdi0hx/

(Sorry, but I don't sure that it is possible revive details of this story)  She with daughter (my grandmother who was very young) lived in little town name of which we can't remember. And once this town turned to battlefield. Shootings, explosions and similar shit was around. Stay here was dangerous, but they didn't decide to risk go out.   Some time later one Germany officer found them and helped to find more saveful place - he placed them to something basement and regular visited with food. Grand grand mother was very sure that he felt in love with she. Next he disappeared due unknow reasons  After this story I realized that national of people don't make them 'evil' or 'good'. And I also have few German friends in internet, they r good   &#x200B;  My stepfather very much love (at least loved few years ago) movies about ww2. And he is convinced that present time German people feel shame for this part of they story and we must not condemn them. I guess generally he think neutral about them. He honor quality of they technic.  Opinion of my mother who told me this story I guess haven't any sense to talk. And she too love and honor they technic and cars. She always bought only Samsung phones cause thought that this is german brand	1642195985.0	hsokpg9	t3_s3z7oy	t3_s3z7oy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hsokpg9/

iep3pod7	But as a whole, Russians tend to be conservative than Americans are. But the US is still more conservative than is Western Europe, with a very strong Evangelical Christian Community. I mean that as a compliment. I say this because I've lived in Los Angeles for some 8 years and have grown to hate it. If you live in Los Angeles or New York, per say, you are likely to come across some sexually questionable and effeminate men. Whereas if a man in Russia dressed up like a woman and acted feminine, he would likely be given some harsh stares at best.  I want to move to your country. It's not too far from where I currently live and it's run by a guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind and despite the extensive maligning of him by the West, is a mild-mannered, eloquent individual with a hefty dose of common sense and decency.  I don't see your president mandating lockdowns, openly saying that he wants to anger unvaccinated people by making life as hard for them as possible, and promoting CRT/LGBTQ/feminism/transgenderism in schools. I don't see him allowing illegal Chinese immigrants to vote like the Democrat Party of the country where I'm currently at is trying to push for.  He's a sane man in an insane world.

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

9f97d	> Why would they suddenly start bombing this region  Ask faschists in ukrainian government, or this general from usa  https://youtu.be/bvn3LEx9dhw who literally proposed to start killing Russians SIX YEARS AGO.  I understand its hard to believe for some European or regular American that literal faschism exists nowdays, but it not just exists, in case of Ukraine it is supported on a government level and celebrated.   Google 'Azov Ukraine' - openly nazi national guard unit responsible for numerius mass killings based on race and nation, OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Ukrainian governments and presidents.  Or google 'Stepan Bandera' - national hero of Ukraine, faschist from ww2 not only responsible for mass murdering Russians and Ukrainians, but also Europeans like Polaks.   Its hard to grasp for an outsider, but Ukraine's ruling elites are so pro-west that they became anti-Russia. For Usa its benefitting to make Russia, China and other geo-political opponents weak, so they will do anything to destabilize the situation there.   And don't pretend like you are shocked that this lead to racial cleansings and bombing of their own territories to please west. If you still believe in kind and compassionate USA or European governments, google 'bombing Yugoslavia', or Colin Powell lying to entire world about weapons of mass destruction they found in Iraq (which turned out a lie ofcourse) which led to destruction of entire country / over a million civilians dead and them stealing the oil.  Western civilization instigate wars, not prevent them, forcing Ukraine to attack its own territories to provoke conflict with Russia (because Russians live in those territories) is only natural for them.	1642253168.0	hsrgkwh	t3_s402cm	t1_hsqn6j7	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsrgkwh/

It started in late August 1918 after the beginning of the Russian Civil War and lasted until 1922. Arising after assassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin and Petrograd Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky, the latter of which was successful, the Red Terror was modeled on the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, and sought to eliminate political dissent, opposition, and any other threat to Bolshevik power.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642504633.0	ht5x4p7	t3_s6uw46	t1_ht5x3t5	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6uw46/why_do_russians_consider_felix_dzerzhinsky/ht5x4p7/

cke4duas	For me it initially has been natural to pronounce this word as a "neuter", but at the age of approx. 16 I learned that mostly country boys speak it as "neuter" so every time I order coffee now I'm super aware about not to accidentally pronounce it in "neuter" but to pronounce it in "masculine" lol.  Kind of the same for "espresso" vs "ekspresso". The latter is pretty common lol and also considered as a country boy style.	1642638072.0	hte4opf	t3_s7ozet	t3_s7ozet	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7ozet/do_you_personally_see_–∫–æ—Ñ–µ_as_a_masculine_or/hte4opf/

Some of these videos are gonna go viral in the US and elsewhere.  Really how hard is it to not understand that its not ok to  - park ABMs etc right across the border - spew propaganda that too from a country that has track record of faking its way to bombing nations or 50+ overthrown govts - leave arms treaties - constantly provoking  - american military industrial complex badly wants a war to revive its bullshit economy mostly swelled by unregulated banks  I wonder how Ukrainians who have suffered and are blinded by falseflags and psych warfare feel?  How do Russians feel about this?   Most redditors are completely brainwashed by the propaganda, wish to know more from the ones who saw through this bullshit.  I am not promoting Russia but can see clearly that it is definitely what the Americans claim. We need to move away from this fucking geopolitics and fight hunger/poverty and this broken system.

fdfb1d4o	Joining EU is not the same as nato.  Find other sources that was literally the first link I saw so shared it.  USA has meddled or assassinated over 50+ countries including democratically elected leaders so not sure how you can even try to meddle with Ukrainian affairs. Sort your own shit first.  As far as joining EU, did I ever mention that once. Your logic is pretty much just deflection and finding reason to justify the brainwashing.	1642715970.0	htiltsu	t3_s7uppw	t1_htih94p	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htiltsu/
fdfb1d4o	So firstly NATO members all need to agree for a membership, and not all would vote yes.  Secondly, for an aggressive organisation like NATO to have access to a land border would be a great shift in the balance of power and that is good reason enough to not join.  The analogy would be Cuba or Mexico to have Chinese/Russian ABMs. I wonder if the US would be happy with that, and yes most Mexicans or Cubans if given adequate incentive would happily vote for this to happen.  Also as you can see most of these votes you spoke of also aren't a significant majority but barely making 50%. Hope you realize that most Ukrainians have suffered from American Propaganda and hence most of these votes don't really have much actual credibility, even Biden many years ago himself said that being a country with high corruption rate etc would not be a good idea for joining NATO.  The best would be if the US didn't interfere with other countries. US policing has only shown to be with an agenda of obtaining resources or to sell more arms in conflict. So yeah same goes with the Ukraine, strategic reasons of course. Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have seen enough war crimes being committed on false pretence. This is just another reason for war literally sponsored by American companies.	1642723535.0	htj2omd	t3_s7uppw	t1_htj0a2p	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htj2omd/

No, despite of what your leaders tell you, emotions are not the right way to deal with politics. One's self-esteem has nothing to do with supporting or not supporting Putin.  True, corruption is rampant in Russia. Still less rampant than it was in the 90's so I guess Putin has improved something, haha. Or he just moved it all to the high echelon while cracking down on low level corruption.

akit2qs4	Bagration Dynasty is not the only surname in Georgia that has Q Y-DNA.  Also Q Y-DNA is found in Turkmen in Iran and other turkic peoples.  It's very likely that the Q Y-DNA group came from David Soslan and the claims that he was secretly a Bagrationi come from biased sources.  The most cited being a person of Bagrationi ancestry himself a few hundred years later.  All I was pointing out in my posts as a Georgian myself is that Georgian's have this obsession with being European.  I'm just after the truth.  I only started trolling when I grew tired of the name calling I received when I was just asking questions.

Stalin addresses a big official audience with some wordy speech. (Of course Stalin gets portrayed with characteristic Georgian accent)   Suddenly someone in the room sneezes. The hall goes silent.  - Comrades, who have sneezed? - Says Stalin.    Noone responds.   - First row out. - Says Stalin.  Security brings the first raw out of the hall and executes them.  - Comrades, who have sneezed?... The audience stays silent.  - Second row, out.  The second row shares the destiny of the first one.   - Comrades, who have... - I, I did, comrade Stalin! - says someone from the last rows with a trembling voice.   - Bless you, comrade! - Says Stalin and continues his speech.	1642844846.0	htq4hxc	t3_s9qfks	t1_htq0slm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/htq4hxc/

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

g00r7	North Caucasus is a place where a tribe that lives on one side of a mountain still holds a grudge against the tribe that lives on the other side of the same mountain because  a thousand years ago, somebody from tribe A stole a goat from somebody from tribe B. On top of that the tribes speak vastly different, archaic, often unrelated languages.  The most practical way to deal with their bullshit is leave them to their own devices and only intervene when it's absolutely necessary.	1643184938.0	hu9qtlu	t3_scuid1	t3_scuid1	/r/AskARussian/comments/scuid1/putin_vs_kadyrov/hu9qtlu/

g00r7	The Tsars dealt with them in a very brutal manner. Some people say that the ethnic cleanings in that region amounted to a genocide. On the other hand, the Russian empire was fairly inclusive. The matrimony and granting titles of nobility was the strategy. After all, they had marry off all those noble daughters somehow. Marrying a noble girl to a Caucasian warlord was a normal practice.  The USSR, despite being heavy-handed as well, had that ideology that one's race and ethnicity doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. It worked for a while until it didn't.  The modern Russia has neither desire nor power to beat the unruly tribes into submission. Which means bribing them is the safest course of action at the moment.	1643191412.0	hu9ysja	t3_scuid1	t1_hu9tflc	/r/AskARussian/comments/scuid1/putin_vs_kadyrov/hu9ysja/

cxmhk5au	I don't see German government giving a free apartment in Berlin or Hamburg to Volksdeutsche who come from Kazakhstan or Russia neither. German government gives you just enough money to rent a social housing (Wohnberechtigungsschein) which is far from Berlin and other fancy places, and a bit more money just to go by, and that's it.   Should the Russian government support repatriates more? Absolutely.    > most former soviet states are shitholes due to communist past  If I were you I'd be quite about communist past. Significant blame for what happened goes to Latvians like you, you have lots of blood on your hands. Until the late 1930s, Latvians were overrepresented in soviet secret police - Cheka - organization which is responsible for execution of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. Who were Lenin's bodyguards? Latvian riflemen. Who crushed Left SR's rebellion against Bolsheviks? Latvian riflemen. Who crushed Savinkov's rebellion in Rybinsk? Latvians again.	1643923518.0	hvh3783	t3_sgbbx3	t1_hvewzgr	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgbbx3/what_do_you_think_of_russians_in_former_soviet/hvh3783/

11jn5n	Hey! So your best bet for getting info is contacting the international office of the university you want to apply to. Typically they will have someone who speaks enough English to explain things to you. Go to the uni website directly (preferably an English version if the uni has an English site) and look for the email of the  international office OR an email of one of the workers who are involved with coordinating stuff for foreign students. In Russian at my uni this is –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ.   For your second question, it really depends. My university would make you start over, however you could transfer specific credits to take the place of a course you have to take aa well as "test out" of a course (which is really just taking an exam early so you don't have to take the course).   The reason why a transfer is impossible to pull off (from what I have been told) is that the curricula are more or less set by the government with additional courses at the discretion of your university and then faculty.   If you need to take Russian prep courses, there should be a separate faculty for that OR it will be organized by the Russian language faculty of the university.	1643928660.0	hvhgow9	t3_sjvqh6	t3_sjvqh6	/r/AskARussian/comments/sjvqh6/american_trying_to_go_to_university_in_russia_i/hvhgow9/

bgq6m3nk	The origins of the German law is that it was created before homosexuality was legalized, it is explicitly about penis-in-vagina intercourse (as that may lead to children...). So even other forms of sexual interactions for straight people are legal.  A reason to keep the law like this, for some people is that gays can not produce offspring with problems. Though this law would cover "transsexual gays", so if someone were to transition from female to male, and then has sex with brother, by penis in vagina that would still be illegal.  (On a side note: even the catholic church admits the health reason for disagreeing with incest.)	1643936603.0	hvhzp7m	t3_sh58ec	t1_hv0g47j	/r/AskARussian/comments/sh58ec/incest_legal_in_russia/hvhzp7m/

People are right to push back against this corrupted system that just funnels more wealth into the pockets of those who dont need it while testing out what is the minimum you can give to the workers without them toppling the whole rotten thing down. And it all works because using religion and race/nationality to disunite the people while the true division is those who want to enslave us vs the rest.	1643970363.0	hvjn2ql	t3_sk9tkd	t3_sk9tkd	/r/AskARussian/comments/sk9tkd/what_do_russians_think_about_the_increasing/hvjn2ql/

Yeah Japan is a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù now, almost all Japanese people don‚Äôt think the nuclear bombs were necessary today.  Your point on Okinawa is moot, since Japan lost all their European allies.  God you really are fucking stupid, did you not see your first comment to me? And YOU think I‚Äôm spreading hate? Once again, I‚Äôm not the one trying justify mass murder genocide.

An incandescent column of smoke and flame, as bright as ten thousand suns, rose with all its splendor.        It was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death, which reduced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.        The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause, and the birds turned white.        ...After a few hours all foodstuffs were infected... ...to escape from this fire the soldiers threw themselves in streams to wash themselves and their equipment."        Dense arrows of flame, like a great shower, issued forth upon creation, encompassing the enemy... A thick gloom swiftly settled upon the Pandava hosts. All points of the compass were lost in darkness. Fierce wind began to blow upward, showering dust and gravel.        Birds croaked madly... the very elements seemed disturbed. The earth shook, scorched by the terrible violent heat of this weapon. Elephants burst into flame and ran to and fro in a frenzy... over a vast area, other animals crumpled to the ground and died. From all points of the compass the arrows of flame rained continuously and fiercely.
