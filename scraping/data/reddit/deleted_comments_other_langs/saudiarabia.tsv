haakkk0n	that's why i switched completely to a us account a couple of months ago. It's a pain buying gift cards and being 1 dollar short sometimes (not able to use KSA cc or debit) but it's still worth it in the long run. By the way, what game did they remove this time? I redeemed Persona 5 strikers, dirt 5, and deep rock galactic.	1641551083.0	hrmc39c	t3_rxm5pe	t3_rxm5pe	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rxm5pe/بلايستيشن_السعودية_على_كيف_كيفهم_كل_شوي_يغيرو/hrmc39c/

If you have a specific argument against what I already posted in response to OP regarding subjective interpretations of "evil", feel free to put it forward instead of this juvenile bickering.	1641557575.0	hrml53b	t3_rtj4g8	t1_hrmky92	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rtj4g8/the_constant_back_an_forward_between_religious/hrml53b/
2h2aqvkb	My thoughts exactly. I mean, this observation is neither limited to race nor nationality. This is common for a group of people who are initially not exposed to alcohol drinking. Say for example, a sheltered high school student who was then suddenly introduced to alcohol when started going to uni. Not everyone is going to be like that, of course, but it happens.	1641557824.0	hrmlj56	t3_ry2rph	t1_hrmdryk	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ry2rph/australian_traffic_police_says_that_among_the/hrmlj56/
hc8jvy6w	Payment is not religious obligation, there was a man who came to the prophet wanting to marry and he had no money to offer the bride, the prophet asked what else do you have he said his wizar or clothes, then the prophet said then you would have nothing to wear, then he asked have you memorized any Quran? He said yes I memorized Surat al Baqara and the prophet wed him on that. (As in he will teach her the Surah)	1641559202.0	hrmntmp	t3_rxbkmi	t1_hrmgygg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rxbkmi/dowry/hrmntmp/
n68wy	Show me the clear cut evidence as to how you determined music and free mixing are forbidden by Allah (the two issues that the OP in this thread rather deterministically claimed are Haram). Both issues are open to interpretation and not explicitly forbidden in the Quran. Regarding music, there are contradictory Hadith on the matter from Sahih Bukhari, and I am not of the opinion that we should claim as forbidden something that Allah has not explicitly forbidden.	1641559321.0	hrmo15t	t3_rtj4g8	t1_hrmn4h9	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rtj4g8/the_constant_back_an_forward_between_religious/hrmo15t/

n68wy	Volume 2, Book 15, Number 72: Narrated Aisha:  Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, "Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah's Apostle !" It happened on the 'Id day and Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu Bakr! There is an 'Id for every nation and this is our 'Id."  Narrated Abu Musa: That the Prophet said to him' "O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David .' (Book #61, Hadith #568)  Meanwhile the scholarly dispute on the matter is well captured here. https://www.virtualmosque.com/islam-studies/sciences-of-quran-and-hadith/regarding-the-permissibility-of-music/	1641566303.0	hrn2m8f	t3_rtj4g8	t1_hrmwr1o	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rtj4g8/the_constant_back_an_forward_between_religious/hrn2m8f/

bxfrzdg7	first i would like to appreciate you sincere response and taking the time to replay back. such a great active member in the community. i guess your refer to the warm approach where you interact with individuals within certain activity or boundary where you share same interest. i totally agree with you in this regard. however, cold approach does work sometimes though because i have entirely different past experiance, its true that you get instant rejection depand on how you approaches the lady either by throwing old school pickup lines or try to flex with your six-back. ladies would obviously know these tricks so you cant play them. but before approach check for signs of approval from her side then go for it. some guys are more expert in this criteria where i have less knowledge. still it works though. online dating is kind of supplement in addition to your real life game. hope for more responses  thanks again	1641640498.0	hrrkiwr	t3_ryjkgn	t3_ryjkgn	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ryjkgn/in_terms_of_dating_and_get_to_know_the_opposite/hrrkiwr/

Perhaps if they used the term "Mental illnesses," I might understand your frustrations; but they didn't.   > This is a highly intricate topic and the survey does nothing but to stigmatise individuals with ADHD-OCD-Depression etc which are extremely common forms of mental health issues, then they are lumped with schizophrenia and bipolar which are serious mental challenges individuals would face.

Cocktailing may give you enhanced immune response but it’s only used if you’re in a country with a shortage of a vaccine type.  This is why I fly back to the U.K. to get my vaccines. Only issue I’ve had is that if a country is on a red list and you travel to it, you can’t come back for 14 days after spending it in a non red list country.  Plus it’s much easier to have NHS vaccine certificate accepted than trying to prove it with Tawakkalna.	1642521644.0	ht6uvbj	t3_s6vql3	t1_ht62igh	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6vql3/i_got_my_booster_shot_yesterday_and_later_found/ht6uvbj/

a3c6f	Looking at the number of jobs is only a partial picture. What's more important and insightful is the productivity of the labour (those employed). That's what gives you a trend to see the level of economic growth, tax revenues, inflation and real wages.  For KSA, productivity has dropped 2019 (6%) and 2020 (4%). Now, look at UAE productivity, this has grown over the last 2 years by (2%).   So, irrespective of what jobs are being back-filled by Saudization or by expats etc it's clear that labour productivity is worsening over the last few years.   Now, compare this with the UK, which has been affected by Brexit and Coronavirus more than KSA. Productivity has increased only marginally over the last two years.  Now, why is this happening? There are experts who may have the data and can answer these questions but it's clear that some of the causes are: Reduction in the actual quality of labour as highly skilled folks retire from the market or leave the country and are replaced by younger, less-experienced workers.	1642693893.0	htgyoqg	t3_s8g06i	t3_s8g06i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8g06i/105_million_foreigner_workers_leave_179k_saudis/htgyoqg/
794mqg3v	With the rise of nationalism in saudi Arabia , I don’t think these companies will be able to do much business in saudi Arabia. Im seeing a lot of companies write only “saudi nationals” in its job listings and its increasing by alot. In the past It would be rare to spot a “Saudi nationals only “ now its rare not to. Companies are proudly writing with bold text made in saudi Arabia “as if saudi products are  known to high quality”   Couple months ago there was a campaign to boycott noon because they fired 15 of their Saudi employees.  On immigration, USA , canada , nz are good countries that even a lot of saudis actually immigrate to. I have met a couple of saudis who have permanently immigrated to USA and Canada. So its expected that non saudis that have it worse would too immigrate.  I a saudi will be immigrating in the near future.	1642698069.0	hth9yeh	t3_s8g06i	t1_htgn81i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8g06i/105_million_foreigner_workers_leave_179k_saudis/hth9yeh/

2r4t7gsh	I used to get paid way less even though I’m Saudi. When I graduated from high school I decided that I want to work instead of “wasting my time” studying under the influence of family members. After looking so hard everywhere around me since I don’t have a car and can’t work far from home, I was able to find a job for 1200 riyals. After working for 3 months, I discussed with the manager that it is not enough and I need more, he was so generous to offer me an extra 100. There were expats working in the same shop and do way less work yet they get paid +2k. I continued to work there and look for another job at the same time with no luck. After 1 and a half year, i decided that I had enough. I tried my luck with applying to a local university and I was accepted. I told my boss that I quit, and he told me he’ll give me 1500 or more if I stayed. I kindly rejected his offer and left. I worked my ass off studying during the past 6 years and I just graduated from medical college in 2021. I’m getting payed +9k during my training, and my salary will double when I finish my training in 6 months.   Moral of the story, if you think you deserve more for the amount of work you do, then you are working in the wrong place/field. People will do their best to get the most out of you for a fraction of your worth if you accepted it.	1642704472.0	hthrokb	t3_s8ggdu	t3_s8ggdu	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ggdu/anyone_else_feels_that_the_salaries_of_young/hthrokb/

On the other hand Saudi Arabia is a country of about 30 million which somehow in our chaotic and devistate region is keeping Mecca and Madina in peace and adequately accessible to all 1.9 billion muslim.   Lets say Saudi had an open boarder which grants citizanship to all muslim. You’re not the only who wishes to be in driving proximity to Mecca and Madina my friend. It would be a massive migration wave the likes of which were never recorded in history. Out of all muslim lets say only 1% decide to come to saudi. That is 190 million people moving into the country. Indeed we might be bonded by faith, but we (muslims) have a diverse pool of politics, languages, traditions and tolarence towards others. The result would be absolutley disastrous. And one could only Imagine what would become of Mecca and Madina then.	1642724912.0	htj5yg2	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htj5yg2/

More like making friends or small talk and if things seem to get serious with a friend then maybe an engagement is to be had, and giving it a shot in the traditional way. but its not really what im looking for right now.

Save money and then go and do whatever you plan to do… there’s nothing more depressing than calculating a daily budget when you’re thousands of miles away in a new place and have to decide between a slap up meal or a train ticket.	1643243834.0	hudfpnt	t3_sdczc4	t3_sdczc4	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdczc4/have_you_gone_to_japan/hudfpnt/

You have no right to tell people what to do or what not to do as long as they're not hurting anyone else. Instead, we can all live together and let other people do what they want and accept our difference instead of spreading hate.	1643325112.0	hui9ho4	t3_sdvdas	t1_hufkckm	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvdas/karens_in_riyadh_be_like/hui9ho4/

I would suggest you do some private projects, build a portfolio, meet with kagglers and try to get some jobs online. Fiverr, freelancer and stuff just to get some experience. It is a good profession most definitely.  The main issue i see is that companies and older management are mostly “traditional” (aka technologically ignorant). Maybe in a few years when they start to catch up with technology then your profession would be in high demand.	1643823216.0	hvavh7j	t3_siiw90	t1_hv96gja	/r/saudiarabia/comments/siiw90/hows_the_job_market_so_far/hvavh7j/

Where do you suggest to search for jobs if relatives and friends aren't helpful? If you recommend online, how would you go by it? Do I just type "available jobs for x field in saudi arabia, (city)"? And what if I'm not looking for a specific field but just trying to find a job in general?   2. What do you think is the correct course of actions when entering the interview room? Should I say Salam, walk to the interviewer, give him a handshake and say how he's doing then sit on the chair?   3. For sending emails requesting a job application, what should I include in the subject and body of the email? Just "Job application" (or) "طلب وظيفة" then attach my C.V in the body?   4.j > عند الوصول للمكان اللي بتقدم عليه، قولهم عندك مقابلة شخصية اليوم. لاتقول انا بقدم على وظيفة. لماذا؟  5.j > الاستقبال في الشركات يعتبر مقبرة السِيَرْ الذاتية.  احد الطرق انك تجي يوم تسأل عن اسم مدير الإدارة اللي حاب تشتغل فيها، اذا سألوك ليه، تقدر تعطيهم اي تصريفة، تقول لهم انك من شركة تقدم خدمات لهذه الادارة او غيره.  مافهمت، كيف يعني مقبرة سير الذاتية؟ 😂 وليش ماقول اني بسأل عن اسم المدير مشان قدم على وظيفة؟  6.j > سؤال حدثنا عن نفسك، الاغلب يقصد فيه مهنياً، لكن بإمكانك الرد بالسؤال "على الصعيد المهني ام الشخصي؟" What do you think is the English equivalent of the statement > الصعيد المهني ام الشخي؟   "On a personal or business level"?   7.j > دائماً احمل ابتسامة خفيفة ابتعد عن الجدية القصوى وكذلك ابتعد التنكيت Interesting viewpoint.

I really do appreciate every single advice and help that was given out to me, I will try my best to get better and follow your advices/suggestions. Every single comment was very well thought out and helpful, I want to thank you all personally but I am afraid of giving repetitive replies and seeming non-genuine (I am not the best with replying) so I am sorry. I just want say to everyone that reached out to me privately or replied to my post that you saved my life at least for another day, I’m very grateful. I honestly wasn’t expecting such a supportive community, but can say that I am very pleasantly surprised.   I am now encouraged to get better and seek out and demand professional help.  Lastly, if anyone is going through a similar situation and wants someone to relate to and talk to please don’t hesitate to DM me.  I hope that everyone who is having a hard time gets their deserved relief.

6ae5e1ey	Dear justto,  I’ve been suffering my whole life of instability. I’m 32 years old and I’ve been literally struggling with every aspect of my life. Can’t say there weren’t moments of joys, but they’re short and always feel bad during them like if I don’t deserve them. I’ve been through all thoughts suicidal and beyond.  Let substitute this for you: For myself I feel that there’s a big gap inside me, I’ve always felt less and always preoccupied with the void of nothing. Since I was aging, I sometimes blamed people and communities. For such that, I was sometimes very strictly religious and other phases of my life I transitioned to be an atheist. All that was a part of trying to fit into something but it never worked.   Lately, I started when ever I feel weird or not well inside I figured out why not trying to analyze why I’m feeling that and try to connect it with every aspect of my life? It did actually kinda worked. All I needed was to express myself and to say what’s been laying in my chest for decades. I’ve been victimized A lot and I figured out that most of these psychological problems started from early childhood and the bigger part of the problem are indeed the parents.  I took a paper and started to write down everything without feeling ashamed. Till the point that I finally can tell why I feel less of myself. Why I’m always thinking like a crazy. I needed to be with myself alone for couple of weeks in order to be clear minded.  I’ve also took this assessment from MOH which indicates that I’m very depressed VERY.  https://www.moh.gov.sa/HealthAwareness/MedicalTools/Pages/depressiontest.aspx  I would advise you to visit a specialist but before you do you need to understand your problem and to be honest with yourself. That’s half the cure.
