b4jsi9bd	I don‚Äôt know if I made it clear but I was joking by saying it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù.   I already speak good French, have been learning it for 7+ years. It‚Äôs just now and again someone will correct me for using ‚Äúun‚Äù instead of ‚Äúune‚Äù which are albeit minor mistakes and I‚Äôm sure the average French speaker will be able to understand what I‚Äôm saying regardless of the stupid gender mistake. I just don‚Äôt think that no matter how long you‚Äôve been learning French, as an English speaker, you will always have some difficulty of the French language from what I and my non native peers have experienced.

kmynr	Sorry for not explaining it clearly.  A simple example:  J'ai vu une maison et je l'ai achet√©e.  Here, the direct object of the verb acheter is the pronoun "la" (i.e., the house - feminine), so the participle is achet√©e instead of achet√©.    (Contrast with "J'ai achet√© une maison."  Here the direct object follows the verb so the participle doesn't agree with it in gender and number.)	1641609639.0	hrq73zm	t3_rynwti	t1_hrq3a3f	/r/French/comments/rynwti/agreement_with_preceding_direct_object_why_though/hrq73zm/

kmynr	Thanks for the article and your comment.   It's sent me down a rabbit-hole of interesting reading about Marot and I think the next step for me is to figure out why Italian is the way it is.

14trf8	Why do you need to take this test? Perhaps with some more information, we can help you make a better decision.  Is this for studies in France? Work? Personal benefit?	1642432949.0	ht1ohuf	t3_s65dmz	t3_s65dmz	/r/French/comments/s65dmz/i_didnt_pass_the_dalf_c1_now_what/ht1ohuf/
14trf8	Would you feel comfortable going back to class? Maybe there are complimentary classes that are not necessarily the core A1-C2 classes that would allow you to skip material that you already passed.  If you are absolutely set on passing this exam, then take 3 months to study and put 2-3 hours, 2 times a week into study at home. The faster you get this done, the easier it will be. You already know French, you just need a refresh to get you back up to a good level. But if you can't do three months of focused study, maybe the test isn't for you.   Finally, do you really need to take this exam? It's nice to know your level, but it's really only something for getting into schools and for potentially getting a job. Would you not be more impressed by setting your mind to reading a book in French or watching a series in French without subtitles? Or with if that's more your speed.  Don't beat yourself too much!	1642434020.0	ht1r0j1	t3_s65dmz	t1_ht1pw3m	/r/French/comments/s65dmz/i_didnt_pass_the_dalf_c1_now_what/ht1r0j1/
36zig	Aw I'm sorry you didn't pass. Unfortunately the Dalf is a very demanding exam and one definitely needs to prepare for it specifically, it goes beyond ease and mastery of the language. Especially if you didn't have any familiarity with the delf before. If you want to self learn, I would suggest buying a Dalf methodology textbook, do a lot of mock exams and having at least 2 of 3 oral mock exams. I did a lot of correction for the Dalf and it was always obvious when someone just showed up vs prepared for it.	1642449058.0	ht2uaw8	t3_s65dmz	t3_s65dmz	/r/French/comments/s65dmz/i_didnt_pass_the_dalf_c1_now_what/ht2uaw8/

drtz5lxy	It's the reverse interestingly. In France the feminist movements want to habe gender specific words and in english they want to remove gender specific words. The difference arises due to french inherently having male/female le/la and them not wanting it to be dominated by males (le).	1642454802.0	ht394tc	t3_s69w4n	t1_ht38epa	/r/French/comments/s69w4n/is_lieutenant_always_masculine/ht394tc/
drtz5lxy	Yes it does... I'm telling you it's the opposite of what you know in english... doesn't seem logical to non french speakers as having every name designated male or female is a completely alien concept in english.	1642455339.0	ht3aiqu	t3_s69w4n	t1_ht39u7f	/r/French/comments/s69w4n/is_lieutenant_always_masculine/ht3aiqu/

36zig	Maybe I was too harsh! If you spent months not practicing then of course conversational workshops are a great way to get back into the language and gain confidence. But what I meant is that the Dalf production orale is very technical, sort of an oral essay + debate, it's not small talk or a conversation, so it needs specific practice.	1642494371.0	ht5kb2e	t3_s65dmz	t1_ht59fjz	/r/French/comments/s65dmz/i_didnt_pass_the_dalf_c1_now_what/ht5kb2e/

There are a lot of people trying/having tried to learn a second language, and each one has an opinion about what method is best, regardless of whether it works or not.  Fortunately, there has been a lot of research on the topic, with very good and enjoyable methods having been developed for    and there are those who have taken the scientific findings as	1642936788.0	htva9a7	t3_san85v	t3_san85v	/r/French/comments/san85v/i_might_have_to_learn_french_and_was_looking_for/htva9a7/

2kexi2mo	Ok, sorry I got it wrong.  When you need to decide whether a liaison is needed or not, you always need to look at the *written* form of the words. I agree *parles* ends with the sound l orally, so as the "l" sound does not incur a liaison, you may think the liaison will not apply. But what matters for the liaison is the "s" at the end of "parles".  "Parles" can definitely trigger a liaison. Compare:  * *tu en parles au cours de fran√ßais* => forbidden liaison between "parles" and "au" , so it is pronounced "parl au cours", with the "e" dropped * same phrase in interrogative form: *parles-en tu au cours de fran√ßais ?* => mandatory liaison between "parles" and "en": it is pronounced "parle (z)en tu"(with the "e" becoming voiced again then) or "parl (z)en tu"  (note: I am well aware that "parles-en tu ?" would not be common and most people will say "tu en parles ?", that is just to have a simple example that sticks to "tu parles").  You also have the imperative form where the "s" is even added before the pronouns "en" or "y": the liaison is mandatory then, you might even argue that compared to the "normal " form of the imperative, it has been added just to make the liaison:  * imperative form in standard conjugation: *parle.* ex: *parle-moi. Parle √† ton p√®re.* * with "y" or "en": exception to the conjugation rule: you need to add an S in written, and it triggers a mandatory liaison:     * *Parles-en* (pronounced "parle (z)en"  or "parl (z)en").     * *Parles-y* (pronounced "parle z(i)" or "parl (z)i")	1643179382.0	hu9j5zw	t3_scn3nn	t1_hu9egkl	/r/French/comments/scn3nn/why_is_the_s_not_pronounced_in_tu_parles_anglais/hu9j5zw/

And the more I think about it, the word ‚Äúen‚Äù is never used with tout, which means it seems to be grammatically an object instead of an adverb (ie ‚Äúj‚Äôai tout mang√©‚Äù vs ‚Äúj‚Äôen ai beaucoup mang√©‚Äù).

d9depviw	My mum was a teacher and taught me the basics of French (common expressions, nursery rhymes, etc.) at a very young age, but I only caught the language-learning bug when I started high school.   My school was part of the Comenius Programme (the high-school equivalent of Erasmus Programme), so I went on exchange to schools in France, Germany, Hungary, and Slovenia, and had to rely primarily on French and German to communicate.  I then studied Interpreting and Translating (French and German) at university, and spent two years studying in Paris and Leipzig as part of my undergraduate degree. (I was the only person on my degree programme who was not at least trilingual from childhood: an early start is a massive advantage.)  The usual learning materials will only get you so far; you will learn more French from an hour in a bar than a year in a classroom. Use the language constantly (preferably with native speakers). Set high standards, but be prepared to make a fool of yourself.	1644451900.0	hwarm1u	t3_sopxvt	t3_sopxvt	/r/French/comments/sopxvt/who_isnt_native_of_french_that_can_speak_fluently/hwarm1u/
jhkvznpk	Accent is good - very comprehensible.  Rhythm is ok, a little staggered sometimes (that just comes with time).  Vowels are still off a little bit (not much change from the other 3 times you posted here and elsewhere the last few days... still sounds a bit Maghr√©bin - even though you‚Äôre not from there).  Because you stated elsewhere on one of the other 3 or 4 recording submissions that you‚Äôre from Alberta, you are much more lucky than so many others on this sub because you *ton* of access to French language media in Alberta (Radio-Canada, TVA, Unis, TFO on enhanced Shaw and Rogers packages).  You also have Rad-Can radio in both Edmonton and Calgary and elsewhere in the province.  I don‚Äôt know what part of the province you‚Äôre in, but if you‚Äôre close to any of Alberta‚Äôs Francophone towns, or close to Edmonton‚Äôs French quarter (Bonny Doon), there are a lot of French/francophone social groups (hobby groups, coffee groups, sports groups, etc).  This is obviously very important to you considering the number and regular posts you make with the same question asking people to judge your accent and new texts.  I applaud the determination.   Therefore my suggestion is to binge on the above easy-access French media, as well as our French shows and movies on Canadian Netflix, Canadian Apple TV, Canadian Prime, and YouTube.  Listen and repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat.   Keep doing it until the words and combinations of words you‚Äôre saying are indistinguishable from those you‚Äôre listening to.  From one anglophone Albertan to another, believe me, this helps immensely (Just the other day I had a discussion with someone about my own language learning experience in Alberta and BC, and [I put it in a recording](https://vocaroo.com/1aPiJXC4n9BN)... So if I can do this, so can you).  As an adult, repeated emulation is one of the absolute best ways to hone an accent.  You‚Äôve obviously got the vocab, grammar and syntax.  So, slugger, now go get the accent!  You‚Äôve got this bud.	1644459758.0	hwb9z7z	t3_sorci5	t3_sorci5	/r/French/comments/sorci5/how_is_my_accent_so_far_any_guesses_also_which/hwb9z7z/
