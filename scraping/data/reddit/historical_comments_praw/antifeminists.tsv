Mandatory jail time creates inequities, our justice system should moving away from mandatory sentencing, not adding more of it. Not saying they shouldn't be sent to jail, just that mandatory sentencing is a societal ill.

flgd5	Cause, generally, men don't accuse women of sexual assault. This is largely a female exclusive problem. Men are the ones falsely accused of sexual assault exponentially more than women, and the men who might end up coming out saying anything against a woman are looked at like they're lying, lucky, or a loser. We don't hate women; we hate people who lie about us, especially when there is tangible legal recourse for the men when it happens.	1605986397.0	gd3ghlu	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gd325y3	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gd3ghlu/

6x07vhfy	No. False rape accusations are a fucking heinous crime that ruins someone's life whether it's proven false or not. As a society we currently have no way to punish criminals adequately besides prison. Personally I believe that rapists and murderers should be put down, and I still believe in the equal punishment. I understand that's extreme but the idea that it's fine to let someone ruin another persons life and get away with it is indescribably stupid in the best case scenario. So we put them in jail. And the paying of court fees for forcing someone to pay to defend themselves against a false accusation that can and almost certainly will ruin their life is a given	1605914038.0	gczpsij	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gczo27q	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gczpsij/

"Oh we can't put women in jail for false rape accusations" "So what about men with little to no evidence against them?

1e4dz6cd	They're both horrible things to endure. Unfortunately, people and especially feminists tend to dismiss the harm it causes. A Time magazine article argued that falsely accused men can "gain from the experience." In many cases, even family turns against the falsely accused.   If you're rich and powerful, it isn't necessarily fatal, but most people aren't. I've known numerous rape victims and in some cases, it still affects them even now.

b0k5e	Sure, I'm just saying that if you were to be falsely accused for a crime, and you got killed for it, then an innocent person dies for no reason and that can never be undone. That is the thing we have to be careful with, since even a confession might be a forged voice recording or similar.	1605917550.0	gczw7yk	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gcztlef	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gczw7yk/
N/A	That doesn‚Äôt even remotely insinuate that 85% of rape allegations are false it doesn‚Äôt even mention sexual assault too. Did you even read this random link that you sent me? Also it was a garbage study anyways	1614793752.0	gpk2uoh	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gpk1nq0	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gpk2uoh/
N/A	i agree, along with the other things listed in the tweet	1606033738.0	gd6s4ui	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gd6rd6j	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gd6s4ui/

agtuygkl	Give me that day in prison anytime if it means I won‚Äôt have to deal with the issues that come with having been brutally raped. And yes I know prison rape is a thing and it‚Äôs terrible. But arguing that this is worse than having someone hold you down while another person rapes you so violently that you can‚Äôt go to the bathroom for a week, a lifetime of flinching when someone raises their voice, fear and pain when someone tries to touch you in a romantic way, forever thinking that anyone who‚Äôs affectionate towards you really just wants to hurt you, night terrors and waking up screaming every other night, seeing a mans hands as something that might kill you....	1617574301.0	gte2zhw	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gtdzy2g	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gte2zhw/
agtuygkl	Suffering is not a competition. We shouldn‚Äôt try to say one thing is worse than the other because it‚Äôs just incomparable	1617574381.0	gte34v0	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gtdzy2g	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gte34v0/
4ivxsb5u	Keep thinking hypothetically then. This post is about some practical thinking.	1605967562.0	gd265fy	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gd25n6c	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gd265fy/

2jydja15	Seems you are the one who didn‚Äôt look.  It happens to be the most comprehensive study on the face of the earth at present and you insinuate it‚Äôs garbage.	1614794455.0	gpk4i3n	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gpk2uoh	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gpk4i3n/
2jydja15	Yes indeed	1606042880.0	gd79wg6	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gd6s4ui	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gd79wg6/
2jydja15	The thing Is that it‚Äôs not one day in prison. Try 2 years  where any day could be your last. But it can be much worse for those convicted on false rape charges because it becomes a lifetime.	1617574852.0	gte4123	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gte2zhw	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gte4123/
