I love how the don't include the "you better look like this because if you get dressed up that means you're actively cheating" part. Literally you're expected to look like this and be cooped up in the house cleaning and cooking.  It's disgusting as hell. And then when you see family you have to suck it all in and pretend that you have a great life as you're giving your lifeline/happiness/youth to your scrote.	1622053316.0	gzjl16m	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzjl16m/

N/A	Wow I really appreciate this as that is such a negative narrative that I see among my older age group. Like we 'let ourselves go' intentionally and completely disregards a vast majoritu of us solely responsible for child rearing, home management, usually also working FT, and perhaps by our ages battling health issues. It is sad. And they like to throw in the exception not the rule stories of women they know who "dropped babies" and got those bodies back immediately, too. Even some shady male coaches are somewhat realistic in saying to plan that the woman you marry and have babies with likely will go up a dress size naturally. (They still suck also yet at least they are telling their audience to be somewhat realistic about what child birth does to our bodies)	1622050651.0	gzjemiq	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzjemiq/

rdiu0	I'd like to give some context. The lady in the picture is honeypreet insaan.  She was born to parents who followed a new age Indian guru. The guru introduced her to the son of a high ranking politician and matched them. As an adult woman, she was adopted by the guru and she became his favorite daughter. She worked as a director, producer and other roles for the wacky Guru's wacky projects. The guru was then arrested for raping to of his young female followers. Honeypreet came to the limelight after she escorted him to the investigation organisations headquarters.  Her husband (the politician's son)  made claims that honeypreet and her adoptee father actually had sexual relations.  He later apologised but the guru definitely tried to push her in the limelight. It is speculated he was trying to train her to take over his cult.  Later his cult members rioted and killed a lot of people when he was  convicted for rape and it was thought that honeypreet orchestrated these riots. She was arrested. The first picture is her posing next to the guru and the second is her mugshot in jail.  The memes were made against her because people hated the guru and his cult members then.  Meme's still sexist tho.	1622081982.0	gzladt3	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzladt3/

b9nfp72p	Statistically, unmarried (never married) women are the happiest demographic. Unmarried men are the unhappiest. Married experience less depression and addiction, and they live longer than their unmarried counterparts. *The exact opposite* of all of that is true for married women. Marriage is literally the worst thing so many women can do to themselves.   And yet men still think they‚Äôre the prize and like single women must be so miserable without them. Not only do women not need them, but they‚Äôre far better off without them	1622061396.0	gzk4dvp	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzk4dvp/

houv1en	I hate when men post women photos for meme's.  The difference in photo to me is happiness. Its scary men don't care about how depressed and sad she looks and more about her not wearing makeup/dressing up all the time. They wonder why women divorce more than men.   The fact that men expect us to look like dolls 24/7 is gaslighting. Any man who has dated women for certain amount of time knows we don't wear it 24/7. So what if women dress down when married when women are considered lucky if we get men who dress [this](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0053%2F2224%2F4211%2Fproducts%2Fblue_white_1200x1200.jpg%3Fv%3D1556746073&f=1&nofb=1) way let alone something nicer.

84o9i8oi	She looks like someone who's in a refugee or concentration camp. That is so sad and how do they not get that she looks like that because of what her husband did to her and has put her through? Men are so blind to this stuff it's heart-wrenching and frustrating on levels I can't even put words to. I feel like it's pointless trying to talk to them at all. Even if you are completely logical and cite all kinds of facts and what women have been going through for the duration of human history they will still find some way to blow you off and blame everything on you.  I feel like I'm at the stage of my healing process right now where I have to let go of the hopeful illusions/delusions I've had and deal with the reality that I've always known but really look at square in the face that most men are just absolutely completely horrible and the really truly good ones are anomalies.  It's also stunning to me to think how many men think that if they're not beating or straight up violently raping their wives that they're not hurting them in any way. This meme clearly shows otherwise. my heart breaks for this woman and I hope she's in a better place right now or that she is able to get to a better place and be happy and feel alive and vibrant!	1622073241.0	gzktoqd	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzktoqd/

1o7m7q4i	Since I‚Äôve been divorced (beginning of 2018), I‚Äôve moved around a bit and have had to update my drivers license both times. The most recent DL pic and the DL pic I had taken right after the breakup are literally like night and day. When I first compared them, I loved that I looked much happier and healthier in my recent one. On the other hand, I was sad bc I allowed myself to become so unhealthy and miserable during that marriage. My skin had no color, my eyes had bags under them, I was easily 50lbs heavier, I had a noticeably forced smile... At that moment,  I decided I most likely will not re-marry.

N/A	Yes. I see a lovely wife who looks physically exhausted. Her husband is not making sure she is rested and has the funds to maintain as best as she can now. And that is sad. My mom and dad have been married nearly 50 years. She has always been a homemaker. He makes sure she has whatever spending money she needs for her Estee Lauder, perfume, haircuts, facials on holidays, and replacing clothes. He buys her a new purse every Christmas and full perfume set. Sometimes she finds 2 3 new ones she likes and buys all of them. He writes down sizes for her Winter clothes and will go to the store to surprise her with new ones. They are modestly wealthy Dave Ramsey types and he makes sure he provides whatever she needs and has money. (She doesnt like to go to the bank anymore now that she is older and so I watch him when I'm over sometimes put money in a drawer for her and he asks if there's anymore she needs if she has other things she wants to do that week).

They'd often say they wanted a woman who they could go out for meals with and she'd eat anything. I have several food allergies and I get sick if I eat certain foods, I've adjusted to it and it's mostly not a big deal but several men I spoke to clearly saw it as a negative thing, as if I've chosen to have these allergies. One guy was mean saying he thought what I had 'would be a nightmare' and he was apparently very glad he didn't have the same allergies. Meanwhile my ex used to get nasty about what I ate, accusing me of eating too much when I was rapidly becoming underweight due to the stress of dating him. I'm a great cook so they all missed out lol.

a19i2ivx	I'm 26 and recently had a similar experience. Since then I have yet to actually leave my husband, however I've been taking better care of myself and doing things that make me happy. I look better, but still have a while to go to heal my self worth and self esteem.	1629816236.0	ha60rvm	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzkwfps	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/ha60rvm/

7882d531	 I got flack for body hair, short hair, natural afro hair, dressing like a lesbian, being too fat(I've been told numerous times by other girls that they wish they had my body,which is a whole other can of worms.) I was a junior bridesmaid once,and the bride(aunt) wanted me to come with a full face of makeup and waxed legs. 'Luckily',I got away with curled hair, waxed legs, high-wedged shoes and trimmed armpits. My six year old female cousin still made a point to tell me that my armpits are too hairy,so keep your arms down. I was thirteen.	1622065756.0	gzkdqfb	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjmt2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzkdqfb/

v4qqb	The funny thing is, I watched documentaries with people who wears makeup all the time, some even to their sleep and they look... older and greasy. That makeup can't hide how tired they are and how skin just wants to do its thing but being constantly blocked. So unless you have a team of professionals for continuous touch up, you will never look "perfect". Bare-faced people actually look younger and fresher.	1622087350.0	gzljsgj	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjmt2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzljsgj/
84o9i8oi	Oh my goodness I'm so sorry! I wish your grandmother would have told you how beautiful you are without that stuff and that you don't need it!   I would love to see women celebrate their natural beauty more! The makeup these days looks like getting ready to go deep sea diving for your face and I cringe when I watch the videos of women making themselves up because I feel like they're covering themselves up completely, meaning you're no longer seeing their actual beautiful face. You're just seeing makeup, almost like a mask. Sometimes it makes me want to cry and I know that might sound silly but I would like to see women showing off their natural beauty more! And if using makeup, just like bare minimum stuff for some extra pizzazz, for enhancement, not covering up. ü•∞	1622073386.0	gzktzsn	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjmt2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzktzsn/

84o9i8oi	I cannot upvote this enough! This a million bazillion times infinity plus one! It's the absolute truth! And I am so happy for you and your marriage! That's the way it should be! Jane Austen has a great quote where she says if you both seek to make each other happy then you will both end up happy! ü•∞ü§ó  I know this example isn't the same but it just shows when people treat you well you respond better. So years ago I took a job as a nanny through answering an ad in my local paper. It sounded great & amazing but once I got the job I was in for a very rude awakening! I found out that several of the things listed in the ad were actual lies or misrepresentations & they ended up overworking me. Everything about the whole situation was just a big mess. I loved the little boy & I loved the little girl too but the little girl was very spoiled! I also got paid the least amount of money out of all the nannies in the area while I had the most duties. On one of my heavy duty days I was assigned to change the water in a flower vase--last on my to-do list because everything else was more important. So I was in the mud room doing a bazillion loads of laundry when the mother came in holding this vase & she was seriously pissed! She chastised me for not changing the water in the vase & said, 'You know, we hired you to make our lives easier.' I have no words! In spite of everything I did not change how I was with the kids or how I did my job for the duration.  All that said, this is how I learned it's better to go through a nannying agency--they make sure the families are on the up & up & same thing for the nannies. Families get a good nanny, nannies are taken care of properly & paid well! Second job I had was a temporary fill-in till the mother's cousin was to come down. I don't know if that family made as much money as the first family or not. It was a live out job whereas the other one was live in. But they paid me WAAAY better than the first family! They paid me time & 1/2 if I worked on days off as well. The mother literally only wanted me doing things for her 2 young boys. She was still nursing their 6-month-old so she needed help. But because this family was so sweet with me & I just loved the mother & the kids so much I did anything I could to help her out around the house even if it wasn't part of my job. Part of me probably would've done it anyway cuz that's just how I am but it really made me want to more!  That's how it is when women get love poured into them! ü•∞ü§ó	1622087687.0	gzlkc86	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzlfng2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzlkc86/
N/A	The mistaken thinking in this is assuming that these kinds of men WANT to be happy... no, they are often miserable narcs/sociopaths/abused-child-turned-abusers who aim to make you feel the kind of misery they feel all the time. It's about revenge and schadenfreude. Often you're a stand in for some woman in his life who denied him something/said no.	1624012581.0	h271adq	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzlfng2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/h271adq/

e6r4g	its crazy. my grandma had a really hard life and is pretty stupid, probably not officially low IQ but kinda close. has a huge issue with like caring about what other people think of you. growing up she shit on everything i did cause i was into skate boarding and didnt dress as girly as my other cousin. really reinforced the bullshit 'im not like other girls' stereotype for me growing up. even now she refuses to believe that i'm happy because i dont have a husband. like i have a professional degree, somewhat high paying job, a beautiful penthouse apartment, buy everything i need and most of what i want, have great friends and other family member relationships, am into a few hobbies, and she'll be like 'what about a man'. meanwhile her and my grandpa have absolutely hated eachother for 10 years and treat eachother pretty shitty. from the outside/male mindset/her mindset im a crazy cat lady and thats all that matters.  also as i have moved up in my career she will shit on me and be like 'really, you can do all this, you think you can handle living there? etc' and when i push back at how i succeed in everything i do and havent failed before, why is she acting like i have?(note: this is because i currently have no problems working 24/7 on tasks and i only take reasonable risks) shell be like oh well im just scared cause you live alone. one time i hung up a bunch of plants and was proud of how nice it looked and sent pics. everyone compliments it and shes just like omg you did that yourself please be careful.   i just 'grey rock' her and give her little info about my life. i love her and have tried so hard with her, shes made some progress in her behavior but shes still a miserable person and i dont have time for misery   end rant	1622060121.0	gzk1czr	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjyvvh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzk1czr/
