4fz4vx9f	To be fair, the United States just freed the slaves and left them without any real assistance, forcing many to just continue working for their former masters for very low wages, essentially making them little more than "wage slaves." Russia forced the "free" serfs to pay their former masters back for shitty land that often wasn't worth remotely what they were required to pay. In both cases the former slaves/serfs were essentially still indentured to their "former" masters and I don't think a whole lot of "freedom" was gained in either.	1641530428.0	hrlgd3c	t3_rxc1hj	t1_hrhai2x	/r/russia/comments/rxc1hj/tsar_alexander_02_the_liberator/hrlgd3c/

4rgna	The cost to benefits analysis says that Russia really, really doesn‚Äôt. Unlike Crimea, Ukraine as a whole has very little of what Russia wants and (also unlike Crimea) the population will largely be hostile and expensive to feed and police. However, if Ukraine tries to grossly violate the Minks Accords and launch an ‚ÄúOperation Storm‚Äù (US supported Croatian offensive which ethnically cleansed all Serbs out of the country)  type of massive offensive against DNR/LNR, hoping to quickly defeat the separatist forces and cleanse the region of ‚Äúundesirables‚Äù (e.g.: ethnic Russians), Russia will have no choice but to intervene, in order to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and a territorial checkmate by NATO, and will likely end up annexing those territories. Russia really doesn‚Äôt want to have to do that though and will not strike without a massive provocation from Ukraine. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian establishment and oligarch press have been salivating over the prospect of repeating ‚ÄúOperation Storm‚Äù  for years and actively preparing for it. Russia is just letting them know that it‚Äôs also prepared and unlike weakened Serbia back in the 90s, won‚Äôt stand by and watch, and be flooded by millions of escaping refugees.	1641533334.0	hrlm3lb	t3_rj50s2	t1_hrlewuk	/r/russia/comments/rj50s2/world_war_iii_in_the_minds_of_journalists/hrlm3lb/

I've been asked to produce the code twice, both times the guys didn't bother to ask for any kind of identification, and without identification the QR-code makes no sense, it could have been anybody's and not mine.  To sum up: generally, nobody cares.

One source is REN TV, a channel that reports on reptiloid activity and conspiracies, and the other one is some Telegram channel with zero credibility.

Despite the fact that the Western music was prohibited in 70s, someone actually managed to get the JCS vinyl records literally from under the coat. And yeah, ABBA, Boney M were also loved in USSR alongside to Modern Talking.	1641570878.0	hrnegnr	t3_ry5zla	t3_ry5zla	/r/russia/comments/ry5zla/what_70s80s_western_musicians_were_popular_in_the/hrnegnr/

7s28j8e5	\- I went to visit my beloved mother-in-law in Lobnya. We decided to go with my friend, parishioner Pavel, by train. There weren't very many people on the platform. We already hear the train humming, approaching. And then there was such a noise, as if something had collapsed. I turned around sharply, I saw someone lying on the rails, - Nikolai Luzanov recalls.   In a conversation, the priest said that he did not know exactly what forces were leading him then. Something inexplicable was happening, he could not control his actions in any way.   \- Even psychologists say that at such moments half of people will have a stupor, and half will have some kind of action. At that moment, I also had to ask the question: what to do, I have four children? I say for sure that I would not have done anything: I would have been cowardly, I would have just prayed, maybe shouted. The train was just approaching. If we talk about adequacy, then it was definitely impossible to jump, - says the priest.  But Nikolai took a risk. He jumped onto the rails and, a moment before the approaching train, asked the man if he was alive, threw his hands on the platform and quickly pushed him onto the platform. There, a friend Pavel helped to drag the man to a safe place. The rescued person began to come to his senses, and the priest and his friend Pavel got into their train and drove to Lobnya.  https://www.kp.ru/daily/27348.3/4528618/	1641571023.0	hrnev91	t3_ryajww	t3_ryajww	/r/russia/comments/ryajww/in_the_city_of_dolgoprudny_priest_nikolai_luzanov/hrnev91/

9419yri4	Update: The U.S. changes its entry requirement to 24 hours, not 48! Luckily Moscow has rapid testing centers in train stations. Getting to Russia, I was fine. It was just some guy at a folding table after passport control that collected the tests. He didn't really even look at it. Coming back was chaos. Though I was aware of the new requirement and had my test, hundreds of people at the airport did not and the lines were insane. I was in Sheremetyevo for 4 hours before I boarded the flight, and barely made it.	1641571621.0	hrngi4w	t3_r64mnr	t3_r64mnr	/r/russia/comments/r64mnr/russia_entry_pcr_testing/hrngi4w/

9419yri4	This is a little late, but I just returned from Moscow and can fill you in. You won't find a free place for a test. There are testing locations at all train stations, which is where I got mine, but the prices ranged from 2,000-3,700 rubles, depending on how fast you needed the results. Places for which we needed tickets, like the circus, or museums, asked for them. You didn't need one to just walk around Red Square, but there is a 50% chance the guard in GUM will ask for it.  Just check ahead of time online for the places you want to go. No restaurants asked us for the code, but that's not to say that some won't.	1641571897.0	hrnh9it	t3_r6i892	t3_r6i892	/r/russia/comments/r6i892/any_tourist_to_russia_lately_have_experiences/hrnh9it/

hw3dl5q8	>Oh, please! Paedophilia has long been associated with the homosexual subculture and historically, a lot of the ‚Äúgay rights‚Äù ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù were known paedophiles, who fought for lowering the age of consent. I mean, American ‚Äúgay‚Äù groups still organize seasonal cruises to third world countries where sex with young boys is not outlawed. Lots of old ‚Äúgays‚Äù even retire to live in such countries. Back in the 90s, when Russia was impoverished and lawless, it also became a ‚Äúhot destination‚Äù for them. I personally know victims. It‚Äôs just that the postmodern neoliberal establishment has been hiding all of this from public view for a long time and all the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù on the matter has been conducted by the deviants themselves or their postmodernist allies. Homosexuality is a mental illness (and was officially defined as such, until the psychiatrist establishment was infiltrated and subverted to support their causes) and has a high rate of co-morbidity with other mental illnesses and defects.   >   >Russia is not ‚Äúhomophobic country‚Äù. ‚ÄúHomophobia‚Äù is a fake and nonsensical term designed to deflect and slander people who don‚Äôt support the postmodernist agenda.  I would leave it to the scientists/doctors to decide if homosexuality is a mental illness (FYI, they have decided, and it is not).  I wouldn't be so sure about cruises from America to Russia, because if you open a map you will see, that it is very hard to get to Russia by water and also because it‚Äôs forbidden to enter Russia via sea borders.      And I never said that gay people cannot be pedophiles, I said that sexuality does not affect that, and there is a 50/50 chance that some pedophile could be gay or straight.      The point is, that in this situation you're paying attention on "gay" and not "pedophile".	1641582203.0	hroa2a1	t3_rxh42x	t1_hrl8ca2	/r/russia/comments/rxh42x/two_days_ago_in_kostroma_two_men_an_old_gay_and/hroa2a1/

hwp3hyyb	It is just an apocaliptic Sci-Fi drama written by a woman who wanted to grab a bite of "Walking dead" fame. The book was written before COVID. As for "bad guys" - it is quite common to portray Russians or especially Russian government as natureborn cruel bastards. Hollywood does it all the time. So the same do some Russian writers, filmmakers and so on. It is sold well, especially in the West. Cause in modern world the Russians are the only group who you can shit over with any nonsence and stay politically correct.	1641608929.0	hrq5ipa	t3_rynbpc	t3_rynbpc	/r/russia/comments/rynbpc/what_russians_think_of_to_the_lake/hrq5ipa/

nlfofey	You clearly do not understand what you are talking about. Lukashenko was a pain in the ass for Russia for many years (for about 10 years), he was alternately friends with Russia, then with Europe, then again with Russia, and each time he begged for money from us, then from the EU, and every time he switched , he began to treat the other side more harshly. At the moment he was just stuck on our side and nothing more, EU completely refused to deal with him and therefore he portrays "one of Putin's best friends", although he still does nothing of what it promises. Putin is not his boss, Putin does not order him anything, most likely he does not even listen to Putin's advices and that is why he is in this situation. The idea that Putin is his "master" is a propaganda narrative of the Western press, because according to the logic of modern EU (which is mostly dictated from across the ocean), Putin is one of the main threats to "humanity" or at least "democracy", therefore any problem affecting America or Europe should be tied to Russia or personally to Putin, in whole or in part, in order to further demonize this artificially created image.	1641609522.0	hrq6umb	t3_r76s97	t1_hrq2msh	/r/russia/comments/r76s97/what_is_your_view_on_the_current_crisis_on_the/hrq6umb/
fmq5vim6	Thank you for the websites they are very useful.  For question 2, you say it‚Äôs possible but there is very little information online about this sort of thing. I have found out the process of buying a vehicle and it seems I would need an address in Russia to register it? Otherwise I would not be able to drive the car.  If I can register the car in Russia, then I assume I will be able to drive around the EU no problem so long as I have correct documents for the car as any Russian citizen would need to drive their car there, and correct visas as a Brit.

Its a style I feel suits russia more being a large state with alot of natural resources that demmands some internal control to prevent foriegn forces from overexploiting the people(There is still a benifit with some expertise and and tech sharing that is involved with the process so its not a good thing to close the door completly to international companies)  There is no reason to censor legitimit complaints unless they are clearly fakes or taken out of context by Foreign Agents like the Yale Educated Navalny and his foreign backed organization(they now openly recive money from western organizations)  Look at what happened in Iran when Democracy was 'attempted' the west is not pro 'democracy' they just use the claim to destroy countries that resist their influence and when democracy turns against them they use their power to overthrow said democracy.  By all accounts the russian goverment is much more resistent to corruption then others mostly by not having a large focus on lobbying and the practice being very looked down upon especially if it inolves mutli nationals...  Compare that to the EU and US where lobbying and Insider trading is basicly as common as drinking water...In Russia lobbying can ruin careers and usually done behind close doors in secret.	1641625936.0	hrr1omv	t3_r6b4l8	t1_hrq28xs	/r/russia/comments/r6b4l8/as_it_ever_been_considered_that_russia_could_join/hrr1omv/

hwp3hyyb	Luckily my British-Russian child is a girl. Russia doesn't have dual citizenship with UK. You have two citizenships. In UK you are considered only British, in Russia you are considered only Russian. So all your rights and obligations are same as for people with only one passport.   To be taken to Russian Army you have to have a permanent address or place of work or to study in University, these are places where people from military service can come and hand over you an invitation to come to military commission. They have to do it personally or through director of your company where you work, or through a head of faculty where you study. Nobody will grab you in airport at border crossing, unless you are a criminal. You can become a student, or wait until age 27, or get married and have a child and then another, or work in village school as a teacher, or say you are pacifist and work in a hospital for three years instead, or go for just 1 year to the army. But nowadays it is enough people going voluntarily and militaries don't run after you. Also if you have some serious health issues you will not pass medical check. My son is 24, never went to the army, he is avoiding it by legal means.	1641628398.0	hrr52w3	t3_rys9q6	t3_rys9q6	/r/russia/comments/rys9q6/conscription_for_dual_citizen/hrr52w3/

4dlbu	When I moved to Russia from the States, I had one large carry-on and checked four luggage items and just paid the fees because it was cheaper and more convenient than having it all shipped.  I'm a musician though and so the majority of my baggage were oversized Pelican and ATA flight cases with analog synthesizers and studio equipment.  It's all sensitive and valuable electronics and everything arrived safely.  I would never have anything valuable mailed.  It's a real hassle to arrange the pick-up and yeah, I had to pay customs fees for receiving even the smallest of items. I've been living here for 3 years and have been back to the States twice, where each time I pick up more of my gear to bring back on a flight and pay the extra baggage fees.  I travel with my wife though and through Delta we each get one checked luggage item for free. Not sure how it is with your sporting gear, but it's difficult and expensive to find the same make and brands of outdoor equipment here.  I'd recommend leaving whatever clothing behind to make room for your other items that you want to have with you.  It's easy and cheap to get your wardrobe outfitted again here.	1641634930.0	hrrdivh	t3_rykstt	t3_rykstt	/r/russia/comments/rykstt/moving_to_russia_from_us/hrrdivh/

90xrgthq	There isn't really a left in the US. There is "conservative" (liberals that don't like social change) and "liberals" (liberals that are willing to accept social change). Both are right.   There is no significant push for reforming child abuse justice and healthcare. Saying "lawl let's put them in siberia" isn't a solution. Recognizing that some people need help to deal with these impulses, and that just having them doesn't make you a bad person, is important. I want to live in a world where these people will go to the doctor and get help before they hurt someone. Those that DO hurt people or are likely to hurt people SHOULD be separated from society for the safety of children. Whether that means prison (people that have hurt others) or something else (other people, such as those that are mentally ill and cannot control themselves). Sending people to labor camps AFTER the fact won't solve the problem. It doesn't make the survivors better off. I'd rather prevent it from happening.	1641644562.0	hrrq1i4	t3_ryra1z	t1_hrrnofo	/r/russia/comments/ryra1z/sic_semper_paedophiles/hrrq1i4/

1k18revr	Soviet-Polish war of 1919-21 was an agression by Poland against Soviet territory, in an attempt to induct former territories of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into the Second Polish Republic, without even asking citizens of those areas for consent. Of course we promptly got our ass beaten, and Soviet forces were on the outskirts of Warsaw, and only a single tactical maneuver by Polish forces (along with a large dose of luck) stopped the Soviet Russia from liquidating Poland and its bourgeoise government (Which, to be honest, would be a better outcome for all of Poland, and potentially for Russia as well - there would be no "socialism in one country", Stalinism would not be a thing, and the Great Patriotic War wouldn't bring such horrendous destruction).	1641990294.0	hsc92iq	t3_s21g4t	t1_hsc7yn1	/r/russia/comments/s21g4t/whats_all_this_about/hsc92iq/

Then you got news article sites like the New York Times.

hn4dd	It‚Äôs not invasion that they are worried about. It‚Äôs shifting the balance of strategic power from parity to US by enabling US to hypothetically strike Moscow with missiles in less than 5 minutes, virtually holding a gun to Russia‚Äôs head and thus having huge political and military/strategic advantage. It may be surprising for some western observers but right now strategically US and Russia have parity - both in nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and nuclear triad - submarines, land based systems and strategic bombers. Thus ensuring mutual assured destruction. Furthermore, Ukraine can be used as a launchpad to incite separatism movement inside Russia and thus destabilise Russia. All of this makes Russia to perceive NATO as existential threat to it.

Fundementally different wars - the USSR at least started it's intervention with a semi-functioning state that never saw war. The US came into that mess after 20 years of war. It's a fundamentally different situation and we both know this. I admire the communists attempts of creating an egalitarian society in Afghanistan. I'm a closet socialist in AMerica. However, I was also an American soldier there and I saw the reality of this society.

hwyus3zz	Well, count yourself. Russia and Finland are separated by a border with a length of 1271.8 kilometers. A soldier for every 100 meters - a total of 12,000 soldiers who must be on duty for 12 hours out of 48. That is, already 48 thousand soldiers, plus armored vehicles, aviation, vehicles, equipment, infrastructure, barracks. Can you imagine how much it costs? It is more profitable for us to sell iron ore to the Finns at a 50% discount, in fact - at a loss, this is more than offset by savings on border protection. With Sweden, almost the same story. 200 years with them - peace, and I hope there will be another 200 years. Well, about Norway, everything is simple. There is oil and gas there. The gas is now being pumped out at such a rate that "proven deposits" will last for about 8 years. In 8 years, Norwegians will earn money by fishing, and at sea they will be under sail. NATO is engaged in the robbery of the countries included in it, in Norway they provide security for campaigns that plunder the country's natural wealth. No offense, but that's the Norwegians' problem, not ours.	1642192550.0	hsobrse	t3_s2y809	t3_s2y809	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsobrse/

Russia has been the worst neighbor for decades, that's why the Soviet union fell apart, that's why almost every single Soviet union country fell in the arms of the west, that's why every Soviet union country either joined NATO or wants to join NATO. Either you people are completely ignorant of history or you're wilfully spreading propaganda.	1642192995.0	hsocxv9	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hsm7ggt	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsocxv9/

2rzwuerl	Random side note from a Baltic viewpoint: Sweden is worried about 3 extra amphibious landing ships on the Baltic Sea. They raised the alert level of troops on Gotland, called reservists to service on that island, and [sent]](https://www.dn.se/sverige/militar-utryckningsstyrka-landsatt-pa-gotland/)  additional troops to Gotland by air transport today.  Translating:  > "On Friday, the rapidly deteriorating world situation prompted the Armed Forces to deploy its operational contingency unit on Gotland. Equipment and personnel flew with an American C-17 plane, an international collaboration in which Sweden has a share. The plane took off from the base Pap√° in Hungary and flew to Kallax in Norrbotten."  Sweden is neutral - has been neutral for many generations. Last participated in a war in 1814. It does not depend on foreign tech, produces its own energy, makes its own planes and boats... it has no reason to bluff for anyone.  I am concerned. If non-aligned governments are making defensive moves that cost significant effort, serious miscalculations might be about to really happen. :(	1642193197.0	hsodgtd	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsodgtd/

I have literally nothing against Russia, and I don't believe a word that the media says. Sadly the majority of the population are idiots (probably rings true to all countries), and that's why there is a hype about it. Brainless people don't have their own mind, they let media decide their opinion. I can't remember ever having a bad interaction with a Russian. During my gaming years, my closest friends and kindest ones were Russians, always.  There was this guy, Oleg, who played L2 on my server. He was an absolute beast, killed everything and everyone. I was so scared of him that I befriended him. Turns out to be the greatest personality ever. We seriously used google translate to communicate, and after 6 months, I could almost form simple sentences in Russian. üòÅ Then he killed people for me whenever I needed him ü§£.

The american regime was defeated after their color-revolution completely failed, they have been raging about it ever since. But they can't do anything about it, hence the panic and propaganda. Have you noticed the propaganda about China too? same story, they can't do anything, as China defeated the american regime in the "trade war", the pandemic, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Taiwan, etc. Notice how in all these cases, the american regime is the one who can't stand the status quo and launches propaganda campaigns and interference to try to change it, only to be humiliated (be it Ukraine, Xinjiang or Hong Kong).  Why does the american regime fear the status quo so much? because america is in terminal decline and has no answers to it, that's why the propaganda you gladly consume exists, it's an expression of impotence.

538lk	"They" are hinting at a Crima style "save the oppressed ethnicity" kind of operation in another strategic region.  No country needs permission to amass its troops by the border, but given recent history, Russian threatening rhetoric and the drive Russia has shown to de-estabilize by any means necessary the status quo in the western bloc, people are obviously suspicious of what may happen next.  I mean other countries like the US and China do that using similar methods, that's true, but to try and whitewash Russia's aggressive, disruptive foreign policy under the guise of "muh western media brainwashing" is questionable at best.	1642195783.0	hsok6hx	t3_s3b2in	t1_hsoitgn	/r/russia/comments/s3b2in/does_the_russian_media_portray_the_united_states/hsok6hx/

4zkra	I think the discourse on "both sides" can be pretty wild nowadays. I know Finnish media isn't as fearmongering as Sweden for example, given the examples written of the Russian ships in Baltic Sea, but yes, we still live in Western hemisphere mediawise, and sometimes Russia is instantly blamed for a plethora of reasons. EU in particular likes to blame on Russia for everything and the US likes to poke around here, thinking we're their "frontline". Then again, I know Russian media has its own ways of telling the stories. The gap can be pretty wide, but we the people are pretty much still the same. We aren't our governments, we aren't the allies our leaders have chosen for us. If we just remember to understand we are constantly being influenced by all the news sources, and that the normal person still lives their lives the same no matter the country, we are born, we love, we die. All the rest is just politics.	1642196706.0	hsomjmz	t3_s436k4	t3_s436k4	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hsomjmz/

aeb7t	It was forced upon them.   Objectively: USSR military had 4-5 million in the army now it's just 1 million.   USSR or RF had never built infrastructure to cross the oceans to invade someone.    Military had defensive doctrine which was reflected in spending and the types of hardware for 25 years.   There was never any need build bases, command centers, guidance systems, outsource killing to extremists.    But now we live in world where minuteman missles regularly fail to launch so the stupid generals recommend to move the frontline to the RF border.   Alternative to Armageddon is 3rd generation wmd. Massive emps that simply collapse energy grids and all modern weapons in nato with minimal casualties. Its about 500k volt per square mile. We would have no GPS, internet, digital money or digital fake economy, hardly any electronics for 5-10 years, but our planet would still be here and civilization would live. Plus, we would finally be able to successfully make an arrangement that keeps military away from borders, wmd under complete control and ballistic bullshit under cap.   WTH am I on about.

gtkjb	If you believe you will never know the truth, then you won't, because you will give up looking (and corrupt politicians like this).   If you believe you will find the truth, then you will find the one you like, and stop there, because you're happy with it. But it might not be truth. Corrupt politicians can work with this.   If you keep digging for the real truth, no matter what it costs you, you will die as a martyr. Because the politicians will hate you. All of them. Because all of them are corrupt. It's what they do.  Power corrupts, absolute power is kinda neat. And to become a politician one must enjoy power.  Ultimately, they don't want you to be curious.   But if everyone is curious, then there are too many martyrs for them to kill or put behind bars.   They don't like that, because we outnumber them, and that forces them to steal less and do more. They don't like that at all. It smells like a guillotine and gives them nightmares.  As to debates, they are rarely pleasant. They might not be good for you, but they might be good for all of us, as a class. They help the truth come out. Political debates help herd immunity against bullshit.	1642197828.0	hsopee6	t3_s3ncv7	t3_s3ncv7	/r/russia/comments/s3ncv7/my_wise_way_how_to_deal_with_different_political/hsopee6/

But being blind to a country‚Äôs faults or pinning all blame on just one country is just an attempt at erasing history. People and governments are more complex than that. My home country is very broken right now and it is horrible to see what it‚Äôs doing to the rest of the world. I wish it were different because it is embarrassing and painful. Too often these discussions turn into vile quibbling and people forget the humanity. I wish everyone could remember that we are individuals, and we don‚Äôt (nor should we) act and think exactly like our governments.

945p2	Freedom of the press is about barring the government from interfering with what‚Äôs reported. This was why it was such a big deal when Trump tried to revoke White House press passes of publications that spoke badly of him.   It‚Äôs also what led to some important moments in American history, like when Woodward and Bernstein uncovered Watergate. Their investigation led to Nixon‚Äôs resignation prior to impeachment.   It does not, however, negate government influence over what is published - though, in my opinion, the bigger issue is that the people who own the newspapers also own the politicians.	1642199873.0	hsougdl	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsotdba	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsougdl/

Russia was also present in many areas within the middle east and Asia and later withdrew because it wasn't working out and the people fought them off. It's something else if the people comply and work together. There was also infrastructure built in Afghanistan etc. by many countries, not just the US, but it was mostly torn down and destroyed again.

4zkra	This is a great thing to remember. For example Finland and Russia, yes, we have a history, but even in history both sides the Russians and the Finns have said they always knew it was the same young man on the other side, the ones you shot were the same. Nowadays most of us get along very well and let the history be history. I've always loved my trips to Russia, everyone's been very friendly, and then again my summer cottage neighbor in Finland is Russian who bought the cottage to be closer to the nature and he's a damn good guy.

9f97d	> I mean Putin did lie that there were no Russians troops in Crimea  We rented space at Crimea for our fleet since 1997. But in reality there were no troops forcing anyone to vote for Crimea to join Russia.  Take a look at video footage from the streets of Crimea when it joined Russia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9AWGnFCi9U  . Does that look like they were forced by anyone or rather finally came home ?. Crimea was always Russian, only due to stupidity of Gorbachev overnight everyone living there somehow were now forced to consider themself 'Ukrainians'.    > Putin seems unsatisfied, so I'm scared he'll try another little war to heat up nationalism and revanchism.  By 'another' you refer to Georgia ?. Please educate yourself on that matter, this has nothing to do with Ukraine attacking its own russian-speaking territories of Donbas and Lugansk which happens now.	1642202496.0	hsp0rhr	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsp0rhr/

4ma9mxs8	nato is volutary membership. so it sounds more aggessive to say nato is expanding, as if tovindicate a roiling occupation as europe percieve Soviets in eastern Europe.  one salient fact is that nato requires western style democratic and legal institutions for (volintary) membership; that's it's purpose. Many of the former Soviet countries are decades away from the governance reforms required for (voluntary) membership.  many russians know how corrupt ukrainian institutions are, they are decades away from the transparent accountabity stsndards of nato membership.   And as a mutal defense organization, neither Rawanda nor Switzerland are eligible for nato membership.   not everybody gets in	1642203705.0	hsp3m31	t3_s3h9ht	t1_hsljrmf	/r/russia/comments/s3h9ht/ukraine_stealing_crimea_from_russia_a_caricature/hsp3m31/

Also looks like Gazprom had a good profit of all this madness with gas prices, so Gazprom covered the exspences for NS2 construction already.   As for Ukraine, they declared independance, but want to be independant at Russia's expense. It is a long story of blackmailing, begging for low tariffs, stealing gaz from pipeline, so basically, NS was build to avoid territories of Ukraine and Poland, so yes tranzit via them may be stopped. But also the pipeline in Ukraine was not modernized for years. If EU will supply gaz to these countries, we would be happy. Deal with them, dear EU, yourself at your expense.  We have another huge pipeline being build to China "Power of Siberia", so we will sell our gaz to other countries who is just doing business, nothing personal.	1642207096.0	hspbb8n	t3_s430yt	t3_s430yt	/r/russia/comments/s430yt/is_nord_stream_2_important_for_russia_or_not/hspbb8n/

There's no in-between.  Get. Across. Then decide what you're going to do: practise Buddhism, make pancakes or wage wars.  I'l leave you with this:  Imagine a dirty and filthy latrine. Is there anything clean in it? There is. It's a hole in the centre of it. Nothing can stain it. Everything just falls down through it. The hole has no edges, no boundaries, no shape - only the stool has all that. And yet the whole temple of uncleanness exists solely because of this hole. This hole is the most important thing in the latrine, and at the same time something that has nothing to do with it at all. Moreover, it is not its own nature that makes the hole a hole, but what people have arranged around it: a latrine. The hole has no nature of its own, at least not until the llama, who sat down on the stool, begins to divide it into three kayas        To understand one's own nature by carrying out Lamaist practices is like studying the hole in the latrine, making a daily visualization of a traditional Tibetan stool covered with mantras and portraits of llamas in yellow and red Tibetan robes. One could spend a lifetime collecting such stools - which is what all these Tibetan embroidery groupies are doing, constantly arguing with each other over who has the real Tibetan stool and who has the disgraceful self-made one. But it has nothing to do with the hole itself.	1642207299.0	hspbrg8	t3_s305qp	t1_hsmfake	/r/russia/comments/s305qp/is_hinduism_allowed_in_russia/hspbrg8/

8sb03s1	As as a older somewhat conservative American, I agree with you in regards to the American government. At the federal level it's completely corrupt both Democrats and Republicans. No election is going to fix this. The politicians are in this for themselves, not the betterment of the country or its people. War after war after war...trillions of dollars spent. Over the years trillions of dollars spent in the US and it has not done a thing...because the system is not set to help people. It's a pyramid scheme.   The sad thing about most Americans is that they still beleave in the stereotype about Russian people still being communists. They have been fed this so long they don't know the truth. They know nothing of their culture or the country at all. They have failed to take the time to find things out for themselves . Instead they let beleave the media.   As a ham radio operator and a shortwave radio lister prior to the fall of the Iron curtain, I was lucky enough to  meet and talk to people in Eastern Europe and Russia, along with listening to radio broadcasts as well. It helped me understand others opinions of Americans and the American government. I knew long before Donald Trump was saying " fake media " what fake media was and is,and I can tell you, most the people have been up to their necks in it ,without realizing it.  As individuals we can only reach out to each other and continue to learn about each other and appreciate our differences.   To all the hard working, fine people of Russia I wish you all the best , and just remember not all Americans dislike you.

xouob	Ehh.. Your military force are in an country where they don't belong, killing innocent Ukrainian people. For what purpose? What right does a country have to invade a neighboring country? What right does Russia have to interfere with neighboring politics?   The whole purpose behind Nato is to be a collective force against this unpredictable militaristic behavior, from a country within Europe that still hasn't turned into a true democracy, despite all cultural influences through mass media and all the revolts during the former Soviet Union. The  leader still elects himself by changing the law.   We could have thousands of years of peace in Europe. We could buy your Gas, respect your cultures, visit your country, learn from each other, come closer, connect infrastructure, take away the mistrust. But this paranoid military behavior drives us millions of kilometers apart. It even forces us to seek an ally on the other side of the world, who touches some of our cultural values, but is a whole different nation, and sometimes pushes it too far.   There is however 0 intent throughout Europe to attack or invade Russia. Nobody has that need or urge to make your country smaller, to take a square centimeter of your soil. Russia belongs to the Rus, as it has been for hundreds of years.   But breaking these laws, where you steal back lands that previously belonged to you (krimea) (without asking for international permission, how it should go) And now attacking Ukraine, or any possible other country, could ignite World War 3, thousands could die by this stupid bluffing game. In an era where we agreed to never use wars again to solve diplomatic differences. But here we are today, one paranoid country that has trust issues, disrupting an entire continent. Europe cannot let this go, nobody wants war anymore, but there are lines no country should cross for the sake of our own safety. Borders are there to be respected, countries have formed and shouldn't be altered anymore, especially not by external force and demand, this is what we agreed upon after World War 2, *"This no more"*. Apes fight for territory and power, we're hopefully smarter than that.	1642208124.0	hspdlqy	t3_s436k4	t1_hsooawi	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hspdlqy/

5vb9espk	I'd say China has much larger nuclear capabilities than both Russia and US, do not underestimate them. They have the world's largest naval fleet and have the most influential economy. Any battle fought outside of China, only benefits China at this point. China collecting DNA from citizens across the globe by obtaining companies and using said DNA to develop bioweapons that only affect non-asian DNA is currently a very valid theory as to why China is doing the DNA collecting from medical chinese companies across the globe. Touching China would crash the entire world economy though.	1642209173.0	hspfw5y	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsob6l3	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hspfw5y/

58oaoi2z	I have doubts that you've actually read my post. I mean, you've asked, I provided the answer and now you've become passive-aggressive all of a sudden. What gives? Is this who you truly are that shines through?   Anyway! You don't like rabbits? Fine. Have you ever seen a magic eye? You either see what's hidden in the picture or you don't. Sophistry doesn't exist at this level of cognition.   The mere idea that an *internal logical argument* could provide anything ‚Äî anything at all ‚Äî about the world, the idea that an *argument* can prove anything at all about the real world is *absurd*.    It is only with a reference to what is actually real we can see if an idea has any merit.   Einstein, right? Albert Einstein predicted black holes back in 1910-s. Nobody said "Oooh, Great Albert said so, so it must be true", but people started looking. They kept at it and the first black hole was confirmed in 1970-s. First picture was taken 2 years ago.   I'll reiterate: an idea can possibly have merit only when it has a reference in reality.   Does the idea of "you" have a reference in reality?   Me looking or not looking for treasures is irrelevant. You forgot what I've said right at the beginning: don't take my word for any of it. The burden of proof is on you. I can't show it to you, I can't force it upon you (I would if I could) and I sure as hell would not recommend you believing that there's no you (like I said, It's a whole another level of insanity).    All I can do is provide some guidance.	1642209651.0	hspgy23	t3_s305qp	t1_hsmdqes	/r/russia/comments/s305qp/is_hinduism_allowed_in_russia/hspgy23/

ehsqhqic	Well the logistical problems of invading Russia are in part the freezing temperatures, which doesn't go for Western Europe. Obviously invading GB is a different beast entirely.  The really unrealistic thing about Russia invading the EU is imo that Russia isn't even that strong. If you go by military budget they aren't that much stronger than any one of the big 3 of Europe and even if you assume that they are better trained and can produce their equipment more cheaply Russia is by no means the military superpower it used to be during the cold war. Assuming so would just ignore that the Western countries continued to grow economically at a much faster pace.  An invasion of Ukraine is something that's remotely imaginable. Finland+Sweden? Highly unlikely and the reaction of NATO would be devastating, so this would be suicide. Western Europe? No chance.	1642212539.0	hspn9wp	t3_s2y809	t1_hsipglj	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hspn9wp/

I'm sorry but 'he said/she said' is not a reliable source, especially when we are talking about media full of propaganda.  If you cannot, please stop spreading your opinion as a historical fact.

And this is extremely crucial to keep up the na-na-na-na noise levels and deflect from real American weaknesses i.e. their ever growing economic inequalities and a very divided population festering with disillusionment of the failed "American dream" and anger. This will continue until it becomes economically confident, perhaps they are hoping in a few years? Then they will start their old game of destroying countries and bringing down regimes - they will want a double whammy starting with China and this will be sufficient to rattle an old Putin is what they are hoping.

I myself am an American (I want it to be clear I‚Äôm an outsider in this sub) who has very negative opinions about my government as well as the sensibilities of many of my fellow citizens.    The government of Putin has been a strong one and has seen the country develop quite a bit since the 90s (from what I understand) but they‚Äôve also engaged in many hostile actions abroad as well as crushing dissent against their rule at home.  The Upper Class, whether they be Russian or American, cares little for those in the working class and often have corrupt ambitions of power and riches.	1642215680.0	hsptzw9	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hsmledi	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsptzw9/

I am not (and many, many of us)  personally responsible for the crimes our government, who has failed us way too many times, has committed. The average American and the average Russian are more alike than they are dissimilar so I'd say it's unfair to say that we are twiddling our thumbs doing nothing. There are many Americans who are trying their best to organize, rally, and fight for injustices against their governors, senators, etc. who do nothing but spew propaganda about Russia (and others) back at them. Nevermind the other injustices we have to deal with that regard our own country.   I don't blame Russian citizens for things their government has done. It's disingenuous to say that every American isn't doing their part to organize their best. And at the end of the day, there is only so much we can do. I, for one, have absolutely no idea what we could do, even united, to stop the government and their military hard on.

There's little to no hope of Ukraine doing any kind of repairing or maintaining of the pipelines either considering its almost non-existent economy.  I would also love to see some new pipelines going further into Asian countries, perhaps India and SEA countries.

Personally I supported the annexation, what I didn't support is lying about it. If we just said "hey it's our troops over there, we are returning Crimea home" that would be fine, but first saying that there were no troops and then saying there actually were our troops is not fine.

a69hz	If you only consume western propaganda... Putin is a dictator as much as liberals in american think any pro social policies is communism.... Taking out western corruption and greed of gov funding thiefs, putting economy to work for russians and not western banks and oligarchy, as well as forcing the russian resident oligarchy to divert their money back into russia and not abroad isnt much of a dictatorship as it is by definition. Remember russia isnt market driven by corporate run interests, corporate run interests now have to work with russian gov interests within the market. For right wing western ideologue thats as bad as dictatorship since they arent free to skirt the rules and abuse markets outside the US. So no, not a dictator...authoritarian sure.	1642218562.0	hspzxqo	t3_s43h5o	t1_hsps0v8	/r/russia/comments/s43h5o/who_is_responsible_for_russias_incredible/hspzxqo/

Which is what the world is constantly in, a state of conflict, economic, social, political. Russia has public infrastructure spending, schools, university, medicare, housing, Etc. As far as diverting to economic and social spending, russia isnt on the top list of nations overspending on their military lol.

cj3el3ke	There is a lot that can be agreed and disagreed, but by the end of the day, one thing is certain. Everyone needs to back up and reevaluate before jumping face first into someone else‚Äôs basket. The US accuses anyone of ‚Äúaggression‚Äù or ‚Äúhostile acts‚Äù when it doesn‚Äôt play to their rules. The EU is a mess of its own, bounding each other to a inevitable chaos one day to come by their own doing. Russia, though not perfect, is trying to make themselves establish and strong. The Soviet collapse still hurts in some areas for Russia, though it is easy to say progress and growth from the collapse has been impressive.  We are in a situation where politicians are trying to divide the people. They use events, whether they impact us or not, to drive us apart and cause discord. Easier to get control and distract us from the real issues in the world. Every year, around the same time, Russia is ‚Äúabout to invade‚Äù (insert border nation) and the US has to deploy troops at its border for ‚Äúx y and z‚Äù reasons. It‚Äôs a distraction from what the real issues are. COVID, climate and economical issues are on people minds but the politics don‚Äôt want to go about handling them the right way so they throw dust in our eyes and pretend all is well. We as a species need to get a grip, put the past behind us and work United for a future but with media and politics at play, that‚Äôll never happen sadly. At least, not in my lifetime.	1642220055.0	hsq2x38	t3_s436k4	t3_s436k4	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hsq2x38/

9ixw7buo	For the past 500 years we have been slowly but surely globalizing. This trend is not a direct result of government & corporate exploitation as much as the people's restless propensity to innovate & explore. The last 100 years the trend of concentrated one world government exploitation proliferates while hiding behind national rivalries. And now today - these ancient rivalries are again being exploited by the NWO to create mass chaos as a catalyst for change - but the final result is not what they have planned - your post proves to me that the people are finally waking up - a trend that the governments  have been trying to guide, moderate and control - unsuccessfully. This trend is not theirs to control - it is divine.	1642220859.0	hsq4ghe	t3_s436k4	t3_s436k4	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hsq4ghe/
2azpwng5	American here. I view Russia as I do any other country - the majority of the population are just people. Trying to live their lives. Just like In America, you also have some (often louder than the majority) radicals that feel like because they were born in a certain geographical location, they are better than people born somewhere else. Shit, both countries are riddled with past atrocities. It would be nice if we could view people as part of the same human team and stop with this stupid nonsense. Patriotism is great! You should be proud of the country you live in. That doesn‚Äôt mean someone in another country is better or worse. If your identity is tied to a specific leader or political party, you‚Äôre setting yourself up to be let down.	1642220910.0	hsq4k3h	t3_s49wxk	t3_s49wxk	/r/russia/comments/s49wxk/mods_of_rrussia_arresting_a_bunch_of_western/hsq4k3h/

gapfvci3	Salad "VINAIGRETTE"   Thoroughly washed potatoes, beets and carrots boil in a saucepan, and then peel. In addition to the mentioned vegetables, you will need:   pickled or pickled cucumbers - 2-3 pieces of medium size;   half a can of canned peas;   150-200 g sauerkraut;   juice of half a lemon;   herbs and spices to taste;   vegetable oil.   The order of preparation:   The cooled vegetables are peeled, cut into cubes, put in a convenient salad bowl.   Sauerkraut get rid of excess liquid, wringing it out with your hands beforehand, add it to other vegetables.   We discard the peas on a sieve, letting the excess liquid drain, pour it into the other ingredients of the vinaigrette.   Now we proceed to the preparation of the dressing, for this we mix lemon juice, spices, herbs, green onion feathers and vegetable oil in a separate bowl.   Fill the vegetables with dressing and mix thoroughly.   Let the salad stand in the refrigerator for about half an hour.	1642223810.0	hsq9yh8	t3_s47lsn	t3_s47lsn	/r/russia/comments/s47lsn/looking_for_recipes/hsq9yh8/

If you see issues with things that you can change in your own country, then you can do your best there. I'm not sure how voting works in Russia but it's the start of change. Look for representation who fits your ideals and slowly move the country towards that direction.

He never saw any real combat, but went through dozens of BDUs, especially the pants. The Army wouldn‚Äôt replace them often enough for him and so he had his mom buy and mail him surplus multicam pants from the States. She also mailed him stuff like Magpul anti-tilt followers for M4 mags, because the issued aluminum 30 round mags were terribly unreliable with their tilting followers. It took the US decades to start issuing decent, modern magazines for their service rifles!	1642226902.0	hsqfcn1	t3_s44e8b	t1_hspr58m	/r/russia/comments/s44e8b/when_you_are_rrussia_moderator_and_you_see_a_link/hsqfcn1/

a69hz	No, you are confusing attributions: out of all the paramilitary cosplay ideation personalities I have come across most are american.

a69hz	Yeah, so once again. Not an advocate, just wise enough not to be biased blindly against systems and functions.   Yeah, I agree that its a waste. But at the current human evolutionary position, not having a military, a defence force, with active offensive capabilities leaves nations and people at the behest of more powerful entities for exploitation. Russia capitalised in the 90s, meaning they are now trying to establish their own governance outside of the western run institutions. Meaning outside the nato partnerships....brics vs transpacific, nato vs russia on that border.   So from what ever angle you think its russia thats the bad guy it isnt. Russian didnt plunge ukrain unto a civil war because it didnt get its way. The whole world knows thats what US does. They dont even hide it, outright in media, politics, news, organisations are pro distabalising nationa and installing their puppets to work for their economic system.   I dont know what info bubble you are from. But you just sound like a western consumer. Zero ideolouge towards rational politics that understands positions and sides and viable options.   Its easy to say:right no war guys. But as we still see today no peoples are safe from the oligarchies of the elite of each system. Russian, US, chineese, german, british, etc protesters were beaten and detained regardless of the agena of protests, or how peaceful they are. Its just clear that this is the world and we have to take sides, and neither side is wholly rightious, or fair.	1642228634.0	hsqi26o	t3_s1cfvb	t1_hsqer9f	/r/russia/comments/s1cfvb/russian_troops_in_their_own_territory_is_bad_but/hsqi26o/

4kcp6a11	>The average american is frankly sick of this and wars.   I want to believe you, but that's not the case if you follow popular subreddits) Anywhere you go - Russia IS just bad, nothing positive comes from that place. "Russia wants war and annex more lands". Your average american is completely ignorant about anything concerning russia - they don't know and they're not interested to know and go deeper, find out, research another party's point of view. Ask the simple question - WHY. All they do is blindly reiterate CNN, NBC and FOX primitive propaganda.   Look at the latest example: NO ONE in russia (officials) ever mentioned that they want to invade Ukraine, annex Ukraine or go to war or whatever, yet all the popular US media talk about it like it is a sure thing. And here on reddit every american reiterate this BS. "Putin wants to restore the Soviet Union, annex lands because he is a macho man". BULLSHIT! In my opinion putin is a crook and an asshole and he needs to go, but he doesn't need "more land", it's not that simple.   Yes, there are russian troops on the border, but did you (not you, but an average american) know that Ukranian president went from 75% supporting rate to 20% in the last couple of months? Did you know that they have political and economical crisis right now? Did you know that he was blamed of treason by the ukrainian people and journalists who actually brought him to power, not the opposition, but his core supporters?

12pok7	So, your point is ...? I don't have to look it up.  This is exactly what I mean. It is a huge difference when people comply and actually take and use the support they get. In that case the aid does wonders, no matter from which side it is coming from. One side kept getting support from the USA and developed further into an economic powerhouse, the other lost support and broke down because they lost support due to the development of the cold war. It literally didn't matter where the support came from, because the country wanted the aid and used it. Unlike Afghanistan for example. The USA actually gave them billions purely for development, they supported and built infrastructure for watery food and education. But it didn't stick ... the infighting tore it down as soon as it was built.   And that was only one of my examples. What with the others? I saw the different development and support in Germany, both from the US / British side and the Soviet one.  The original comment I replied to tried to made it look like the US support always just ends up badly, while soviet / Russian support ends up so much better and is always doing great. It isn't just black and white. As I said, neither side is the pure good guy or the pure bad guy.	1642231587.0	hsqmetr	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hspub70	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsqmetr/

Russia claims Crimeans want to be Russian majority. Ukrainians and western sources state Crimeans want to be Ukranian majority. Referendum under Russia cannot have been trusted.  So the only social justification here is Crimea belongs to where it already belonged, Ukraine.   It still belongs to Ukraine, as a justification ignoring power over the black sea.

zoa9d	Greetings. Sorry for my poor English. The logic here is simple: 1. Russia is not interested in the seizure of foreign territories. By foreign territories we mean those territories in which Russian culture is not widespread, or is widespread, but is not accepted by society in a positive overwhelming majority. 2. If there is a state next to Russia to which Russian culture is related, where it is treated mostly positively, then its "capture" (accession) is possible only when a referendum is held. An attempt to annex something without a referendum can provoke strong discontent within Russia itself, and for almost all territories potentially possible for annexation, it is necessary to hold a referendum not only in the annexed territory, but also in Russia itself, for reasons that Russian society does not seek to absorb anyone - "Russian annexation must be deserved", since it implies the social and economic development of the "annexed" territories on an equal basis with all other regions of Russia. 3. The territories bordering Russia should not be anyone's proxy, otherwise, regardless of Russia's desire, it will have to eliminate this proxy sooner or later. This is a matter of national security. For this reason, Russian diplomats explained that it was time for NATO to leave. If NATO does not leave by itself, it will be forced to do so, while no one will occupy anyone. 4. The vast majority of countries where the media and the political elite spread fear about the Russian invasion, Russia as a territory is not interested not only for cultural, but also for economic reasons. Strictly speaking, even Belarus and Ukraine, which are closely related to Russia, are extremely unprofitable for occupation in economic terms for the Russian Federation.	1642234923.0	hsqr147	t3_s2y809	t3_s2y809	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsqr147/

d4y2o	In Soviet times Russia was investing a lot of money and resources into supporting other territories, both inside the USSR and outside. According to the statistics, if I remember correctly there were only 2 republics in the USSR which earned more money than they spent, and that surplus was going to the rest of the country. One of these two republics is RSFSR (current Russia); unfortunately I don't remember the other one. It might be Belarus but I may be mistaken.  For example, Soviet Union built a lot of manufacturing facilities and if I remember correctly some shipyards in the Baltic republics; these facilities were mainly destroyed after the secession of the Baltic states, so the people who worked there lost their jobs and had to leave these countries to look for jobs in the UK and European countries. In my opinion this is one of the many reasons for the current depopulation of the Baltic states. The Ignalina nuclear power plant was destroyed in Lithuania, and now they have energy deficit and have to spend a lot on importing LNG which is a separate funny story: they were planning to lower their dependency on Russian natural gas and ended up buying the LNG from another Russian company (Novatek); only this LNG is being sold to them as an American one while Americans buy it from Russia :))  I often visit Germany, and my German friends too confirm that there's still an economic gap between Eastern and Western part of Germany. If understand correctly, the industrial plants which were built in the Eastern part before the reunification were destroyed, but nothing significant was built there in their place - and of course it's another reason for the before-mentioned gap. In my opinion it resembles the situation in the Baltic states: everything from the past times was destroyed and not a lot had been built, here's the problems with economy and depopulation.	1642235683.0	hsqs1ck	t3_s2y809	t1_hsoznfe	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsqs1ck/
3fq1je3w	The federal subjects have their own budgets(based on their own taxes) there is also a larger 'regions' that include multiple Federal subjects and they coordinate their budgets togther.  The federal goverment is mostly responsible for the Army,Police,healthcare,border control,foriegn policy and doesnt get involve much in regional governence.  The goverment offers money in a few ways direct investment and loans(typicly if the local goverment has a budget deficite or is struggling or if they need money for a project)  The better a region preforms the more Loans they can take while the goverment subsidizes stuggeling regions more to get them up to standerd.  TLDR: There is a reward scheme for more prospourous regions in the form of loand while the less fortunete have a life line in the form of more direct investment.	1642235928.0	hsqscx3	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsqscx3/

1nxg52ul	You're assuming that Ukrainians and Russians are two different people. Reality is, for many Ukrainians these are not two exclusive things. Just as one can be Bavarian and German at the same time, you can be Ukrainian and Russian at the same time. After all, historical name of Ukraine is "Little Russia" and word "Ukrainian" in ethnic sense does not appear in sources until end of 19th and beginning of 20th ct.  Now that's not to say that Ukrainians that think that Ukrainians and Russians are two separate people does not exist too, but my impression was, that in the east of Ukraine, most people feel like part of larger Russian ethnos, along with White Russians and Great Russians.	1642237650.0	hsqulp1	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsqulp1/

gapfvci3	"I think it also brings me to Putin. ... in our country, we don't have much love for our leaders. My God, how much shit our prime minister gets is just unbelievable. I'm curious why there is a protective culture around him. Is it just because you can't really change anything?"   You see, my friend, some things can only be understood in the context of some distant events. Imagine that some person saved your life when you were in imminent danger of death. Well, let's say you were hanging over the abyss on a bunch of blades of grass, and realized that another minute or two, and you were already flying into the abyss and this is the complete end. And all your emotions about it. And there is no hope, no hope at all. The only reality is death at the bottom. Introduced?   .   That's about the state in which Russia was suspended over the abyss after the collapse of the USSR.  It is necessary to describe what was going on then for a long time and in detail. But how the enemies of Russia triumphed! Here is a quote from Brzezinski: ""The New World Order will be built against Russia, on the ruins of Russia and at the expense of Russia."   That is, he has already buried all of us - it was assumed, apparently, that we would all really die of hunger, and there would be stacks of our corpses and the corpses of our children on the streets of our cities. And I'm not exaggerating, we all felt the approach of something like this.   When I saw a university professor selling some spoons taken out of the house at the market to buy food, and old veterans selling their orders... And terrorist attacks almost every day! And the war in Chechnya, which seemed endless. And the salary that has not been paid for months. And complete hopelessness - where to get food?   And then Putin came to power. The war in Chechnya ended two weeks later with the complete destruction of the bandits. They started paying off their salary debts. There were still terrorist attacks, but less and less, and then they stopped altogether. They started paying off pension debts. In short, we suddenly felt a timid hope that this fall of the country into the abyss would stop.   And then suddenly roads and bridges began to be built, emergency housing in cities was replaced with new comfortable high-rise buildings, whole streets and neighborhoods were built. And then suddenly it turned out that the eternally unprofitable agriculture began to make a profit, and we went from food importer to exporters...   No, you won't understand. Young people here who did not live at that time, they also no longer understand   But those who survived that horror - they will hold on to Putin with their hands, teeth and claws. Because we have always remembered that "the safest place is behind his back."	1642238605.0	hsqvu4z	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsqvu4z/

g80r0	These issues can't be separated from anything else. In my opinion, Russia has huge potential. But it's wasted on confrontation and dumb things. We should be trying to take over the world economically and culturally. But instead of that we're trying to take over Ukraine and letting our corrupt politicians and oligarchs to take over our country. All things protected and built by our great ancestors belongs to oligarchs now. Things like Norilsk Nikel and Magnitogorsk MMK was built by generations of soviet people whose grandchildren live in (or close to) poverty now. Even our "great culture" now belongs to a bunch of wank stains who can gatekeep everything. And the country is moving to be even more closed and more authoritarian. And it will make all that terrible people richer and the population even poorer. Saint-Petersburg will be filled with trash continuously from now on.  So yeah, fuck all that positivity.	1642238717.0	hsqvzda	t3_s49wxk	t1_hsq1q97	/r/russia/comments/s49wxk/mods_of_rrussia_arresting_a_bunch_of_western/hsqvzda/

1nxg52ul	With Taiwan it's even more complicated. There are two major groups of Taiwanese today. One is composed of "original" inhabitants of island and another are exiles from mainland that arrived with Chiang Kai-shek after lost civil war.  The first group are not "Han Chinese" as I understand it, and as much as I can tell, they feel much less connection to mainland China then the later group. There was also apparently always political division along these two groups in Taiwan.  But I ques it comes down to how you define "Chinese". Both Russia and China were and still are essentially imperial civilizations that include many ethnic groups. However Russians are distinct ethnicity and in Russian language there is even difference made between "Russians" -Ruskye and "citizens of Russia" -Rossiane. Later of course can be of any ethnicity and not necessarily ethnic Russians.  In case of Chinese to me it seems that word is more equivalent to "Rossiane", that is all citizens/inhabitants of China, while equivalent to "Ruskye" would probably be "Han": [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han\_Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese)  But I am no expert in China so take what I said with grain of salt.	1642238960.0	hsqwafr	t3_s4g8cx	t1_hsqv62o	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsqwafr/

y2hmths	The fact is, while I can understand the need to feel more security near their border, in regards to Ukraine, the way Russia is going about it is not wise. If they truly want more security from the West they‚Äôre going about it the wrong way, they‚Äôre not contributing to any sort of peaceful diplomacy instead they‚Äôre straining the relationship and Putin knows this.  He‚Äôs be willing to lose millions of Russians in order to secure territory and resources from neighboring countries, of course it will be justified through patriotism and national security and many would die willingly for their country, just like America to its own military. We‚Äôre not so different.  Part of me wonders why the US and Russia do not work together to keep China in check, the enemy of my enemy sort of thing. We have more to gain from working together and more to lose from fighting eachother.

p7h2ze	In the West, they do not understand the terms, what is Russian. Comparison with the Germans is a good example. Imagine that Germany was divided into 3 parts: Swabia, Bavaria and the rest of Germany. And the peoples were called Schwabs, Bavarians and Germans. The Swabian and Bavarian dialects began to be filled with Anglicisms and Frenchisms, for example, so that they were more different from the common German language. After 100 years, a revolution takes place in Munich. Where crowds of American puppets in the squares shout anti-German slogans, call for a ban on the German literary language and demand that all schools and everything else be translated into Bavarian. And in northern Bavaria in Nuremberg, people do not support these slogans. They are holding referendums in northern Bavaria to join Germany (the capital is Berlin).    This roughly describes the situation of the division of the single Russian people into three different peoples: Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians. Even 100 years ago, it was a single Russian people, which was regionally divided into 3 groups:    \- Great Russians (now called Russians)    \- Little Russians (now called Ukrainians)    \- Belorussians    But in fact, all these groups still consider themselves Russians and speak the same literary Russian language. Majority.    Here, for example, is a map of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof Belarus, Little Russia and New Russia. (Kiev University, 2009).  [Map](https://ibb.co/ZB4Zchk)   You can see that in Little Russia and New Russia languages ‚Äã‚Äãand dialects by popularity:    1. Russian literary language.    2. Surzhik (a rural dialect of the Russian language with Polonisms).    3. Galician dialect or Western Ukrainian (this is essentially a mixture of Russian and Polish languages)    4. Poltava dialect or Ukrainian language (this is some Surzhik, on the basis of which the Ukrainian language was invented in Soviet times).    Until now, the majority speaks the Russian literary language, although it has been banned in various ways for 30 years. And the dialects appeared during the occupation of these lands by the Poles. The more the territory was under occupation (Galicia was not in Russia for 800 years), the more distant the dialect from the single Russian language. And the Surzhik of the central regions is about 80% Russian and 20% Polish. Only Kiev officials and TV presenters speak Ukrainian.	1642242814.0	hsr1d2r	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsr1d2r/

dw6kjdmn	Let's turn to the figures, exports from Russia in 2021, more than $ 470 billion, Gazprom exports more than $ 47 billion. Gazprom has sold about 200 billion rubles abroad. cubes of gas. Nord Stream 2 is capable of pumping 55 billion cubic meters maximum, but it will not be additional gas, but gas that will not go in other directions (Ukraine, Poland). If Gazprom supplies a lot more gas, the price will fall and Gazprom's profit will fall too. Nord Stream is needed first of all in order not to monopolistically depend on transit countries, and to agree with them on a favorable price. Then it has already been built, this is a positive fact, and already helps to negotiate transit more easily. The fact that it has not been launched yet allows us to keep gas prices high. The situation is similar to what if in Russia it was forbidden to buy new German Mercedes trucks, under far-fetched requirements, but it would become more and more expensive to buy passenger cars.. Not very pleasant, but not fatal..	1642246633.0	hsr6hma	t3_s430yt	t3_s430yt	/r/russia/comments/s430yt/is_nord_stream_2_important_for_russia_or_not/hsr6hma/

i9i8v7he	Government corruption and lack of economic reforms. It is well documented that one of the reasons Russia lags behind EU in economic growth is its arbitrary raiding of businesses ("Reiderstvo") which dis-incentivizes foreign and domestic investment and leads to brain drain and capital flight. Something like 70% of Russians fear doing business in Russia. That's not a good sign.  I neither like nor dislike Putin, I think he's done well especially on foreign policy but there is much more he can do to tackle the issue of corruption and perhaps a softer stance with Europe to encourage FDI and trade.  What Russia needs right now is a strongman nationalist (like Putin) on an anti-corruption rampage advocating for a balanced relationship with Europe (neither pro nor rabidly against, basically emphasizing economic integration over political squabbles much like what China is doing). Only a nationalist has any chance of winning the Russian populace and anti-corruption is the number 1 pressing issue at the moment.	1642247418.0	hsr7kn7	t3_s4ia0b	t3_s4ia0b	/r/russia/comments/s4ia0b/russians_what_do_you_think_is_the_biggest_problem/hsr7kn7/

Everyone else is a burden for those, who produce material goods, and must either service emotional needs or just be simply subsidized through some mechanism.  It is called "service economy", it is a symptom of excessive industrial efficiency (which is good) and is a source of unemployment (which is bad).  In Russia unemployment is countered through creating a huge number of inefficient and low-paid (naturally) jobs by government. It is a sort of "redistributive justice" which is unnatural and hindering for the capitalist economy.	1642247581.0	hsr7t00	t3_s4ia0b	t3_s4ia0b	/r/russia/comments/s4ia0b/russians_what_do_you_think_is_the_biggest_problem/hsr7t00/

6cg4g	>can anyone explain to me how wealth is distributed (so taxes predominantly) back into the country?  Simple enough: most taxes (but not all) are gathered into the federal coffers. Several federal subjects are self-sufficient (Moscow, Khanty-Mansiysk, Yamal; also often St. Petersburg and Tatarstan); the rest are subsidized from the federal budget. If there is fighting for the amount of subsidies (and there obviously should be), it's pretty much never made public. The system in which taxation from all regions is taken by the feds and then redistributed is aimed both at equalizing the wealth somewhat, particularly redistributing the wealth from resource extraction, and the federal center maintaining control over the regions.  >I'm curious about why there is a protective culture around him. Is it just because realistically you can't change anything?  No, silly, it's because his rule saw a vast improvement in quality of life for the vast majority of citizens. In late 1999/early 2000, when he came to power, not only was Russian economy still reeling after the default of 1998, with massive poverty and American humanitarian aid requested to prevent hunger, there was an ongoing civil war (with islamic terrorists holding maternity hospitals hostage), and regional currencies started to appear.   Pretty much every social well-being indicator, from GDP per capita (PPP) to average longevity, from average wage to morbidity from principal diseases (other than AIDS and tuberculosis), from average fertility to average ethanol consumed per capita, saw massive improvement under Putin. This is what maintains his lasting popularity.  Of course, moving from an absolute wreck in late 90ies to one of the great powers in the international arena, which was enabled by the resurgent economy, has also done little to diminish his standing with the general populace.	1642248271.0	hsr8rch	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsr8rch/

There‚Äôs a big issue with Russophobia in a lot of subs, and it can often go completely unchallenged. People have soaked up to decades and decades of propaganda about the ‚ÄúRussian Bear‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Menace‚Äù while also not being able to separate normal Russians from the worse actions of the government, as if you‚Äôre all personally directing policy...   Eastern Europeans also get a lot of hate, as can smaller communities like itinerant (or travelling) groups such as the Roma and Irish Travellers.  I‚Äôm a mod in one sub and make a point of shutting down that type of behaviour, as well as trying to foster a bit of solidarity.

Is there a lot of corruption and have you found corruption slowly getting removed out of the system?  Anti-corruption policy definitely got prioritized after 2011-2012 protests. Since then around 10 region governors and 2 ministers were arrested on corruption charges. Even now arrests of government officials is a frequent news. For example, this one: [https://tass.com/society/1346997](https://tass.com/society/1346997)  >What's happened to this ski resort builder guy now?

1pltoegv	Simplifying this, Ukraine as you might now it today is based on internal administrative borders dictated under the –°–°–°–†. Those internal borders were prone to somewhat frequent changes. Imagine a gerrymandering on a country level, but instead of it being for voting, it was for administrative reasons, and/or to please the local ‚Äúboss‚Äù.  We can turn it as much as we want, but Crimea and Donbass are better defined by the ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù adjective, not ‚ÄúUkrainian‚Äù.	1642249229.0	hsra4fp	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsra4fp/

6cg4g	Okay, there are a few things to unpack here.  First, Ukrainians and Russians are close enough culturally and genetically, plus have a significant share of intermarriage. This means that being "Russian" or "Ukrainian" is often a question of self-perception when answering population polls, so a child of two ethnically Ukrainian Russian citizens can easily have themselves listed as Russian in a Russian poll, and a child of two ethnically Russian Ukrainian citizens can easily have themselves listed as Ukrainian in an Ukrainian poll.  Second, the last data point available for [Donetsk](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8) and [Lugansk](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%9B%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%97_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%96#%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4) oblasts comes from 2001, but then ethnic Russians made up some 38% population of the former (to 56% Ukrainians) and 39% of the latter (to 58% Ukrainians). This means that the populations of the People's Republics are Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian and Russian ethnic descent.  Third, what the population of the Republics wants is quite a bit more nuanced than "joining Russia". Their original demands, when they followed the Western Ukraine's lead in capturing city administration, were essentially increased local autonomy: federalization of the country, veto right for their regions in the Parliament. Obviously, after these demands were answered not with appeasement, as was the case in the West, but with artillery fire on living quarters and ground attack plane runs on the captured administrative buildings, the share of those willing to live inside the Ukraine lowered, and the share of these who wanted to join Russia or become an independent nation grew. The following war, with the Ukraine using Nazi paramilitaries such as battalion Azov or battalion Tornado as punitive forces against civilians, did little to endear it to the locals further.	1642249670.0	hsras1e	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsras1e/

6cg4g	> I asked a question to another bloke about the dissolution of the USSR and the splitting of the assets - and where did these oligarchs come from?  This was precisely where the superrich came from, yes (they aren't oligarchs, by definition, given Putin's autocratic rule). The transition to capitalism saw Russia call on Western aid for expertise, and that expertise was given in the form of Chicago school hucksters, whose mantra was "state ownership is to blame". So state-owned assets (and that was pretty much everything at the time) were sold for a trifle to the men who became oligarchs in Yeltzin's Russia, obviously, through barely legal means such as the loans for shares scheme.  >Also there was a video posted by a fella enlightening me on Putin's day to day involvement in issues which gets the backing of the people.  I don't think anyone who's superrich has been bankrupt because of corruption charges and that. Even those who did not get Putin's hint to remain out of politics, like Khodorkovsky, remain very wealthy people.   Putin's antics are mostly for show, I believe: to show that the czar is good even if the boyars are bad. As long as the rules set for the elites aren't broken, nothing serious happens to them.	1642250248.0	hsrbney	t3_s4d5o4	t1_hsr9scu	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsrbney/

glc3l365	In the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, Russians comprise a very significant minority in these regions with 38 and 39 percent of the population respectively. Now on to the republics, there is no demographical research that has been done yet that shows the share of Russians in the republics but I would assume the share of Russians in the republics is a bit higher than in the regions. Why? Mainly because the republics hold districts such as Krasnodon which have a Russian majority.   The Ukrainians that live in Donbass, Slobozhanshchina and Eastern Polissya are no different from Russsians.	1642250375.0	hsrbufk	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsrbufk/

ms6e8	>Actually next question: in the long term; what do you think the state of affairs will be with that type of thing happening more and more? And. Are you seeing it more and more?  Yes. There is a struggle in the government between liberal-minded elites and 'patriotic' (for a lack of a better term) ones. By this I mean they have different paths for Russia in mind, globalist one and nationalist one. Liberals are still in control of the economic block. Among them are head of Central Bank of Russia, acting and former ministers of finances and ministers of economical development. Their actions are directed at keeping Russian economy as a resource export-based one. For example, they do not approve use of profits from oil and natural gas exports to stimulate economy. Because "it will raise inflation". They prefer to follow IMF advices and invest those money into foreign economy: [https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/28/imf-advises-russia-not-to-spend-its-national-welfare-fund-a65765](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/28/imf-advises-russia-not-to-spend-its-national-welfare-fund-a65765)   On the other side are Putin, Shoigu, Lavrov, PM Mishustin, first deputy PM Belousov, some others. As I understand, they're building a new iteration of planned economy. By planned economy I don't mean 'how much every factory should produce', but rather having a complex mathematical model of the economy and its inner dependencies, which would allow to predict bottlenecks (like energy crisis that is unfolding in Europe) and plan better for budget spending.   Globally, there is an ongoing struggle for a new world order between globalistic policy of USA + UK and nationalistic policy of Russia + China. I'm sure latter ones are the right bet.  >Do you still reside in Russia or have you moved?  I'm in Russia; just moved from Yekaterinburg to Saint Petersburg last year. I've spent several vacations in Europe during last decade, so I have something to compare life in Russia with.  I expect much more turbulence in geopolitics around 2024-2025, when there will be next presidential elections in Russia, then next presidential elections in the USA. I think there is a nonzero chance of the breakdown of the USA, and I think Russia is the safest haven to live through those years.	1642251143.0	hsrd35u	t3_s4d5o4	t1_hsravxl	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsrd35u/

p7h2ze	You can ignore the official Kiev statistics. It does not reflect the real situation. Many things in these statistics are propaganda. Let's say. What is your native language? This refers to the language in which you constantly speak. But after 20-30 years of propaganda, residents of Russian cities (Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Nikolaev, Zaporozhye and even Donetsk and Lugansk until 2014) answered that "the Ukrainian language." But in reality, these people speak only literary Russian. And they don't know many from them Ukrainian at all. They only heard it on TV. Therefore, all the statistics there are distorted. What did the Americans from GALLUP do?   They saw the discrepancy between these statistics and reality. After all, they were in different cities, where people speak Russian, and statistics show other things. They came up with a trick to deceive these poor people who were being exposed to propaganda. They invited people to complete the survey in writing. There were different questions on different topics. But there were two forms to choose from: in Russian and in Ukrainian. What the trick. 83% of respondents chose the Russian form and only 17% chose the Ukrainian form. Here is the real situation! You will also see a similar picture in the language queries of different social networks. Also about 80-90% Russian language and 10-20% Ukrainian.

hjtcpzel	Personally I wouldn't call him corrupted.  He is just a loser.  * Name at least someone fired over his anti-corruption investigations. There are so many claims and allegations against high-ranking officials. Don't you think there's a power struggle there? Yet Navalny achieved precisely nothing with his works despite all the views he gets on YouTube. Or was publicity his main goal?  * Name at least one of his anti-corruption investigations done from scratch. They are all repackaged content presented as if Navalny's team did them. For example, pretty much all the locals knew that the expensive plot of land with a bunch of buildings was Medevedev's residence. Yet Navalny's team simply omits the fact it's well-known among those who want to know about it. You can achieve a lot by not mentioning things. The same applies to the so called Putin's palace: the data is like a decade old.  * Even if Navalny's team comes up with an original claim that A leads to B which leads to C, they actually omit things again manipulating you into believing things that have never been said. They will present you with A and C, but not the interstaging B. Navalny would show you someone owns property, he would claim he knows who gifted it, but he does not explain why and how they would gift that property.  * There are typically easier explanations for everything. So called Putin's palace looks like an expensive hotel or a government residence ‚Äî you can even see the individual hotel suites. Why would so called Putin's palace have a hookah room anyway if the Grandpa does not smoke?  * Whenever evaluating anything, numbers are massively overinflated. This plot of land is worth 1 billion! Nobody would ever shell out that amount of money.  * Overall you are led to believe things that are not true. After watching the video on Putin's palace you may think they had access to the compound. They only show you the CGI.  * This is a philosophical question about the nature of monetary compensation and you have your right to disagree, but I don't understand the following. A CEO of a game development studio can make $100 million a year. Why can't a president or a prime minister of a whole country be compensated similarly? He is just a manager with a family, not a saint. Why can't Putin, Medvedev or whoever own an expensive residence? I propose the radical idea that government officials are allowed to live like all the normal people, too. Yet Navalny's investigations operate on the basis they aren't and they should live in poverty for some reason.  * The assassination attempt‚Ä¶ where do we begin. To whack a guy even abroad you need a person willing to spend 20 years in prison and an ice pick. Imagine how easy it can be when you are inside the country ‚Äî just make it happen like a car accident for example. Instead you are led to believe FSB would go with the usual ‚Äúpoison that works unreliably and doesn't seem to be able to kill anyone‚Äù plot. Can you name at least someone who was killed by Novichok by the way? The main sign of its usage is death.  * ‚ÄúWe arranged a phone call with a guy who attempted to murder me!‚Äù Except you are again carefully manipulated into believing the guy admitted things that he didn't say. He merely said internal services were closely monitoring their beloved opposition public figure to avoid, god forbid, anything bad happening to Navalny. That's right: FSB had a few guys closely watching and protecting him to avoid anything weird happening, and it was a thing for years. Why would they wait so long?  * Finally they got sick of his shit and put him behind bars. Over the years Navalny was allowed to walk free from so many things that would otherwise result in lengthy prison time. Navalny even was released from the country after the whole poisoning brouhaha to save his life (or at least it was presented as he urgently needed care in a German clinic) ‚Äî and I'm sure it was allowed to happen only with the Grandpa's approval. Yet it was another political stunt which was the last straw.  * His complaints in prison were hilarious. He was monitored (oh no, they came in the night and checked whether I was in my bed!), he was treated with care, there were public visits from journalists. Meanwhile, in the free and just democracy: Assange (a guy with actual investigations and not ‚Äúlook how lavishly your Putin lives‚Äù) suffered a stroke in prison over the extreme stress. Can you imagine how loud every Western media outlet would weep if something similar happened to a Russian guy who published some YouTube video about Medvedev's boat?  So you are dealing with a loser who achieved precisely nothing aside from PR stunts. And look where it led him: after only a year in prison nobody even remembers the guy.  It's pathetic.	1642439861.0	ht25wqb	t3_s648xd	t1_ht1gok5	/r/russia/comments/s648xd/a_year_after_arrest_navalny_says_no_regret_about/ht25wqb/

6cg4g	Serious answer: multiple reasons.  First, the US is working very hard to undermine MAD, in two chief directions: ballistic missile defense and first disarming and decapitating strike capabilities. There are multiple projects for both, and infrastructure for both moved ever closer to the Russian borders.  Second, the weapons of mass destruction aren't a panacea. You can't use nuclear blackmail to solve all your diplomatic and military issues, not by far.   Furthermore, there's a lot of escalation to cover between peacetime and an all-out nuclear war, including proxy conflicts, guerrilla wars and support for rebellions, attacks by expendable vassals' conventional forces, and limited long-range strikes.   Would Russia nukle the US if it arms and supports a Chechen rebellion? Would Russia nuke the US if it provides weapons, say, to Georgia or the Ukraine, and encourages their governments to attack Russia? Would Russia nuke the US if a number of American cruise missiles, say, destroy a hydroelectric dam somewhere in Russia? It's brinkmanship, of course, but it's reasonably safe, because no one wants to burn in nuclear fire, and mutually assured destruction is mutual for a reason.	1642440059.0	ht26flr	t3_s5picc	t1_ht11m8w	/r/russia/comments/s5picc/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_all_this_hypocrisy/ht26flr/

I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but you really need to do a bit or research into the 2014 U.S. sponsored coup, the neo Nazis in the ‚ÄúRight Sector‚Äù and the ‚ÄúAzov Battalion‚Äù that have been providing the muscle for the coup government, the anti-Russian language laws they proposed, and the attempts made to ethnically cleanse the east of Russian people.

Do you have no resemblence of a unbiased wiew on your nations history? Russis fought many defensive AND offensive wars and in modern times quasi-wars and hybrid conflicts.

5xtagdr8	> The Baltics spent three hundred years in the Russian Empire, then saw Russian specialists sent there by the Soviet government after university graduation to help build their economies.  Was this by the choice of any of the Baltics? That inevitably determines the decisions made by a nation and their idea of what's ''fair''.  > because there have been Russian populations there since before such entities appeared on the map at all  I suppose I did generalize and historically the post soviet nations do differ in many ways, however, despite of the ''entities'' not existing on the map, the nations have been long established in the regions. In the same way Russian Federation is a successor of USSR and previously the Russian empire and you don't view yourself as a newly freshly formed country/nation. It's the reason these nations seek independence all together, they don't perceive themselves as Russian and Russians are not them.   > Denying ethnic minorities the right to speak their language, as well as representation in the elite, is absolutely abuse.  Changing road signs to another language is not really ''denying ethnic minorities the right to speak their language". Russian is very prominently spoken in post soviet states and no one is going to jail over it. Non-Russians are pretty much expected to speak it.  Couldn't say the same about the reverse situation that occurred in Russian Empire.   I can recognize that the change was overall not beneficial to Russians that have been living there a long time, but neither were the repeated occupations to other nations. There's still a whole lot of resentment over it in people's minds and the historical events cause turmoil in everyone's lives.  Regarding Finland and Sweden, that is more ancient history than last 30 years, I'd expect a lot to change in Europe over the next century if we were to avoid another war, which starts to seem less plausible but regardless. But I admit, I do not know about the Sweden's and Finland's common history that much and their relationship during Sweden's rule.  > Wow. Should the Welsh seek to assimilate and become English? Should the Scots?  This is looking at it entirely the other way around. Welsh are not English in the same way Estonians are not Russian. What happened with Welsh regarding England is perhaps similar to what would've happened to soviet states had they never been liberated and reestablished themselves. The Welsh and Scottish had their cultures watered down significantly.  > yes, but claiming that it's "ethnically uniform without persisting minorities" can only come from ignoring the very basic facts of reality on the ground.  I do admit I possibly don't know the reality of the situation. The speculation was that having small percentages of various minorities has an overall different influence than a larger uniform but culturally different minority spanning 15%-25% of the whole population.   > Sort of a weak reason there, this injustice should be fixed asap.  Absolutely. But on a more serious note, it isn't really about what the Germans or the English did or didn't do, it's about what the Welsh, Irish and Scottish would want.  > Finland and the Baltic states had never had an independent national statehood before 1917  The Finnish language, thus the Finnish nation, has been present and developing in their region for a really long time though. I think this is most of what shapes national identity and its relationship with its land.   The particular border disputes is a much more complex topic. It's much more straight forward to say that the Polish, for example, are historically based in Eastern/Central Europe rather than, you know, South America or something, than to argue which particular areas in Europe should belong to them.  > Would it be the right thing to do to grant any regional identity national statehood, and see the dozens or hundreds of wars start between them as they fight over interlapping settlement areas?  I think this is one of the things that time itself resolves and people stop caring. Of course there are no need for new conflicts if people themselves feel no clashing differences and are satisfied. And it is true that dissatisfaction and disputes can be aroused in people with organized methods, however the success of that declines as time passes and long standing friendly relationships develop.  > or Estonians or Latvians in a Russian state should have had their culture and language protected and preserved (as they were), but Russians in Estonian or Latvian state are "foreigners who should aim to assimilate"?  This is curious as we might be exposed to different sources regarding those periods of history. The efforts of Russification and instances of press ban even are highly accented.	1642596517.0	htb82db	t3_s5mkoc	t1_ht9e42c	/r/russia/comments/s5mkoc/whats_the_media_coverage_of_the_ongoing_situation/htb82db/

9yi4f982	My advice would be to firstly look for any Facebook or VK pages for foreigners living there if you want an immediate network and secondly to put yourself out there by going to bars and cafes etc and just trying to socialise. It will be hard with a limited amount of Russian, but if you know English to an adequate level you will definitely find locals who want to speak in English and practice. As for the bureaucracy, all I can advise is to familiarise yourself with basic principles of legal process etc and see if you can find a native speaker who would be able to translate for you - unfortunately this will be a little harder than in a city like Moscow or Peter but Yekaterinburg is still big enough to have native or advanced English speakers.

lna0b	Ah, I see.  I get that your messages are targeted for the "internal audience" of Russia, but it's really interesting to read as an outsider.  Apparently you claim to have been a Finnish citizen, and yet, you don't seem to understand even the basics of a Finnish society. Talking about gods and being fascist, which are something Finns never talk about but know that Russians do.  And it's somewhat silly to say that only Sweden and Russia genuinely like Finland. Where did the "little brother", Estonia go? Or Norway? Or Denmark? Or Iceland? Or Japan? And just that you know, Sweden is often considered to like Finland the least, of Nordic-countries. You should know at least these if you claim to have lived in Finland.  Also, you should tone down the book quotes. It's an another clue that you have no knowledge about Finnish people. Finns don't take those seriously and avoid quoting people -- because quite frankly, it's a bit dumb.  I wonder if an average Russian citizen sees you as a troll as easily or are you targeting the less educated only? Most of your comment history seems to be about propaganda.

For your information, i was born there, i am a professional writer in finnish language, and i have one thing to say to:  Te kouluttamattomat maalaisjuntit ette tajua h√§rm√§st√§ yht√§√§n mit√§√§n, te yrit√§tte tuhota meid√§n h√§rm√§n ja te pellet annoitte pois Nokian, tuhositte meid√§n itsen√§isyytemme 2000-luvun alussa ja teid√§n maanpetturien takia me el√§mme ja kirjoitamme maanpaossa. Kasvoin Eiran ja Ullanlinnan rajoilla Pietarinkadulla, kuuntelin Pietarinkadun Oilersin pottuilupuhelinta ja tied√§n tarkkaan mit√§ mielt√§ Sakke ja kumppanit teist√§ maalaisjunteista on. Tied√§n mit√§ Kaurism√§ki ajattelee, ja tied√§n mit√§ te maanpetturit yrit√§tte tehd√§. Siin√§ on sinun vitun hinttis saatanan koulumattoman juntti. Valmistuin Helsingin Yliopiston yleisen kirjallisuuden linjalta H.K.

Katotaan mik√§ pelle siell√§ on jostain saatanan K√§rs√§m√§elt√§ joka on varastanut n√§iden vitun k√§teisten, stuppien ja mariinien kanssa meid√§n maan. Onko selv√§, vitun maalaisjuntti?

In general if American writers need a big bad enemy they choose Russia as the next major super power for two reasons.   1) The cold war so people are already fairly familiar with Russia.   2) It's believable   3) Putin has done lots of shady things on the international stage to keep Russia in the forefront of everyone's minds as potential bad guys.   4) China would be the next obvious Country but they're a huge film market and will block anything that makes China look bad so American film makers don't want to make them the bad guy.	1642603661.0	htbn1va	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbkgp1	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbn1va/

Only ones they believe will make the US military look good. The liaisons also do not go over every single detail, they also generally will not have the ability to correct small mistakes. They get much more influence into how the overall actions of the military are portrayed.

p7h2ze	There is a very interesting marker in politics that the Russians have understood. If the West loves a Russian (Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Navalny...) then this is a traitor to Russia. And such a person brings enormous damage to Russia and the Russian people if he gets power here. And vice versa. If the West hates a Russian (Ivan Grozny\*, Stalin, Putin...), then this is a Russian patriot who has done a lot of good for Russia and the Russian people.    \*Ivan Grozny is not really Ivan the Terrible. The mistranslation is part of the demonization myth.    Therefore, when you now notice how Putin is being demonized, without even knowing the truth, you can appreciate how Ivan Grozny and Stalin were demonized in the West.	1642605478.0	htbrgsz	t3_s7rqwj	t3_s7rqwj	/r/russia/comments/s7rqwj/what_the_heck_should_be_this_this_is_another/htbrgsz/

nlfofey	Are we talking about recent events?    The Russian military conducted military exercises after another escalation of the situation and violation of the truce in the Donbass (in late autumn), after which NATO announced that Russian troops were on the borders of Ukraine and were planning to invade Ukraine right now, while Belarus was distracting attention with the situation with refugees on the border with Poland, then they announced that Russia would attack in January-February, then they announced that they planned to attack on Christmas Eve, now they are again talking about the end of January. With the exception of Crimea, Russian military camps stand hundreds of kilometers from the borders of Ukraine, one near Smolensk (200km to the borders of Ukraine), one near Voronezh (300km), there may be some smaller camps, but these are the main ones, as far as I know, and even the NYTimes refers to them. When the media talks about "troops on the border", people probably imagine how the troops are already almost breaking through the border posts and invading Ukraine, while in reality the Russian troops are closer to Belarus and Moscow than to Ukraine or Kiev.        When the invasion does not happen, the media will most likely tell how Putin got scared, or how Putin bluffed and blackmailed NATO, but NATO bravely stood up for Ukraine and did not succumb to Putin's threats, something like that, but the damage to the economy has already been done simply by threats of new sanctions , and then they will impose new sanctions for "Putin's threats" and the economy will suffer even more. At the moment, this is their main idea, to harm the Russian economy as much as possible, because they believe that when the savings of ordinary Russian citizens (and first of all Russian oligarchs) will take a hit, the Russian people will rise up against Putin or the economy will collapse and Russia will fall apart into smaller countries.	1642605991.0	htbspxl	t3_s7faju	t1_htbjt8j	/r/russia/comments/s7faju/does_putin_want_to_integrate_ukraine_and_belarus/htbspxl/

4qgbb	> You my friend are an exception, until the last couple of years, I was largely taught the Soviet horde myth by television and school.  I dunno what you're watching because I watch tons of documentaries and WWII movies and didn't really see that as widespread doctrine. What I did see was underequipped (generally not rifle wise as portrayed in Enemy at the gates) Russian forces, especially early in the war, in far superior numbers go against German army's and get beaten back. Not all the time, but some of the time. It's not a secret that Germans at the start of the war had better weapons, training, strategy and more supplies.   So seeing Russian forces lose with much larger numbers on the battlefield field and experiencing much higher casualties is not really a myth. It's also not the whole picture of the whole war either. By the end of the war the Russians were pumping out great tanks in the T-34 and other designs, had better strategies to counter the Germans, and frankly steamrolled them all the way back to Berlin.   But to deny that there were battles, especially early in the war in which the Russians had far more people, and lost to much smaller German forces due to inferior weapons and tactics is just denying history. We only learn from history when we study the good and the bad. Not just that which makes us feel proud of ourselves and our people.	1642606394.0	htbtpzj	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbs0qn	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbtpzj/

6cg4g	> Was this by the choice of any of the Baltics? That inevitably determines the decisions made by a nation and their idea of what's ''fair''.  Again: three hundred years before these entities appeared on the map.  >the nations have been long established in the regions. In the same way Russian Federation is a successor of USSR and previously the Russian empire  Not at all. The Russian Empire was a state, so was the USSR, and so is the Russian Federation. They inherited each others' international treaties, established embassies, etcetera. The Baltics were drawn arbitrarily on the map by an occupying power: there is no objective reason why Latvians in particular should get national statehood, but say Latgalians or Livs shouldn't.  >It's the reason these nations seek independence all together, they don't perceive themselves as Russian   Neither do Tatars or Chuvash or or or or, so? Similarly, Pskovians or Novgorodians did not share an ethnic identity with the Muscovites in the XIV century; similarly, again, Gasconians or Burgundians did not share one with the Parisans, or Bavarians with Prussians.  >Changing road signs to another language is not really ''denying ethnic minorities the right to speak their language".  It is simply creeping derussification in a country where some 80+% speak Russian as their native tongue. A state-sanctioned effort to make Russians (or their children) less Russian and more Belorussian. Same as in the Ukraine (see below)  >Russian is very prominently spoken in post soviet states and no one is going to jail over it.  Haha, nope. The Ukraine has introduced a law some time ago that not just bans importing or printing literature in Russian, but mandates a certain share of broadcasting time (75% if memory serves) to be in Ukrainian, and service by any commercials companies be offered exclusively in Ukrainian. And yes, there are already some three thousand reports for breaking that law, because throughout the Eastern and to a large degree Central Ukraine the language everyone talks in the streets is Russian.  >Couldn't say the same about the reverse situation that occurred in Russian Empire.  The Russian Empire had a single official language, but that changed in the USSR, once again I remind you.  >I can recognize that the change was overall not beneficial to Russians that have been living there a long time, but neither were the repeated occupations to other nations.  If you mean "being a part of the Russian state" by "repeated occupations", then they were beneficial, objectively, as the aforementioned Ukraine still surviving on remains of the Soviet industry left over when the Union fell atests.  >This is looking at it entirely the other way around. Welsh are not English in the same way Estonians are not Russian.  So Welsh are "foreigners" who by your own claim above should "seek to assimilate". Same as Estonians were in the Russian Empire and the USSR.  >The speculation was that having small percentages of various minorities has an overall different influence than a larger uniform but culturally different minority spanning 15%-25% of the whole population.  And what would that difference be? The minorities in Russia form 25+% share of the population in their national republics; in some of them, up to roughly 85%. So?  >But on a more serious note, it isn't really about what the Germans or the English did or didn't do, it's about what the Welsh, Irish and Scottish would want.  The German occupying forces did not run a plebiscite in the Baltics. Neither did the White Finns when they slaughtered the Reds. Install a puppet government in St. Petersburg today, pump it with money, allow it free reign to do as they please with dissenters, pour media propaganda onto the population through local and international media, and in a couple dozen years to maybe half a century you'll have some Ingermanlandians claiming a separate identity from the rest of the Russian stock. If you want a real precedent of the process at work, check out Hongkongers. Ask the Scots if they want independence before and after Brexit (e.g. within a handful of years), and you might receive notably different results. Etc.  >The Finnish language, thus the Finnish nation, has been present and developing in their region for a really long time though. I think this is most of what shapes national identity and its relationship with its land.  Except it doesn't work this way. There have always been Finno-Ugoric tribes living from Scandinavia to the Urals; their languages are not discrete and different but a spectrum of dialects diverging over time. Take, for instance, Karelians: the Finns consider their Finnish Karelians a subset of Finns; in Russia, they have a national Republic of Karelia.  Do they have "an established national identity and a relationship with their land"? Had the Germans won WWII, Karelia would've become a part of Finland, and thus Karelians on this side of the border too a subset of Finns. Is that to mean that Russia is "repeatedly occupying" Karelia? Or that fighting back the Finnish Army back out of it during WWII was "a Russian invasion"?  >I think this is one of the things that time itself resolves and people stop caring.  People did not care in the Soviet Union until its economic system started to fail, given rise to local ethnic nationalisms. As noted above, ethnic and national identities are flexible like this. History demonstrates time and time again (see: creation of Russia by Moscow principality, creation of Germany, creation of the US, creation of the EU) that large state entities are the most viable and the most stable; as long as every ethnicity's rights are ensured, this is the obvious main way for humanity's development.  >The efforts of Russification and instances of press ban even are highly accented.  Third time around: state language, korenization, no official positions without knowing the language.	1642608114.0	htby3ql	t3_s5mkoc	t1_htb82db	/r/russia/comments/s5mkoc/whats_the_media_coverage_of_the_ongoing_situation/htby3ql/

And did i mention he famously wrote of how he had "[never been able to dislike Hitler](https://twitter.com/SarahTheHaider/status/1300360063845126144?s=20)"?   And to top it all of... he was just kind of a shitty writer. His writings were quickly co-opted by the US government, of course, and as such easily driven to high fame, but his books are kind of shit! I've read them and stand with Isaac Asimov in regards to how just not really all that good at all his writing is. [Here's Asimov's review of 1984](http://www.newworker.org/ncptrory/1984.htm) where he talks of it.  George Orwell was kind of a really, really bad person.

6ksc4euo	In honesty we were taught that they fought without (or with empty) weapons because the military budget ran out. Sometime in the early 40's brass became internationally scarce and soviet rounds were fitted with steel casings which work good enough for a while but destroy the "upper" and barrel over time. At the same time I can buy a mosin nagant at the pawn shop for $500 so idk just how bad they were. But I guess even then Russia had way more troops than they had bullets and we were taught that near the end, the eastern front was won by charging soldiers with empty weapons  We were also taught that the war devastated the russian male population, some 20 million casualties I think, which caused economic and population problems that can still be measured today  Is that different than what you are taught?	1642614274.0	htcefvs	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbk8e3	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htcefvs/

"Protection", my ass.  One has to be dumb as a brick to trust NATO or any other organization completely controlled by USA or GB considering all the known facts and deeds of NATO and it's leading members.  But there is more: some of the NATO officials have the nerve to demand Russia to move it's own military forces away from it's own border.    It's as if they didn't know that Russia has it's own interests including maintaining it's own safety. Which does not allow the presence of enemy infrastructure capable of causing irreparable damage in the event of an attack by NATO countries right near it's borders.     But there is another option: russian nukes return to Cuba + few more South American countries.     Sounds totally safe for me.

eahhpais	I can with an honest heart say I love the russian people, in so far as I've had any experience with them. And I see little use in joining NATO. But as a swedish soldier and teacher, I see no use in lying. I see little use in lies and thinly veiled threats.   Why should we not react when the Russian state makes such provocations? It's not like we are in a position to attack you. So these silly quips about "Estonia and Sweden are hightening the aggression"? Come on! It isn't 1698 or something! And yes, I do understand NATO wants to use us as pawns, I get that. But does that make threats directed at us any better?  And honestly, if it came to blows, to me it matters little to me that you would kill me in the end. No matter what, my native soil is mine. And no amount of death can turn wrong into right.  I don't want to rob Russia of your sovereignty, your rights, or your beauty and life.

i7lavsor	Maybe this is partly true. But satelite pictures do show large russian forces mobilized at the border to Ukraine. It is no wonder that there now are talks between Russia and a lot of other nations to calm down the situation. Its not just all headlines. Yes, western media is biased to put Russia forward as the bad guy. But the same goes for Russian media, just the other way around. No matter how you put it there is no wonder about the situation being very tense right now - perhaps the most tense since the cold war‚Ä¶ 150 k russian troops at the border to Ukraine aint a joke. Especially when it involves a lot of tanks. And Ukraine importing equipment from Britain and the US‚Ä¶ Sweden mobilizing their troops‚Ä¶ Russia sending drones to inspect swedish nuclear factories‚Ä¶ the situation is no joke‚Ä¶.

5xtagdr8	> Again: three hundred years before these entities appeared on the map.  This makes me wonder what is your take regarding the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or Polish-Lithuanian common wealth. Perhaps Latvians and Estonians are a somewhat different case but I'd be surprised if Lithuanians viewed themselves as suddenly appearing on the map in the 20th century. They had a king crowned in the 13th century.  >  there is no objective reason why Latvians in particular should get national statehood, but say Latgalians or Livs shouldn't.  And why aren't they demanding statehood? Because they mostly assimilated to comprise current Latvians. There's no one left to desire statehood. To avoid similar fate nations try to establish themselves culturally. It's a strategical move that I doubt would be viewed negatively if there wasn't present multiculturalism due to previous historical events. Consider Japan and their fairly xenophobic policies. Rich culturally though. They never seem to receive the same extent of criticism that many western states do when it comes to this.  Assimilation and watering down of culture does happen to some nations and they slowly vanish and merge with others, globalism is now causing western culture to seep into nations and that's a whole separate issue, if one perceives it as an issue all together.  This makes me wonder, would you not mind to see Russia getting extensively westernized?   > It is simply creeping derussification in a country where some 80+% speak Russian as their native tongue.  I think this aspect is often taken within the context of USSR. Within USSR most learnt to speak Russian as that's just how it was. Of course 30 years later a lot of people still continue to know the language cause things don't change that quickly, but it's not viewed any more as a language that those who aren't ethnically Russian should have to use.   It is true though that an opposing effect is now happening everywhere with English where it's becoming sort of a second language and people are expected to speak it. But it's more of a natural shift which often receives less opposition.  > The Ukraine has introduced a law some time ago that not just bans importing or printing literature in Russian  Didn't know that, so fair enough. That is indeed excessive.  > So Welsh are "foreigners" who by your own claim above should "seek to assimilate". Same as Estonians were in the Russian Empire and the USSR.  That's spinning it around a bit. There is a distinction between people choosing to live in the lands predominantly inhabited by a different nation rather than their own and a whole nation being occupied by another power.   Surely you must be able to see that the situation of Russians in current day post soviet states doesn't quite compare. It is true that they didn't move there with intention to leave Russia. But Russia is still there.  It's perhaps a bit more like the English moving to Scotland and then Scotland becoming independent from United Kingdom. It would be inconvenient for the English, but England is still there, it's just separate from Scotland.  > People did not care in the Soviet Union until its economic system started to fail, given rise to local ethnic nationalisms.  That probably varies on sources one is exposed to. There are always groups that are nostalgic of the old regime but from what I've read and heard of people's memoirs of life under the regime, economic failure was far from the only problem or source of dissatisfaction.  > that large state entities are the most viable and the most stable; as long as every ethnicity's rights are ensured, this is the obvious main way for humanity's development.  That I can agree with. However it seems that in itself requires substantial cultural similarity. Even minor social issues such as liberal migration policies and recognition of same sex marriage are causing disagreements among EU nations.  These responses are getting excessively long, I'm sure I missed some points. Some I might not even have sufficient knowledge to express an opinion on.	1642618690.0	htcqffu	t3_s5mkoc	t1_htby3ql	/r/russia/comments/s5mkoc/whats_the_media_coverage_of_the_ongoing_situation/htcqffu/

1nxg52ul	Russia have 400,000 troops in the Southern Military District alone on the permanent basis if I recall correctly. When I saw reports in the US media about Russia amassing 100,000 troops on Ukrainian border, I begun laughing, because that would have to mean that Russia have basically withdrawn 300,000 troops from there.  Yes, full scale inversion of Ukraine would require some preparation, but I have no doubt that Russians would try to hide it and given "competence" Western intelligence services have shown in the past, I guess they will likely succeed. Besides, it does not have to be all out invasion. There are plenty of people in the Ukraine itself that are willing to side with Russia if given some support. I mean there are two breakaway republics armed to the teeth that rely on Russian support for years.  &#x200B;  >Western Media. Propaganda?

yqhvm	Well, picture 9 is from one of Jason Bourne films, that I know for sure. 13 is from K-19, a film from 2002. It's actually not the worst film depicting USSR though, and is quite well made, my regiment's political officer actually put it on for us while I was serving.   It's not necessarily about the *state* being villains. It's just *Russians* in any way that they might appear.

yqhvm	This idea fails when you consider how modern warfare works. Russia has already utilised missiles that go from ships in the Caspian Sea all the way to Syria. Conventional forces are no longer limited to their immediate area of operations.    That, plus nuclear weapons (including supersonic cruise missiles with nuclear payloads) guarantee Russia's safety from a potential invasion much better than any buffer zone would. Especially when establishing such a zone costs so much in both direct investments and in the reprisals that hurt the economy.	1642624830.0	htd6zyq	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htd3bls	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htd6zyq/

2rzwuerl	I'm doubtful. These ships have a specific role: to arrange landing on a contested or hostile beach.  Delivering large equipment to Cuba would be more efficient using cargo ships, which can dock and unload in ports with remarable efficiency.  Due to distance, people and small equipment would benefit from air delivery. Nobody wants to slowly steam across the Atlantic when they can arrive in hours via airplane.	1642625009.0	htd7hne	t3_s7vobn	t1_htcdxij	/r/russia/comments/s7vobn/six_russian_landing_ships_sail_past_britain/htd7hne/

f6avfqpv	The other day I listened to a webinar about from the Iranian American Institute about cultural stereotypes of Iranians in American media. There was a consensus that there were essentially three archetype-depictions of Iranians in American media:  * The Bazaari carpet-merchant * The fanatical terrorist * The decadent sex/drugs/rock and roll Persian millionaire  It is my view that there are plenty of stereotypes of Russians in American media as well. I note the following ones:  * The barbaric Russian military brute (e.g. Ivan Drago from Rocky) * The honeypot Russian spy who uses her sexuality to extract state secrets from American men * The funny-hat wearing Russian * The pathetic, unemployable alcoholic Russian man * The backwards, babushka-clad Russian grandma * The Russian ballet dancer * The vaguely Asiatic Russian mystic (admittedly this kind of died off with Rasputin) * The female Russian prostitute (this one is related to the honeypot spy) * The joyless Russian mafia member * The communist intellectual  In the view of the Americans, all Russians are merely a composite of these basic characteristics.	1642625084.0	htd7oup	t3_s7pryw	t3_s7pryw	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htd7oup/

My observation from my last visit is that it's full of South Korean girls who want to go do Europe but don't have the time and money so Vladivostok is their substitute 'European' city to take endless selfies with those selfie sticks walking around all day.

At the start of the war, the USSR had 3.2 million soldiers in the border areas, while the Axis invasion force numbered 4.3 million. At the most critical moment, during the Battle for Moscow, the capital of the USSR was defended by only 1.25 million soldiers who defended themselves from 1.9 million Nazis, moreover, with a twofold advantage of the Nazis in tanks, planes and artillery. The Soviet troops began the Battle of Stalingrad with only 386,000 soldiers on the front line, when the Nazi side numbered 430,000. When the Battle for Stalingrad was coming to an end, the Soviet troops reached a strength of about 1.1 million, when the Nazis were about a million. The USSR had no numerical advantage almost anywhere before the Battle of Kursk, but as soon as the USSR managed to achieve at least an equivalent number of troops, the Nazis were continuously defeated until the very end of the war.	1642628433.0	htdgy93	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbtpzj	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htdgy93/

dj1wcws2	American here, yes. But its interesting to know that Russians are simultaneously desperate to turn Ukraine in to Russian territory, while decrying how no one would ever want them (literally just means the west to you) to be THEIR asset. And then cites nord stream to say why.   The reason nord stream occured is because Ukraine is between Russia and Europe and can tax the oil being sent through its territory. Obviously and naturally, this pissed Russia off. But then to turn around and claim "SEE! WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM!" While you're actively doing the exact opposite on the ground. Ok, then give back Crimea and never deal with Ukraine again, then? Hell, that'd even get the western sanctions off your back.  Seems like it SHOULD BE a  win win from a russian's perspective.   Furthermore, Russia has a smaller GDP (1.29 trillion, though i think thats up to 1.4 now, $8,735 per capita) than a single US state, Texas (1.7 trillion gdp, $58,000 per capita). With around 5 times as much population (29.3 million vs 144million) . So why is it the case that the same shouldn't ALSO be said of Russia, if it should be said of Ukraine in the first place?   The cold hard truth is, Russia put its self in the position its in. The cold hard truth is russians are a bit wrapped up in a superiority complex. And the cold hard truth is, the world needs the Russian people to stand up to their own government. No ill will friend, just a frustrated plea for sanity from a fellow human on this planet.	1642629703.0	htdkf88	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htca8l0	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htdkf88/

Sorry to say, most Americans don't know, and don't care to see the truth.  There's even cases when Americans would tell off folks who experienced Chernobyl's tragedy directly, government or civilian, and claim they were wrong about their own life experiences because the show told them so.

sxp8e	This is all a chess game. Russia moves their pieces into position and the West does the same. Hopefully the outcome will be a peaceful stale mate where diplomacy prevails. In reality though, who knows? Putin is generally good at the game, but even a grandmaster can lose sometimes.   Personally, I think both sides need to chill the fuck out and leave each other in peace. The West won‚Äôt because of their giant ego and belief that their way is the only right way. Russia won‚Äôt because it means the West encroaches on its sphere of influence. It would behoove both sides to stand down, leave Ukraine as a buffer and establish individual trade agreements. I hope they get tired of the head butting and find a win-win solution instead of the bullshit that‚Äôs going on now.   Enough people have died from the pandemic.

4b7rn1xk	If the RF was going to invade, they‚Äôd do it away from media attention. Notice how both the Georgian conflict, and Crimea both caught the media off guard?   They were playing catch-up to report past events. When the media is constantly going on and on, It‚Äôs manufactured hype for views/click. I highly doubt Russia will actually invade under the current circumstances. Russia literally cannot afford a war right now.   Russia has also built up troops along their western border every year since 2015. Its ‚Äúyearly training‚Äù, which is obviously intended to be ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù without a doubt. But it‚Äôs not as if there is an ongoing invasion? They‚Äôre just at the border, and honestly more like ~400Km from the border.   Essentially:  Russia won‚Äôt invade currently, and especially not while media attention is at its peak. They always catch the media off guard it seems (Crimea and Georgian conflict). This isn‚Äôt a new move on the behalf of the RF, it happens yearly.	1642696533.0	hth5qmc	t3_s8c7jl	t1_htgol2q	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/hth5qmc/

ib6p23ku	If it does, it probably won't happen for a while though.  The decline of the Roman Empire is said to have spanned from the reign of Commodus (AD 192) to approximately AD 476, but this was at a time when sufficient numbers of people with pitchforks could effectively topple a local governor.  With modern technology, it's a lot more difficult.  Perhaps America is on its decline, but even if they split, I would hardly see any of the successors sinking any lower than say the French or Spanish empires to what France and Spain are today.  France and Spain are still relatively wealthy compared to other countries.  It's just that they aren't globally prominent.  You might have at worst something like Yugoslavia and perhaps they'd lose Hawaii or some Pacific Islands, but I don't see anything going further than that.	1642698258.0	hthah7a	t3_s8gfyk	t1_hth6df2	/r/russia/comments/s8gfyk/western_liberals_be_like/hthah7a/

31jlerr8	This has already happened to me personally. I read the European news in 2014, which claimed that Putin had staged the coup in Kiev to steal Crimea. And my reaction was, "What? Take away the Crimea? What nonsense!". To be fair, the coup was also clearly initiated by someone else. But the situation with Crimea seemed to me at the time to be a fantasy of the Western media.  If Russia really goes to war with Ukraine I will be very disappointed. But honestly I don't believe it will happen in the next few weeks at least simply because the equipment will get stuck in the mud halfway through, and no one ever plans attacks that will immediately fail. Mid to late February is clearly a better time.

Travelers who arrive in Russia without an entry visa will not be permitted to enter the country, and face immediate return to the point of embarkation at their own expense.  Russian Embassy..  In my regard the average person seeking travel in the US can not just go to Russia and see it for what it is unless like I said under specific circumstances such as a visa..  I can jump back and fourth over to Canada and America as long as I got a passport now Russians and Americans can‚Äôt do that to Russia and the US is my point.

Once in Russia, we have to register, but often this is a service the hotel provides.   I've always known this and perhaps this is why I consider it normal.

7e23owtf	It‚Äôs simple, in the USSR you couldn‚Äôt take the money out of the country. With the fall of communism Russia opened up and the currency has been leaving Russia for 30 years. There are several avenues for this, whether thats because foreign products dominated the domestic market because of perceived quality and ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù, so Russian industry had to shutdown because there was no market for their products, or because people who came in to possession of profitable corporations got wealthy selling mostly natural resources, and instead of keeping money in the communities they would just move to some subtropical region of the globe and spend the bulk of their money there. Now with sanctions some of these avenues have been cut, or hindered. Now some foreign products have been eliminated from the market completely and thus has given domestic producers and empty playing field, these new businessmen now can‚Äôt leave due to the precarious international situation and are forced to keep their money circulating in Russia. This is basically the same thing trump wanted to achieve in the US with the trade war. Of course this is a double bladed approach but I believe it‚Äôs currently keeping Russia a bit more insulated against foreign economic troubles but can cause domestic producers to become complacent and the quality will suffer and that when someday trade will open up again the same process of leaking currency will begin again.	1642704696.0	hthsarp	t3_s8jbpd	t1_hthldi6	/r/russia/comments/s8jbpd/from_january_1_2022_the_export_of_unprocessed_or/hthsarp/

He was seriously wounded in 1944 and relegated to kitchen duty; still got a medal for delivering hot food to the tankers in a deep breakthrough.  The other was sent on a business trip to Belorussia in June 1941, only to find German motorcyclists entering the railway station as he arrived. He jumped on the last train to the East and went to enlist the moment he was back in Moscow. Served in horse recon, got several wounds and a serious concussion at the crossing of Dnepr (his horse knelt and waited until he regained his senses when he lost consciousness and had his neck caught in the reigns) and was moved to serve as a teacher in the Vystrel course.	1642705063.0	hthtay4	t3_s8ds5i	t3_s8ds5i	/r/russia/comments/s8ds5i/how_did_your_family_contribute_to_victory_in_the/hthtay4/

That shocked Europe which feared the loss of its identity and when the USSR took that to the next level and the US appeared on the scene with Europe, that age old battle went to the next level. Today it is the West that projects its own sins on Russia in a bid to make Russia in its own image.

p7h2ze	Especially for you, I will draw an analogy to make it very clear. Swabia=Belorussia, Bavaria=Ukraine, the rest of Germany=Russia. That is, it is a single people, with small regional differences. In 1991, Germany falls apart. Swabia and Bavaria become independent states. Bavarian nationalists seize power in Bavaria. They are gradually squeezing out a single German literary language. The Bavarian dialect is declared the sole official language. Rewriting history. The main motive is that the Bavarians are the right Germans. And the North Germans are a mixture of different peoples. Half German. Then in 2014 in Munich, the Americans and the British stage a Maidan, where an even more radical Nazi power comes. They generally forbid the German language even in cafes and shops. Translated all German schools and universities into Bavarian. During these 30 years, the Bavarian language itself has been artificially moving as far as possible from the unified German language by adding hundreds of new words, borrowings from the English language.    But northern Bavaria refuses to submit to the new Nazis in Munich. They take power in Nuremberg into their own hands. They say they are all Germans. They want to teach their children in their native German language. And not to divide the German people into different parts. Munich sends troops north and starts bombing Nuremberg and other cities. Northern Germany helps them with weapons and humanitarian aid. But she herself does not interfere in the conflict.

4rgna	Not really an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù per se. Russia already had military control of Crimea, thanks to an early 90s agreement with Ukraine. Not a single person died during the takeover, which was mandated by numerous referendums by the Crimean people who never really felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù in Ukraine, and really had enough of Ukrainian rule after the illegal Maidan putsch. There might have been some minor incursions into Donbas, but even that‚Äôs disputable. So, this supposed ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù was mostly a myth spread by the post-Maidan Ukrainian regime and its Western handlers.	1642708517.0	hti2mi4	t3_s8c7jl	t1_hthldjm	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/hti2mi4/

f6avfqpv	>And Mitch mcconnel, joe Biden, Liz Cheney, most neoliberal democrats,  most neocon republicans  This is true. I think Hillary Clinton played a key part in getting most Democrats onboard the anti-Russia train. I remember when Mitt Romney ran against Obama IN 2012, Romney said "Russia is our top geopolitical enemy" (this was before anti-China hysteria also swept the nation following Trump and COVID). Romney was mocked as an out of touch old man who was stuck in the past when he made these remarks.   But after Hillary Clinton blamed her loss to the fat, idiotic Trump on a nefarious Kremlin plot rather than her inability to relate to working class voters and the limited appeal of her ultra-Type A personality, she managed to get most of the Democratic establishment to move towards Romney's position. It also helped that Romney became the face of anti-Trumpism within the Republican Party, which endeared him to Democrats.   Either way, Russophobia that was derided as a paranoid vestige of the Cold War by mainstream liberals not long ago has come back into fashion.   >even video game developers(Russians the only enemy ever)  I remember one of the first video games I played as a kid in the late 1990s was *Metal Gear Solid*. It was about a terrorist/mafia cell of Russians who infiltrate a military base to steal a nuclear weapon. For some reason even though the main bad guy had a British accent, all the normal enemies were Russian.   The only Hollywood movie I can recall that showed a positive portrayal of Russians was *Enemy at the Gates.* Even pieces of crap like the Angelina Jolie movie *Salt* (set when Russian-American relations were still relatively good) used the old stock character of the sexualized Russian female spy, who is revealed to be a Russian agent when the audience sees her (you guessed it) wearing a giant coassack hat.   Russian men are always depicted as stupid, joyless brutes (usually outsmarted by the American hero and also probably as alcoholics) and Russian women are always depicted as either rural babushka grandmas or spies or prostitutes. It's absurd.	1642708949.0	hti3sdi	t3_s8k5po	t1_hti0k4m	/r/russia/comments/s8k5po/years_ago_the_simpsons_poked_fun_about/hti3sdi/

6cg4g	Both my great-grandfathers I knew fought in the war.   One was an ardent communist and a decent sportsman, fought in the Finnish War, then volunteered in 1941. He was seriously wounded in 1944 and relegated to kitchen duty; still got a medal for delivering hot food to the tankers in a deep breakthrough.  The other was sent on a business trip to Belorussia in June 1941, only to find German motorcyclists entering the railway station as he arrived. He jumped on the last train to the East and went to enlist the moment he was back in Moscow. Served in horse recon, got several wounds and a serious concussion at the crossing of Dnepr (his horse knelt and waited until he regained his senses when he lost consciousness and had his neck caught in the reigns) and was moved to serve as a teacher in the Vystrel course.	1642705063.0	hthtay4	t3_s8ds5i	t3_s8ds5i	/r/russia/comments/s8ds5i/how_did_your_family_contribute_to_victory_in_the/hthtay4/

That shocked Europe which feared the loss of its identity and when the USSR took that to the next level and the US appeared on the scene with Europe, that age old battle went to the next level. Today it is the West that projects its own sins on Russia in a bid to make Russia in its own image. I predict that the West will eventually succeed and Russia will split between Asia and Europe.	1642705545.0	hthum3t	t3_s8dt3d	t3_s8dt3d	/r/russia/comments/s8dt3d/anyone_else_in_the_russian_diaspora_get_asked/hthum3t/

ccpxixhw	The Pacific Fleet's Volkhov Project 636.2 diesel submarine in the Sea of Japan launched a Kalibr cruise missile that hit a target 1,000 km away. To assess the strike precision, the explosive element was removed from the cruise missile so that it only hit the target with kinetic force. This capability also ensures that certain targets such as jets can be destroyed whilst minimising the collateral damage.	1642705888.0	hthviw9	t3_s8qc2g	t3_s8qc2g	/r/russia/comments/s8qc2g/project_6362_submarine_in_the_sea_of_japan/hthviw9/

p7h2ze	Especially for you, I will draw an analogy to make it very clear. Swabia=Belorussia, Bavaria=Ukraine, the rest of Germany=Russia. That is, it is a single people, with small regional differences. In 1991, Germany falls apart. Swabia and Bavaria become independent states. Bavarian nationalists seize power in Bavaria. They are gradually squeezing out a single German literary language. The Bavarian dialect is declared the sole official language. Rewriting history. The main motive is that the Bavarians are the right Germans. And the North Germans are a mixture of different peoples. Half German. Then in 2014 in Munich, the Americans and the British stage a Maidan, where an even more radical Nazi power comes. They generally forbid the German language even in cafes and shops. Translated all German schools and universities into Bavarian. During these 30 years, the Bavarian language itself has been artificially moving as far as possible from the unified German language by adding hundreds of new words, borrowings from the English language.    But northern Bavaria refuses to submit to the new Nazis in Munich. They take power in Nuremberg into their own hands. They say they are all Germans. They want to teach their children in their native German language. And not to divide the German people into different parts. Munich sends troops north and starts bombing Nuremberg and other cities. Northern Germany helps them with weapons and humanitarian aid. But she herself does not interfere in the conflict.

4rgna	Not really an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù per se. Russia already had military control of Crimea, thanks to an early 90s agreement with Ukraine. Not a single person died during the takeover, which was mandated by numerous referendums by the Crimean people who never really felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù in Ukraine, and really had enough of Ukrainian rule after the illegal Maidan putsch. There might have been some minor incursions into Donbas, but even that‚Äôs disputable. So, this supposed ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù was mostly a myth spread by the post-Maidan Ukrainian regime and its Western handlers.	1642708517.0	hti2mi4	t3_s8c7jl	t1_hthldjm	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/hti2mi4/

f6avfqpv	>And Mitch mcconnel, joe Biden, Liz Cheney, most neoliberal democrats,  most neocon republicans  This is true. I think Hillary Clinton played a key part in getting most Democrats onboard the anti-Russia train. I remember when Mitt Romney ran against Obama IN 2012, Romney said "Russia is our top geopolitical enemy" (this was before anti-China hysteria also swept the nation following Trump and COVID). Romney was mocked as an out of touch old man who was stuck in the past when he made these remarks.   But after Hillary Clinton blamed her loss to the fat, idiotic Trump on a nefarious Kremlin plot rather than her inability to relate to working class voters and the limited appeal of her ultra-Type A personality, she managed to get most of the Democratic establishment to move towards Romney's position. It also helped that Romney became the face of anti-Trumpism within the Republican Party, which endeared him to Democrats.   Either way, Russophobia that was derided as a paranoid vestige of the Cold War by mainstream liberals not long ago has come back into fashion.   >even video game developers(Russians the only enemy ever)  I remember one of the first video games I played as a kid in the late 1990s was *Metal Gear Solid*. It was about a terrorist/mafia cell of Russians who infiltrate a military base to steal a nuclear weapon. For some reason even though the main bad guy had a British accent, all the normal enemies were Russian.   The only Hollywood movie I can recall that showed a positive portrayal of Russians was *Enemy at the Gates.* Even pieces of crap like the Angelina Jolie movie *Salt* (set when Russian-American relations were still relatively good) used the old stock character of the sexualized Russian female spy, who is revealed to be a Russian agent when the audience sees her (you guessed it) wearing a giant coassack hat.   Russian men are always depicted as stupid, joyless brutes (usually outsmarted by the American hero and also probably as alcoholics) and Russian women are always depicted as either rural babushka grandmas or spies or prostitutes. It's absurd.	1642708949.0	hti3sdi	t3_s8k5po	t1_hti0k4m	/r/russia/comments/s8k5po/years_ago_the_simpsons_poked_fun_about/hti3sdi/

It's almost as if the govt realized that the market didn't fully correct after 08 and decided to tighten their belts (leading to their decision not to support the ruble during sanctions) in order to get govt accounts in order in case of a recession.

1645m7	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs would be fair to mention Caucasian accents since people from that region are typically non native speakers, they do learn Russian early, but they speak other languages at home and that‚Äôs what impacts the way they speak.  I believe OP is asking about native speakers and among them,  the language is pretty universal and most of the times we can‚Äôt say the difference, however if you  really pay attention and analyze you can spot subtle nuances; they are more obvious if a person is from a small town or a village. People from Ukraine or close to Ukrainian border often pronounce ‚Äúg‚Äù very softly and it sounds sort of like ‚Äúh‚Äù or ‚Äúhg‚ÄùAlso there are many words in Russian where it‚Äôs hard to say whether the word is spelled with an ‚Äúa‚Äù or an ‚Äúo‚Äù because we pronounce a sound that is kind of in between ( little kids have a hard time learning those in school) . For example, ‚Äúmilk‚Äù - Moloko. People from Moscow region tend to overpronounse ‚Äúa‚Äù in those words - ‚ÄúMalako‚Äù, while people from the north of the country - overpronounce ‚Äúo‚Äù. The rest of the country would pronounce the word in a way that if you don‚Äôt know how to spell it- you won‚Äôt guess wether it‚Äôs ‚Äúa‚Äù or ‚Äúo‚Äù .  But overall, as people are saying, most of the times if a person is not from a distant village, you have to really pay attention to notice those things.	1642715137.0	htijk36	t3_s8rs05	t3_s8rs05	/r/russia/comments/s8rs05/russian_accents/htijk36/

f6avfqpv	What do *I* personally think of China? It's a major world power that has narrow territorial disputes with neighboring state, which can all be resolved fairly easily through negotiation. It's also a country that is far from perfect, in my view, but which has amazingly lifted 1/7th of the world's population out of poverty in rapid fashion. And I think that China is understandably suspicious of America's geopolitical motives and fears that it might be next on the hit list. Above all, it's a country that I think we absolutely have to cooperate with in order to address climate change.   What does the American *government* think of China? The one thing Democrats and Republicans seem to be able to agree upon is that China is an evil, revisionist power that wants to spread un-freedom and authoritarianism all over the world, and that Taiwan isn't part of China. Neither party wants to get painted as "weak on China" by the opposition.   What do Americans *in general* think of China? Well, a lot of them have no gripe with Chinese people but blame the Chinese government for COVID, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and so forth. Most Americans also won't accept the idea of China displacing the United States as the world's dominant Super Power, and they tend to think that China is an aggressive, revisionist bully in geopolitics.	1642716878.0	htio8lp	t3_s8rujo	t1_htimgbf	/r/russia/comments/s8rujo/this_cartoon_was_recently_featured_in_a_prominent/htio8lp/

2t068aaa	I fully agree with the title of this post. I have never really considered Russia as an enemy country or as threat (I grew up in communist town, so even during the cold war I never had all the propaganda about the evil Russian), and I don't really realize why we are not a lot closer. I currently learn Russian, I am an old guy, I don't do it because I hope to earn money with my knowledge and not because I think of moving to Russia (I am too old to emigrate anywhere), but because I love the language and the culture. I see a lot of Russian people on youtube while learning and I certainly cannot start to see them as my enemies.   I really don't understand this desire to install OTAN bases as close as possible to Russia but I can imagine how the US would react if overnight Canada or Mexico decided to become friend with Russia and host Russian bases at the border with the US. They would certainly not take it with a big smile. Provoking Russia is a very bad idea and I really don't understand why it is done (maybe to distract the voters from the real problems that would actually need fixing) In my opinion, Europe should treat Russia as a friendly country we would all benefice from that.	1642718000.0	htiptx2	t3_s8kvnx	t3_s8kvnx	/r/russia/comments/s8kvnx/just_to_let_you_know_not_all_westerners_are/htiptx2/

nyr4w	One of the problems with the Russian economy is that it is mainly dependent on raw exports: oil, gas, coal, minerals, wood. Processing them and selling finished products rather than raw resources would be beneficial to the economy, but that requires actual effort. Selling raw oil or gas right now is much easier and brings in quick money ‚Äî enough for certain people to get rich, so they don't see much incentive in trying to create processing facilities. The government, unfortunately, mostly seems to agree and doesn't make enough effort to push the economy towards higher degree of product processing. This here seems like a step in the right direction. However, it would be even better if there were proper conditions to stimulate the growth of processing industries, rather than simple ban on exports. Making processed goods should be done because it's profitable and beneficial, not because it's literally the only option allowed.  There's a problem, though. If you want high quality goods that will be in demand in other countries, they will be expensive for Russians. So you'd have to build your business almost entirely export-oriented, and that can be a risky strategy with no guaranteed payoff. If you create goods for the domestic market, they will have to be somehow made cheaper, and this probably means lower quality. Unlike China, Russia doesn't have the nearly endless manpower you can use as cheap labour. Russians will actually want to get good wages if they are to work hard (and even then it's not a guarantee, lol). And higher wages translate to higher prices for the finished products. Dealing with this requires careful strategic planning and proper execution of that plan that would involve improvements throughout the entire economy at a roughly similar pace. And that's something that's not yet happening on a large scale. The economy is certainly improving since the 90s, but perhaps not fast enough.	1642722308.0	htizpys	t3_s8jbpd	t1_hthldi6	/r/russia/comments/s8jbpd/from_january_1_2022_the_export_of_unprocessed_or/htizpys/

635diibl	I think the specific character of the antisemitism that matures into Naziism arguably does have some roots in Russia - the PotEoZ were written by an Okhrana agent in involuntary collaboration with an English science fiction author, the Black Hundreds definitely prefigured what fascism later became, and you have groups like the [Aufbau Vereinigung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_Vereinigung) which were critical in spreading various antisemitic theories from Russia to Western Europe.   However, antisemitism as such has existed since the Middle Ages in all of Europe, if in significantly different forms, and if anything came late to Russia, so claiming that antisemitism in general originated in Russia is obviously absurd.	1642722358.0	htizu9l	t3_s8dt3d	t1_htgaj5w	/r/russia/comments/s8dt3d/anyone_else_in_the_russian_diaspora_get_asked/htizu9l/

hzsosi0z	One thing I've never understood about vaccine policy in western countries:  So the purported purpose of COVID-19 vaccination is to reduce the rate of hospitalization, right? And most clinically approved vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, AstraZenica, Sputnik V, etc.) have all shown to have a >95% effectiveness against hospitalization. J&J and AstraZenica have been removed from shelves so to speak by western countries because they supposedly have a tiny but present probability of causing severe side-effects in some people (even though Moderna and Pfizer are guilty on the same count, but let's just sweep that under the rug for a second). BUT, Moderna and Pfizer are the only two vaccines that require an initial TWO dosages and still then only last for a few months without boosters.  So riddle me this: if all of these vaccines have shown to be equally excellent at achieving their purported goal of reducing hospitalization, why are the two vaccines that require TWO vaccinations rather than ONE preferred? I find that very strange, that western countries would choose the vaccines that require twice the number of doses to have the samme effect as the other vaccines, it certainly doesn't make it any easier for them in the effort to get their population fully vaccinated. Admittedly there is research that suggest the overall efficacy of the mRNA vaccines are higher than their viral vector counterparts, however this research is spotty with the studies being performed in different countries and at different periods in the pandemic with different variants being dominant, so it can't really be constituted.  I find the seemingly baseless loyalty towards some vaccine manufacturers by several western governments to be... dubious.	1642730309.0	htjigqu	t3_s8x1yn	t3_s8x1yn	/r/russia/comments/s8x1yn/sputnik_v_shows_higher_omicronantibody_levels/htjigqu/

gxbhz	Gee, I wonder what happens to developing world countries that decide to not play ball with the west.  Oh yeah, they get sanctioned until their cities are polluted and rotting off the map or even worse they get their government decapitated.      The fact of the matter is that larger countries have a natural influence over the countries around them. And while this doesn't always mean cozy relations, it does mean that messing around in there by further-away countries is going to antagonize the larger country.       Same way that the USA has been brutalizing Cuba for 60 years for going their own way and allying with the USSR, Ukraine is similarly pissing off the Russians for trying to get in bed with Western Europe.     It's not to say that Russia deserves to have Ukraine (nor the US Cuba), but their response to try and secure Ukraine from falling into the political orbit of other countries is an entirely reasonable and predicable response.       If China were to start trying to draw Ireland into its orbit, you can bet the UK would put troops in Northern Ireland and start running special ops inside the country and possibly even try to foment a coup to install a UK friendly government.	1642730491.0	htjivnl	t3_s8vqoy	t1_htjg9z1	/r/russia/comments/s8vqoy/but_russia_is_attacking_us/htjivnl/

f6avfqpv	As an American I am constantly baffled at how little my fellow Americans seem to know or care about what a terribly stupid idea NATO expansion is. I am also sick and tired of paying for the defense spending of ungrateful freeriding European welfare states. I would rather use that money to help African American and Native American communities here in the United States rather than allow the French and the Italians to fund lavish welfare states full of ungrateful, bitchy baby boomers because they don't have to pay for their own defense spending.  The only sensible country in Europe seems to be Germany.      Also this nonsense about Sweden and Finland wanting to join NATO is bullshit.

7v4jm0hy	Russian troops captured the city in 1710 in the great northern war, officially control of the area was transferred from Sweden to Russia in 1721 with the treaty of Nystad. The area, which included the Viipuri and K√§kisalmi counties, with some additional land ceded by Sweden 1743 in the treaty of √Öbo after the Russo-Swedish war came to be known as "Old Finland" (–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞—è –§–∏–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥–∏—è).  Because the area was populated by Finnish people, it was incorporated to the autonomous Grand duchy of Finland in 1812 when Russia had conquered the rest of Finland from Sweden. When Finland declared independence in 1917, it became part of the independent Finnish state.  It became de facto Russian in 1940 after the Winter war, when the Finnish population of the Karelian isthmus and Ladoga Karelia was evacuated according to the Moscow peace treaty. Finnish troops retook the area in 1941, but were forced to cede it again in 1944, and Russian control was formalized with the 1947 Paris peace treaty. The area was left empty and settled with soviet people, as almost all of the Finns were evacuated from the area.	1643125007.0	hu5wgv9	t3_sc6wbb	t3_sc6wbb	/r/russia/comments/sc6wbb/vyborg_castle_built_in_1293_during_the_third/hu5wgv9/

ai28y	It would be like if Russia was a top 2 GDP country and began investing heavily in its relationship with Canada, till the point that Canada withdrew from trade agreements with USA and joined with russia, and then wanted russia to build up troops in canada. All while launching a media campaign to get a pro Russian PM.  If the US was a much poorer country with not as much economic might, the only way it had to prevent such a thing would be to basically say, "nope, if you go that route then we are going to invade." And it is sure as shit what the US would do.  &#x200B;  Everyone saying this doesnt make sense, russia is nuts, etc is misguided. Russia is acting logically. The real problem is that military threat is Russia's only option to use here, by their own doing, since Russia doesn't answer to its people and its economy shows just that. They dont care that their people are moving out of the country looking for better opportunities. They don't care that their is little investment in private and public sectors in the country. They don't care that they are slipping in standings with the rest of the developed world. If Russia did answer to its people then it would care about all of those things and business would get better, investment would get better, progress would get better, Russia would get better, and people would want to stay in Russia and move to Russia. Their economy would boom, they would attract great talent from all around the region. They would use opportunity as a means of barter with its bordering nations rather than threat of violence. If Russia was a great economic ally to have, then Ukraine would of course see no reason to break ties.	1643125336.0	hu5xbnu	t3_sc8ovx	t1_hu5kyo7	/r/russia/comments/sc8ovx/this_time_he_knocked_to_the_wrong_door/hu5xbnu/

Yet they are not representative of the entire country. They are just the most vocal.  There are people here who are opposed to war, but their representation is not as strong because of the disparity in campaign finance and corruption.  I can see why the Russians are upset. We were so upset over the Cuba Missile Crisis, but now we are doing the same thing to Russia and asking why there are bad feelings as if we do not know the precise cause.

f6avfqpv	\> People should be allowed to determine their own fate; if Ukrainians want to join Russia they should be able to. Any actions that America takes to prevent sovereign nations from making self-determined choices (made by the people, not autocrats) are counterproductive to maintaining peace.  If this is your chief ideological concern (and you're willing to sacrifice the lives of non-Ukrainians for it) then you should look into the other side of the story: what do the people who live *in Crimea* actually want? The majority of them want to join the Russian Federation and leave Ukraine, because a majority of them are ethnic Russians. This has been consistently burred in the Western media's coverage of the Ukrainian political situation. What's more, Russia has zero interest in annexing any territory inhabited by large majorities of Ukrainians because everyone in Russia knows that it would not only be unjust, but would also be incredibly costly since Russians would be seen as illegitimate occupiers. Russians have no interest in repeating this chapter of their history. They do have an interest in making sure that a hostile military alliance doesn't get parked at their doorstep.   >It has more to do with the irony of you defending an autocratic regime‚Äôs desire to invade Ukraine, which is motivated in part by the fact that they are striving to achieve a democratic form of government.  Which is not only quite misleading (the current crisis has its roots in a coup in 2014 which ousted a democratically elected pro-Russian President in Ukraine from power) but very inapposite to NATO. NATO is a military alliance, it's not a political institution. NATO had countries led by legitimate fascist dictators in the Iberian Penninsula in its ranks. NATO had France as a core member while it still had colonies in Algeria and Vietnam against the will of the people in those poor countries. It has nothing to do with democracy and everything to do with the military.   >Personally I think Assange shouldn‚Äôt be imprisoned, but that is beside the point because he is not an American political leader of any sort. Navalny is the only political opposition leader who could possibly pose a democratic challenge to Putin. His unjustified imprisonment (along with that of countless other political dissidents) is a clear and obvious sign that Putin desires nothing other than maintaining (and expanding) his autocracy.  Do you actually know anything about the charges against him? Likewise, do you know anything about how popular he actually is in Russia? Are you getting your information on Navalny from American media sources which basically reflect the views of the State Department? As with the other parts of the narrative you have provided, my friend, I have to tell you that there is very much another side to this story. If your argument is that "he shouldn't be in jail simply because he is embarrassing the state" then neither should Assange.   >The only sacred principle worth defending is that a sovereign democratic state should get to make its own decisions. And I‚Äôm aware that America has a history of violating that in the past and it is worth denouncing.  I don't agree at all, at least not to the extent that I'm willing to sacrifice the lives of Americans for the sake of a foreign state's sovereignty. It doesn't matter if that state is a democracy or a dictatorship. If the people of that state have a political grievance against their neighbor, they should deal with it themselves rather than asking for an insurance policy courtesy of Uncle Sam.   Likewise, it should be the prerogative of my sovereign state to say "you may want to dance with us but we don't want to dance with you, because you're more trouble than your worth." Freedom of association is not a one-way street. It involves the freedom to *dissociate* too.   >That‚Äôs not how treaties and not how NATO works. Should every single member nation of NATO (not just the American president) agree to switch to an ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù pact, then I would eagerly fight that every step of the way. But that would never happen; all European countries loathe the idea of another ground war.  You are betting on the assumption that NATO's intentions won't change. Russia will not accept this risk.   The divorce rate in the United States is 50%. Whenever anyone gets married, they assume their spouse harbors benign intentions. Half the time, it ends up that their spouse changes from Bambi to Atilla the Hun. Appeals to some idea of NATO's fundamental character or the character of the member-states are unavailing, because intentions can change over time. Thus, the best policy is to simply have a buffer zone of non-aligned states between the West and Russia.   >America has not broken any codified treaties that Russia has not broken first. A ‚Äúpromise‚Äù from a diplomat or politician is unfortunately worth nothing, just like most everything Putin says to and about the West is deliberate misinformation. Gorbachev should have demanded that those ‚Äúpromises‚Äù get ratified by NATO member states and the American legislature.  You may want a refresher on the law of promises, my friend.   I took a class in law school called "contracts." You know what a contract is? It's a promise. The first thing I learned: an agreement on certain and definite terms is enforceable against the party who makes it. The second thing I learned: a representative with apparent authority from a principle may bind the principle in contract.   That's a fancy way of saying that (i) an oral promise is just as valid as a written promise, and (ii) an individual who appears to have authority to negotiate on behalf of the United States (like the f\*\*\*ing Secretary of State) has the authority to bind the United States; and certainly, *that's how a foreign government will perceive it.*   Then again, the United States cannot be trust to honor its *written* promises with foreign states either. Remember the Iranian nuclear deal that Obama agreed to with Rouhani? That was in writing. Trump tore it up simply because he didn't like the terms of the deal. How can another foreign state trust our intentions when our policy is "the next President can break the promises of his predecessor?" Obviously, Russia will not take our word about our benign intentions. It will provide for its own security instead, just like we did when they were making buddies in our neck of the woods.	1643137830.0	hu6urxj	t3_s9pr4r	t1_hu6qbvq	/r/russia/comments/s9pr4r/ukrainian_crisis_megathread_selft_post_or/hu6urxj/

They gained both military support and economical development from joining EU.  All you just told me is "hey, Poland is doing well now." Great. I'm sure they love the EU, more power to them. That's different from NATO.   NATO, you prick, is what shitbird podunk countries in Eastern Europe use to tell me that I need to be prepared to fight their battles for them because I'm an American. NATO, in other words, is a series of freeriders who want me to give them an insurance policy. It's a bunch of fucking ingrates who might not run their mouths if they didn't think Uncle Sam was going to bail them out for biting off more than they can chew.   "That's beside the point" just assumes that the interests that you find most important are the only ones that matter.

zhfm19i	Yeah, I lived there for a few years and absolutely love American people and culture, but your government is a massive bully on the world stage who basically does everything they accuse foreign powers of doing.  Living outside the US now it‚Äôs just so sickening to watch it happen and then turn on the news and nothing.    When the US media talks about Russian oligarchs Americans need to learn that their media is intentionally keeping the focus off American oligarchs as an example.    I also get to watch my own government play puppet to the American government and do what they want instead of what the people want as if we‚Äôre some kind of western Belarus.  You seem open minded, so I‚Äôll run through an opposing perspective on some current events as an example.  With the current Ukraine focus at present I think the best way to explain the eastern perspective is as follows:  Imagine Puerto Rico, American citizens living in a territory and part of the greater populous but also not in ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù depending on your definition, on the other hand we have Ukraine, also Russian citizens, until 2012 they were a CIS member and had free movement within the CIS.    Our fictional example below should help.  2012 hits and china uses non-military pressure to gain and build infrastructure projects in PR using Chinese tech and labour, there‚Äôs some outcry  but not much as it‚Äôs just good business.  Chinese money continues to pour in and china starts backing a candidate for leader.   Once elected the state is shifted from the American sphere of influence to the Chinese one gradually. Parts of PR have breakaway groups who want to go back to being part of America.  International pressure mounts and the US steps in to chase out china and protects the American citizens living in Puerto Rico.  Replace the US with the Russia, China with the US and Puerto Rico with the Ukraine and your up to speed, while the Ukraine was not a Russian oblast (state) prior to 2012 it acted as a semi autonomous region much like the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.  Of course there‚Äôs tremendous internal pressure to protect the Russians in the Ukraine, to most Russians the Ukraine is just as much part of Russia as Kazan or Moscow and probably more Russia than st Petersburg .	1643142002.0	hu75xd0	t3_sbvr19	t1_hu5rd9p	/r/russia/comments/sbvr19/congratulations/hu75xd0/

f6avfqpv	As a Westerner I can tell you that the whole of American and British mainstream media are dead-set on depicting Putin as the new Hitler and a personalizing the conflict in terms of how people react to Putin as an individual rather than looking at him as someone who is representing Russia's national interests as Russia's head of state.   I saw the same thing happen with Erdogan when Turkey launched its military operation in Syria a few years ago. Everyone said "this guy wants to re-establish the Ottoman Empire" and never bothered to (a) listen to Turkey's explanation of its objectives \[which were very limited\] or (b) observe the fact that a huge majority of Turks including Erdogan's opponents supported the military operation in Syria. We confuse state interests with our reactions to personalities too quickly.	1643142608.0	hu77jjs	t3_s9pr4r	t1_hu75ijq	/r/russia/comments/s9pr4r/ukrainian_crisis_megathread_selft_post_or/hu77jjs/

f6avfqpv	We're both great powers who pursue interests within our geographic spheres of influence that advance our own security interests. Obviously, small countries within these regions don't want to be told what to do, but from the perspective of the big dogs, they don't care because what the little pups do can threaten the big dogs' security. It's really very similar.   Now, however, in the US I think we have moved onto supporting things like color revolutions instead of the kinds of things we used to do to Latin America in the 50s, or just deciding that we (rather than the UN) has the right to determine who the legitimate government of countries like Syria or Venezuela are.	1643142853.0	hu786z1	t3_s9pr4r	t1_hu77qsj	/r/russia/comments/s9pr4r/ukrainian_crisis_megathread_selft_post_or/hu786z1/

f6avfqpv	>Under Russia-installed government Ukraine got billions stolen from it in just last decade. I don't think this is defined as Russia wanting Ukraine to be "prosperous".  Every government steals from its people in order to keep political elites in power and reward its friends. I live in the United States, do you think mine is any different? Do you think my government has stolen natural resources from people all over the world? I know a couple of guys named Jacobo Arbenz and Mohammed Mossadegh who could tell you that the answer is a resounding "yes, they took issue with my people living on top of their oil."   Of course if you're a hardcore Ukrainian partisan, you'll never accept that Yanukovych was democratically elected. Likewise, in the US the Democrats will not accept that Trump's election was legitimate (hence the narrative about Putin putting him in power) nor will the Republicans accept that Biden is legitimate. This is just the way the game seems to work these days. People can't accept that their team lost the game fair and square.   The real issue isn't trade relations between Ukraine and the West.

7rkij41d	I think we're not on the same page for the point I'm trying to make. I apologize if I didn't convey my message very clearly. I'm not trying to state that those views I mentioned earlier are factual. I personally have no idea what is the actual truth. I, too, have contacts within Ukraine and Russia (though I admit probably way fewer than you do) and so I might have a little bit more of the picture than a typical Westerner, but my point isn't that the Western views are correct or that the Russian views are correct. It's that people's true perspectives often get lost in the myriad of hatred and disbelief.  I don't think there is anything I can say of the situation that will make you believe "my perception" because you see me lumped into that "Western influence", right? You inferred it yourself when you said "mythical country painted by western media." And conversely, it would be hard for me to accept anything that you claim in this because of "Russian bias", right? After all, I was formally in military intelligence here so there are things I know beyond the scope of a normal citizen. But it's also why I left that life behind. I got tired of leaders, on both sides, who refused to let the cold war end.  I grew up hearing one version, and you grew up hearing another version. I can see that and realize that my side may not be always truthful, can you at least acknowledge that may be the case for your side as well? That perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between? If everyone did that, then perhaps we could make actual steps to moving forward peacefully and putting aside the measuring sticks (you know, to see who's got the bigger tool üòÖ)	1643143908.0	hu7b11s	t3_s9pr4r	t1_hu6z0po	/r/russia/comments/s9pr4r/ukrainian_crisis_megathread_selft_post_or/hu7b11s/

3tr314my	Me, being from Poland, I'd rather if everyone calmed the fuck down. Actually, most of us Poles would probably love that   I know what I'm about to put here are just empty platitudes to many, but We're all slavic here in Central and eastern Europe. Our languages are similiar, we had similiar struggles. We're closer to each other mentally than the west or China will ever be. They don't understand us.  In my eyes, we're all brothers. We should stick together and use diplomatic means to solve our differences. Hell, invite Russia to NATO if it wants to join. Why the fuck not? Putin, even if he has antagonistic plans (because who the fuck really knows what's on his mind) towards the west, he won't live forever. Whatever our history was (fucked up, to say the least), we would be much better if we learnt from it and moved on. Everyone was a dick to another at some point. That's just how it was. We should be better than this.  The thing is: our post-soviet governments suck ass. Polish government always used Russia as a scapegoat, used everything what Soviets did against Poland to cover their shady business inside the country (and unfortunately, my Russian friends, it wasn't just saving our country from the nazis).   Putin and his team seems to do the same, painting us as a threat to Russia to push a narrarive, to gain popularity and create common enemy. But that's exactly what politicians do. It's a tactic old as the world.   But we as Polish people don't want to wage war with you, guys. But we sure are careful, because you're powerful.  And most importantly: there's far bigger threat to all of us: China. I know Putin sided with them, but in my opinion, he wasn't given any other option. US and the west basically forced him to Ally himself with China. And these cunts that currently run China, they don't care if whole world will burn. They want every little bit of power they can gain. Chinese people are already flooding Russian Siberia, aren't they? Do you really think they will just stop and live there in the frozen wasteland? No, they will move to more civilised places, to cities.   Chinese officials want to own us, economically and our societies. They want to overtake our businesses, to put shackles on our wrists and put us to work as a slave class. Just look what to they're doing to their own citizens. They don't see us as their equals.  If anything, we should stick together and stand against them and waste more time, fighting between ourselves.	1643147823.0	hu7lbls	t3_s9pr4r	t3_s9pr4r	/r/russia/comments/s9pr4r/ukrainian_crisis_megathread_selft_post_or/hu7lbls/
60bisqnk	Sputnik is the Russian covid-19 vaccine. Other worldwide options include pfizer, astrazeneca etc.   I ask because, depending on what you want to do in Moscow, a lot of places will only let you in if you are vaccinated with sputnik and have the required QR code you get when vaccinated.   This rule is enforced for restaurants, museums, cinemas, shops and anywhere else really. Some shops, cinemas and restaurants might accept a foreign vaccine and let you in anyway, but you can't bank on that all the time and anything state run like museums won't let you in.	1643148042.0	hu7lw08	t3_scb43j	t1_hu7l31q	/r/russia/comments/scb43j/getting_an_official_invitation/hu7lw08/

3q4ahodp	Thanks, i'll give it a read.     I would be lying if I said I wasn't particularly convinced that the word 'genocide' and the corroboration of accounts have as much legitimacy as I would like. But in saying that I also completely agree that 'our' only litmus test for 'truth' is western outlets and organisations that have been shown time and time again to be subverted by western imperial power.   And those things aside, with the very little I do know or could even begin to understand about Russia and Ukraine, I think there is a fair claim that the people of those regions deserve their autonomy. Even from a western perspective it is quite clear that there is harmful economic and social policy that disproportionately targets people in these reasons for morally irrelevant reasons.  If on the face of it, Russia are ready to defend the interests of their people who are surrounded by a government and populace that is incredible hostile to their wellbeing. And I think that is morally justifiable. If we treat like things alike, Russias position is heavenly compared to the fucking blood spilled in the name of US imperialism.     And as someone who was a former member of NATO and who helped America win the war in Afghanistan and bring peace, stability and prosperity to the country, I see a stark difference between that, Iraq, Panama, Iran, Cuba, Vietnam, Nicaragua etc. compared to the relatively bloodless transition of Crimea.	1643151028.0	hu7tbqg	t3_rc0c28	t1_hu7pau8	/r/russia/comments/rc0c28/question_from_a_non_russian_regarding/hu7tbqg/

The biggest difference I see here is that they attribute Russia as a government and Russian history to Russian people which is not always true (some or many people in Russia don't like Putin or corruption).

We all want peace and no war, no fighting, and to live happy lives. Our governments on the other hand are using fear and threats of war and sanctions to push whatever agenda they want.

Wang Yi pointed out that solving the Ukraine problem lies in the New Minsk Agreement \[Minsk II\] .

China will support any efforts that conform with Minsk II's direction and spirit. At the same time, we call on all sides to remain calm, and refrain from stoking tensions or sensationalizing crises. Wang Yi emphasized that the security of one country cannot be at the cost of another country's security. Regional security cannot be guaranteed by strengthening or expanding military groupings. In today's 21st Century, all sides should abandon Cold War thinking, reach a balanced, effective, and sustainable European security mechanism through dialogue, and Russia's legitimate security concerns should be respected and resolved.	1643309692.0	huh4aeq	t3_sdrlcz	t3_sdrlcz	/r/russia/comments/sdrlcz/sec_blinken_asked_chinas_advice_about_the_ukraine/huh4aeq/

31sn3	What's truly disappointing is to see that Russia is used as a tool for domestic politics in the United States, but given how our culture and news is smeared all over the planet like a toddler's feces it ends up having a global impact. Both major American political parties have boogeymen. For the Republicans it's black people and poor people and college kids with blue hair. For Democrats it's Republicans and Russians. Both sides whip their base up into a frenzy by hyping up the imaginary threat posed by "those people" in order to distract them from what's really going on right here in our own country. It's sad that Europe panders to the US so much and echoes all this nonsense. I'll be the last to say that I 100% support Putin and everything he's done domestically and internationally, but I certainly won't fault him for standing up for his country, and to watch the American news it's clear our leaders think he has some kind of audacity to stand up for his own interests (meanwhile we've got our hands up the assholes of half the governments on the planet).	1643309856.0	huh4qnz	t3_se22wi	t3_se22wi	/r/russia/comments/se22wi/he_is_absolutely_right_i_myself_have_repeatedly/huh4qnz/

I myself am not against a dictatorship as long as we continue to have rights   Generally speaking, the problem is not Russia itself nor the fact that it is a quasi-dictatorship in the traditional sense of the term (i.e. a man who is accountable to no one, a despot who can be enlightened or tyrannical): you can't deny that Putin is practically unaccountable to anyone.  No, the problem is the near absence of respect for human rights.

46hn73qd	My comment wasn‚Äôt meant to be a pissing match.  I detest my country (or rather it‚Äôs government and ideals) and wish that I hadn‚Äôt been born here.  The US federal government spends 10 times what your country does in a single year on its military, becoming a factor of over 100 each decade.  How is anyone supposed to compete with that?  The Russian Air Force is significantly smaller, doesn‚Äôt have the ability to project power from the ocean, and would run out of supplies after weeks of heavy intensity conflict.  I‚Äôm pretty sure this info is available from your own government.  How do you think Russian tanks would do against an endless stream of drones?  I‚Äôve heard the six drones that Turkey gave Ukraine have given ground forces in Eastern Ukraine quite the hard time.  The US has thousands of them.  As far as US cities burning down due to disorder (this was mostly a lie pushed by the media, I live in one of the cities that saw police cars burnt and large scale rioting/looting‚Ä¶just the poor areas got messed up and they‚Äôre already filled with open air drug dealing and violent crime) and honestly I think everyone would be so scared about an impending nuclear apocalypse, that this would be a fairly unifying war.  Even if it wasn‚Äôt, it wouldn‚Äôt last long regardless of who won and I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever looked up how many people the US throws into prison (a lot more than Russia or China‚Ä¶the real land of the freeüôÑ) but our government would have no real problem crushing dissent.  They‚Äôve done it many times before over far less.    Russia is better at going further with what they spend on their military.  It seems they‚Äôve developed a lot of technology and tactics to help circumvent the US/NATO advantage.  A small theater war is something Russia could definitely win if they achieved objectives quickly enough but Russia does not have the resources to fight a direct war for long.  This entire scenario is unrealistic anyway.  Russia and the US will never fight a direct war.  Either side would likely resort to their strategic nuclear arms as soon as they felt they were loosing, if not starting the war with them.  Russia definitely has the advantage there (mobile ICBMs with solid-fuel boosters that can fire on short notice) but probably not to the extent where both countries wouldn‚Äôt permanently cease to exist.  Let‚Äôs just hope it never gets there and we don‚Äôt have to find out who‚Äôs right, yeah?  I‚Äôve liked the large majority of Russian folks I‚Äôve known (lots of people from there and other Eastern European former Soviet Republics like Belarus and Ukraine around my area/neighborhood) and have probably spent more time reading about Russian/Soviet history than I have about my own.

j1t6ddqi	Whose point of view do you want to hear? Politicians? they're not here. Russians are already tired of making excuses, since no one hears them... the Russian writer Krylov has a fable "The Wolf and the Lamb": The strong always have the powerless to blame: We hear a lot of examples of this in History, But we don't write Stories; But about how they say in Fables. ___ A lamb on a hot day went to the stream to drink; And there must be trouble, That there was a hungry Wolf prowling around those places. He sees the lamb, he strives for prey; But, to give the case at least a legitimate look and sense, Shouts: "How dare you, impudent, with an unclean snout There's a clean muddy drink here Mine With sand and silt? For the audacity of such I'll rip your head off." - "When the Most Serene Wolf allows, Dare I tell you what's down the creek I drink a hundred paces from His Grace; And he pleases to be angry in vain: I can't stir up his drink in any way." " That's why I'm lying! Worthless! have you heard such audacity in the world! Yes, I remember that you are still in the warm summer He was rude to me here somehow: I haven't forgotten that, buddy!‚Äî- "Have mercy, I'm not even a year old yet," the Lamb says. "So it was your brother." - "I have no brothers." - "So this is kum il swat And, in a word, someone from your own family. You yourself, your dogs and your shepherds, You all want to hurt me And, if you can, you always harm me, But I will divorce you for their sins."- "Oh, what am I to blame for?"-"Be silent! I'm tired of listening, Leisure for me to sort out your guilt, puppy! It's your fault that I want to eat." - He said and dragged the Lamb into the dark forest.	1643313164.0	huhdrju	t3_se0hyn	t1_hugzn14	/r/russia/comments/se0hyn/has_this_sub_been_invaded_by_us_propaganda/huhdrju/

35ene1px	Maybe it is because we are simply fed up with being the default villains and scapegoats for the West. Considering our sacrifices made during WW2, and the onset of the Cold War shortly after (not a huge fan of the USSR's expansionist policies myself) the state of geopolitical affairs could have shifted dramatically after the fall of the regime in '92. But no, we had to continue being so at first a Black Friday Sale to the West during the dark 90's, and all was jolly then, being sold and quartered, and the minute Russia regains strength and autonomy on the world stage, Cold War 2.0 comes out. We're patriotic because we have many reasons to be than not to be. There are a thousand things to improve about our country. Corruption to be rooted out, infrastructure rebuilt, education revised, take better care of our public services etc. However I must say that we have come a long long way from an abysmal fall of an empire, to where we are now thirty years later.	1643313975.0	huhfz7w	t3_se22wi	t3_se22wi	/r/russia/comments/se22wi/he_is_absolutely_right_i_myself_have_repeatedly/huhfz7w/

4rgna	Every sane person supports the concept of justice, including social justice. However, the radical postmodernists behind the current Western world order have perverted the concept of ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù to the point of where it has a completely lost its original meaning, giving  it Orwellian undertones and sinister connotations associated with mass hysterias and witch hunts. They have also redefined most of the terms associated with it and use it as a ‚Äúdivide & conquer tactic‚Äù against the working class, distracting it from the real injustices perpetrated against it.   Radical feminism (toxic feminine supremacism) is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Making protected minorities out of sexual deviants is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Making violent career criminals (like Trayvon Floyd) into saintly martyrs, while demonizing brave police officers, is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Hiring practices that openly discriminate against white males via ‚Äúminority quotas‚Äù is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Teaching children to hate their own race (CRT) is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Punishing men for disciplining their children or practicing traditional husbandry with their wives, is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Re-defining the meaning of ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù to include things like spontaneous sex with your female partner and just looking at a woman with desire in your eyes, is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Redefining ‚Äúracism‚Äù to include things like listing open statistics on black crime, is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Using my taxpayer money to support welfare queens or for  ‚Äúhormone treatments‚Äù for jailed rapists is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Censoring or ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù (ruining) people for expressing opposing views is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Undermining traditional human values, which are based on millennia worth of collective thought and wisdom, for the sake of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Dehumanization, libel, silencing and warmongering directed at Russians, while screaming about ‚Äútolerance‚Äù, is NOT ‚Äújustice‚Äù!	1643315633.0	huhkgpb	t3_sd1plm	t1_hub084n	/r/russia/comments/sd1plm/wokeness_in_russia/huhkgpb/

c0nna1mt	What happened in Chechnya is very similar to what happened in Syria recently. Genocide of civilians, foreign fighters, Al-Qaeda, Islamic fundamentalism and other shit. Imagine this horror in the USA, for example in Texas. Do you think your government would not have brought in troops?   Georgia fired at our peacekeepers. What would the United States do if some country subjected a US military base to rocket and artillery fire? As for the annexation of Crimea, it was a provocation by you know who. On the one hand, we did not give up the military base, and on the other, we protected the civilian population. Compare with the horror that was staged in the DPR and LPR. Again, imagine that you have such a thing going on, for example, in Canada, where they suddenly decided to ban the English language and began to oppress everyone who has Anglo-Saxo roots. In fact, everything is more complicated than it seems. Maybe the decisions that Putin made are not the most beautiful, but other options would be much worse.	1643316433.0	huhmmbn	t3_se6xra	t1_huhexew	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/huhmmbn/

eb6hbwb	I lived in Russia before Putin. It was all mafia controlled. Murders were everywhere. It was pure unadulterated chaos. I was 14 and regularly bought vodka. I walked into a bar once, at 14, ordered a beer and watched a porno being shot on the pool tables across the room.  I went back in 2016 and there was a mandated liquor-sales limit at midnight. There were Ubers everywhere instead of having to flag down random cars for a ride. While being demonized by the West, Putin has done quite a lot to stabilize the country.	1643318352.0	huhrt6h	t3_se6xra	t3_se6xra	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/huhrt6h/

wt4n1	 I mean, what you have to understand is that most Americans on Reddit grew up in a post USSR world, and certainly a world long after the era where nationalism played a huge role in determining global affairs. America started to perpetuate this idea that we were the global arbiter of international norms (or in the words of Madeline Albright, we were the Indispensable Nation, on which the world depended). Believing that you‚Äôre Indispensable, and furthermore than you‚Äôre good and right, is a pretty powerful drug. It‚Äôs going to be difficult I think for many Americans to understand a world where national power once again becomes the arbiter in international politics.   That‚Äôs going to be something important to understand for other powers trying to navigate a rapidly shifting international landscape.	1643318763.0	huhsxkz	t3_se22wi	t1_huhqp0x	/r/russia/comments/se22wi/he_is_absolutely_right_i_myself_have_repeatedly/huhsxkz/

c0nna1mt	It was worse with Chechnya than you can imagine. Bandits were hiding on the territory of Chechnya, stealing people for ransom, they had real slavery. Regarding Crimea, the situation is not so primitive. In the Western media, everything is simple: dictator Putin has seized Crimea. Point. In fact, international politics is like a game of chess. In the case of Russia, a classic fork came out. Either Russia loses a warm port and a naval base, while the peaceful Russian population suffers greatly from the actions of the most natural fascists (nationalism, swastikas, torchlight processions, praising the SS troops, and so on) and receives a NATO base on its border. Either Russia seizes Crimea, saves people and the base, but falls under international sanctions. Both options are losers, but one is slightly better than the other. What would they do in the USA in this case? Who arranged all this? It was arranged by those to whom a strong Russia is not economically profitable. The fact is that in Yeltsin's time, immediately after the collapse of the USSR, the good Western countries began to quickly take away everything valuable from our country, pumped our oil, took minerals and took away specialists. I got my PhD in the late 90s and I had to work two jobs (\~200$) to feed my family. Putin fixed it and we love him for it.	1643320175.0	huhwqcy	t3_se6xra	t1_huhqa9o	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/huhwqcy/

wtelx	You really think that the NATO nations are interested in invading Russia? I will tell you that at least from an American perspective the last thing we want to do is get into a shooting war with Russia, much less try to invade and hold it. It would be a nightmare and cost way, way more than it's worth. We honestly don't even care much in general how you conduct your internal affairs.   But invading Ukraine does not go over well. Once you start expansionism it typically doesn't stop, and we had a deal with Ukraine to defend them from this exact scenario in exchange for them giving up their nuclear weapons to y'all.  Bottom line, stop fucking around and we'll leave you alone.	1643320926.0	huhyq1w	t3_se6xra	t1_huhsqyu	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/huhyq1w/

6x0lnpoj	I can see Putin's logic when it comes to geopolitical issues like Ukraine, Georgia, etc. Having lived in Russia in the early '90s, I can also appreciate that Putin has brought wealth and stability to Russia, and that Russians like that. As an American, I also know better than to blindly trust whatever agenda American media is pushing.  However, what I can't excuse Putin for is shutting down independent media and murdering journalists. That alone is enough to make me believe he's a dictator, regardless of how many dogs he pets.   I personally know several Russian people who worked as journalists and had their offices raided by Putin, were threatened and beaten by State forces, had to leave the country for their own safety, and had their friends and colleagues murdered. These people were not "tools of the West." These people were following the money and reporting on State corruption, and had their whole lives ruined.   If Putin is such a clean, upstanding leader who has Russia's best interests at heart, why does he shut down independent media? Why does he murder journalists? If he really has nothing to hide, he should have no problem with Russians reporting on their government.  And yes, I know the West is also corrupt. I know they also lie and cover up. But that is not the question I'm asking, here, so "the West does bad things, too" won't be a satisfying answer or absolve Putin from murdering multiple journalists and closing all independent media outlets.   I'd really like to hear an answer to my question that is not "well, America did a bad thing too." How can you believe that Putin is a good, honest leader when he murders the people asking him questions?  Thank you for your input. I hope we all have a safe and healthy year.	1643322154.0	hui1y2x	t3_se6xra	t3_se6xra	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/hui1y2x/

1u1fyj09	To be honest I don't like the way you bash your country so much, not very patriotic, not very American. Even visiting r/russia you shouldn't diminish your country just to fill in with the crowd, locals for the most part don't deserve it. Back to main topic. I think the main reason of our misunderstanding is the fact that you don't understand the way American MIC spending works very well. Eighty to ninety percent of this 700 something billions are going to maintain the current state of US military, for the most part, being the welfare program. Salaries, pensions, welfare social checks probably eating half of that sum, then there is the fact that US must maintain copious amounts of infrastructure around the globe. Ports, airfields, runways, bases, intel gathering stations and a lot more of other various facilities consume inglorious amounts of money. Is this money gonna help to maintain global presence of North American superpower, yes, does this in any way helps to conduct beachhead style landing in the hell of Russian Far East, no, not at all. After all, invasion of RFE is the topic we were discussing, not the power projection through ocean, in this category US is number One. At last, after we subtract the enormous corruption present in American MIC we finally got the sum of money for which an actual warfighting hardware is bought or modernised and core R&D is conducted, a fracture of aforementioned money. Now let's talk about Russian MIC, with budget in nominal USD around 65-75 bln it is around Saudis, Great Britain and India. Of course it looks, let's be clear, pathetic. Russia being around impotent UK that is incapable of maintaining and modernising its tiny fleet of Challengers without German help is laughable and yet we are here. What is creating this confusion is the fact that ruble is the most undervalued currency in the world and Russian MIC being 94-97% self sufficient. Russian steel, aluminum, titanium, engines, radars, weapons systems everything that is there, we produce on our own, yes, with ruble being like this cost of workforce is a fracture of what USA is paying to their people, nothing to be proud of, but that's the fact that must be taken in to the consideration when we discussing US trying to land in the RFE. Russia sold top notch SU-35 to China for 104 mln USD per plane in 2015 (cost includes maintenance and spare parts), but what SU-35 costs for our Air Force, probably, 1/10 of this cost or even less, you will find this pattern in all branches of military hardware easily. Now there comes speculation on my part, with the amount of hardware Russia is buying every year, with massive military infrastructure expansion going on and huge military drills I would speculate that Russian defense budget is around 200-280 bln with majority of this money being poured in to the purchase of equipment and R&D subtract the massive corruption in the MIC, of course. Russian and American militaries are very different in their core role. US must control and maintain global maritime trade with their humongous Navy, Russia must swiftly annihilate European militaries in the ground war, destroying infrastructure, industry and basic livelihood so much and without occupation that Euros pose no threat and Americans negotiate peace terms coming to conclusion that landing in Europe is not feasible. What is probably much more important than dick measuring contest is the fact that Russia is much more stable, homogeneous, jingoistic society than American one, with pain threshold ten times more minimum, USA on the other hand is very fractured, mostly by ethnic lines, society. And at last current American elites hates their core population probably more than they hate Ruskies. In conclusion US military is for the most part a welfare program for people of questionable ethnic background, with large appendage of US Navy doing its work of maintaining maritime trade routes and bullying shitholes into submission. Is they capable, as you say, easily replace anything they lose, absolutely not, working horses of US Navy Arleigh Burke-class takes four years from lying down to being commissioned, that's actually very impressive, but Russia can shave off tens of those ships in single salvo, rebuilding these would take decades. You saying that the Russian Air Force would be decimated and US planes would fly through Russian skies with impunity, I disagree on that too, yes, we have fewer planes, the Russian Air Forces were absolutely annihilated with collapse of the USSR, thousands of good planes was rotting and dying in the fields abandoned and betrayed by their nation. All of our current service fighters are 10-12 years old with some token exemptions, everything was build up from the scratch. But when it comes to SAM's there is no contest here, Russia is building up to 60-80 launchers yearly, with 560 already being online as for 2021 and those are only S-400 (top notch ones). It is too hard to count all the assets, but with modern estimations, and with capabilities being at least half of what MIC is shilling in their sources, for every capable american plane there would be 10-13 state-of-the-art missiles behind its tail, in my opinion is the opposite of flying with impunity.	1643322327.0	hui2ei3	t3_sctg10	t1_huhdk1i	/r/russia/comments/sctg10/what_do_you_think_will_kill_them_first_siberian/hui2ei3/

z5w2	Totally agree. I was apolitical 10 years ago. I even dreamed to move to the US. But after I have started to read English freely on Reddit I became radical patriot.  And more important I started to to be more proud of my country. Now I love and respect Russia more than ever, thanks to US and western dumb propaganda.  For the past 4 years I am working in EU, and my eyes were opened how western propaganda could be much worse than Russian media.  I am thinking to move back to Moscow, because almost everything is better there back home. One downside is inflation and unstable Russian ruble. But everything else is much much better: smart people, deep culture, great social services, free healthcare, cheap taxes, cheap cost of living, very easy to live if you have education and profession.	1643322389.0	hui2kdy	t3_se22wi	t3_se22wi	/r/russia/comments/se22wi/he_is_absolutely_right_i_myself_have_repeatedly/hui2kdy/

Nobody threatens US due to its geography, the whole NATO idea is about offensive.

5zdwwjck	Yes, I think US is interested in invading Russia. There is no other reason for US to keep building based in Europe after the fall of Soviet Union. This also explains why Russia was denied NATO membership.  US economy is built on the principle of endless expansion and ginormous US military only exists to support this expansion. Nobody threatens US due to its geography, the whole NATO idea is about offensive.  US needs Russia‚Äôs natural resources and land access to China because China will be next.	1643322908.0	hui3wrb	t3_se6xra	t1_huhyq1w	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/hui3wrb/

Russia is on 150th (of 179 countries) place in the [rsf.org](https://rsf.org) Press free index. He has zero real opponents politically. He has total power and total control of media.

wtelx	Well, I can tell you that here in America no average citizen has any interest is taking over Russia. We have plenty of our own oil, we don't need yours  If we had interest in territorial expansion we have a funny way of showing it as we haven't added any territory to our nation since we bought Alaska. We absolutely want to expand our economy, but that's much better done getting the world to buy our products and use our services, which we do a great job of.   Seriously, no American I've ever met has even thought about invading Russia. We have no interest in it. We just want to contain you guys so that you don't try to eat up all of Europe.

Pockets of locals who did what the Nazis wanted them to do did so as slaves at gun point, not out of their eagerness to follow a foreign dictator.

How about they stop using concentration camps, bullying everyone, stripping their citizens of rights with no cause, and being a general menace to the world as a whole.

ifqbq	It's not clear that China will use its aircraft carriers the same way that the US does. Aircraft carriers can certainly be used for power projection, if you pack them with strike aircraft. That doesn't mean that this is the role that the PLAN intends for their next generation carriers.  China may very pack their carriers with long range reconnaissance aircraft instead and leave the strike role to long range hypersonic missiles.	1643325550.0	huiaklg	t3_sdvhcx	t1_huhrere	/r/russia/comments/sdvhcx/look_at_all_theserussian_military_bases_menacing/huiaklg/

1oxwnd9	*The Atlantic's* editors were just trying to sell magazines.  In 2001 Russia was the largest country in the world by land area, with a highly educated population, lots of world class infrastructure in many areas, and was still the world leader in certain technologies.  Yes, it was in a bad situation.  It was hardly finished though, because it had uncountable strengths and NATO and the US were not trying to destroy it - not at all.     In fact, the US government provided at least [$28 billion dollars](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/RL32866.pdf) in aid to the states of the former USSR between 1992 and 2007, with Russia receiving the lion's share of that aid.  Much of this was in the form of food aid which prevented famines in 1993 and 1999.  In addition to that there were billions more in aid from a slew of private American charities.  [Here is an English language article from a Russian university](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1117290.pdf) discussing the aid.    One small part of this aid, Operation Provide Hope,  is memorialized in a [United States Air Force Museum.](https://amcmuseum.org/history/provide-hope/)  The operation, *...transported 2,274 tons of food and medical supplies to 24 cities in 10 former Soviet republics.*   The goal of all this aid was to create a stable, non-aggressive Russia, so that the deep military cuts during the same period could remain permanent.  In the US the money saved from these military cuts was called the "Peace Dividend."   9/11 killed the Peace Dividend, but US government aid to Russia did not end until 2012.     Some people will argue that the primary purpose of this aid was geopolitical, and, it probably was, but it was also humanitarian.   Most smart Americans knew Russia would eventually bounce back, but hoped that when it did it would focus on developing its vast untapped resources instead of worrying about foreign policy issues.    That didn't happen either.  In part, this was because the western Cold Warriors did push NATO east.  That probably was dumb, but it was done at the urging of the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs.  It also was done with the certainty that Russia would understand these moves were defensive, and that was borderline idiotic on the part of these hawks.	1643326886.0	huidu72	t3_se99f3	t3_se99f3	/r/russia/comments/se99f3/this_2001_cover_didnt_age_well/huidu72/

However there was attempts to establish a US military base, first during president Ben Ali era, but he refused ( see his meeting with Condoleezza Rice and the tension it created), he got overthrown under the sugarcoating of arab spring , then they brought in pro-western islamist ,and  they accepted to establish US military base, However Algeria (russia No 1 partner in north africa and probably whole of africa)  intervened  and it was posponed, and now there is another "coup" which is  algerian backed ,      coup between ""  because the president dissolved the parlement and said all power in my hands, so more of a shift of power , which is good to some extent ,cause almost all  the legislators in the parlement were on the pay roll of  some US institutes like the NDI  ( the  National Democratic Institute) , so the get paid to pass in action the laws dictated by the corporate america, like for example one week before the coup , parlement members were to pass a law permitting foreigners to exploit water  points and groundwaters in Tunisia,  you will see Nestl√© jump in Tunisia in 5 min,  luckily the "coup" happened	1643327462.0	huif83s	t3_se5itu	t3_se5itu	/r/russia/comments/se5itu/countries_with_us_military_bases_and_facilities/huif83s/

ufeaf	As an American I must say that "all" isn't true, but it is broadly very bad. Unfortunately you're exactly right about being misinformed, though the refusal to educate themselves is not limited to Russia. Being uncultured became popular some decades ago so brains have widely rotted.   I feel like the main root of the problem is that Russia was used as a bogeyman for the elite to fear-control the rest of us for a century. Lies were encouraged and the Russian people dehumanized. That's extremely hard to undo...especially since they keep doing it!  For what it's worth I haven't spoken to anyone that wants war. And while ignorant, most people in real life don't hate Russia, and if they do they're trash that hates everyone not like themselves anyway.  Sorry for rambling, I have been fascinated by Russia for a long time and the state of the world makes me very sad.

The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists have the doomsday clock at 100 second to midnight. The US has been developing "low yield" targetable nuclear weapons and the US military increasingly discusses a "limited" nuclear exchange. This is obviously a ridiculous concept, but it is disturbingly prevalent.  An additional element that adds risk is that during even a limited conflict false signals indicative of a nuclear attack are much more likely to be met with a presumed counterstrike.	1643331890.0	huiptf4	t3_sdql2j	t1_huintsa	/r/russia/comments/sdql2j/this_is_basically_propaganda_at_this_point/huiptf4/

ifqbq	>Long Range reconnaissance aircraft? This is not WW2.  You might want to check out what weapons platforms China is actually developing. Long range reconnaissance aircraft is definitely part of the package.  Satellites are not survivable in a modern war. They can be taken out with missiles or lasers. Their trajectories are too predictable. Attritionable long range recon drones will likely be a major component of future navies. Whoever sees first shoots first.  Modern hypersonic missiles outrange carrier based strike aircraft. Unarmed recon drones will outrange strike aircraft since they don't have to carry weapons. A carrier doctrine centered on carrier borne strike aircraft have a range problem when confronting a strike group consisting of carrier borne recon drones + destroyer launched hypersonic weapons.	1643331981.0	huiq180	t3_sdvhcx	t1_huidbp0	/r/russia/comments/sdvhcx/look_at_all_theserussian_military_bases_menacing/huiq180/

Literally all it takes is some panicked false message about ICBMs incoming and missiles are set to be launched in response in 5 minutes or less.	1643336310.0	huj05oa	t3_sdql2j	t1_huisjbt	/r/russia/comments/sdql2j/this_is_basically_propaganda_at_this_point/huj05oa/

Trump was going off the rails & Biden is a complete incompetent idiot that has now brought nothing but absolute ruin to my country & been an embarrassment to us all world wide.  American politics are dominated my large corporations both civilian & military. It all comes down to the "mighty dollar".   There are very few "honest" politician's that get elected to office that have the interests of their constituents at heart. Unfortunately what they try to do for America is soon overshadowed by the politicians that are bought & paid for.	1643336313.0	huj05xe	t3_sedlz8	t1_huixfyz	/r/russia/comments/sedlz8/im_an_american_so_lets_talk/huj05xe/

12mplnhi	I‚Äôm not the original poster, but I am an American, and as you probably know we can‚Äôt resist an opportunity to talk about ourselves.  First of all, I‚Äôd like to thank you for your kind views on Americans. I know we can come across as stupid to the world, and I know most people don‚Äôt believe that, but it can be very easy to buy into stereotypes (like ours of the vodka-drinking, angry, strong Russian, though that‚Äôs certainly a more positive stereotype).  The BLM movement is definitely propped up by some who hold power, wealth, and influence, who want to empower the movement for better or for worse. These are individuals, so it‚Äôs hard to generalize their feelings and personal ambitions on the movement, but I have to imagine there are a few who have malicious intent. However, it‚Äôs also a fairly legitimate movement, though very complicated. It‚Äôs understandable to be frustrated as a black person in America. You‚Äôre constantly told not to resist and cooperate with police, yet you constantly see the results of cooperation, which can far too often end in death. These are isolated cases, but no amount of isolation could remove the fear and anger that they instill in the minds of black Americans who witness them. So while the majority of Americans disapprove of the destruction caused by it, it‚Äôs hard to blame them for being upset when peaceful action hasn‚Äôt seemed to lead to any major change.  In terms of Trump, it‚Äôs probably a more contentious topic. Personally, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as dumb as the left-wing media characterized him. George W. Bush was fairly dumb, for lack of a better word. He looked like a fool numerous times, despite being from one of the most politically powerful families in the country. Trump, on the other hand, came from a real estate and celebrity background, who really made his career by simply being an image of luxury. Somehow, he used his wit and sense of human emotion to leverage that into being the President of one of the most powerful nations on Earth, despite running against a former Secretary of State. He won over working class voters despite having a golden toilet, for Christ‚Äôs sake. I can‚Äôt imagine he‚Äôs dumb, but I could be wrong.  Apologies to the original poster for responding before he could get a chance to, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself, given the need for communication in these current tensions.	1643341469.0	hujbv8w	t3_sedlz8	t1_huj2n3h	/r/russia/comments/sedlz8/im_an_american_so_lets_talk/hujbv8w/
8bc3xmei	The difference between the Russia and Ukraine subs says it all really.  I posted the exact same thing in each sub, a simple expression of appreciation for both peoples and a wish for peace.  I was downvoted in the Ukraine sub and upvoted here.  Biden is going to get pummeled in the midterm elections and the average American is really upset over inflation. The Fed is in a corner and can not raise rates. Another senseless war where millions of Europeans kill each other would be just what they want so Biden can be a wartime President and they can keep printing trillions of dollars we do not have.  A war would only result in the rich getting richer from the catastrophic loss of human capital.  There are Americans who are very much aware of the constant russophobic propaganda and see it for what it is.  We almost went nuclear over the Cuba Missile Crisis and now we are doing the same thing to Russia and pretending we do not understand why you are upset.  It is madness and stupidity!	1643341529.0	hujbzzi	t3_sdql2j	t3_sdql2j	/r/russia/comments/sdql2j/this_is_basically_propaganda_at_this_point/hujbzzi/

12mplnhi	I already commented, so I‚Äôll try to keep it short.  Our involvement in foreign affairs has set in a domino effect over 100 years old, at this point. On one hand, we might just need to suffer the consequences of ending our term of World Police and try and mind our own business, in the hope it leads to prosperity for us and others.  On the other hand, as a nation defined by it‚Äôs diversity of populations, many of us feel the need to protect the nations of our ancestors because of the power bestowed on us, though I don‚Äôt think we consciously realize that.   It‚Äôs a complicated issue that none of us really have the answer to, but I think the general view is that we made a mess that we should clean up, and cleaning up that mess creates another, and so on. I anticipate that any way in Ukraine would result in the same kind of mess later on.	1643341937.0	hujcvsa	t3_sedlz8	t1_hujaz91	/r/russia/comments/sedlz8/im_an_american_so_lets_talk/hujcvsa/

Since you mentioned your age, I will ask this: at almost 70, do you feel like your country was better set off in the past? People were happier, food was better, crime rate lower and life quality higher in general? Asking out of curiosity because I'm Russia we have quite a large amount of population stating that life in Soviet Union was the best time they've ever experienced: even though not everyone could buy variety of food and shelves were not always stocked, quality was better. They said that jobs were plentiful, education used to have higher standards etc.  I personally tend to think that it might be misleading feeling of their young years and some kind of nostalgia, plus, not many could adapt after Union collapsed.	1643342559.0	huje7vq	t3_sedlz8	t3_sedlz8	/r/russia/comments/sedlz8/im_an_american_so_lets_talk/huje7vq/

Also as far as encroachment what do you call Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and East Turkmenistan?

27znjxl8	1. It‚Äôs like momma birds kicking the baby birds out of the nest. They need to learn to be independent   But to be fair, a lot of young people seek out that independence - from mom and dads rules so then venture out on their own. So they can take lots of selfies and brag about it to their friends   2. Older parents are placed in homes because few households are multi generational. Meaning, that the parent/s live with only one of their child instead of several of their children.   So the burden is then on the one child and their spouse to care for the parent/s. And if both the child and the spouse work, and if the parent needs more attention (like Alzheimer‚Äôs) than just a roof over their head, then it‚Äôs best they be placed where someone can watch over them for their safety  I come from a multigenerational household and because there were many of us, there wasn‚Äôt an issue in having someone look after the elderly because the burden is shared amongst many of us children	1643342851.0	hujetgf	t3_sedlz8	t1_huj2be0	/r/russia/comments/sedlz8/im_an_american_so_lets_talk/hujetgf/

Providing it doesn't end the world in all out nuke attack, it will probably break up in the next decades.    I feel the West is baiting them to invade Ukraine just to accelerate that process.  Also, when Putin goes, that country will tear itself appart like it always has   If Russia had no nukes, nobody would care about that economic midget which has a smaller GDP tham Canada.    Can you imagine if Spain or Canada started acting like superpowers üòÖüòÖüòÖ  (I am canadian btw)    In that regard, Russia is just a bigger version of North Korea.  An irrelevant country that acts up because it has it has nukes.     Look at Russia's GDP over the years, it dropped and has been stagnating since 2014.    If Russia behaved normally and focused on its shitty standard of living, highly corrupt institutions and outdated politics, it might have slowly (over decades) turned into a major player and ally itself with the West.  Instead, it chose to isolate itself and all of that is because their dictator wants to shift the blame on external forces when he is the actual problem.  Russians turn their back on their western  roots and act like an uncivilsed wasteland...let them üëãüëãüëã	1643343236.0	hujfm7w	t3_se99f3	t3_se99f3	/r/russia/comments/se99f3/this_2001_cover_didnt_age_well/hujfm7w/

I think the answer is obvious  On another hand, if we take the "Communist state" as the same way as communist party which means "Trying to achieve" then we have a different talk. But it not really matter since american left is a weird bunch, too preoccupied with purity of things. They have a lot to say about socialist projects across the world, from Soviet Union to China and DPRK, but thats the point - to say, not actually do something at best or, at worst, outright support their own government in the struggle against so called "authoritarian dictatorships"	1643343307.0	hujfrjg	t3_sea9q0	t3_sea9q0	/r/russia/comments/sea9q0/more_and_more_young_people_in_the_us_believe/hujfrjg/
1oxwnd9	Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  There is a mountain of evidence to back this statement up.  Google "Peace Dividend" Bush Clinton.  But here is a 1993 article from the [NYTimes that explains the basics for the first year of huge cuts](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/04/us/clinton-seeking-14-billion-cut-by-the-military.html).   Or check out this [chart of US military spending as a percentage of GDP.](https://imgur.com/a/5U8ZryO)   If you want you can follow the link below the image into a long report on US military spending.    This was the goal of the United States.  It was seen as by far the most important result of the end of the Cold War.  This was hundreds of billions, eventually trillions of dollars, that could be spent on health, education, and tax cuts.    But also the US went through a change of administration when George H.W. Bush lost.  The Clinton Administration had a new agenda and it was pushed into more of an aggressive stance by a Czech emigre, Madeline Albright, who served as Secretary of State and a strong American-Polish lobby.    This constantly happens in American foreign policy.  It is very rare for one American party to hold power for more than eight years, which is not a long time in foreign policy.    Also, there was enormous frustration with the corruption, which for some reason, the Harvard Boys who led the US efforts to help the Russian economy never saw coming.  If Americans deserves blame for the Russian disaster of the 1990s it was the free market economists who had no idea of the real world.    I have spent some time in Russia and worked with a lot of Russians.  I really enjoyed my time in the country.  I believe it has an enormously bright future if it can quit living in the past.  And as far as Russian criticism of the US, most of it misses the point historically.  After the death of Stalin, during the 1950s the US deserves gigantic blame for not reaching out more to the Soviets who really did want better relations.  But nearly all American leaders blamed the Soviet system, not Stalin, so they were incredibly belligerent towards the USSR during that period.    The US Air Force overflew the USSR at will from 1950 to 1957 or so. (I am too lazy to look it up.)  Sometimes they purposely tried to make it look like we were attacking, and usually they did this without ever telling the President.   This and the complete inability to imagine that the Soviets wanted better relations - not an end of communism but more normal relations - ended up reigniting the Cold War after 1965.    I could go on and on.  Neither country really understands one another.  The Soviet losses in World War II simply are beyond American imagination and Russians don't realize Americans actually believe they are the most humane, compassionate people on earth.    The US often stumbles into dumb policies overseas that are not in the country's best interest.  For instance, pushing South Africa to end apartheid made zero sense from an economic or strategic sense, but the US did it.  It sent huge amounts of food to the USSR in 1920-1921.    It would have sent more if Lenin had allowed it, although this greatly strengthened the young USSR.  It was crazy from a Machiavellian stand point and so was much of the US aid to the USSR during World War II which was in much greater amount and lasted far longer than was in the America's national interest.  (This is the most debatable point in this little essay, but there were many people at the time who thought FDR had lost his mind in 1944.)     But then the US right wingers, scared of communism and unwilling to see shades of grey will win the next election and put in brutal political realists like Kissinger.  Then we made alliances and supported all sorts of bad players who claimed to oppose the USSR.  Nearly all of the really bad stuff the US has done in opposition to Russia or the USSR was done in Third World countries.    To Russians it might even appear we fooled them, but there is a deep disagreement in the United States about whether the US is supposed to be generous or hard in foreign policy.  It is a little nuts in a way that nearly no one in the rest of the world fully grasps.    Anti-war sentiment - pure pacifism runs deep.  One Congresswoman voted against going to war with Japan after Pearl Harbor and by [November 2001 only 71%](https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-war-afghanistan-twenty-years-public-opinion-then-and-now) of Americans supported launching a large scale attack on Afghanistan in retaliation for 9/11.  Support for the war in Iraq in [2003 fluctuated between 52% and 59%,](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rally-round-the-flag-opinion-in-the-united-states-before-and-after-the-iraq-war/) and this weak public support led to a series of idiotic strategic moves on the part of the Bush Administration during the planning for the war.    I am sorry this rambled on.  But when I was younger I was an academic.  :(  I see lots of shades of grey in most issues and I do really like Russia.  I believe a war would be a disaster for Russia and the world.	1643343365.0	hujfvvi	t3_se99f3	t1_huil2if	/r/russia/comments/se99f3/this_2001_cover_didnt_age_well/hujfvvi/

Both of our nations essentially worked their own vision of what they could achieve into existence, so it‚Äôs not surprising that you feel at home here more so than anywhere else, besides Russia.

ml526	It might not be a democracy in the real sense, but it's ok for now. There is a common stereotype that democracy leads to people's prosperity. I think the opposite:  that the people's prosperity leads to (actual) democracy. Giving poor, frustrated people in an undeveloped country democratic institutions is pretty useless at best, actively harmful at worst as it gives populists a huge advantage. Not because people are stupid etc, this just how the system functions. Most modern western democracies were developed from either dictatorships or monarchies (dictatorships with bling). So I think Putin is an ok option for now, and hope that after Putin, Russia would be closer to real democracy.	1643344057.0	hujhb7k	t3_se6xra	t1_huioo0d	/r/russia/comments/se6xra/is_putin_grossly_mischaracterized_by_the_western/hujhb7k/

hcqspi2x	Coming from an American who has only a limited understanding of the circumstances, it really does appear like NATO has been pressing Russia for decades now.   For good reason, yes, wouldn't trust ex-KGB agent at all, USSR and US almost went to a full blown war, Russian political opposition disappearing/dying, Crimean Peninsula events, etc.  But, Putin/Russia bring up a good point that the US and NATO have been putting military installations up left and right well within striking distance of Moscow. The reason is for defense/interest of freedom... but we all know those installations can be equipped with offensive capabilities rather quickly. If another country wanted to do this to the US, there would be an immediate war in the name of national security and protecting the interest of free people.  Believe it or not,  Moscow is legit 1000km from Ukraine border, meaning if needed US and NATO forces really needed to, there is a good chance they could make it to the capital.	1643813222.0	hva4t6u	t3_sio7zt	t3_sio7zt	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hva4t6u/

However, there is a country who killed Uyghurs in Afghanistan that says otherwise, we can't ignore its opinion, it's against freedom of speech.  If you say you can prove that something isn't happening, prove to me that there is no teapot orbiting Earth. Moreover, facts are for authoritarian commies, freedom of speech is all about opinion, personality.

qtb0i	Ok, I've read it in its entirety.  Putin at no point says that Ukraine should be part of Russia.  His points are that:  - the very concept of Ukraine as a country, is rather novel and the birth of the country post ww1 was driven by western powers seeking for a buffer that would counterbalance the newly formed Polish state and the Soviet Russia. He provides a quite detailed explanation behind his points with sources and events.  It's hard to deny much of this point, afterall Ukraine never existed before 1918, differently from countries that were born just 50 years earlier  (like Germany or Italy that completed their reunification process in late 1800s) and had centuries or millenia of a concept of their nation.  - He says that Russia was robbed of territories and he makes quite clear examples: (Crimea, Bessarabia, Galicia, Carpathia, South Eastern Ukraine and some more) that have been incorporated into newly formed Ukrainian state, thanks to the soviets, not "in spite of". He clearly says that Russia was "robbed" because it lost historically Russian territory (pointing to the east and crimea) in a time where Bolsheviks didn't care about internal borders of the soviet union, and he points at how some of these events were even unlawful (like the 1954 gift of Crimea) under soviet law.  While I don't hide the idea that Russia has always had imperialistic ambitions and always considered itself sort of a protector of all slavs, I don't think that many of his points are invalid. Both Yugoslavia and USSR redefined borders at a time of unity, once this unity felt people simply found themselves in "foreign" countries. People bring Georgia up all of the time, but they never ask Abkhazians or Ossetians how do they feel about being Georgians because Stalin decided so 70 years ago.	1643815064.0	hva9e7g	t3_sio7zt	t1_hva7ebw	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hva9e7g/

16v68u	>But why don‚Äôt more people talk about the 10-20 million Slavic civilians that died in WW2?  They do, in the black book of communism as victims of Leninism and totally (TOTALLY) not the victims of those poorly misunderstood champions of european civilisation fighting a brutal war against communism and international Jewery, the dudes that draped their flags in questionable symbols and goos stepped their way into eastern Europe only did so for defensive purposes civilising purposes. ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì /s  Of course I'm over exaggerating a bit, but when the nazis marched east, the would be powers of the world felt a weird understanding and kinship with the nazis and the fascists in Italy. They allowed the Italians to spread their colonial sphere because well, the Brits and the French had colonial holdings too, no biggy. Although the mass genocide of peoples and groups was off putting (because the nazis industrialised the act of killing people), they probably wouldn't be opposed to a nazi colonial sphere in the east.  It's why they had a defensive treaty with italy against the Germans and the Brits criscrossed into developing a naval pact with the Nazis as a counterweight to the Soviets in order to clamp down on growing socialist elements during the interwar period.  After the war, Stalin and the communists really wanted to develop a new multi polar world order where the Soviets would be accepted into the global market economy, not to dissimilar to what the chinese had done by being accepting into the WTO or orgs so they can trade freely with Europe and the US.  It's why Stalin refused to arm the greek revolutionaries in the hope that he could salvage relations with the west. Stalin was pragmatic like that if it meant that the USSR wouldn't be isolated as well as getting much needed support in the reconstruction effort, something the soviets needed and the Soviets would help with in Europe.   The United States wasn't interested in such a relationship and pursued its hegemonic interests by inserting itself into Europe.  Then began the dehuminisation of the Soviets/Russians for the American audience. The soviets was this alien other, uncivilized barbarians in the east. Starship Troopers was an American fiction that centred around this ideology. People call the the book a fascist allegory written by a staunch militarist  and enlightened anti communist, Robert A. Heinlein.  I would argue the opposite because the Arachnids and this alien force was an allegory to the Soviets and the liberal struggle against communism. It's an insightful book, looking at the murmurings of anti socialists in popular western culture at the time.  This led to liberals co-opting nazi era talking points about the soviets and in general, slavs.  This lead to a perverse interpretation of Russian culture and in general Russians as well. It's a form of racism that seeps into our media narrative here in the west. They write about African countries in a similar way as well. China gets the whole shebang.  The other reason that isn't so insidious as the one I brought up is the fact that the eastern front was so detached from the western experience. One can call it it a separate conflict altogether and it kind of was.  Anti communism in the west was so potent that they would subscribe to nazi talking points as a form of ideological defence against communism.

hg49scms	I mean it‚Äôd be great if the world could just move past pretending like any western country should have any genuine interest in invading another of its neighbors ever again. I don‚Äôt really understand Russia‚Äôs concern over Ukraine and NATO, *at least* with respect to the understanding that there really isn‚Äôt any world on which the US or NATO members have any interest in threatening Russia‚Äôs territorial integrity.  It genuinely confuses me why Russia and the West still insist on being enemies. Seems like it‚Äôs purely habit and Putin‚Äôs dream of building a larger territorial empire. Again, maybe this is just ignorant of me to say, but what the hell does anyone care anymore? Not to be provocative, but there‚Äôs not much excuse for annexing new territory in Europe in this era.  If leaders (especially Putin) could chill out and just focus on productive trade and cultural relations, what the hell should anyone be worried about. Putin says it‚Äôs just western scaremongering but putting 100k troops on the border is pretty overt and doesn‚Äôt reasonably look like anything other than a pending invasion. That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always worked.   My longstanding belief is that Russia and the West should be allies.

Also, how do you equivalate Russia's military activities on it's own soil, and military build-up that's clearly aimed at coercing and containing Russia while being disguised as a regional military alliance? A regional military alliance that was CLEARLY formed to counterbalance Russian influence.   >Not to be provocative, but there‚Äôs not much excuse for annexing new territory in Europe in this era.  This seems to be the UNO card for anyone that makes any argument against Russia these days, but you have to remember that historic and geographic references would make this argument obsolete.  The West already took more from the USSR and the Russian Empire in 1991 than the Modern Russian Federation can take from Europe in the next century.   >If leaders (especially Putin) could chill out  Last time I checked, it was Western media that's oversaturating the situation and trying to gaslight at every given opportunity.

When they came to pick up the sinti and roma, I didn't do anything, because I'm neither.   When they came to pick up the jews, I didn't do anything either.   And when they came for me, there was nobody left to do anything for me."  &#x200B;  Thus, we have to defend each- and everybody. Doesn't matter where you are from or what you belief in, fighting for your own country and own belief isn't good enough.

1oxwnd9	It does get coverage, maybe not appropriate coverage, but it gets covered.  I do think that it is hard for people not to overvalue the impact of their ancestors, so of course each country gives more press to its own countrymen.   Also, World War II is a big complicated story.  Without the British deciding to keep fighting - though they had no hope of beating  the Nazis - the war could not have played out like it did.  And there is no doubt Soviet soldiers killed more German soldiers than anyone else.  But without the absolutely ridiculous flow of American made war material the Soviets and British both would have had to fight different wars.  So, giving everyone due credit is hard.    And all of this is without even discussing the Pacific War, which ate an inordinately large amount of American men and supplies in part, because the American public was focused on revenge for Pearl Harbor.  So, it's just hard.    In fact, in terms of overlooked I believe that Japanese atrocities are probably the most overlooked story of the war.  They were brutal to civilians everywhere.    The Chinese have done a good job of reminding the world about this in China, but Japanese atrocities in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore do not get enough mention.  And that is without even discussing rampant torture of POWs and the work of Unit 731.    Many stories of tortured American POWs were covered up during the war, because the US government felt that if the US public really knew all these stories it would make negotiations of any kind impossible.   I believe this was pushed by the State Department, but I know it was an issue.    But still the suffering of the Slavs is unbelievable.  Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia all suffered enormous casualties.  Poland also ended up conquered in the end after the whole thing.    The best book I have ever read about the suffering of the Slavs is probably [The Last Witnesses: An Oral History of The Children of World War II By Svetlana Alexievich](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540745/last-witnesses-by-svetlana-alexievich/)  It is one of the best books I have ever read, because the children saw the war without as many preconceived notions.  The book is both horrifying and uplifting because all the children manage to live to tell their stories.   Finally, one reason things are overlooked is because it is very difficult to visit Russia and Belarus.  I have been to both but the rules are torture and the fees are outrageous compared to so many other countries.	1643822942.0	hvauq3b	t3_sij237	t3_sij237	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvauq3b/

I understand that the United States wants to expand its empire, but they will have to face the consequences of its expansion into the territory of the ethnic settlement of the Russian people, who did not invite them.   You have not yet understood that some actions are irreversible.   You lost your expansion in Afghanistan because of a third force, Pakistan.

These standards is a mandatory minimum for any school in the country. And it is pretty high, much higher than in the US public schools. Russian pupil have mandatory home works on all subjects. Parents are always informed about the grades. Often teachers are interested in good pupil results and try to motivate pupils to learn well. There is a competition between the schools on different school Olympics.  Yes, there are private school as well and most of them are much less expensive than the US private schools.	1643825291.0	hvb15yf	t3_siulij	t3_siulij	/r/russia/comments/siulij/school_education_in_russia/hvb15yf/

7g5zr	    So you dont think that are elections are very fair? Do you mean along the lines of what was happening in the USA last year?      Also, the freedom convoy is a very divisive, interesting topic in Canada right now. Personally I think restrictions will loosen over the next month.

Russia didn't say a word against NATO military adventurism in Iraq, Libya etc. Even allowed NATO to establish logistic routes through territory of Russia.

kq0er	Allow me to enlighten you as an American that our public education is horrible. Because of the no child left behind act parents can no longer hold their kids back another year if they are failing. The schools force them through. Our history books are chopped up and barely tell any information on important movements in history even in our own country such as the civil rights movement. Classroom size to teacher ratio is so bad most students who need more help are left behind. It is a system where the haves are the only ones educated. This being the weathly few. Most citizens in poverty recieve the least amount of education. American politics and government are taught in schools with almost no mention of how other governments in the world work. People here compare democratic socilaism to communism...when the truth is the countries they fearmonger over are generally totalitarian regimes.   From the time we are old enough to walk to the time we are adults we are put through a propoganda brainwashing machine. In schools, through news sources, television shows and advertisements it is cramed down our throats we are the best no one is better than us and we can do no wrong and we are the enlightened morally superior country. Its also repeated over and over that everywhere else in the world is a dangerous place that you should not go. This is the greatest country in the world why would you ever want to leave, they ask? All of these things add up to one thing.   Fear is the tool my country uses to control its population and keep us divided. If we are divided we cannot fight the corruption in our gov. Our gov allows companies to eat money and drive the deficit in order to stay in power in their little chair in congress to do nothing except bitch at each other and point the finger. Behind our backs they are laughing and eating at the dinner table with their so called red or blue "enemy". All the while they get richer and the poor get poorer.   The public believes whatever the tv tells them RED GOOD BLUE BAD. Or vice versa. This is why I realized that no matter how much I vote that it doesnt matter. The 1% will always pick their puppet red or blue.  Religion is the other tool used to control with fear. Just look at the ban of Maus book in my home state.

It's a sign of weakness though to feel unmanly if you are threatened by a woman that takes the lead. As a man you could take the lead if you wanted to but you think that it's best if she does it because you trust her leadership. If there are things you don't agree with you talk to eachother first. Then usually you give her right and but its not about being weak its about you choosing to do what you think is the best way forward. Also it's not about all decisions as well.

6dn1oxf0	Well, it matters what you beleive because that is what shapes your opinion, no? Plus, asking for an objective truth only opens the door to disagreeing on that truth, whereas if I ask for your opinion there is no basis for disagreement as it is subjective to you.  That said... you appear to have given me what I was asking for nonetheless. I'm not sure it was NATO that invaded Iraq, but a coalition of countries, most if not all of which admittedly were from NATO. That's perhaps irrelevant, I think clearly what you are alluding to is aggressions by Western Countries that Russia did not oppose, and now Russia does anything remotely similar you feel those states are instantly calling you out on it.  Just out of interest, what do you think is required to resolve the situation in Ukraine, and also what do you think the Russian states resolution to be? It seems there are many civilians who now feel they are on the wrong side of a border, and many of them will feel it is the border that needs to move and not them? I get the impression this current state doesn't bother the West, whereas a Russian intervention to resolve it would potentially risk escalating the situation.   When you say the Georgia crisis in 2008 rang the bell, what do you mean?  I think I can appreciate what you are saying, although all I'd add is that I think Western populations are just as much a target for this stuff, and what this stuff is is actually rampant neo-liberal globalist capitalism, not any one particular nation or people's. I think we too are subjected to economies and policies and information crusades that serve to benefit a select few of the financial of political elite in Western Countries, just with enough satisfaction for enough people to keep enough of us quiet or sufficiently misinformed to elect anyone who might challenge this (for example Jeremy Corbyn in 2019 who gave or political establishment a real scare and sent their propaganda machines into overdrive to make sure we didn't elect him. We have democracy... but it's not entirely free or fair!)	1643827401.0	hvb6uvn	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvb2c4g	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvb6uvn/

7g5zr	      It is hard to really say for that one at the current time. Pre-pandemic canada was amazing. Economically, many great places in Canada to go and get a good paying job. Strong middle class. The low price of oil was hurting Alberta, but economic recovery was well under way. Ever since 2010, tourism in western Canada (where I live) has rose quite sharply. I'm not a huge fan of increased crowds in national parks, but it was great for the towns that I live in.        Since the pandemic started it has been a shit show. There has been rolling lockdowns. The big concern was the lack of funding pur medical system clearly had. A lack of hospital beds. Inflation has hit us like a ton of bricks, especially in the housing market. I live in a small town in the rocky mountains, and the value of my house rose 37% in 2021. A lot of millennials and younger are worried that they will never be able to buy a house now.        I would say no one is happy with our politicians at the moment, and that spans both major parties.       That being said, I am not a great person to ask about it. I worked thru the whole pandemic, not everyone could do that. I have a great paying career with great benefits, that has almost no risk of lay offs ever. I have no desire to live in  big city, so housing prices didnt hurt me much. I love canada, but I can admit we are in for some pain before things get better.	1643827975.0	hvb8enb	t3_siuaaz	t1_hvb6du7	/r/russia/comments/siuaaz/what_do_russians_think_of_canada/hvb8enb/

Why haven‚Äôt they recognized the killings of Assyrians, Armenians, Serbs, Russians, Ukrainians and all other nations that suffered in the hands of evil.

hjtcpzel	Recently on the Internet I read about a way to get meth from a MOLE. This got me very interested and I decided to trrrrrryyyyy eeeeet. I went to the dacha and got my first experience there. I wove a small snare from the rope and went to the field in the evening. I found a fresh pile of earth characteristic of these animals and set a trap right on top. All night I sat and smoked joints by the fire. In the morning, not without curiosity, I went to check the prey. I didn't catch anything.  In the afternoon I came with a shovel, and ... I did not catch anything.  I went to the city and bought a biology textbook for universities. It turned out that he was listed in the Red Book. What a fucking miracle, that means there are few of them, and each mole makes a lot of holes. But I still caught the mole. I lured him to earthworms, which he feeds on. In general, I fiddled with the force again at night.  Came home, killed him with a mallet. This is such a rubber hammer that it would not hurt so much. Gentle technique, like military rubber bullets. I just had to hit him a lot.  He put it in a half-liter jar, "poked the fucker" with an awl, then with a pulper for mashed potatoes, properly wielded it. The mole gave juices. I decided that I should give him a day to settle. I went to town and got more herbs. Came and squeezed the mole in the juicer. Then he passed the carcass through a meat grinder, and also squeezed the resulting mass.  Fearing an OD, I first boiled the secondary mill cake, i.e. carcass. It turned out a pink powder, it smells disgusting. I sniffed him. BITCH FUCK FUCK FUCK! AS I REMEMBER NOW, SO GOOD! It's good that I didn't stick it in the center. In short, from pervach the same garbage. Good thing I didn't sniff from the center. Theory: Mole must be immediately in a meat grinder and squeezed, and then kept and evaporated for a day, you get meth.  Well, what's the point. The mole is very difficult to catch. Therefore, I took the Neva gasoline cultivator, kinda like a walk-behind tractor, put a harrow on it and plowed a nearby meadow. Then I found four and a half mole carcasses, I don‚Äôt know where the other half is. I lived on this for quite a while, but then the mole numbers nearby diminished and I got tired of this. The fact is that the mole meth rushes powerfully, but lets go quickly. Yes, and moral comedowns also tortured me. In short, I caught myself thinking that my roof was going. And I realized that I need more meth.  I thought a lot, read textbooks, in mechanics, in chemistry, in biology. Naturally, I sold meth, I had some money. In the end, I assembled (a halo should be drawn over this word) A COMBINE. Based on the same "Neva" cultivator. A COMBINE. Now this miracle plows the earth, firstly, deeper, and secondly, it itself grinds moles into biomass, then squeezes them out in a centrifuge. Then, under pressure, it passes cold cleaning, through a group of filters and, in a special chamber located next to the walk-behind tractor, on the basis of a motorcycle sidecar, the final evaporation of the product, METH, takes place. I learned how to feed the moles and developed some new pastures.  Bottom line: a clean release, with a total of five acres, I get 44-60 grams per week.	1643828954.0	hvbb1ft	t3_sirhpg	t3_sirhpg	/r/russia/comments/sirhpg/russian_molerat/hvbb1ft/

US military is fully on board with helping the private contractors with whatever lobbying they can because they are almost guaranteed to get jobs there.  >According to the Project on Government Oversight report, there were ‚Äú645 instances of the top 20 defense contractors in fiscal year 2016 hiring former senior government officials, military officers, members of Congress, and senior legislative staff as lobbyists, board members, or senior executives in 2018.‚Äù  https://www.businessinsider.com/military-officers-leaving-for-jobs-with-private-defense-contractors-2018-11?international=true&r=US&IR=T	1643829349.0	hvbc3o4	t3_sicz2t	t1_hv8zhyp	/r/russia/comments/sicz2t/a_ukrainian_sees_through_his_countrys_propaganda/hvbc3o4/

7zwjr464	That makes your original statement seem a little disingenuous.    I don't support my country's policies of warfare (USA), and I don't believe we should be involved.  I don't believe we would be involved were it not for money and resources involved, mainly oil.  So I am not buying into the propaganda you speak of.  I would rather walk to work than have people die so I can drive.  I would say you should watch out for propaganda yourself though, because it goes both ways.  Right now, I think we should be focusing on peaceful resolutions to the conflict than on armed interventions.  And yes, I also think it would be a good thing if the Ukraine were united and accepted as a viable power.  They are not united however, and they are not universally accepted as a power.  Even Ukrainians living there cannot all accept their own autonomy, because many of them suffer a brutal life and feel they have no country to speak of.  So you see, I am actually in some agreement with you.  However, Russia is not the superman it pretends to be, and may not be able to help the Ukrainian government much more than the west has been able to.  Imagine, though, if both powers agreed to work together and the Ukraine got help from both sides?  Maybe things would be different, then.	1643829914.0	hvbdmwm	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvb6oau	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvbdmwm/

7g5zr	     Ahhhhh I see what you mean. For some of them; mechanics, welders, electricians, plumbers, I definitely think they should have a license or ticket. A big part of that is to maintain your home insurance. The last thing I need is my basement to flood because my friends cousin wasn't as good of a plumber  as he said he was.       That being said you can do a lot of stuff without licensing. I will be redoing my roof and siding this year - no license or permit required. The only caveat is if it collapses and its found that I've changed the engineered design of of my roof - insurance may not cover it.             But a barber? If you aren't good at cutting hair, I would imagine the market would put you out of business pretty quick by itself. I am a blacksmith as a hobby, and if I paid 50$ or whatever for a business license, I could do that as my job if I wanted.	1643832547.0	hvbkhsm	t3_siuaaz	t1_hvbhdak	/r/russia/comments/siuaaz/what_do_russians_think_of_canada/hvbkhsm/

7pr208pz	It's easier for the europeans to be just "critical" of a nation with an extremely scarce history of conquest, that also resides on the other side of the world with only peaceful neighbours. Than it is to just be "critical" of a historically expansionist country that only recently (historically speaking) occupied or puppeted half of them, and said state has also been seemingly returning to that policy. Georgia and now the Ukraine. You can't really compare the two as equals, as they aren't. The US has been the leading hegemony for a long time now, and they haven't expanded militarily at all during that time.   I'm not saying that russia is some crazy imperialist like so many countries were a hundred years ago, but even if one might not like it, the different responses the US and Russia gets is understandable.

Cause Turkey is their sixth largest trading partner and Azerbaijan a major oil supplier (and rare Muslim-majority ally on the border with Iran)... that's basically the entire reason. recognizing the Armenian Genocide is very popular amongst the Israeli population every time it comes up, far more popular than Turkey, but realpolitik still wins out.	1643833338.0	hvbmiva	t3_sij237	t1_hv9dv44	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvbmiva/

Then came Stephen Colbert mentioning Reddit, and after that the stampede from Digg, and Reddit's revamp of it's Mod system.   The new moderators quickly implemented restrictive rules which served to ensure that no alternative media could be posted.   The users fought hard against the changes, but eventually - the old guard gave up and walked away.

4azh9	This is my own repost from the last time someone asked this:  I've looked in to this a couple times because I've always wanted a Lada Niva. The process is a lot of trouble and costs a lot of money.  Your best bet is probably going to be to make an alert on eBay for Lada/GAZ/UAZ/etc and just wait for a car you're interested in to come up. The prices you'll find on eBay would make a Russian's jaw drop ($8k-$14k for 25+ year old cars) but the cars generally belong to collectors and are well taken care of. Plus, buying one of them saves you all the trouble of importing it because most of them are already registered and titled in the US. Lada sedans and Volgas pop up on eBay routinely.  It's basically impossible to import a Russian car that is less than 25 years old. If it's a newer car, it would have to pass US emissions, which it wouldn‚Äôt, but if the car is old enough it is exempt. You'd also want to make sure that it wouldn't need a smog certificate, wherever you live, as it will not pass, no matter the age. Title and registration is also going to be tricky.  So, basically, you would be used car shopping across an ocean with a language barrier for a car that would be considered extremely old for the Russian market. Quite a difficult task. You would also have to arrange shipping and freight.  Basically, you're going to be paying a lot of money and going through substantial headaches for a car that is objectively not very good (slow, spartan amenities, probably no AC, bad gas mileage relative to engine displacement) for the money you‚Äôd be paying. A car that needs regular maintenance with parts that you're going to have difficulty sourcing. I actually love Russian cars and I think they're good cars for what they cost in Russia. But a shitty old Lada shouldn't cost upwards of $10,000.  There is a small company called Pobeda Motors, that‚Äôs basically one guy in Illinois and one guy in St. Petersburg that will go through the trouble of locating, importing and registering a Russian car of the appropriate age that will be delivered to your door. I can‚Äôt personally vouch for them though.  You may also want to search used car listings in Canada, as Lada imported there for several years, however these have gotten pretty rare.	1643837034.0	hvbwrb9	t3_siyqhb	t3_siyqhb	/r/russia/comments/siyqhb/someone_from_the_us_here_my_dream_vehicle_is_an/hvbwrb9/

Corruption and cartel influence quickly sweeps over San Diego and now those families that have invested their lives towards their properties are now stuck and can‚Äôt leave without severely crippling financial consequences. Unrest breaks out and now the US government is receiving immense pressure to provide military aid. US forces begin to line up next to the border.   Ukraine was founded in 1991.

gwhj6tf	It's not that nobody mentions it. I mentioned it when talking about the war with my dad the other day.  I think the reason why atrocities like the Holocaust get more attention is because the Holocaust was *specific.* The Nazis targeted all Jews in all of their occupied territories, and demanded their allies give up their Jews as well. They were extremely thorough with the genocide of the European Jewish population. In comparison, the Nazis only started killing Slavs in truly large quantities when they invaded the Soviets. Yes, it was still a genocide, but it was not as "targeted" as the Holocaust. The Nazis simply killed any and all civilians in their way. Their main objective was the war itself, not the genocide.  So because it was not as targeted, and because the genocide it tied much more directly to the invasion and war itself rather than a byproduct of it, I think that's why it is given less media attention, but by no means does that make it any less terrible of an atrocity.	1643838047.0	hvbzkwh	t3_sij237	t1_hv990mn	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvbzkwh/

ivpiz39o	Okay. Let‚Äôs talk about this frankly.   NATO was created by the US and her Allies as a way to respond ti an advancement of the Soviet Union.   After the formation of the Russia federation, it was agreed that Russia wouldn‚Äôt advance west and NATO wouldn‚Äôt add any members as the Soviet threat was gone.   Now, Ukraine is relevant because it controls Russia‚Äôs only access to the Mediterranean. Historically, Ukraine and Crimea have been under Russian cultural and military influence because of its strategic importance. This is why the Soviet Union and the Russia Empire both wanted to insure control of the Crimean peninsula.   If Ukraine were to join NATO, it would be a massive security risk for a Russia.

Te recomiendo unos canales de youtube como Bald & Bankrupt (este va cuidad por cuidad de paises slavos no solamente Rusia y en muchos videos hace la mitica pregunta ed que si vivian mejor antes en la URSS, muy resumidamente el sentimiento por la URSS es algo meramente nostalgico pero no era mejor y nadie con menos de 30 a√±os piensa que la URSS era mejor)     Arielosky es un chileno que literalmente copia el estilo de Bald & Bankrupt hasta inclusive la font de los subtitulos pero debo admitir que el chileno tiene su caracter que lo hace unico y se informa muy bien a cada cuidad que va, Ariel solo visita cuidades de Rusia al contrario del pelado ingles que va por muchos paises slavos.  &#x200B;  Luis Romviro es un espa√±ol que hace mas videos comunes como de preguntas y respuestas sobre Rusia, esta bien para informarse un poco pero no sale de Moscu y creo que la mentalidad que tiene otra gente que vive en otras cuidades es distinta.  &#x200B;  Yeah Russia es una chica que vive khabarovsk y esta bueno para ver otra parte de Rusia mas del lado este, digamos que el este de Rusia no es nada que ver con el oeste y los sentimientos que tiene ella hacia su pais no son muy buenos, aunque ultimamente esta mucho mas positiva hubo momentos duros de "depresion" hacia su pais, me gusta porq es como ver la contra parte y no quedarse con la mirada de una sola moneda     NFKRZ es un chico que ahora mismo esta viviendo en ST Peterburg y hace videos sobre cultura moderna en Rusia, trata temas politicos y de la sociedad comun como artistas memes etc, No me gusta mucho de los que nombre aca me parece el peor pero tiene algun que otro video que es interesante, sobre todo el que va a una feria en ST Peterburgo que venden cosas sovieticas con Bald & Bankrupt     Si tenes alguna duda o queres saber algo capaz que te puedo ayudar en espa√±ol, todavia no visite Rusia pero es mi plan a futuro vivir alli, las cosas como bien sabras no estan muy bien en Argentina y mi destino se que es ir a vivir alla asique estoy peleando cada dia con el idioma	1643843469.0	hvcdvwy	t3_sifrmq	t3_sifrmq	/r/russia/comments/sifrmq/just_my_think/hvcdvwy/

h2ky4po9	Loved labor and PE classes at my school. And literature, too. Every summer, we had a huge list of books that we were required to read and then had to write an essay for one of them at teacher's choice in September. Also, in grades 9-11 instead of labor classes at school, we had assigned day to visit –£–ü–ö- —É—á–µ–±–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ç ( i think, in English, this would be speciality / trade college?). We were free to choose from the list of disciples such as : shoemaker, driver, automechaniks, baby sitter, welding, sewing and sculpting. I've selected automechaniks, but got transferred to driver section in grade 10 due to age. They had a rule that of you turn 17 by the time of graduation, then you can just go to the local DMV , pass exams and get your DL. normally, in Russia, they require some classes at driver's school to be completed. But since it was a part of my curriculum, i just went to testing site, passed it and got my DL early. That was really cool. Also, used to know the guy who liked welding so much that before he even graduated he already knew what to do after.

ha631npn	So, your first worry is that my dream might be detrimental to your ethnic group? While perfectly reasonable and even natural, it obfuscates and ignores the fact that the presentday social contract is bound to be detrimental, possibly even lethal to my ethnic group in the long run. We are slowly but surely losing our nations and states, we are forced to rewrite our histories and apologise all the time, we are already being hunted, stabbed, pillowed, slaughtered, raped and abused all over Europe (admittedly not by Turks), we are vanishing through low birth rates and race mixing (mostly including the scenario of our women marrying outside our race), but we are merely supposed to accept it as our fair share of reparations for colonialism and remind ourselves that we are still the dominant group, that there is an asymmetry in power between us and others?

I'm sure the world would be alarmed if the US started massing tanks and armored vehicles at the Canadian border too, especially if they did so relatively recently after annexing Quebec or something.	1643853609.0	hvd2cyc	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvadad7	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvd2cyc/

The CBC has lost its credibility among many Canadians years ago (as reflected by their declining viewership) and they now appear to be going the rout of failing American news networks by trying to drum up fear about the Russian boogie man.

fnpcn31r	I can do the same in Spanish‚Ä¶  Think of a world where most people learn a language of a bordering country that they frequent quite a bit with. For instance, the US with Mexico (Spanish), English with France (French), France with Germany (German), etc. then you have Russia that borders no English speaking countries other than maybe Magadan with Anchorage and English is taught frequently in Russia. That right there proves that Russia is at a failed state in the world sphere.  Russia has a rough history and I really wish we all could be friends, but when your country has the same GDP of Florida‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to take it seriously in a conventional war. Russia is not the USSR of the late 40s-60s, sure it could get back there. However, it would have to take multiple acts of aggression that NATO + the US will not allow in this day and age.  Sure, hold on to the glories of the past and take over territories forcefully rather than working on making your country prosper and have a higher GDP of fucking Florida.	1643859795.0	hvdguve	t3_sj6rmi	t1_hvdfhfu	/r/russia/comments/sj6rmi/imagine_thinking_you_can_go_to_war_with_russia/hvdguve/

72jn9	It makes sense though.  Biden is compd by Ukraine and this goes way back, Hunter, Maidan, everything.   China released a bio weapon with Covid and interfered in the 2020 election.  If the rumors are true that Biden isn't really in charge, and there are competing factions in the U.S. in charge, then the theory that they will build up troops together in Ukraine, then to force China's hand together somehow.  And in exchange for that, the U.S. clearly grants the concessions Putin wants about NATO, which Trump largely supported. Possibly even Germany is on board, that's why they won't allow simple things to pass through them to get to Ukraine.	1643863503.0	hvdoq4g	t3_sj9j7p	t1_hvdn03r	/r/russia/comments/sj9j7p/about_biden_ukraine/hvdoq4g/

72jn9	It sounds crazy. But there's a very good case for this theory.  Just realize those 2 points.  If indeed, there are warring factions in the U.S., and Trump never fully surrendered power, both the Ukraine, and China have reason for us to sanction them.  The way you leverage them into capitulation is by first having the ability to strike quickly and decisively and fully so they HAVE to concede.  Russia wants some things from the U.S. regarding NATO and Ukraine.  If indeed 1/2 the U.S. is still in Trump's hands, this theory makes absolute sense.  And this has been planned in the works for awhile, it's why the media tried to tar Trump as being this stooge of Putin, because they knew they were working on this all along.  The U.S. has purposely looked weak to China, and Putin has purposely made it look like they're about to get into it with the U.S. over Ukraine.  So then China thinks they can go for Taiwan, and when they do, Russia and the U.S. combined obliterate China.  Or China capitulates to the world for Covid somehow.   People mention during the Olympics this could go down...	1643865354.0	hvdsc1i	t3_sj9j7p	t1_hvdqxdk	/r/russia/comments/sj9j7p/about_biden_ukraine/hvdsc1i/

Kennan, had called the expansion of NATO into Central Europe ‚Äúthe most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era.‚Äù Kennan, the architect of America‚Äôs post-World War II strategy of containment of the Soviet Union, believed, as did most other Russia experts in the United States, that expanding NATO would damage beyond repair U.S. efforts to transform Russia from enemy to partner."

Americans over exaggerate a lot when it comes to this topic without even realizing who is truly going to be affected the most. Also, might I add that I am American. Yes, Americans can be concerned for what is happening, but they need to educate themselves a lot better on the situation and understand how our media also makes us feel about these current events happening. I hope nothing happens, I truly don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt like seeing anything like this in any part of the world and I am sad.

Buuut I've done a few raids with a friend, and became a tarkovholic. Seriously, I love that game. It's like a breath of fresh air among these modern mmo shooters.  Tarkov's hardcore mechanics and overall gameplay is harsh, unforgiving, yet enjoyable and addicting. Plus, setting and decorations are brilliant and realistic. Seriously, as a russian, I criticized Metro: Exodus a lot for being bogus in terms of decorations, but I haven't found anything controversal in Tarkov's decoration and art.

The goals of this expedition included exploration, surveying, and the establishment of diplomatic relations and negotiation of trade agreements with various nations of the region; opening contact with the government of Japan was considered a top priority of the expedition, and was one of the key reasons for its inception.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1643867538.0	hvdw875	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvdw6yc	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvdw875/

hnvolv0	I think there are pro russians among americans in government. We would be lying if said Trump admin wasent (sanctions were never approved by Trump Treasury department) for the 4 years he was in office he even removed some. I think technically only 1 or 2 sanctions were in.   Anyhow I dont think Biden is compromised by China. China threatens the western worlds dominance especially the US. There is no reason for the sanctions and diplomatic moves of Biden admin against China.   The odd thing is though  If they wanted to try to isolate China they would ease up on Russia. So that Russia doesnt need to rely on China so much.  However the current US policy is stupid and is being anti Russian because they (america) believe they can take on the entire world.	1643871427.0	hve2idc	t3_sj9j7p	t3_sj9j7p	/r/russia/comments/sj9j7p/about_biden_ukraine/hve2idc/

I know, first-hand, that most Americans do not want war, and we don't support a lot of what the politicians do.  Do you believe you should bear the brunt of your countries indiscretions?  For you, someone not from the US, to state, as fact, what happens in the US, would be perpetuating the cycle of lies all governments feed to their people.  The East believes just as much propaganda about the West, as the West does of the East.  When you say that Americans are taught certain subjects and believe certain things when you have no frame of reference because you're not American.  That means you believe in another person's lie's.	1643871516.0	hve2n79	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvdlf7i	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hve2n79/

ihrckv8m	There are several thousand of these structures through-out the Caucasus region. Often they are referred to as tombs however it was not uncommon for burials to take place inside the floor of the structures while they were occupied. I dispute these theory, clearly them were meant to live in, they provided warmth, shelter safety while sleeping and for the females of a clan they offer protection during a women's monthly cycle when predators would be drawn far and wide by a females scent. Many people reject this due to it's just factor, but it is a mature view considering how widespread wild predators such as lions, tigers, wolves, bears, hyenas, etc. Even though they are very old there is no accurate measure to date them. People need a place to sleep at night, so they were homes.	1643871931.0	hve39e6	t3_sigqib	t1_hva5x2b	/r/russia/comments/sigqib/dolmens_of_russia_along_the_coast_of_the_black/hve39e6/

yup6jmi	In December Russia demanded from the US to pull off its missiles and soldiers from the eastern europe and do not expand NATO further east. After that all american and british media started a hysteria about "imminent russian invasion into ukraine" and all US officials constantly tries to switch any conversation on the topic to Ukraine. I won't be surprised if the US are going to agree with (some) russian demands and they need some artificial "crisis" that they will "heroically resolve" and it will distract people from the real situation. Also ratings of both Biden and Boris Johnson in their countries are extremely low right now so such hot topic as "evil russians invading innoncent ukraine" is very useful in that regard too.   The funny thing is that Ukranian officials of all levels (including the president) deny that Russia is going to invade Ukraine and even accuse western media of disinformation	1643873619.0	hve5qcp	t3_sjcw3b	t3_sjcw3b	/r/russia/comments/sjcw3b/anyone_want_to_explain_whats_going_on_between/hve5qcp/

I am not a supporter of the 5 eyes or the imperialism of the west myself, but insinuating Russia or China to be better the west shows your biasedness.   Parroting Putin's "historic and cultural experience" as a legitimate reason to conquer Crimea while ignoring international law, hell even criticizing legality altogether, shows you're spewing agenda.  If you think the sinocentric worldview consists of "harmonious relationship", then you don't understand what harmony even is. China uses its dominance to achieve that shroud of harmony. Seeing you celebrating "status hierarchies" also shows that dumbness of yours.   It's very clear that Russia and China are worse than the west, even US in most regards.

The NDAA and Patriot Act were also pushed by his administration. Oh, I almost forgot about Reagan and his campaign of terror, genocide and bloodshed across Latin America and the Middle East, like the Contras of Nicaragua and Iran. Or even Trump and his perpetuation of Bush and Obama's policies for war.  Stop watching Fox News for five seconds. Russia wouldn't benefit from being bullied by America and NATO's ridiculous demands. In fact, after Yeltsin and Clinton rigged the Russian elections in the 90s they refused Russia to enter NATO.. why?  >We continue to recognize that collectively the conventional forces of the states formerly comprising the Soviet Union retain the most military potential in all of Eurasia; and we do not dismiss the risks to stability in Europe from a nationalist backlash in Russia or efforts to reincorporate into Russia the newly independent republics of Ukraine, Belarus, and possibly others... We must, however, be mindful that democratic change in Russia is not irreversible, and that despite its current travails, Russia will remain the strongest military power in Eurasia and the only power in the world with the capability of destroying the United States.

I don't have the arrogance to claim I understand the entire situation.  All I can do, is form an opinion with the little knowledge I have and with the facts we can observe now: Russia has not invaded Ukraine even though the West has claimed it would do so "any time" for years now.   Also, back in the days, the West promised Russia NATO wouldn't expand Eastwards, yet we still did and it's getting really close to Russia's borders which makes them, understandably, nervous. On the other hand I also understand the concept that each country should be able to decide for membership for itself. Basically, it's kind of a deadlock and it will take concessions on both sides for this crisis to resolve. I just got a feeing that NATO is more in a "we're strong, so we ca bully anyone into what we want" position and makes use of this.	1643879348.0	hvedgvf	t3_sjdgr1	t3_sjdgr1	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvedgvf/

Ukraine, just like any other neighbouring nation, has the sovereign right to invite american troops and build bases. Russia, being a sovereign nation, has the right to oppose such steps on national interest grounds. It can threaten sanctions, severe ties, etc to stop such things from happening.

No, I very much doubt it, and no other nation on earth would either. Invading a country to prevent the United States, of which has created several wars across seven nations these past two decades, from potentially invading is self-defense. Ukraine joining NATO would be a direct threat to Russia's national security. So fuck off with this "propaganda" bullshit. I'm pointing out basic facts that geopolitically no other nation in the world would be okay with.   Cool story, I guess Cuba and Venezuela have a sovereign right to allow Chinese and Russian troops/bases within their borders, thing is America threatened war with either nation if this happened. Funny how that works, eh? Everybody has to follow the United State's rules but they can break their own. Whose the one whose indoctrinated here?

From my perspective it looks like Russian goverment tries to play the victim and tries to convey the story where the Big Bad US is pulling the strings and tries to oppress Russia with NATO.  The narrative however completely forgets the fact that in the last 100 years Russia has occipied or tried to occupy most of its western neighbours and those nations were not treated that well during the occupation.   So maybe its not that NATO is being a dick and trying to aggressively expand near Russia borders but that the countries near Russia actively seeking protection so that history could not protect itself.	1643881083.0	hvefnqg	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvefnqg/

It's obvious that normal russians transformed into nationalist and brainwashed dumbos with a blinding support for Russia due to the humongous propaganda against their country by the west. They see this as a defensive mechanism against the west, which I can sympathise with, until they are rallying for invasion and violence. The west in a way created them by lacking the nuance to deal with Russia and allowing their own state sponsored propaganda against Russia. These assholes lack nuance and are too proud of their motherland to see the problem in them.   They don't consider the crimean invasion as an invasion. They see it as correcting a mistake.

But, new Ladas pass EU emissions you may say, unfortunately though, the emissions standards in the US are different than in Europe, where Lada actually exports, so it‚Äôs no guarantee that it‚Äôll pass in the US.

Fracking is a proven drilling technology used for extracting oil, natural gas, geothermal energy, or water from deep underground. Fracking has been safely used in the United States since 1947. More than 1.7 million U.S. wells have been completed using the fracking process, producing more than seven billion barrels of oil and 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

The United States has violated a lot of treaties and just promises that were given to Russia and the world. Any leader of Russia will take this into account.   Putin's proposals were the last ritual attempt to offer the United States to return to the treaties and promises that were given.   No one expected a positive reaction, but the ritual was observed.    Now the union of Russia and China is inevitable, and a hard redistribution of the world.

697hi00l	You know, I want to thank you for trying to understand us in these times, and have aome critical thinking not to become another victim of propaganda. Seriously, we need more people in the world, who tries to understand first.  Russians is common people who try to live their best. We want our home to prosper. But we don't need expansion for that, we don't need to conquer someone, fight for resources - we have everything that we need... Except neighbors. Resources of Russia, it's size always was an object of fear and envy, so we always have someone, who simply try to either subdue us, or just rob.  And NATO is not an exception. It may be controversial, but it's not us, who started cold war - we were cautious and unbelieving to our allies in WW2, yet grateful and trustworthy.  NATO tried to crush USSR for 40 years. Well, they succeed. We suffered a defeat. We were literally colonised in 90s.  But when we began to get up from knees, then bam, we hear again "Russia is big, scary, it'll try to conquer us, let's crush it so it won't crush us". And here we go again.  Yes, we had some misdeeds, like everyone else in the world. But that's child play comparing to some another countries.   But definitely we don't want to conquer anyone, we want us to be left alone. You may ask "But what about Crimea? You conquered it", and I'll tell you, that Crimea is an exception, we have the only naval base, capable of housing whole Black sea fleet there. Plus, I'd add, that Crimeans wanted to return to Russia. And it all happened because of maidan on Ukraine, which it's not we, who started it.  So...yeah. NATO is a bunch of jerks.	1643890142.0	hves46z	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hves46z/

j9vicxmq	All in all regular people have to suffer from all conflicts, frankly NATO's influence is viewed with interest in Romania, we have a long history with Russia interfering in our affairs, and we know what happened with many other countries that were close to them. As a normal person, I would love to visit Russia one day, I spoke with many russians from the outskirts of Moscow all the way to Siberia.  I wouldn't want a conflict between our nations in a million years. NATO should keep it's distance and US should stop making pressures for a conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Frankly speaking I don't give a damn about US, always respect Germany because during WW2 a German doctor saved my granny's life, learned to respect Russian people because I find them beautiful after I knew some of them.	1643891175.0	hvetu3d	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvetu3d/

hvp2lljs	hello american! I'm interested in another question. how in the most "democratic" and richest country (the US debt today is 30 trillion dollars) country in the world in the 21st century, there are still reservations and ghettos?   The Indians of North America, once brutally driven from their native lands by European colonialists, have been forced to live on reservations for several generations.   There are 2.5 million American Indians today.   At the entrance to the reservation there was an impressive poster: ‚ÄúDo not invade! Violators will be shot. The survivors will be shot again!" What is this, 17th century?   By the way, links to the website of the US Bureau of Statistics, access from the territory of the Russian Federation to the site is closed!!!!!! How is it not democratic?   Now about the ghetto.   Ghettos and slums in America, a mistake of the authorities or a pattern? What is the San Francisco Heroin Ghetto?	1643893839.0	hveynjp	t3_sfnrwx	t1_hur03gs	/r/russia/comments/sfnrwx/the_moscow_times/hveynjp/

756bndet	Agree let's hope it doesn't come to that. The people on both sides need to cut through the propaganda bullshit  - the potential for a Russo-Ukrainian war to develop into a Russo- Nato war is hugely worrying. Wars in Europe don't end well for either side. The Americans, Chinese, Russians - all meddling in the great geopolitical game but its the ordinary people that have to send their sons to die for fuck all. One thing that's not clear is this assertion about having Nato on the borders. Isn't using the military stick against Ukraine likely to result in just that? Already talk of Sweden and Finland now considering Nato membership and if the Ukraine was invaded and assimilated into Russia, Nato would still be on Russia's borders. Do Russians really believe that Nato would ever attack them for Russia's natural resouces? Why wouldnt China (lacks many of these resources) at some point in the future then? Notwithstanding that any such action goes against what the alliance is supposed to stand for (defence), such a rekless action would need the agreement of all the members (never going to happen).It would be the dumbest move since Hitler and Napolean...	1643895544.0	hvf22sm	t3_sio7zt	t1_hvecmic	/r/russia/comments/sio7zt/bruh_same_old_sh/hvf22sm/

i0off	I like the way you put this. I have a few questions, because I am concerned about a friend on the Russian side of this, whom I would like to get a chance to meet at some point this year.  You say no one wants a war, and those words are fantastic to hear! - I just hope they are true, cause a lot of the stuff we see, admittedly with US origins, makes it sound like war is just around the corner.  What, in your honest opinion, does it take - from all sides, to find a peaceful solution to this?   How long do you - or Russians in general, expect this to go on?  I'm just a Dane, in the grand scheme of things my country is insignificant, but I understand that we too have a responsibility, in this because we are a member of NATO. I'm also mildly worried that our current defence minister is utterly useless and mocked by.. everyone pretty much.  I should very much like to see a world where Europe and Russia works together, and finds solutions to global issues.	1643895871.0	hvf2rb4	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvecrmu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvf2rb4/

7snlg2nr	If you want a peaceful solution - there is one actually. NATO in general and US in particular should already accept the fact that they can not dominate the world in a way they want to. The politics are getting more and more multipolar instead of bipolar system of after WW2.   Maybe if they accept the fact and the reasoning Russia gave with the stabilization project to both (US/NATO) there would be no threats. We want no war. We need no war. But we are ready to go to war if the need arises. Not like it's the first time West tries to make our coutry fall.  Better be realistic here - if there actually was any real plan on invasions and stuff - our people would have done that neat and clean (and fast enough for other countries to not have time to intervene).But we just want: a - NO weaponry or rivalry directly at our borders and b - no intervention with the unfair and unclear methods into our internal stuff.

alvxyak	Not NATO...the greedy U.S. Megacorps are being dicks.  Just as wars were fought in the Middle East for oil, this conflict in Ukraine is about the country's rich, fertile agricultural land.  Starting around 2014, the U.S. Megacorps got the World Bank and IMF to use debt based diplomacy tactics on Ukraine to get the local farmers to give up their land rights the them. Then Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, etc all setup shop to start farming their toxic GMO foods. But what the Western media suppresses in the news, is how Ukraine separatists have literally attack these installations in revolt over losing their land and livelihood. So now the U.S. Megacorps want NATO to move into Ukraine to protect their installations.  This is basically American Imperialism under the guise of spreading Democracy. I don't support it as an American. It's seems once again, innocent blood will get spilt over the greed of U.S. Megacorps.  Google "Monsanto Ukraine" and youll learn all about what I stated above.	1643898514.0	hvf8o78	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvf8o78/

ekzzcp9z	It‚Äôs complex problem. Main idea - find who benefits from situation. Example - passenger aircraft shot at DPR/LPR. Do Russia benefits from this? No Does any of opposing ‚Äústates‚Äù benefits from it? Yep  (could explain more widely, but don‚Äôt want to make a ‚Äúlongread‚Äù) Do Russia get benefits from invading Ukraine? No (a ‚Äúmore territories‚Äù argument is for imbecils, that view at politics as an ‚Äúempires struggle‚Äù, who needs a failed state territory to pay wages/pension, and get nothing in return?).  There is a so called ‚Äúred lines‚Äù which was written for Ukraine govs, that they should implement Minsk agreement, and not to try to solve this problem with arms (and Ukraine govs count this as a political failure, and try to avoid to implementing this treaty).  So - forces on boarderline of Russia COULD invade DPR/LPR territories, to shield russian natives (these regions was russian historicaly, so theyinhabited mostly with russian people, which are ukraine citizen from USSR fall apart). Despite that forces could do that, it is just a method to force Ukraine leaders to ‚Äúhold their word‚Äù  And the first question - why France and Germany doesn‚Äôt act when Ukraine is not acting in a way that they promise to do? Last time in same situation the state was taered apart with active action of NATO "defensive alliance" (I'm about Yougoslavia)  Because US is beneficiars from war at this region. And EU is just have not enough independence to decide it for themself. So - "no acting" lead to a possible war actions. What profit does it for US?  1) sanctions against Russia, which not-rarely acting in oppose of US will (at UN for example). so multiplying economical problems - they clean they way to dictate their will to the world) (China - you are next) 2) ban for russian oil - to sell own, more expensive oil 3) ban for russian natural gas, to sell own liquefied (read ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù again) gas 4) get a scarecrow to have a new reason for NATO to exist, and its beaurocrats to get a salary) 5) happy days for US arms manufacturers (new markets to sell, grown needs, ban for russian military export - less competitors).  Sorry, anyway - longread)  Some thoughts might look naive, but as I said - I could describe them more ‚Äútheoretically and practically based‚Äù	1643899265.0	hvfag4r	t3_sjdgr1	t1_hvedgvf	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvfag4r/

hvp2lljs	NATO, which has unleashed several bloody conflicts over the past 20 years, which they diplomatically call "peacekeeping wars."    NATO and the US often act as the main initiator of the bloc's military operations.   Yugoslavia   The dead - 5,700 people, including 400 children   Wounded - about 7,000 civilians, 30% of them are children   Missing - 821 people   Excess deaths as a result of deteriorating living conditions cannot be estimated   Afghanistan   The dead - 35,000 people   Refugees - 500,000 people   And also - the aggravation of interethnic conflicts, terrorist attacks, an increase in drug trafficking   Iraq   More than 1 million people died during the war in Iraq.   Iraqis is a huge loss in modern history. A quarter of them are women and children   During the operation, NATO troops used prohibited weapons, namely white phosphorus!!!   German peacekeepers in Afghanistan are accused of desecrating graves!!!!   https://static.1tv.ru/uploads/photo/image/5/big/267025\_big\_6baaa83284.jpg   Libya   The dead - more than 20,000 people (military and civilians)   Refugees - more than 350,000 people   At the same time, in August 2011, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen claimed that not a single civilian was injured from the actions of NATO air forces in Libya.    NATO also used cluster bombs and white phosphorus in Libya, as it did during operations in Yugoslavia and Iraq.   NATO members dumped uranium dust on Iraqi facilities - a radioactive substance banned for use by the UN convention. And finally, many sources claim that in Libya the Alliance used mustard gas, a chemical warfare agent ‚Äútested‚Äù back in the years of the World Wars, and banned by various conventions, due to its extreme danger.   Vietnam   The beginning of the great American scam may be the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in August 1964, which unleashed a bloody Vietnam campaign that began because North Vietnamese speedboats allegedly attacked the United States fleet. After 40 years, the US government declassified archival military documents, from which it became clear that the reason for the start of the Vietnam campaign was shamelessly fabricated. The bombing of settlements in Vietnam that followed the Tonkin incident led to thousands of civilian casualties.   The use of napalm bombs - a weapon that is an incendiary, flamethrower mixture. Being thickened gasoline, napalm literally burns a person alive.   https://r2.mt.ru/r4/photo39A2/20447451572-0/jpg/bp.webp   https://r.mtdata.ru/r480x-/u19/photoDE06/20130122852-0/original.jpeg   https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/64973/213948141.4e/0\_166c36\_54b937ef\_XL.jpg?from=https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/64973/213948141.4e/0\_166c36\_54b937ef\_XL.jpg   https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15538/9430010.1b5/0\_eae26\_b30a4eca\_orig   Countries of the former Yugoslavia   After the collapse of the USSR and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the Alliance began to feverishly look for reasons for its continued existence, the main of which was the so-called "peacekeeping mission", when NATO entered into the resolution of interethnic conflicts, pursuing purely personal goals (first of all, expanding its zone of influence ). As, for example, it was in the Balkans, when the bloc invaded the region and took a direct part in the escalation of ethnic wars.   NATO's military actions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia, which marked the beginning of the bloc's modern operations, have become an example of gross violations of all norms and laws, including the Organization of the North Atlantic Alliance itself. First of all, NATO violated its own Charter, the Washington Treaty, the 1st article of which states that the member states of the Alliance must ‚Äúresolve all international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in a manner that does not endanger international peace, security and justice, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.‚Äù   The American TIME magazine of September 11, 1995 was published under the heading ‚ÄúTaming the Serbs. Massive bombardment opens the doors of the world"   NATO used weapons against Yugoslavia that were prohibited by the Nuremberg Charter and the Hague and Geneva Conventions. First, shells with a low uranium content were used in Yugoslavia. This type of weapon is not only high-precision, but also radioactive and highly toxic weapon, dangerous for humans and the environment. Secondly, NATO used the so-called cluster bombs - indirect fire weapons with explosive projectiles, subsequently banned by the "Ottawa Minefield Process"	1643899757.0	hvfbmgb	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfbmgb/

If China suddenly placed thousands troops and a large amount of heavy weaponry on the Russian border that would obviously raise eyebrows in Moscow and around the world. Moreover, Russia hasn't kept its troops within its borders. It currently has troops in Ukraine*, Moldova** and Belarus*** and many of these are recent arrivals.  *I understand that from a Russian perspective Crimea is formally part of Russia - despite a near total lack of international recognition - but the same cannot be said of Donbas where Russian troops are known to operate. **Yes, Transnistria is not under the control of Chi»ôinƒÉu, but it also not part of Russia. ***Definitely not part of Russia.	1643899884.0	hvfbxp5	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvf1xti	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvfbxp5/

hvp2lljs	NATO, which has unleashed several bloody conflicts over the past 20 years, which they diplomatically call "peacekeeping wars."    NATO and the US often act as the main initiator of the bloc's military operations.   Yugoslavia   The dead - 5,700 people, including 400 children   Wounded - about 7,000 civilians, 30% of them are children   Missing - 821 people   Excess deaths as a result of deteriorating living conditions cannot be estimated   Afghanistan   The dead - 35,000 people   Refugees - 500,000 people   And also - the aggravation of interethnic conflicts, terrorist attacks, an increase in drug trafficking   Iraq   More than 1 million people died during the war in Iraq.   Iraqis is a huge loss in modern history. A quarter of them are women and children   During the operation, NATO troops used prohibited weapons, namely white phosphorus!!!   German peacekeepers in Afghanistan are accused of desecrating graves!!!!   https://static.1tv.ru/uploads/photo/image/5/big/267025\_big\_6baaa83284.jpg   Libya   The dead - more than 20,000 people (military and civilians)   Refugees - more than 350,000 people   At the same time, in August 2011, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen claimed that not a single civilian was injured from the actions of NATO air forces in Libya.    NATO also used cluster bombs and white phosphorus in Libya, as it did during operations in Yugoslavia and Iraq.   NATO members dumped uranium dust on Iraqi facilities - a radioactive substance banned for use by the UN convention. And finally, many sources claim that in Libya the Alliance used mustard gas, a chemical warfare agent ‚Äútested‚Äù back in the years of the World Wars, and banned by various conventions, due to its extreme danger.   Vietnam   The beginning of the great American scam may be the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in August 1964, which unleashed a bloody Vietnam campaign that began because North Vietnamese speedboats allegedly attacked the United States fleet. After 40 years, the US government declassified archival military documents, from which it became clear that the reason for the start of the Vietnam campaign was shamelessly fabricated. The bombing of settlements in Vietnam that followed the Tonkin incident led to thousands of civilian casualties.   The use of napalm bombs - a weapon that is an incendiary, flamethrower mixture. Being thickened gasoline, napalm literally burns a person alive.   https://r2.mt.ru/r4/photo39A2/20447451572-0/jpg/bp.webp   https://r.mtdata.ru/r480x-/u19/photoDE06/20130122852-0/original.jpeg   https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/64973/213948141.4e/0\_166c36\_54b937ef\_XL.jpg?from=https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/64973/213948141.4e/0\_166c36\_54b937ef\_XL.jpg   https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15538/9430010.1b5/0\_eae26\_b30a4eca\_orig   Countries of the former Yugoslavia   After the collapse of the USSR and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the Alliance began to feverishly look for reasons for its continued existence, the main of which was the so-called "peacekeeping mission", when NATO entered into the resolution of interethnic conflicts, pursuing purely personal goals (first of all, expanding its zone of influence ). As, for example, it was in the Balkans, when the bloc invaded the region and took a direct part in the escalation of ethnic wars.   NATO's military actions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia, which marked the beginning of the bloc's modern operations, have become an example of gross violations of all norms and laws, including the Organization of the North Atlantic Alliance itself. First of all, NATO violated its own Charter, the Washington Treaty, the 1st article of which states that the member states of the Alliance must ‚Äúresolve all international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in a manner that does not endanger international peace, security and justice, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.‚Äù   The American TIME magazine of September 11, 1995 was published under the heading ‚ÄúTaming the Serbs. Massive bombardment opens the doors of the world"   NATO used weapons against Yugoslavia that were prohibited by the Nuremberg Charter and the Hague and Geneva Conventions. First, shells with a low uranium content were used in Yugoslavia. This type of weapon is not only high-precision, but also radioactive and highly toxic weapon, dangerous for humans and the environment. Secondly, NATO used the so-called cluster bombs - indirect fire weapons with explosive projectiles, subsequently banned by the "Ottawa Minefield Process"	1643899960.0	hvfc4ie	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvecqxd	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfc4ie/
hi5kn	You've answered my question with a question. Let's try and clear up this communication.  Does Russia see NATO as an organisation who made its life mission to destroy Russia?  Does Russia see NATO as talking behind Russia's back with Russia's close friends, trying to get those friends to abandon Russia and side with NATO? If so, who are the close friends?	1643900047.0	hvfccag	t3_sjkii6	t1_hvf8wow	/r/russia/comments/sjkii6/can_anyone_explain_why_nato_expansion_is_seen_as/hvfccag/

7snlg2nr	Let me not start the meaningless discussion for the topic elaborated many times already. In general - we did not invade anyone. It was a totally legit (even if the media say otherwise) referendum by the people of the region to join Russia instead of going through the shit happening in Ukraine. We can say that they asked for protection which we provided. Prove me wrong if you can, but note that I do not refer to biased media, but the people I actually know from there and who saw the situation firsthand.	1643900207.0	hvfcqeu	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvfbztu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfcqeu/

c0nna1mt	It's pretty simple. Large corporations want money and do not want to share the market with Russia, China and some other countries. When a country becomes strong enough to prevent it from earning more money, a revolution is made in it, and if this is impossible (for example, as with Russia or China), hotbeds of tension are created around. So that ordinary people believe that the good guys want to punish the bad guys, propaganda is constantly heard in the media and ordinary people from another country are turned into monsters, and the head of the country into a dictator. If the United States (more precisely, the owners of very large banks and corporations) could, they would do to Russia the same way they did to Iraq or Libya. But fortunately, there are not enough forces for this. Therefore, Russia and China are trying to destroy as competitors gradually, with the help of sanctions, false propaganda, terrorism (two Chechen wars in Russia), color revolutions in surrounding countries (Ukraine and several others) and hybrid wars (ISIS, Syria).	1643900484.0	hvfdeuf	t3_sjdgr1	t1_hvez92u	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvfdeuf/

hvp2lljs	My dear European friend, do you know the history?   maybe you are afraid to speak or in the west it is forbidden to know and remember the history of the west?   how was NATO created? - this will be the next course of history (if you ask me to tell you)   But let's start in order, who fought for Hitler and the Wehrmacht?   The answer is the whole "civilized democratic" fascist Europe!   Every year on June 22, we remember the sad date:   On that tragic day, a war began between the great Eurasian power - the USSR and another coalition of European states, since, together with the Wehrmacht, the troops of Romania, Finland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria, in total 15 European countries invaded the territory of the USSR !!!   Russians will never forget this historical memory!   you forgot to mention the other armies of Europe!   Who fought for Hitler and the Wehrmacht?   The answer is the whole "civilized democratic" fascist Europe!   In total, more than 3.5 million people from 15 European countries fought in the Wehrmacht troops (more than half a million - the Romanian army, almost 430 thousand - Hungarian troops, more than 270 thousand - Mussolini's troops!).   Of these, during the war years, 59 divisions, 23 brigades, several separate regiments, legions and battalions were formed.   Many of them were named after state and nationality !!!   Blue Division - Spain   "Wallonia" - the division included French, Spanish and Walloon volunteers, the Walloons were in the majority. The "Blue Division" was the only unit of the Wehrmacht awarded its "own" medal established in its honor !!!   HUNGARY (MAGYARS) 430 thousand - Hungarian troops   In total, 513,767 Hungarians were taken into Soviet captivity during the war years.   "Galicia" - Ukrainians and Galicians   "Bohemia and Moravia" - Czechs from Moravia and Bohemia   "Viking" - from the Netherlands, Belgium and the Scandinavian countries   Finland was an equally important ally of Nazi Germany.   From the end of June 1941 to September 1944, there were sixteen Euro-fascist infantry divisions on the Eastern Front, a total of 740 thousand soldiers and officers, 3047 guns and mortars, 186 tanks and 407 aircraft.   "Denemark" - Danes   "Langemark" - Flemish Legion (Holland)   "Nordland" - Scandinavian SS division   "Nederland" - Dutch collaborators who fled to Germany after the Allied occupation of Holland.   The "French Infantry Regiment 638", since 1943, has been merged with the newly organized "French SS Division" Charlemagne "- the French.   Army of Bulgaria   This is not complete data, Europe is afraid to voice the archives because the numbers will increase by 2 or 3 times!	1643900845.0	hvfebc6	t3_sjecqu	t1_hveu40x	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfebc6/

Despite this  material conditions improved drastically in China, eradicating extreme poverty, raising the minimum wage, allowing the middle class to grow while poorer regions have been given more attention. Lastly, China is still an undeveloped country despite its growth economically, and as such people aren't going to get paid the same as they do here in America. In fact, despite America's incredible wealth, [we face massive income inequality to the point where it's now historically at its worse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States).  >"According to a December 2020 analysis of W-2 earnings data from the Economic Policy Institute U.S. income inequality is worsening, as the earnings of the top 1% nearly doubled from 7.3% in 1979 to 13.2% in 2019 while over the same time period the average annual wages for the bottom 90% have stayed within the $30,000 range, increasing from $30,880 to $38,923, representing 69.8% of total earnings in 1979 and 60.9% in 2019 respectively. The earnings of the top 0.1% surged from $648,725 in 1979 to nearly $2.9 million in 2019, an increase of 345%"  But hey, if you rather focus on how supposedly evil China is with outdated misinformation then be my guest, it doesn't stop the rot and terror within America that's been growing exponentially for decades and is seemingly at its peak now due the pandemic.. all the while the "freest country" ([with the largest prison population](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262961/countries-with-the-most-prisoners/)) in the world does *absolutely nothing* in the face of it.	1643905222.0	hvfpspm	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvf8wua	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvfpspm/

The light went out, the fence fell,   The car's engine stalled   Healthy tooth removed   Or a thief got into the apartment,   Didn't like the movie   You stepped into the shit...   Any cataclysm   One explanation...   Every democrat knows   It's Putin's fault!   Who was in my house yesterday   Elevator pissed to the ceiling?   Believe me, comrades -   This is Putin's hand!   I caught a drunk "squirrel" -   This is Putin's antics!   A pile of shit under the table -   It's Putin's fault!   Clogged toilet -   This is Putin's order   Threw gobies there,   He drained the water - and that was it!   At night, linen is stolen,   The glass in our house is breaking.   Drunken in the yard dancing ...   This Putin is an idiot!   There is no escape from the villain!   writes swear words on the walls,   Broke the bushes in the alley.   This is Putin - oh and ah!   Liberal rain wets -   Putin laughs merrily.   Did your cottage flood?   This is Putin, I know for sure!   Did a storm catch you on your way?   That hand of the Kremlin got it.   Cold, wind, snowfall -   Again, Putin is to blame.   Blows the roof off with a hurricane?   This is Putin taking revenge on the sheep.   Storm, tsunami, flood?   This is Putin, without a doubt!   Downpour, landslide, cyclone -   It's his fault, of course.   Mudflow, avalanche, rockfall?   Clearly: Putin is to blame!   Tornado, typhoon, earthquake -   There is no salvation from Putin!   Did a crow peck on the back of the head?   This is a special agent of the OMON.   Do bees, wasps sting you?   This is Putin's Special Forces.   Do you see this bumblebee?   He is in the service of the Kremlin!   If you believe in this -   It's just paranoia!

Actually America and China have do a lot of business ess with each other and a lot of American companies are based in China.    But in this particular case, it's not about trade its about the Ukrainian people.  See the problem with saying your county does this and that is...the other cou try says the same thing.  Americans can say look at Crimea invasion, look at government corruption or withholding energy from Europe, cyber crime.  Not saying it's true, but I want to know what's the view point of Russians about Ukraine.  My gf is Russian and she talks about certain groups in Ukraine or Crimea being pro Russian, not wanting to join NATO, etc.. I wanted to hear those view points.  Because if no one in that country had those view points then how can you say it's justified for Ukraine to not do what their people want.

The opinion of the people is defined mostly by their origins so if you ask the Russians "Is NATO being a dick?" , they would probably say yes but if you mention the exact same question to an American, he would probably reply with a no. It's a conflict between interests so there's usually no "right"/"good" side, only two understandings of the same situation.	1643905897.0	hvfrntc	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfrntc/

j7lrxxx3	I don‚Äôt think anyone is innocent, I think all parties point fingers and ignore their own actions for the most part. The US is known to meddle in other countries affairs, South America being a famous area of operations for their meddling. They funded the Mujahadeens because they were against the soviets, then ISIS because they were against Taliban, then they ledt weapons and vehicles to Taliban when they deltaed out of there. They have also refused to stop the deescalating of anti nuclear weaponry, increasing nuclear tension. The US and therefore NATO, are not looking for peaceful ways of settling an old mindset, they are preparing for war against Russia, have for many years, whereas Russia have tried deescalating the tension. I live in Europe, I hear it and I see it, and have seen it for the last couple of years.

19xvztxc	"No, Russia isn't invading anyone" Well, russian troops near Ukraine's borders aren't something a peaceful country would do, don't you think?  It is true that both NATO and the US did bad things, still, Ukraine should be free to join or not NATO or the EU, while the russian governament is trying to avoid that for political reasons.  Of course this is all about politics for both sides (Russian and NATO), but ukrainians should be free to choose where to stand, and the fact that they prefer to stand with NATO and EU says a lot about Ukranian-Russian relationships.  It is not about "UnItEd StAtEs BaD, RuSsIa GoOd" or vice versa, is about letting an independent country do its own choices and avoiding another conflict on Europe soil.	1643906333.0	hvfsv2u	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvecrmu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfsv2u/
3h85o81x	While basically all military actions of the US ‚Äì or NATO in general since 9/11 ‚Äì were just a shitshow based on lies or geopolitical interests, I don't get the Yugoslavia thing. Yes, they didn't have a UN mandate (at least as far as I know) but in contrast to lets say Iraq in the 2000s there was and an ongoing war with many war crimes like the Raƒçak massacre right at the borders of NATO states, commited by people who were already responsible for a genocide (for example the Srebrenica massacre, declared as genocide by the International Court of Justice). So the NATO had basically the same goals, as Russia in the past (Georgia) and today. No threat and a somehow stable situation at direct borders. In this case I just can't say if it was good or bad.   Being dragged in a conflict over a region / country or whatever based on lies, geopolitical goals of a single nation or whatever, what happened basically the last 20 years, is a whole other level.   Regarding Ukrain, I'm again not sure what to think about it. The approval of NATO by the Ukrainians was somewhere around 25%. After Russia sent some funny green and black man to Crimea and supports Ukrainian separatists with weapons and maybe soldiers "on vaccation" (maybe the NATO should have sent soldiers on vaccation to Yugoslavia),  you wonder why Ukranians want to move closer to or even join the NATO because they feel threatened? Seriously... I just don't get it..   They only thing I see right now: Some politicians, millionaires or billionaires and some of their friends (from both sides) doing some dick fencing and putting thousands or even millions in danger.	1643906377.0	hvfszjt	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvfc4ie	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfszjt/

5s8jhhuq	Funny how you haven't provided a single retort. You just change topics, which is a logical fallacy, [specifically a red herring](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Red-Herring.html). Regardless, all countries are inherently authoritarian. There isn't a single country that doesn't actively use a military or police force as an arm of authority for their administrations and government of whos superstructure is controlled by a specific class. In China's case it's the workers or proletariat. Also, pointless neoliberal verbiage like "regime" is little more than a joke. If any country fits that word it's America.. a country with a bloody history of genocide, slavery, colonialism and imperialism that's maintained through brutal conflicts that's constantly instigated through vicious propaganda that you're seemingly eager to regurgitate without thinking twice. I don't "shill" for China, I'm not being paid, but I do openly support them because I know their people and I know their history the same I do Eastern Europe. Also, they're a close ally of Russia, and last I checked this is a r/russia subreddit. If you want to smear and slander then go to r/worldnews.

I'm not sure about the reason of exactly this lie, but I think this is to support US-military extra-budget after withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. May be Russia has some extra forces on the boarders (to prevent provocation against pro-Russian part of Ukraine for example), but we will not start operation first. No such support from locals as it was on 2014. Real risk of heavy sanctions. Putin is not an idiot. But constantly paying attention about what we should do with our army in our country is really piss-off everyone (and Putin as well), that is why he don't give an order to replace troops.	1643907073.0	hvfuwo1	t3_sjnmv0	t3_sjnmv0	/r/russia/comments/sjnmv0/question_from_an_american_about_the/hvfuwo1/

They need to justify and satisfy the people that are being ignored, satisfy the shit COVID situation and the fact that they would rather invest in the military than a proper healthcare system.

hvp2lljs	>–ë–∏-–±–∏-—Å–∏  HAHAHAHAHAHA   BBC Fake News!!!!   BBC Cookbook: British fakers are torn between lies, self-censorship and secret duty!!!!   The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC admitted that filming the aftermath of the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma in April 2018 is nothing more than a staging. However, the staging is bloody - since the virtual "chemical attack" of Bashar al-Assad became the reason for another US cruise missile attack on Syria!   The search for "Russian influence", like obsessive Russophobia, has become a trademark of BBC news stories.   when the theme of the ‚Äúhand of the Kremlin‚Äù began to be pedaled in his materials in the French anti-government speeches of the ‚Äúyellow vests‚Äù. Earlier, Olga Ivshina, correspondent of the BBC Russian Service, admitted in a personal correspondence with one of the Russian correspondents in Paris that the channel‚Äôs management requires any evidence of ‚ÄúRussian interference‚Äù in the ‚Äúyellow vests‚Äù protests in France from employees.   ‚ÄúThe editors demand blood,‚Äù Ivshina told the stringer.   By the way, this is the same Ivshina who was noted in the story of the Boeing MH-17 flight crash in the sky over the Donbass and the subsequent BBC self-censorship. In her report from the crash site, she blabbed that local residents saw combat Ukrainian aircraft in the sky shortly before the crash.   As a result, this video was very quickly removed from the BBC Russian Service website under the pretext of "imperfect structure and due to incomplete compliance with editorial values." Not a fake - but a very characteristic feature of the British handling of information.   In order to fabricate the material required by the BBC management, Ivshina unashamedly admits that "the editors are demanding blood." The situation turned out to be so hopeless that she began to sort out the most absurd options.   Even before Trump's official inauguration, the BBC released a full-length "investigative journalism" with the telling title "Trump: the Kremlin's candidate?". In it, British journalist John Sweeney, known for his anti-Russian views, poured all the hodgepodge of rumors about Trump onto the heads of viewers, including the alleged ‚ÄúKGB compromising evidence‚Äù on him, thoughtful sophistication about the location of the Miss Universe pageant, and Trump‚Äôs love for Eastern European girls. All this was interspersed with statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin.   ‚ÄúI'm really surprised that the BBC is broadcasting fake news. There is no news."   This phrase was said in February 2017 by the head of the UK Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, leaving the BBC Breakfast program with Charlie State.   The BBC is just one of the elements, and far from the most dangerous. Goebbels, however, did such things better than the Anglo-Saxons and the BBC are doing now.	1643907629.0	hvfwg3h	t3_sfnrwx	t1_huu2734	/r/russia/comments/sfnrwx/the_moscow_times/hvfwg3h/
i7ougkwm	Do you know why changing of ruling parties and having political opposition are important for the people? Because ruling party without opposition staying for too long in power is not so interested in doing what people elected them to do. As a result the government can do what they want regardless of people will. Authoritarian regimes tend to suppress opposition and control media since they can become dangerous for ruling party. That is why I think it is absolutely reasonable to treat current government form in Russia as regime. It has all criteria met to be called like that. On the other hand I do not state that presidential election in USA is a democracy in a nutshell. But USA has way more mature political institutions in states and lower level. If district or number of houses do not have water supply citizens usually do not call Biden to solve it.

I don't know where a better place would be, but maybe it would be a good idea to ask r/ukraine what they think, and whether they agree with the opinions you see here? It would be good to include them and the European NATO countries ( + the CIS ) in any conversation about whether this or that country is being a dick.   This whole idea that the Ukraine situation is only a US and Russian concern, and that negotiations shouldn't include other NATO and CIS members, is complete and utter bullshit.	1643907652.0	hvfwiih	t3_sjecqu	t3_sjecqu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfwiih/

Crimea borders Russia and the contact between Russia and Ukraines were therefore very high in that area.

Russia, who saw it as a reunion, accepted them and Crimea was therefore under Russian military protection. It wasn‚Äôt an invasion, that was western media painting Russia as the enemy. If you‚Äôre given a house and protect it, are you invading the former owners property, or defending your own property? Much of the violence was anti-Russian from all over Europe who travelled to fight against Russian troops, like violent looters or hooligans after a sport match.	1643907960.0	hvfxcux	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvfvw3n	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvfxcux/

j1t6ddqi	It's probably my fault! I came to Reddit 7 days ago and apparently KGB agents followed me))) In fact, I had to read specialized literature in English for work, and since I do not know English, I downloaded a translator to my gadget. Now in quarantine and there is time to read and other information. A week ago I came here and ... –∑–∞—Å—Ç—Ä—è–ª–∞ –∑–¥–µ—Å—å. It is interesting to read the opinions of people from different countries about my country. Many messages surprise both in positive and negative terms. Sometimes I enter into a discussion, but since I think that an electronic translator does not cope well with the translation of my thoughts, I often hesitate to do so. But I don't think I'm here for long, since I'm being killed on another discussion thread right now (they put cons). Maybe I won't live to see the morning))) Therefore, I want to say a huge thank you to those people who are trying to reflect and want to hear the opinion of another person. And I don't take offense at unreasonable creatures who write all sorts of nasty things about my country and about Russian people! It's a sin!)))	1643908017.0	hvfxieb	t3_sjm3xg	t3_sjm3xg	/r/russia/comments/sjm3xg/hey_rrussia_is_growing_fast_this_is_our_fastest/hvfxieb/

hvp2lljs	HAHAHAHAHAHA   BBC Fake News!!!!   BBC Cookbook: British fakers are torn between lies, self-censorship and secret duty!!!!   The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC admitted that filming the aftermath of the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma in April 2018 is nothing more than a staging. However, the staging is bloody - since the virtual "chemical attack" of Bashar al-Assad became the reason for another US cruise missile attack on Syria!   The search for "Russian influence", like obsessive Russophobia, has become a trademark of BBC news stories.   when the theme of the ‚Äúhand of the Kremlin‚Äù began to be pedaled in his materials in the French anti-government speeches of the ‚Äúyellow vests‚Äù. Earlier, Olga Ivshina, correspondent of the BBC Russian Service, admitted in a personal correspondence with one of the Russian correspondents in Paris that the channel‚Äôs management requires any evidence of ‚ÄúRussian interference‚Äù in the ‚Äúyellow vests‚Äù protests in France from employees.   ‚ÄúThe editors demand blood,‚Äù Ivshina told the stringer.   By the way, this is the same Ivshina who was noted in the story of the Boeing MH-17 flight crash in the sky over the Donbass and the subsequent BBC self-censorship. In her report from the crash site, she blabbed that local residents saw combat Ukrainian aircraft in the sky shortly before the crash.   As a result, this video was very quickly removed from the BBC Russian Service website under the pretext of "imperfect structure and due to incomplete compliance with editorial values." Not a fake - but a very characteristic feature of the British handling of information.   In order to fabricate the material required by the BBC management, Ivshina unashamedly admits that "the editors are demanding blood." The situation turned out to be so hopeless that she began to sort out the most absurd options.   Even before Trump's official inauguration, the BBC released a full-length "investigative journalism" with the telling title "Trump: the Kremlin's candidate?". In it, British journalist John Sweeney, known for his anti-Russian views, poured all the hodgepodge of rumors about Trump onto the heads of viewers, including the alleged ‚ÄúKGB compromising evidence‚Äù on him, thoughtful sophistication about the location of the Miss Universe pageant, and Trump‚Äôs love for Eastern European girls. All this was interspersed with statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin.   ‚ÄúI'm really surprised that the BBC is broadcasting fake news. There is no news."   This phrase was said in February 2017 by the head of the UK Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, leaving the BBC Breakfast program with Charlie State.   The BBC is just one of the elements, and far from the most dangerous. Goebbels, however, did such things better than the Anglo-Saxons and the BBC are doing now.

3eh7w3nm	I don‚Äôt live there, but I wanted to provide perspective.  Imagine Texas seceded from the states many years ago.  After that, each year we sent financial aid to Texas.  Now, it serves us to have a good relationship with Texas, and for them to have a good relationship ship with us, and there is a defensive strategic standpoint we have to consider.  We sort of feel like Texas can do their own thing as their own country, but despite our differences they will surely side with us over most other foreign interests.  After all we share a long history of similar ideology and culture.    Over time Texas becomes somewhat more independent and Russia begins negotiating with Texas.  They do it in a way which gives them more access to our border than we feel comfortable with.  And they do it under the disingenuous auspices of ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù little Texas from the big bad America.  So we want to trust Texas, but we have to be careful.  We put a little bit more into our effort to guard our border.   Also, it seems there are a large group of Texans which wish to secede back to America.  It‚Äôs not a majority of Texas, but a majority of a certain region.  We take a vote, where a majority in that region wish to secede back to America but the outcry that follows calls into question the vote.  It is either a loud minority, or a genuinely bad vote.    Fast forward and Texas seems to be talking about having a much closer relationship with Russia, and while the next step in their relationship ship may not be a problem, it‚Äôs the one after that which puts us at serious risk.  We have no interest in violating the sovereignty of another nation, but we have a duty to protect our people.    America blocked the Russians from putting missions in Cuba and waged a war half a world away concerned about the cascading effect of communism a la Vietnam.  There is not a perfect answer where all parties involved come away feeling good about their efforts and the decisions they had to make.  But the best answer is for America to stay out of it and not give the Ukraine or Russia ultimatums.  But Russia is issuing ultimatums you might say.  That‚Äôs their border.  We did the same thing for ours and you better believe if Russia wanted to ‚Äújust help the Cubans have a defensive missile system to protect themselves‚Äù we would not allow it.	1643908792.0	hvfzmm5	t3_sjdgr1	t1_hvez92u	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvfzmm5/

19xvztxc	You understood nothing of what I wanted to convey with my answer, let me explain it better so you get my point straigth this time.  1) Both Russia and US/NATO are doing this kind of stuff for political reason, as I stated in my previous reply "It is true that both NATO and US did bad things" I do not think that NATO is sinless, quite the opposite, but the same could be said for the russian governament (I do not want to say russians, because there is a difference between one country's population and governament).  2) Ukrainians should be free to do whatever they want, if they want to join the NATO or the EU they should be free to do so. If they want to have more close relations with Russia, than they should do that, they are free to do whatever they want.   3) As I stated here ("and the fact that they prefer to stand with NATO and EU says a lot about Ukranian-Russian relationships.") it seems to me that the russian governament doesn't really have a diplomatic way to approch this kind of problem with Ukraine, and the only thing it can do is to blame the West and use hard manners. If instead of invading and provoking Ukraine in the past Russia had done otherwise maybe we wouldn't have this kind of situation now.  4) Both Europe and Russia do not need another silly war just because of some political reasons and tension between Russian and the US. Let Ukraine decide where to stand and let's avoid another useless loss of blood and people.  Bonus) I'm in no way russophobic, I do like russian people and culture, I used to study russian to be able to speak with them. Anyway, I do make a clear distinction between the russian people and the russian governament. While I do not like what the russian governament is doing, I enjoy russian traditions and speaking with people from the biggest nation on Earth. I have nothing against russians, they are great people, and I'm sure that most of them just want to live in peace with all the rest of Europe.  Please feel free to respond, but keep in mind that just because people are from the EU/USA doesn't mean we are brain dead and we just follow blindly what our media tells us, quite the opposite. Anyone has its personal opinion about what it is happeing, but saying that disagreeing with what the russian governament is doing is "russophobic" is just bs imho.	1643909547.0	hvg1qom	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvfvrwh	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvg1qom/

waa7nr4	I follow subs of all countries that I visit frequently, r/Russia is just one of them.  I enjoy pictures of Russian nature and wildlife, as well as posts about Russian literature and mythical stories.  I dislike the 'look how strong and great Russia is' posts. It's in my opinion a sign of weakness and insecurity. Russia has an extremely rich cultural, scientific and military heritage. I do like the more subtle posts that point that out, but some of these posts are too militaristic, North-Korea-like for my taste.  I'd love to see more posts about current day Russian art and music, but no other country sub does that either.	1643909722.0	hvg282l	t3_sjm3xg	t3_sjm3xg	/r/russia/comments/sjm3xg/hey_rrussia_is_growing_fast_this_is_our_fastest/hvg282l/
8elhhjpv	If it's all about ukranian people why it's Crimea anexi√≥n illegal and no international recognition when even 70% of the ukranian army changed his side and joined Russian forces? Even maintaining current status and degrees.  Why we forgot the eastern Ukraine being mostly pro Russian, tal mostly Russian, and have strong familiar and economical link with Russia?   I get we got to protect Ukraine will of their people, but ALL the will not just the ones afine at us.  Because everything started when a prorussian pressident that declined a "preferential " partnership with UE because under EU demand, preferential trade with Russia had to stop, which would hurt ukranian economy and affect the presidential campaign since half of the country usually voted for pro-russian president (that's why we had yanukovich).  Why the desire of the ukranian people is to join NATO, but what happen with the other half of the population that until 2014 systematically voted for pro-russian candidates?? Do they still wanna join NATO or we better not ask that part of the pepople (I get that since Russian intervention there are less pro-russian but still it's a huge amount of them in terms of numbers)   I will tell you something that maybe others not has tell you, what happens with Nord stream 2 being activated? (Which could be done at any moment since it's just government who put stand by)   I will tell you what happen, that nearly All gas Europe consume, will go through the sea, you know what that mean? That neither Ukraine neither Poland will be paid just for letting Russian gas pass trough its territory.  That is a huge part of the ukranian budget just cut (less money), having ukrania lost by their decision the Russian market which half of the country traded to or was focus towards what we will have now?? Ukrania has been rescued at least 2-3 times now since 2014, how many times more we will have to rescue it if ukrania suddenly lost half of its national budget?  That why we have troubles now, not 6 months ago, we have troubles since the politicians just had to agree to open flow of gas on North stream 2, because that north stream 2 opened secured cheaper gas to Germany and Europe, and more secure since you don't have to worry any of the passing country's would attack the pipe line or close that, that would give some autonomy at Europe but will destroy ukranian economy, time will pass and people tired of the situation will start to think that NATO and EU doesn't bring that much of prosperity and then decide to turn toward Russia again, destroying NATO sweet dream.  I could add more things, like a lot but I know the longer the post it, the less likely is for you to read it so I will stop here.	1643909730.0	hvg28we	t3_sjdgr1	t1_hvfr8bc	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvg28we/

Futhermore, as for the 200k US troops in Europe you probably googled it and you just wrote the first (wrong) result you found, in reality they are WAY less than 200k, and let's not forget that they are not all stationed at the Russian border.  Anyway, it is not about US/Russia is bad or good, it is about letting Ukraine do its thing and its decision. As for last but not least, just because there are NATO troops in NATO countries it does not justify placing 100k troops near another NON NATO country's border just because your governament its at constant "war" with NATO.	1643919843.0	hvgtosq	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvgrduf	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvgtosq/

21js2j	For some reason I only got a notification about this reply today? Lmao sorry. China has actually been pretty good with its Belt and Road program, for example its forgiven countries' debts if they couldn't pay them, that sort of thing. Certainly much better than the way the Western countries do it. It's just that Western media tries to paint it as the same because they can't comprehend that maybe someone's not trying to exploit the Africans.  You can certainly argue China's doing it in its own self-interest, although I don't think that's *completely* true, but the benefit they get is not from controlling countries' infrastructure (again that's more the Western way of doing things), it's instead in how they gain those countries as allies.	1643920280.0	hvgut39	t3_sbvr19	t1_hu8jfm5	/r/russia/comments/sbvr19/congratulations/hvgut39/

i0off	I agree, none of us common folks have any impact on the outcome of this, yet watching both the Ukrainians and the Russians post and share information and news that directly contradicts the threat of war being on the brink of happening, does in fact offer hope that perhaps it's not quite as close as it is being portrayed elsewhere.  The problem I have with that is almost all of the "war is coming" arguments are in fact coming from one place - USA. A place I also wouldn't trust if they felt threatened or cornered.   Therefor, I choose to hope - that the people living in the countries that are currently in danger of being the battlefield if a war comes - are in fact right, rather than the news from the other side of the world.	1643922110.0	hvgzdsq	t3_sjm3xg	t1_hvgxdit	/r/russia/comments/sjm3xg/hey_rrussia_is_growing_fast_this_is_our_fastest/hvgzdsq/

I'd would very much appreciate your thoughts on this.   I am talking about taking over portions of other countries.   And I will pre-empt your argument. Even if I accept (and I don't) that there was a fair vote in Crimea and they voted to join Russia, that does not give Russia the right to take it over. The sanctity of national borders is well established international law.   And we will see what happens with the current situation. I am not at all qualified to have an opinion but I would not be surprised if, this time next year, much of Donbas will be part of Russia. And there will be more sanctions against Russia...hurting the Russian people but not those that have made the decisions that affect them.   And to what end? How has taking over Crimea helped the Russian people? Improve their lives? How will taking over Donbas? What is the point of the rivalry between Russia and Western Europe? How is it helping anyone - particularly in Russia where there is much opportunity to dramatically improve the standard of living.	1643923500.0	hvh35cx	t3_sjm3xg	t1_hvgygs6	/r/russia/comments/sjm3xg/hey_rrussia_is_growing_fast_this_is_our_fastest/hvh35cx/

The sanctity of national borders is well established international law.  As to other counties joining NATO (or wanting to)...  They ARE sovereign countries. They can do what they want. And the more aggressive Russia gets with their neighbours, the more likely they are to join NATO. Russia's actions are doing the exact opposite of what Putin says he wants.

8elhhjpv	>So you are say main fighting in Ukraine is because west sees Crimea annexation as illegal, Russia sees it as legal.  No, I was referring to your previous comment: it's about ukranian people.  That Western nation only take in consideration ukranians pro west, not pro Russian, "they don't exist" so it's not about ukranian people.   >But at the end a country has to go with majority vote right? If the majority of the country voted one way then the country should follow.  True, and here it comes the reason ukrania has conflict really quick and simple, I have not much time  1- Democratic elected government refuses an agreement of cooperation with EU since it means it has to lose preferential partnership with Russia (EU imposed, Russia begged for a 3 party relationship).  2- There are massive protest pro EU and pro west.  3- unknown people start shooting at polices and polices shooting back.  4- Democratic elected pro-russia president have to leave the country in fear of he being killed.  5- New government is put in place which treat to ban Russian language (bi-lateral with ukranian in government and normal life) and start the persecution of everything Russia-linked.  6-Crimea is taken without blood.(maybe this could be 5 instead of 6, it happend long ago and didn't checked it before posting)  7- Pro-russian local movement in eastern ukranian,aiming at defending their right to speak freely their language, and maintain economical links with Russia (since the most part depend from Russia) start to appear and gain popularity taking even government, that attracts sponsors.  And the rest is history   So the pro-west side of ukranian had the right to topple a government democratically elected just because they don't like what it's doing and had the right to decide for the rest of the country what the country want? The rest of the country that it's pro-russia, so that's what was reflected on the government in charge?  Russia see the hand of the west in that coup and new government and just acted quickly to secure really important things, like no NATO boats on Sebastopol.	1643924355.0	hvh5g1h	t3_sjdgr1	t1_hvgqxhb	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvh5g1h/

I know that you probably won‚Äôt agree with that and I suggest not to discuss Crimea‚Äôs affiliation.  Russian troops are also on Ukrainian - Belarus border. And that is far away from Russian territory. I mean it looks like Ukraine reacts on it quite reasonably. US and UK giving defensive (!) weapon on Ukrainian request (!) is also understandable. Javelines is used for destroying tanks. It cannot be used in any other purposes except defensive.	1643924917.0	hvh6yp4	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvecrmu	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvh6yp4/

hib7osf8	 Argentinean here who will soon go to live in Russia, I am not going to lie to you, although a part of me is happy to have these relations with Russia, Alberto is not a good president, each one in his country can have his differences, he can love or hate his political party or president, but Alberto in Argentina.    An example I always give to my Russian friends was that when I started studying Russian at the end of 2019 the dollar in Argentina was 40/1 40 Argentine pesos for 1 dollar, when I took classes with a teacher to improve my Russian it was 60/1 and my teacher interested in my country said "The ruble is worth the same as the Argentine peso! "to which I sincerely said "it doesn't work like that here" that was less than 1 year ago, today it is 216/1 (on the internet it is 106-110 but with taxes it is 216, I hope this kind of taxes will never be in Russia).   Argentina is a beautiful country, with beautiful people, with good meat and good values, but the politics here makes me have a pressure on my head that is unbearable, I am proud that my mother has the Sputnik with 70 years who had cancer a couple of years ago and still smokes cigarettes and when she got covid already with the second dose did not have any discomfort.   While people were dying in the streets because there were no beds in the hospitals Alberto was celebrating a party with his mistress in the presidential house.  The only thing I have against this text, is that at the time there was a contract with Pfizer since we also have good relations with the United States, it was never known why this contract was not accepted, the government at the time said that they could never reach an agreement because the things they were asking for were "impossible" months later the contract was known and it was discovered that it was a lie, again I am glad that we have the Russian vaccine, but this man is a liar and in the last elections of deputies his party already lost and I doubt that he will win the presidency in 2 years when he can be re-elected.   Even so, and I repeat, I am happy that my country has this type of deal with Russia, and I hope it will continue like this for a long time. Best regards and have a nice day.     –ê—Ä–≥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ—Ü, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å–∫–æ—Ä–æ —É–µ–¥–µ—Ç –∂–∏—Ç—å –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é, —è –Ω–µ —Å–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞—é—Å—å –ª–≥–∞—Ç—å –≤–∞–º, —Ö–æ—Ç—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –º–µ–Ω—è —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤–∞ –∏–º–µ—Ç—å —ç—Ç–∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–µ–π, –ê–ª—å–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç, –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –≤ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –∏–º–µ—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–∏—è, –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –ª—é–±–∏—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ—é –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫—É—é –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—é –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞, –Ω–æ –ê–ª—å–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –≤ –ê—Ä–≥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ.    –ü—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–∂—É —Å–≤–æ–∏–º —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–º –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º: –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª –∏–∑—É—á–∞—Ç—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫ –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ 2019 –≥–æ–¥–∞, –¥–æ–ª–ª–∞—Ä –≤ –ê—Ä–≥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏–ª 40/1 40 –∞—Ä–≥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Å–æ –∑–∞ 1 –¥–æ–ª–ª–∞—Ä, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —è –±—Ä–∞–ª —É—Ä–æ–∫–∏ —É –ø—Ä–µ–ø–æ–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —É–ª—É—á—à–∏—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, –æ–Ω –±—ã–ª 60/1, –∏ –º–æ–π –ø—Ä–µ–ø–æ–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å, –∑–∞–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤ –º–æ–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ, —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: "–†—É–±–ª—å —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç —Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∂–µ, —Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∞—Ä–≥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–µ—Å–æ!

34epiolm	Small government? The US?  US is a democracy in name only really. You are free to vote for "whoever you want" but there are only 2 candidates and they are preselected.  In Australia where I'm from it's a bit better because we have 4-5 bigger parties that can win seats and effect change but in reality it's not really the case. the elections are always won by either Labor(centre left) or liberal( centre right but more right wing these days).  The vast majority of all media is owned by Murdoch and is aligned with the US and the LNP which is a coalition of the liberal party and the national part(also right). They also are bankrolled by big business and fossil fuels and any company that wants to see workers rights eroded.   Of the other sizeable parties - one nation(far right), UAP far right), Greens(far left) only the greens would ever consider giving their preferences to Labor.   So a vote for either UAP, The National party or One Nation is in essence a vote for the Liberal Party and a.lot of people don't understand the preference system so they don't know this.  Add to the mix that UAP doesn't actually expect to win anything. They were created just to spout lies and right wing propaganda for the LNP whilst keeping their won hands clean.   And IF the Labor party overcomes all these obstacles and actually wins then they can look forward to being assassinated in the news for the next 3 years to make sure they lose in a landslide come next election. And if that doesn't work the US will straight up remove them like they did last time.  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/23/gough-whitlam-1975-coup-ended-australian-independence	1643927911.0	hvhervr	t3_sjdw4r	t1_hvg4dd5	/r/russia/comments/sjdw4r/this_is_sadly_most_conversations_with_people/hvhervr/

9igxbffy	It's simple, really.  The US government can order the families of US diplomats out.  It's part of their condition of employment.  The US government can't order US citizens in general to leave their place of residence without a substantial legal reason.  Just look at how we deal with Hurricanes.  Generally, there are several days warnings of imminent danger.  The smart thing for everybody to do is to Get Out of The Way.  State and local authorities will strongly suggest that people evacuate the area but many people don't.  Instead, we wind up wasting a lot of resources fishing them out of the area that's been flooded and destroyed.  It would be so much simpler if the governments could just order everybody to evacuate, but they can't.	1643928302.0	hvhfrxp	t3_siz550	t3_siz550	/r/russia/comments/siz550/americans_in_ukraine_are_a_gulf_of_tonkin_waiting/hvhfrxp/

81m0xpo6	I joined shortly before this 'Ukrainian conflict', but the propaganda here in USA has ALWAYS been intense when it comes to Russia. Perhaps there's something to it, perhaps not.  Russian language is very attractive in my opinion,  and a lot of beautiful, heart-wrenching, thought provoking books and music have come from Russia. I want to know more outside of our government's tit-for-tat. I wanna know more abt the people, the culture, I wanna see the good and bad in all its glory.   The only way anything will ever get better in this world is if one decides to connect to the other. We must choose to understand eachother. It will only expand our minds, and our hearts. Perhaps that's the naivety in me, but its still something I think worth pursuing. That's why I joined.	1643930883.0	hvhm6yn	t3_sjm3xg	t3_sjm3xg	/r/russia/comments/sjm3xg/hey_rrussia_is_growing_fast_this_is_our_fastest/hvhm6yn/

For starters Australia has stripped the Nation of the right to bare arms, while i already know you are going to say that it's a ""'stupid"" right history has taught us that regimes that are the very worst tend to disarm the people first.     2 The destruction of Freedom of movement and the human right for a man to be with his family, i do not care what justification you have, a man who is not a threat should have the right to be with his family if he so chooses, to deny a family this right and to divide families is evil.     3 the destruction of freedom of speech, remember that pregnant woman who was arrested for making a facebook post that called for a peaceful and lawful protest?     this reminds me, 4 public gatherings (unless it supports the state's agenda) is banned and you do not have the right to peacefully protest.     5 Travel in and out of the Country is now illegal, now one can get in, no one can get out.     6 your government refused to stand up for Assange when the British and the Americans came for him, he is now in Solitary confinement and treated worse then a animal and the government did nothing to save one of their own citizens from this.

There are different strategies for investing, in the growth of the share price or in dividends. There is an Individual Investment Account type a, it allows you not to pay tax on income from the difference in purchase and sale prices upon closing. IIS type b allows you to return part of the personal income tax that you pay. There is an easier option - if you own shares for more than 3 years, then when selling from a regular brokerage account, then no tax is charged.	1643938562.0	hvi45jt	t3_sjz63g	t3_sjz63g	/r/russia/comments/sjz63g/buying_or_owning_securities_in_russia/hvi45jt/

661tt2jn	Well it helped keep your state to zero, meanwhile in mine we spent two years in and out of stage 4 lockdowns with the added bonus of curfews and 5km radius limits, all being surveyed and patrolled by drones and police helicopters. The premier recently just passed a bill which took any parliamentary discretion out of the process which grants him the ability to enforce these measures. If we didn't like it and wanted to leave for a different country we were not able to because of the closed border policy. And ok sure, if the majority of people support these extreme measures then I guess in a democratic system those who disagree just have to suck it up, but at least from my perspective it made Australia seem like an authoritarian hell. Add on that the only realistic alternative to this party probably would have done exactly the same thing if they were put into that situation.   And yeah I know you're probably going to disagree on a lot of this and say that all these extreme measures were worth it being from QLD (?) I guess, but at least try and put yourself into someone from VIC's shoes and imagine the last 2 years.	1643939026.0	hvi56jz	t3_sjdw4r	t1_hvhum2i	/r/russia/comments/sjdw4r/this_is_sadly_most_conversations_with_people/hvi56jz/

4bre38v9	1. You actually can have guns but there‚Äôs a stricter licensing process than in the US which is a good thing, considering the last mass shooting in Australia was in the late 1900‚Äôs while there was one just 2 days ago in California! 2. I agree with you that a person should be able to see their family but you said a person who is not a threat. At the very least the person could be endangering the lives of immunocompromised if they are infected. If not then yes they should be able to travel but now that pretty much everyone is vaccinated that isn‚Äôt really an issue anyway. 3. How can you say that freedom of speech is destroyed when there have been plenty of protests happening over the past few months? And do people not have access to the internet anymore? Everyone is expressing their opinions freely, BUT of course there are consequences for someone organising a massive gathering at the height of the pandemic in Victoria, which goes for any event not not just one against lockdowns etc. I think any large gatherings at this time were irresponsible. 4. Again, there have been plenty of protests happening both related to covid and not. The only time this was restricted was at the height of the pandemic in various regions, but even then a few still happened with social distancing and so on 5. No, it‚Äôs not. I could get on a plane to anywhere I want right this moment, international borders were opened ages ago 6.

7bpc8z8	The person on the photograph is Sobolev Danilovich. During WWII he was a navigator in the 717 light bomber regiment of the 242 night bomber air division. He was flying in the Polikarpov Po-2 plane that the Germans called the "sewing machines", they were a quiet biplane that would often sneak up to the enemy unnoticed, they were flown on bombing missions at night because during daytime they were very vulnerable.   In 1942 he was awarded the order of the Red Banner for: On 17.3.42 he bombed the enemy defensed near village Beliy Bor, he went on 11 night combat missions, dropped 2200kg of bombs. On 20.3.42 he made 10 night combat missions to bomb enemy defenses near MTS Lychkovo, despite the heavy anti aircraft artillery fire he dropped 2000kg of bombs on the enemy. In the period of 28th to 30th of March he was bombing the enemy accumulation of manpower near Kozlovo, Kolyshkino and Kudrovo, overcoming heavy anti aircraft barrage fire he went accurately at the objective, he made 24 combat flights and dropped 4800kg of bombs on the heads of the Germans. Overall over the period of 15 March to 4 April 1942 Sobolev completed 86 night combat flights, and dropped 16,800kg of bombs on the heads of the Germans. Overall combat flight hours of Sobolev are 79hrs. Sobolev is considered the best navigator in the squadron.   On July 12, 1942 he flew a combat mission on his Po-2 plane to the village of Ramushevo and did not come back. He had a wife Efimya Mironovna in the city of Krasnoyarsk.   Further research online reveals that Sobolev‚Äôs body was found in June of 1996 near the village of Omychkino. His body was buried July 11th 1996 in Staraya, Russia.	1643940602.0	hvi8reu	t3_sk1ctj	t3_sk1ctj	/r/russia/comments/sk1ctj/ww2_fallen_soviet_air_force_member_sobolev/hvi8reu/

Or they could make an agreement with Ukraine to give the Ukrainian government military aid, if Ukraine agrees to let an independence referendum take place. If Ukraine doesn't want Russian soldiers in it's land it has the right ( as long as they don't attack Russia.)

hvp2lljs	Many remember the monstrous intentions of Nazi Germany in the defeated states of Europe. However, the plans of the Allies after the victory over Germany, which had been developed since 1943, were no less cruel. How did the United States and Great Britain see the future of the German people, and why did they prefer to forget about this plan?   The program for the post-war organization of Germany by the Americans was called the Morgenthau plan.   The program forever deprived Germany of independence, divided it into many states and destroyed all the industrial achievements of the Germans over the past 400 years.   The division of the Central Bank of Germany into 11 banking districts, a ban on interaction between them. A complete ban on foreign trade, import restrictions, a ban on sea fishing. The destruction of all heavy industry.   True, in 1948 the program to destroy the German nation had to be curtailed. The Morgenthau program was replaced by the Marshall Plan, which, on the contrary, was aimed at the restoration of Germany.   What influenced this decision? Cold War. The Soviet Union was not aimed at the destruction of the Germans, despite all the suffering they caused. On the contrary, the country focused on the development of German industry and the creation of a pro-Soviet government.    Franklin Roosevelt proposed the creation of five autonomous states instead of a united Germany, Winston Churchill also advocated the dismemberment of Germany, emphasizing the need to separate Bavaria, Baden, and W√ºrttemberg from Germany. Churchill proposed to include these territories together with Austria and Hungary in a separate Danube confederation. Stalin opposed the division of Germany. Here are his words: "The experience of history says that the Hitlers come and go, but the German people, but the German state remains!"   https://sun9-24.userapi.com/impf/veNCmWcfxej2tDjMGOnlZgqs3TNYPkwX-3YkVQ/9myKZrmLNcQ.jpg?size=0x0&quality=90&proxy=1&sign=a3ea5b4509acad362d7102e08da6736d&c\_uniq\_tag=8awo4o7aEq-tg8kd6e9mcYVw1dNOhfg\_5xR0EVEv2vY&type=video\_thumb	1643946857.0	hvimm88	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvi0ov8	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvimm88/

Even before I had my doubts, with all that war mongering, speaking about "Russian invasion" out of nothing, whole that evacuating diplomats nonsense, meanwhile sending weapons to Ukraine... It didn't make any sense to me unless it is actually Ukraine who would attack first. And when Russia would react, so to protect Donbass people, they would claim its Russia invading/attacking first.

hvp2lljs	>we have a long history of Russian interference in our affairs.....?   are you serious ?????   In the occupied lands of the USSR, the Romanians unleashed a policy of genocide and terror against the Gypsies, Jews, "Bolsheviks". Antonescu supported Hitler's policy of "racial purity" and considered it necessary to clear the territory of "Greater Romania" from "Bolshevism" and "racially unclean" peoples. He said the following: ‚ÄúI will not achieve anything if I do not cleanse the Romanian nation. Not borders, but the homogeneity and purity of the race give strength to the nation: this is my highest goal. A plan was developed to exterminate all the Jews of Romania. First of all, they planned to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transnistria, after their ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù, they planned to exterminate the Jews in Romania itself, in total there were about 700 thousand people in these territories. The process of creating ghettos, concentration camps began, the largest of them - Vertyuzhansky, Securensky and Edintsky. https://cont.ws/uploads/pic/2019/2/Romanians%20fascists.jpg   https://pastvu.com/\_p/a/i/v/2/iv277fa2zo7qpzsph3.jpg   During the occupation, the Romanians established laws that were supposed to clean out everything Russian from Odessa and other settlements. All books in Slavic languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere confiscated from libraries and private collections of the city, which were later burned on a huge fire. A strict decree was issued prohibiting the use of the Russian language by civilians.   The Romanian secret police of Siguranza had instruments of torture, as did the German Gestapo.   The Romanians got the name - "Death Marches": they marched in the winter, those lagging behind and unable to walk were shot on the spot, pits were dug for every 10 km, where they buried the half-dead and the corpses of the dead. The camps of Transistria were overcrowded, a huge number of people died from hunger, cold and disease, before their execution.   The district of Golta was called the "Kingdom of Death", the largest concentration camps in Romania were located here - Bogdanovka, Domanevka, Akmachetka and Mostovoye. In the winter of 1941-1942, large-scale mass executions of prisoners were carried out in these concentration camps. Romanian executioners shot 40 thousand unfortunate prisoners in just a few days, another 5 thousand were burned alive in Bogdanovka. According to some reports, only during this period, 250 thousand Jews were destroyed here !!!!   Of the 18 Romanian divisions stationed in the southern direction, 16 suffered heavy losses, were actually defeated. In total, during the war, Romania lost 800 thousand people, of which 630 thousand people were on the Eastern Front (of which 480 thousand were killed).   However, later the USSR returned the former Romanian conductor (leader) back to Romania, where, after a trial in Bucharest, he was sentenced to death as a war criminal.   Under the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947, the USSR established an unlimited military presence in Romania.   Over the past 130 years, Russian-Romanian relations have gone through serious trials. Two world wars swept over Russia and Romania. We had to restore diplomatic ties twice. Thanks to the generosity of SSSR Transylvania finally returned to Romania.   We must remember the bloody tears of fascism, we must prevent its restoration in new forms. We must understand that any fascism is a threat to human dignity and the right to freedom!	1643950749.0	hviufk4	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvetu3d	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hviufk4/

hvp2lljs	Hey dude, did you escape from the asylum?   What is communism?    The communist government uses this idea. There is public ownership and control over industry and resources (mines, factories and factories). The goal is that there should be no different social classes, that there should be neither rich nor poor.   All people will be equal.   To be effective, communism requires a delicate balance and the equal participation of all people. This may seem simple enough, but it can actually be very difficult. That is why it has failed in many countries that have tried to do so.   The main principle of communism: "To each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"   Capitalism (fuck it) is a social system in which one class of the population (capitalists 10 percent of the population) owns enterprises, factories, firms, industrial enterprises and even the bowels of the earth) and profits from the fact that another class (wage workers are modern slaves 90 percent) of the population) serve these capitalists    The inevitable companion of capitalism is unemployment, since the main goal of the capitalist is to extract the greatest profit!   don't be an idiot!!!!!!!!	1643951773.0	hviwcrn	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvidorx	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hviwcrn/

They‚Äôre on the border of Ukraine with tanks. They are a war machine run by Putin. It might be a great country but when does the next generation get to pick its own leader. It‚Äôs like having a corrupt cruel leader with KGB tactics for a president. It‚Äôs time for the younger generation of Russians to choose a new leader. My grandparents were Lithuanians I don‚Äôt think they like the Russians since they deported most of the family to Siberia and raided the churches.I‚Äôm neutral but I wish they‚Äôd work on their own problems and stay out of our elections. Everybody wants peace but you‚Äôll never have it with the Russian government and Putin. Choose a young dynamic progressive leader it‚Äôs your generation not that of a lifetime kgb president.

hvp2lljs	Biden said he would approve gender reassignment surgery for 8 year olds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The transition from woman to man intensified dramatically during the Obama and Biden years. The girls remained bald, bearded, breastless, ovarianless, with a permanently lowered voice and distorted genitals, at risk of a myriad of physical and mental problems, and their feminine identity was erased.   About 5% of all American girls can now self-identify as transgender or non-binary. About 50% or more may have a diagnosis of autism or undiagnosed autism. Some suffer from mental disorders. But gender transition is so popular right now, and the risks are so well hidden, that many young people without major mental illness or autism may be involved in it.   The American dream: change from female to male and become a passive faggot.   These are the idiots who live in the USA and want to become presidents!!!!   What about eight years?

661tt2jn	In my opinion for much of the lockdowns the restrictions were adhered to by the absolute majority of people. I think as time went on especially during late 2021 people weren't complying as much, at least that was evident from the protests. Though I did realise that when journalists were uncovering the incompetent handling of hotel quarantine in early to mid 2020, the language from the government shifted from initially being pretty encouraging, to shifting the blame onto ordinary people. I believe this was an attempt to deflect responsibility for their HQ mess ups and avoid political consequence. During that period I believe their was almost completely compliance, yet the story from the government really wasn't matching up to the sight of completely empty city streets.  Anw I told myself at the start of the year I wouldn't ponder on this anymore so I should probably stop talking here and move on, and at least I got the chance to improve my Russian throughout lockdown so I guess not all is bad lol	1643952607.0	hvixwoc	t3_sjdw4r	t1_hvi8vbi	/r/russia/comments/sjdw4r/this_is_sadly_most_conversations_with_people/hvixwoc/

5s8jhhuq	You're, yet again, using words you don't understand while immediately making brash judgements from them. You see the verbiage and don't even bother to look up the definition. Within formally agrarian countries, like the USSR and PRC, nations that had become socialist couldn't introduce policies without yet developing their forces and industrializing the various sectors. The dictatorship of the proletariat existed side by side with the markets while the bourgeois were kept in check. As Lenin himself said;  >"*The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class.* ***Our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is represented not by the bourgeoisie****, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry*."  So yes, China does have corporations, so what? Only a leftcom or ultra pushes the dogmatic idea that AES cannot have markets. Not only is it historical revisionism but it ignores the material conditions of the state that adopts it. The [USSR had the New Economic Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy) which introduced the private sector temporarily, China has SWCC and [Deng's market reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform), [Vietnam and Laos also a socialist market economy](https://developingeconomics.org/2021/01/11/the-socialist-market-economy-in-china-vietnam-and-laos-a-development-model-to-embrace/), even [Cuba has begun introducing a private sector](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55967709) to survive against the brutal sanctions of the west. That doesn't mean socialism doesn't exist. All countries still have a centrally planned economy where collectivization has been applied while the workers control the means of production.   Also, using the term "authoritarian" again while I already explained all states are inherently so just shows you refuse to read anything I say while repeating the same arguments, and misinformation. Name-calling and whining isn't a retort. Also, what the fuck does it mean to be a "unironic communist"? I *am* a communist. As are many, many members here which makes me wonder why are you here other than to push lies and propaganda? Or is it to harass other users who don't bow down to US hegemony?	1643954589.0	hvj1e7c	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvgb8tf	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvj1e7c/

bci24ojc	**[New Economic Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy)**     >The New Economic Policy (NEP) (Russian: –Ω–æ–≤–∞—è —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ (–ù–≠–ü), tr. novaya ekonomicheskaya politika) was an economic policy of the Soviet Union proposed by Vladimir Lenin in 1921 as a temporary expedient. Lenin characterized the NEP in 1922 as an economic system that would include "a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control," while socialized state enterprises would operate on "a profit basis". The NEP represented a more market-oriented economic policy (deemed necessary after the Russian Civil War of 1918 to 1922) to foster the economy of the country, which had suffered severely since 1915.   **[Chinese economic reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform)**     >The Chinese economic reform or reform and opening-up, known in the West as the opening of China, is the program of economic reforms termed "Socialism with Chinese characteristics" and "socialist market economy" in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Led by Deng Xiaoping, often credited as the "General Architect", the reforms were launched by reformists within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on December 18, 1978, during the "Boluan Fanzheng" period. The reforms went into stagnation after the military crackdown on 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, but were revived after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1643954615.0	hvj1fqo	t3_sj5igh	t1_hvj1e7c	/r/russia/comments/sj5igh/pretty_much/hvj1fqo/

hvp2lljs	Of course, it's easier to be ignorant, especially if there are sawdust in the head instead of brains!  the main difference between the Sputnik V and Pfizer vaccines:   the American vaccine was developed very quickly on a completely new basis.    As for the Russian drug, it was produced on developments since 2002, which were undergoing clinical trials on humans.   US halts coronavirus vaccine trial due to severe side effects   By the way, the United States has rich experience in killing people with its vaccines and potions, and according to the law adopted in the late 80s,    and these companies cannot be judged!!!!!   Six people have died during trials of a coronavirus vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German company BioNTech, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report says.   The entire "civilized" world hoped for the United States! You were like a ray of light in a dark realm! And now what? Will everyone have to buy an "unfinished" not "democratic", as you said, vaccine from Russia? What have you done!   For the Americans, instead of bringing their vaccine to perfection, they only had this intelligence enough to impose sanctions against six Russian laboratories and institutes. And they summed up the reason - they say, Russia, under the guise of a vaccine, is developing chemical and bacteriological weapons. And 50 countries have already lined up for the Russian vaccine!   And Phizer, which poisons the population of the planet for decades !!!!!

hvp2lljs	HOW JAPANESE MOTHERS DEMANDED THE SOVIET VACCINE   In Japan, in the 1950s and 1960s, a real tragedy unfolded: thousands of cases of polio were recorded in a small country. Only a live vaccine produced in the USSR could stop the epidemic. But registering and issuing permission to use it was very difficult. Then the mothers of children with polio took to the streets, demanding permission to import the Soviet vaccine. They got their way: 20 million Japanese children were saved from the threat of disease.	1643955330.0	hvj2m72	t3_sjkzzn	t1_hvgh9pz	/r/russia/comments/sjkzzn/russia_announces_retaliation_over_rt_de_ban_in/hvj2m72/

4rgna	Tell this to Georgia. I don‚Äôt think that the Ukrainian regime is any more mentally stable or sensible than Saakashvilli was in 2008. They‚Äôve been talking about taking over DNR/LNR is an ‚ÄúOperation Storm‚Äù style, massive ‚Äúlighting offensive‚Äù for years. The objective would be to quickly overrun the separatists and cause millions of ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù refugees to run across the border to Russia, and get entrenched before Russia can respond. It did work for Croatians in Serpska Krajina. With covert but massive US support, they managed to strike and ethnically cleanse the area of all Serbs, without too many straight out massacres, before Serbia could react. Plus, if you watched Ukrainian TV (like I do), you‚Äôd know that most of their hawks have actually deluded themselves into thinking that they can hold their own against Russia. In addition, they currently have twice as many troops in the area than Russia does. Even with Russia‚Äôs overwhelming heavy equipment superiority, when it comes to a defensive kind of war (after Ukrainians  already took over the Donbas), things could be in their favor in some ways. I mean, there‚Äôs no doubt that Russia can kick them out, but at a pretty heavy cost, making them hesitant to do so. All of this, might make it worth the gamble for Ukrainians.	1643955643.0	hvj34pn	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvj1490	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvj34pn/

The entire conflict is not even about Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúdemocracy or Western integration‚Äù‚Ä¶ The sequence of actions that US is counting on is: 1. US gets Ukraine to provoke Russia into some military action; 2. A long list of Western sanctions kicks in automatically against Russia; 3. Russia counters that by either reducing or cutting off gas supply to Europe. 4. US & UK says ‚ÄúI told you so - the pipeline is a political weapon Russians always wanted to use‚Äù. 5. US rushes liaising various agreements on alternative energy supplies to Europe (surely US companies will have a major stake in this) and thus secures the EU market for itself 6.

2esd7jrm	Crimea was a part of Russia historically. It was transferred over to Ukraine while they were a part of the same Union.  Eastern Ukraine is highly Russian, ethnically, culturally, and lingually.  Western Ukraine is more aligned with Western Europe and the United States.  The current government was installed by the US.  It's so close to the US as to personally pay bribes to the President of the US via his son.   Eastern Ukrainians feel unrepresented and oppressed by the current government.  Under these circumstances Crimea voted to secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia.  This was done lawfully.  The US and it's Ukrainian fascist allies attempted to prevent the secession by force.  Russia insisted Crimea's sovereignty be respected.    You are two faced.  You will bitch about Hong Kong and Taiwan but take the opposite position if it is disadvantagous to your country's national interest.  You are nothing but an opportunist.   You want to talk about amassing troops, but you are too ignorant to have a respected opinion.  Why is Ukraine so unstable? Was capitalism not so good for it?  When you speak of the bulkanization of a region are you too stupid to know what that term historically refers to?  You want to talk about history but you are a moron. Please explain NATO's invasion and overthrow of Yugoslavia and tell me again how America is the defender of Ukraine. The US has already destroyed Ukraine.  The country is already a husk and it is you who did it.    If you have an opinion the Ukrainian malitia takes volunteers.  Go and join them at the Russian border.	1643958780.0	hvj7y8q	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvj47qv	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvj7y8q/

d0vulrjn	Nah Ukraine was so unstable because its economic was so connected to Russia it has to start over. Im polish and i know that Krimea historically belonged to Russia, but instead of marching your troops right away dis you ever negotiate. If eastern Ukraine is populated by russians then why not just talk about it. Make them autonomous by negotiating. NATO intervention in Yugoslavia happened too late to make Yugoslavia fall (after Tito‚Äôs death it was already falling apart) not even talking about the fact USA helped Yugoslavia When USSR wanted yo incorporate it to the eastern block. Honkong is a part of China that i can agree with, Taiwan is debatable.

32nd3	At no point did I even remotely hint to that.    But the casualties before 1941 (the point where Soviet and Nazi Germany became enemies) and after 1945 where not committed by German Nazis.  If you check that at a certain date the population should be X and it turns out it significantly less than that then its hard to distinguish when or where that happened. The official sources claim 1.5 - 1.8 million died in Gulags but that number is extremely uncertain and not every political "dissident" lived to see a Gulag. Not to mention starvation in the 1930's and post war (which could be seen as Nazi casualties).    Is this making things clearer for you?      I do not think Nazis wanted to ethnically cleanse the Soviet Union much like the Soviet did not want to cleanse Poland. But the treatment of the civilian population and captured armed forces where extremely cruel and harsh.	1643959516.0	hvj8zze	t3_sij237	t1_hvgvp6e	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvj8zze/

13fkk2	r/worldnews brought me here  the anti Russia propaganda is absurd and these people actually think they're spitting facts smh.    I live in USA and moved here in 99 from the far East in Amur. I was born in a town called Dalnerechensk. Grandfather is Ukranian and his distant family lives there. On fathers side, my aunt is Ukranian, and the same thing her distant family all live there. I visited my distant Ukranian family in Ukraine in 2006(I know it's been a while), and had a blast. They live in outskirts of Kiev and what a beautiful city that is.     The comment that ticked me off in r/worldnews that ticked me off was some poster saying that the reason that "Ukraine is training children to fight is because Putin will indiscriminately bomb civilian areas, so they might as well get a fighting chance" and that comment had many upvotes.   All I have to say is I doubt I am far from the only Russian to have family in Ukraine. I would bet that our air force pilots, marines, army, naval personal have tons of people who have a similar story to mine, and would have a very hard time bombing/shooting/firing missiles at Ukrainian civilians. A crazy order like that from Putin(if we play devils advocate), would make our entire military turn on him. That's what as lot of these western mindless drones saying this stupid shit don't get.

How many people are starving today in Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Afghanistan due to your evil and genocidal sanctions.  While there's no respectable evidence for Holidimor as you would have it, there is overwhelming and undeniable evidence of Churchhill's causing a truly genocidal famine in India. The language is not hyperbole. Scholars refer to it as a genocidal act.  You care so much for a famine in the USSR and nothing for the worse crimes done with undeniable intent by you and your ally.   Famine follow war.  You can tell a lie one thousand times and it will still be a lie.

Photo was taken at specific angle and at specific time of day, plus there were some filters, as a result it looks E-E-EVIL and menacing. Someone found another photo of this exact hotel, at another angel and time of day without filters. It's looks pretty normal, though you can say that building needs some renovations.   This is can be partly applied to tic toc videos. My hometown have a lot of old soviet buildings, but despite them being old, town authorities paint them, apply patterns, even multicolored masonry is applied to new houses, in the form of historical characters or animals.

c0nna1mt	We have long proposed the Minsk agreements. You can read them on Wikipedia. The Minsk agreements propose the decentralization of power. It works, it's made in the USA and Russia. Our people living in the republic (we have 22 republics) can speak their native language, have their own laws and their own president. No one forces Chechens or Tatars to abandon their culture, customs and religion. People live the way they like. This would solve the problem in the Donbas and there would be no seizure of Crimea if the Ukrainian authorities wanted their citizens well. Unfortunately, these authorities are not the authorities of Ukraine. These are the puppets of those corporations. I want to note that the corporate lobby is not a problem of the USA or the West, it is a problem of all mankind. We also have large capital in Russia, whose interests may contradict the interests of the state.	1643962165.0	hvjcoug	t3_sjdgr1	t1_hvgs0xx	/r/russia/comments/sjdgr1/can_we_all_agree_on_one_thing/hvjcoug/

35hvl8y6	>Let me hear your great wisdom about the Gulags.  It's funny how you think you know the stuff enough to make sarcastic comments, yet in fact you don't know a thing. Hell, you didn't even bother to look at the article you linked! Now let me enlighten you...  GULag - –ì–£–õ–ê–ì - **–ì**–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ **–£**–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ **–õ–ê–ì**–µ—Ä–µ–π - is a short for General Department of Camps or Chief Departmnet of Camps. An up to day Ministry of Justice, if you want.  Referring to any single camp as Gulag is a dumb Hollywood cliche. For example, the US has a Federal Bureau of Prisons. Imagine if we referred to every prison as a BOP? A BOP here, a BOP there, a BOP over there...  Now, since we've figured out the names, I'd like to address some of your previous statements:  >Not only German PoWs went to Gulags.  Except they didn't. The settlements and prisons under Gulag were for Soviet citizens only. German PoWs were sent to special PoWs camps under GUPVI, another division of NKVD. And released Soviet PoWs went to the third division, filtration camps supervised by SMERSH. 3 different departments with different goals and conditions, yet you've managed to unify them all, bravo.  >Quite a lot of civilians as well  A lot in absolute numbers, not so much if we look at percentage. Modern historians tend to say there was 10, 25, 50, 100, 1000 million of prisoners of Gulag. Yet, if we stop using mr. Solzhenytsin as a source and refer to the stats, the picture may seem quite different.  For example, do you think 600-800 prisoners per 100,000 of population is too much? It is. Yet it's \~ 500 for modern Russia and 600+ for modern US. Everything is known in comparison.

1s39qcge	Russia tends to use citizenship giveaways to have legit excuse of intervention in the "contested" regions on the favourable side. International right doesn't explicitly operate like that but, well, it provides some sort of moral high-ground, allowing our officials to say "we are just protecting our citizens, nothing more". This is how that happened during war of 08.08.08: in Southern Osetia there were plenty of Russian citizens (still being Osetians), though main casus belli there was of course attack on Russian peacemakers, previosly being placed there on a fully legal basis.   *** At first Donetsk and Lugansk were calling for federalisation and more local authority to set own language and economic policies. Region is sort of heavily dependent on trade with Russia, there are plenty of relatives across the border, so economic and culture ties were quite significant. Unfortunately, the self proclaimed in 2014 (there weren't election yet so term would be correct) new Ukrainian government weren't willing to negotiate and show their weakness, especially seeing how it went in Crimea. They were brought in power on the wave of quite nationalistic protest, so as you could guess, sometimes you have to follow your own agenda, which you have created yourself, or be buried under it.  It was of course, a bit more complex than just stand-off between Moscow and Kiev. You have to understand that Ukraine is divided due to historical reasons, by a Dnieper river: there is left-bank Ukraine and right-bank Ukraine. Left-bank was always more pro-Russian region in the fight for power between Russia and Poland, but right-bank was more Polish-aligned due to Poland being able to establish tighter control over locals. After Poland was no more, the division was inhereted by Russian Empire and later USSR - eastern Ukraine was rapidly developing in terms of local industry since 19th century, and western Ukraine was more an agricultural hub, so it affected demographics spread and formation of own influence groups inside one state.   Long story short, post-1991 Ukraine had two noteable oligarchic groups, again in the East and in the West. They have competed for power and having own representatives in Kiev, ideally in the chair of President  himself. Deposed president Yanukovich was from the East. Don't let this fact confuse you: he wasn't Russian patriot or something, he just could play "Russian card" when things got nasty for him, and association with EU terms didn't look good for him and his chances to stay in power. Russia was still in the dreams of own analogue of EU so of course, immediately accepted the offer of joining Russia to the Customs union. That has triggered a lot of Ukraininan nationalists (and probably Western politicians who didn't appreciate so rapid change of plans) and it let to the Maidan.   After Maidan victory, Eastern oligarchic group found themselves vulnerable - their president was running for his life, opposing group was making themselves comfortable in Kiev. So they found nothing cleverer than to play the card of "locals don't like you but support us, so don't touch our assets and we are good". As locals weren't told that they, with their pro-Russian sentiments, were just a bargain chip in the negotiations of oligarchs, it all spiraled out of control. Russian nationalists, already inspired by Crimea annexation, have declared it a "Russian Spring" and started gathering volunteer groups to cross the border with "rebellious" Eastern regions and stand with locals. Kiev, seeing how whole region may follow the footsteps of Crimea, decided to act with force (have already explained up there, why the were no negotiations attempts), and so that got ugly really fast.  ***  Keep in mind, this is still quite a brief explanation with plenty of oversimplifications. I tried to explain key factors, but to fully cover a picture, you would already need something of the size of huge historical monography, starting the story in Medieval, even before Mongols.	1643964268.0	hvjfgkr	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvjcdt1	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvjfgkr/

It gave the percentage division of control over Eastern European countries, dividing them  into spheres of influence. Franklin Roosevelt was consulted tentatively and conceded to the agreement. The content of the agreement was first made public by Churchill in 1953 in the final volume of his memoir.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1643967795.0	hvjjv9e	t3_sk5k7k	t1_hvjju3f	/r/russia/comments/sk5k7k/me_after_spending_1_hour_in_reurope/hvjjv9e/

Africa and South America have a shit ton of natural resources, go there and teach them on how to build their countries we don't need your "help" here  > You guys should be by now as rich as norwegians .  Or we could be as poor as the congolese lol. Also, check the oil volume sold per person in Norway and Russia. They sell a shit ton more of raw resources per person than we do. And stop measuring success in simply material terms. We love our country and we don't want to be another Norway.  > look at what 20 years of Putin did to you  Are you delusional?!?! Are you really comparing modern Russia to that of 2000?!

75hhm	Norwegian here.  I think the propaganda goes both ways. Politicians do all the fighting over our heads. But on the people's level, it's not really hateful. It's just that politicians and their propaganda make us believe that Russia (and its people) have ill intents. Some people believe in this propaganda, and it sparks a conflict on the people's level too. But these people are already idiots for having bought into the messaging.  In the end, politicians have to lay their dicks on the table and measure it. But they're politicians. They have tiny dicks.	1643968864.0	hvjl7aa	t3_sk5k7k	t1_hvj049s	/r/russia/comments/sk5k7k/me_after_spending_1_hour_in_reurope/hvjl7aa/

6n2veewj	When the scene at the grave of the female pilots was filmed, a jet plane flew over the filming location, leaving an inversion trail in the sky. During the WWII such aircraft have not yet been created. The director wanted to reshoot the scene, but actor Alexey Smirnov (the performer of the role of the aircraft mechanic Makarych), himself a former front-line soldier, said that he did not agree to reshoot anything, because if he had to play the farewell scene with the girls again, his heart would stop and he would die. The scene was left as it is, the trace of the plane in the sky is visible, but this did not affect the quality of the film in any way. This is a poignant film about the war and those who did not return from it, about guys and girls who seen and felt so much that they became "old" in just 20-25 years.	1643969066.0	hvjlg6h	t3_sk8umy	t3_sk8umy	/r/russia/comments/sk8umy/and_the_steppe_grass_smells_bitterstills_from_the/hvjlg6h/

He consistently has brought forward fake news about his own country, and he organised protests that broke many laws, including the covid-time kaws against public gatherings. He has done this to live a good life, financially, but in the end his bluff was called and his whole operation ran into sand.

3twhvtgv	Is there some timeline of recent Ukraine situation from Russia's point of view?    I feel that Russia's point of view is not fully exposed in western information sphere, therefore I  would be grateful if someone shared some analytical sources about how Russia sees/informs about this conflict (can be in Russian).         From what I see in western information sphere: current tensions were initiated by substantial military movement closer to Ukraine border in Russia's side. Then requests about  guarantees that Ukraine won't join NATO, etc. were issued by Russia, which were not fulfilled fully and economic sanctions were promised in case of intervention into Ukraine. Additional (though not significant in numbers) NATO military forces relocated to Eastern Europe, Ukraine gets some support in weapons and equipment. So basically all escalation is coming from Russia and Ukraine with NATO/USA help just reacts with defensive measures.         It seems that there is no motive or benefit for USA/NATO/Ukraine to raise tensions between Ukraine and Russia. And Russian intentions apart from increasing geopolitical influence (more influence in Ukraine or at least Ukraine's neutrality, stopping NATO expansion, etc.) does not seem feasible to me.         These speculations about potential upcoming attack, full scale operations, false flags etc. feels like pure propaganda, trying to emphasize, exaggerate image of Russian threat, which is not completely unfounded, but usually takes slightly too far by the media.	1643971002.0	hvjnvtw	t3_sk3b08	t3_sk3b08	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvjnvtw/

Soviet union and russia both have had a conscription in place, always, and before you do anymore provocations against Russia, you need to remember that it can, if it is attacked, mobilise probably about 5 million people in a matter of weeks. Also, if anyone attacks Russia, like they do every 100 years or so, these days Russia doesnt have to leave its territory to totally destroy the perpetrator. Look at its defensive weapons s-400, s-500, hypersonic missiles, it can utterly destroy, from faraway, any base or even country that has attacked it and presents an ongoing threat.   Keep this in mind when you do your provocations, and also what happened 75 years ago today, in Volgograd.	1643971467.0	hvjoha4	t3_sk9iu4	t3_sk9iu4	/r/russia/comments/sk9iu4/how_many_of_you_are_worried_about_being/hvjoha4/

And among the young there are a lot of those who were born in wild capitalism and brought up in the "man is a wolf to man" system. In this system, there is no trust between people, there is a need to have a lot of documents, lawyers become an important element. In the USSR, all this was not. The man had a passport, driver's license, some kind of paper for his apartment and that's it. He never thought that anyone would deceive him. The handshake was the best deal. And now a bunch of different papers for everything, legal contracts. At the same time, there are many scammers in absolutely any field who deceive people.

32nd3	Bravo, almost all copy pasta from the wiki and I am well aware that not all types of labor camps in Soviet belonged to the same organisation.      Another quote from the wiki: "English-language speakers also use the word gulag to refer to all forced-labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union"     18.000.000 people passed through the camps between 1923 to 1961 with little to no trial. That qualifies to "quite a lot". Is that the world record? I have no idea.  10% of them died. That is pretty bad, again, is it the worst? Again have no idea.       The point I was making before you felt the need to beat your chest was that quite a lot of people died there not all of them on record. So when calculating who died of what in that time period, this is needed to be taken in to consideration.    The exact numbers does not exist, which was my point.	1643974697.0	hvjstci	t3_sij237	t1_hvjfc3c	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvjstci/
hnvolv0	United Nations laws technically doesnt condone coups, and internal military action. It does oppose annexation, secessions unless the governinc power agrees to it or nations make an agreement on land swaps. Also, you cant even annex land even if the people want you to and or you win a territory in war. I believe the US and USSR supported that law change decades ago as they then didnt want easy border changes globally.   However since then the US has not listened since the end of the Cold war and has supported many seccessions and even invaded foreign nations without a real cause for war (Iraq, Libya, etc) I think only Afghanistan was sort of UN approved as they traced 9/11 attacking masterminds to the Taliban which ruled Afghanistan at the time.	1643974698.0	hvjstef	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvjdzcn	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvjstef/

If there was a war, the US would most likely nuke or attack Denmark to ensure the Russian fleet couldn‚Äôt slip past, as the Danish navy isn‚Äôt strong enough to fight the Russian navy. I would feel much safer with Russian anti air missiles closer to Copenhagen, as it would be better for Russia to protect Denmark, as we‚Äôre a geographical an important strategic point for control of the baltic sea.

hvp2lljs	I do not like it. RT DE has been shut down due to conspiracy theories about the coronavirus, such as Pfizer's vaccine that kills more people than it saves, and animal testing of BioNTech's vaccine reveals dangerous levels of nanoparticles in organs...  Russia, as the heir to the USSR, has vast experience in the development of vaccines, and the best in the world, well, or almost the best. and the West, led by the United States, how much crap they poured out about the Russian vaccine Sputnik?   The West still does not stop trying to discredit the Russian vaccine against coronavirus "Sputnik V", developed by the Russian NITsEM. N. F. Gamalei   A series of pseudo-analytical investigations and eyewitness false testimonies about the alleged danger of the Russian vaccine are being prepared on social networks and Russian-language Internet resources funded by foreign grants.   The West is driven by banal envy and fear of competition - the Russian vaccine, registered the first in the world, turned out to be the most effective among all the analogues being developed, which means it will be more in demand.   The plans of the West to discredit the Russian vaccine not only exist - they have been actively implemented over the past few months. First, it is necessary to continue and actively promote the very noteworthy Russophobia that exists. Russia in the image of absolute evil, where, in principle, there can be nothing good, and even more so there is some kind of vaccine, the first in the world, for a second. The second point, no less important, is that the West needs to clean up the market for its vaccines that will someday appear in this way. So that they do not have competitors, they must behave in a similar way. Here they are doing it all.	1643975749.0	hvjud9n	t3_sjkzzn	t1_hvj3x83	/r/russia/comments/sjkzzn/russia_announces_retaliation_over_rt_de_ban_in/hvjud9n/

Personally I think he's the most relevant political man or his time with Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and I see him a centrist, a practical and very clever man entirely devoted to realpolitik. And when I try to defend Russia among other westerners I pointed out exactly this thing we're talking about here (that Russian nationalists and the far right hate him for his policies) but usually without much success.

4fyxa2p	I'm German and about us it's a kind of love or fear thing. It depends what kind of influence people have (media, family, personal experience with russian culture).  I like russian people, food, music and culture and think, that Russia as a country / society has just different strenghts and different weaknesses than the typical western countries and not everybody can deal with this.  Personally I don't have an actual reason to fear Russia considering what I've read and heard (minus the US/UK narrative). However I really hope that I'm right and Russia's not going to invade Ukraine as it's a great country with great people who deserve peace.     To summarize the recent situation imo there's so much "propagand" from NATO as well as Russia, that it's almost impossible for civil people to understand what's actually going on.	1643977353.0	hvjwug7	t3_sk5k7k	t1_hvj049s	/r/russia/comments/sk5k7k/me_after_spending_1_hour_in_reurope/hvjwug7/

p7h2ze	It is necessary to explain who the oligarchs are in Russia, how they appeared and what attitude the people have towards them. The West does not understand this.    In the USSR, almost all the people were the middle class. Due to the fact that all property belonged to the state of the USSR, that is, to all the people. This allowed all residents to have their own housing, the best education in the world for free at all levels, free medicine, a great vacation with free vouchers to resorts, and so on. All the basic stuff was either free or very cheap.    After the collapse of the USSR, almost all the most profitable USSR assets were given to various adventurers and scammers. So they became these oligarchs with multi-billion dollar fortunes. This led to the collapse of the middle class in the 1990s. More than 90% of the former inhabitants of the USSR became poor, many even starved and died in the chaos of the 90s.    In the minds of Russian people, an oligarch is a thief who needs to nationalize all the factories he has stolen (oil, gas, Norilsk Nickel, and so on) and enterprises in favor of the state.    From the point of view of Putin as the head of state, it is necessary that these oligarchs at least pay taxes and return this money stolen from people from offshore companies to the Russian economy. Compromise. Therefore, he gave them this speech in 2002 and then repeated it several years ago.    You will be surprised. But the news that London would confiscate all the money of the Russian oligarchs in England was received very positively by the Russians. The Russian people generally do not think anything good about England. Usually England only does bad things to us. But if they really do it. We say "thank you". It is clear that they will not return this money to the Russian budget. We perfectly understand the scheme of the British. They collect money from thieves from all over the world in their banks. But the Russian people will be at least morally pleased that these thieves eventually got what they deserved for the chaos of the 90s in Russia and the enormous harm they brought us.	1643977579.0	hvjx7oa	t3_skbhta	t3_skbhta	/r/russia/comments/skbhta/russian_oligarchs_face_sanctions_in_uk_putins/hvjx7oa/

The original film told the true story of the Akita dog named Hachik≈ç who lived in Japan in the 1920s. This version, which places it in a modern American context, was directed by Lasse Hallstr√∂m, written by Stephen P. Lindsey and Kaneto Shindo, and produced by Richard Gere, Bill Johnson and Vicki Shigekuni Wong. The film stars Gere, Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer, Jason Alexander and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.   **[Hachik≈ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik≈ç)**     >Hachik≈ç („Éè„ÉÅÂÖ¨, 10 November 1923 ‚Äì 8 March 1935) was a Japanese Akita dog remembered for his remarkable loyalty to his owner, Hidesabur≈ç Ueno, for whom he continued to wait for over nine years following Ueno's death. Hachik≈ç was born on November 10, 1923, at a farm near the city of ≈ådate, Akita Prefecture. In 1924, Hidesabur≈ç Ueno, a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University, brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo, as his pet. Hachik≈ç would meet Ueno at Shibuya Station every day after his commute home.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1643978788.0	hvjz9p4	t3_skc5ke	t1_hvjz8do	/r/russia/comments/skc5ke/in_kemerovo_a_dog_has_been_sitting_near_the/hvjz9p4/

65n4soj1	That is not bad news. I recently read that DW was started in 1986 as its main quest to spread propaganda against socialist countries, such as yugoslavia and soviet union. Their news are js√•ust awful, but i must say they have very good documentaries, like the recent one about us ‚Äùwar on terror‚Äù. The documentary taught me, for instance, that there are now 3x more terrorists than were in sept 2001 when the war started. I have seen a lot of good documentaries there, but it is not advisable their news, it is pure ‚Äùmanufacturing consent‚Äù.	1643980164.0	hvk1rwh	t3_skccnd	t3_skccnd	/r/russia/comments/skccnd/employees_of_the_deutsche_welle_correspondent/hvk1rwh/

jya24	Pretty successful, I would say. To wit:  * Soviet laws used to be based on principles derived from communist orthodoxy, and had provisions specifically enshrining the special role of the CPSU (beginning with Art. 6 of the Soviet constitution). Modern Russian laws are not based on such principles and have no such provisions. * Indoctrination in communist ideology, which used to permeat Soviet education on all levels, has been removed from curricula. Scholarly works, especially those in social sciences, are not required to pay tribute to Marxist-Leninist classics. * Being a member of the CPSU and its affiliated organizations isn't anymore a necessary prerequisite for a successful career. * The Soviet economic system, based on state property and guaranteed labour, has been dismantled (even too radically, in many cases). Modern Russian economy casts a far greater role to private property and private initiative and profit as the measure of success. * Many characters from among Soviet elites were quite successful in amassing wealth that they can now pass on to their heirs. * Subsidies to former Soviet republics have stopped. Some of them still pay discounted prices for carbohydrates etc., and enjoy other trade preferences, but it's much less burdensome for Russia than direct revenue sharing practiced under the USSR.	1643980505.0	hvk2eys	t3_sk9vjw	t1_hvjtotu	/r/russia/comments/sk9vjw/was_the_fall_of_communism_mostly_optical_within/hvk2eys/

qtb0i	I don't think anyone hates Russians. It's the geopolitical chess people aren't fond of.  We don't like US wars either, just to point out and we all realize stuff like Iraq was deeply wrong but yet we followed.  You see, Europe has long ago gone for "ok stop wars and get rid of borders" policy and we love it. Meanwhile the tensions in eastern Europe kind of prevent this serenity to spread so we don't like them.  In the end you can blame US all you want for many things and I would agree but it's not US that annexed various portions of foreign countries after 1991.  Mind you, I absolutely understand Russian concerns for their own national security, disliking nato bases at their border and ballistic technologies, I absolutely understand disliking Victoria Nuland feeding protesters at Maidan telling them to overthrow a democratically elected government, and many other things.  But still, it's not like looking at Russia you're looking at a beacon of peace, justice and democracy either.  But again, I don't think most hate Russian people nor they care that much.	1643980705.0	hvk2skm	t3_sk5k7k	t1_hvj049s	/r/russia/comments/sk5k7k/me_after_spending_1_hour_in_reurope/hvk2skm/

fxd4ogr6	The Italian GPD is just an example because Italy is a much smaller country. But the Italians usually have a love for Russia and Russians. This goes both ways, two examples would be the Covid help sent from Russia to Italy or the TV show "Ciao". Also, historically there has always been a love for Italians and Italy, a lot of Moscow and Peter monuments were designed by Italian architects.

Here some examples:  - The US started a war against iraq for false pretenses and dragged half the world into the war that created dozens of terrorist attacks in europe, asia, and africa - Egypt beat cameroon in the semifinal of 2022 africa cup - a big storm hit east coast of the us, lots of damage - bidens approval rating is 33% and going down - the 2022 winter olympics have started  These are real news, about something that happened and was reported without opinions, analyses etc. It is not news if you tell people ‚Äùthere may be a storm tomorrow, next week or next month‚Äù or when you write ‚Äùegypt cant win africa cup because the coach is misbehaving‚Äù.

kdcss	They could strip him of power and frame him, like they did with his predecessor.   See, the issue is that the US wants exactly what you think Russia would do. Russia's goal most certainly isn't a prolonged war or casualities on either side. If it was, they would have done the US the pleasure and moved already.   Russia merely seeks to undo the damage the US-instigated undemocratic insurrection has caused in Ukraine, make the Ukraine uphold its promises from the Minsk treaty and make them respect the decision of the citizens in Crimea to join the Russian Federation.	1643982661.0	hvk6ssa	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvk640u	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hvk6ssa/

hvp2lljs	(ISS) is a joint international project involving 14 countries, including: the USA, Russia, Canada, Japan, as well as several European countries acting under the auspices of the European Space Agency. Its design began in 1984, with the order of US President Ronald Reagan, who ordered NASA to develop and build a new orbital space station in 10 years. By the beginning of the 90s, it became clear that the scale and high cost of the project would not allow the United States to create it on its own. The actual construction of the station began in 1998, when Russia, which joined the project, launched the first element of the ISS, the Zarya functional cargo block, into orbit.  Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and American astronaut Robert Cabana were the first to board it.   On July 26, 2000, the Zvezda service module docked with the FGB. It is these three nodes that have become the basic blocks for the start of space cooperation for more than a dozen countries of the world.   In order to fully fulfill their mission, Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd underwent four years of training and education at NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City and at the training center in Munich in Germany to refine the technology conducting many scientific experiments.   Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd established contact with mission control centers in Korolev and Houston. The ISS-1 crew ensured the docking of Progress M1-4 cargo ships in November 2000 and Progress M-44 cargo ships in February 2001 with the station. They also met American shuttles on the ISS - Endeavor in December 2000, Atlantis in February and Discovery in March 2001. In February 2001, the first crew of the ISS assisted in the integration of the American laboratory module Destiny into the ISS.	1643983401.0	hvk8egc	t3_sk81zw	t3_sk81zw	/r/russia/comments/sk81zw/from_the_space_to_bejing_video_from_two_russian/hvk8egc/

ihrckv8m	both, the education system in the US is terrible. but it is not a fault of the average people   It is not even worthy to blame it on the "people" they've been denied, from the very beginning. More people know about a TV show than they do a simple mathematical principle which will serve them their entire live time.     To answer your question 2 though, no the people do not believe, but they are systematically divided along whatever lines may exist. It could be as simple as man vs woman, young vs old, white vs black, the US populace is constantly fighting a running battle everyday. It is even parents vs children.  For many people it is a simple as an extension of early childhood development for the association of sports teams. This team vs that team, it then extends into everyday daily life involving everything. Often it comes down to, sure our own government is disgusting, but your government is more disgusting than mine.  Go visit r/politics/ the people there who hate everyone, certainly hate the people they agree with the most if they were put into the same room as they are in.... and yet it is one of the most popular subs on all of Reddit and it is allowed to continue everyday.

e8qzhr1o	Overall there‚Äôs is a lot of respect for anyone over 50. If you‚Äôre in a crowded public transportation and you‚Äôre young, you are culturally and morally obligated to give up your seat for an older man or woman. Not everyone does this anymore, but it definitely still exists and can be seen on a daily basis.   Plus as said in comments above, that generation didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmess anything up‚Äù the way people in the US think the boomers did (or joke about, anyway). That generation experienced what can be argued as the better era of the Soviet Union and are generally quite mentally solid and very communal and friendly.   Again, not everyone (is definitely ignoring exceptions with this statement) but overall there is not battle between the boomers and the millenials or gen z in Russia.   Not to mention, most people still live with their parents the way they do in Greece. One condo in Moscow can easily support three generations of people living together.

hvp2lljs	The "civilized" Western world against great Russia!   The war will continue until the ‚ÄúRussian question‚Äù is completely resolved, that is, the destruction of the Russian superethnos and Russian civilization with its unique ‚ÄúRussian matrix‚Äù ‚Äì the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãjustice and life in good conscience. Only by destroying the Russian people and the Russian language, by physically destroying Russia, can the West receive the main prize - the planet!    Papal Rome remains the spiritual ideologist of the ‚Äúonslaught on the East‚Äù, on Russia and the Slavic-Russian civilization from the early Middle Ages to the present. The other two "command posts" of the Western project are London and Washington.   Therefore, the Western "elites" have always looked with great surprise, misunderstanding and fear at the "mysterious" Russians, who always, having superiority in military skills (warrior people), did not colonize, did not rob, did not ruin neighboring nationalities, as Western peoples did. .   in particular, if it weren‚Äôt for the revolutions, wars and ‚Äúreforms‚Äù of the 20th century, then there would be about 500 million Russians now, that is, we would be the third ethnic group on the planet in terms of numbers, as at the beginning of the century, after the Chinese and Indians), with each round of development, the Russian super ethnos and Russia are becoming more and more powerful and great nation and power.   Hence the clue to Western Russophobia. The current Russophobia is not due to the fact that the West does not like "bad Putin or Stalin", it has millennial roots. This is the fear of the Russians (‚ÄúRussians are coming‚Äù), which was known both in Ancient Rome and Constantinople, preserved in Paris, London and Washington, which inherit the ancient traditions of confrontation between Russia and the West. This is hatred for Russians, hostility, which expresses the inferiority complex inherent in a less perfect culture in relation to a more perfect one. Misunderstanding and inability to understand a more developed culture, while militarily a more powerful people (the Russians more than once defeated the western hordes, but did not raze Warsaw, Berlin and Paris to the ground as they could), generates genetic, biological fear and envy. The Westerners are afraid of the militant Russians and envy them, they greedily want to take advantage of the riches of the Russian land.	1643986159.0	hvkeqi6	t3_sjnmv0	t1_hvk7w0a	/r/russia/comments/sjnmv0/question_from_an_american_about_the/hvkeqi6/

hvp2lljs	Are you really from another planet?   And this is not only in Germany, this applies to all homosexual Europe!   In Spain, an 8-year-old girl, with the support of a lawyer, won a gender reassignment trial! probably today she sewed a man's dick!   why are you surprised, alien?   A British hospital has advised its staff to refer to mothers as "birth parents", fathers as "second biological parents", and breast milk as "human milk" or "breast milk". It was decided here that too explicit indication of gender could offend people of the so-called non-binary gender, that is, who do not identify themselves as either men or women.   One of the first to get excited was female athletes. Many remember the very recent scandal with the New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard. Previously, her name was Gavin, and after the sex change, Hubbard began to compete in women's championships, immediately taking several gold and silver awards.   In Germany, Switzerland, France, Austria, Scandinavian countries, unique methods of sexual education are generally practiced: they don‚Äôt just talk about it in class, but encourage children to experiment with same-sex as early as possible, that is, first ‚Äúplease yourself‚Äù, and then - ‚Äú The age of sexual consent needs to be reconsidered." In Holland, a few years ago, a party of pedophiles was officially registered, which intended to participate in elections: it called for reducing the age of sexual relations to at least 10-12 years. And in Switzerland, they have already launched the production of condoms in children's size, that is, for ten-year-old boys. The argument that we, as traditionally oriented people, consider all this to be unnatural, means little to ‚Äúthem‚Äù. On the contrary, the more unnatural, the more desirable it is to be put into practice.	1643988244.0	hvkjwfe	t3_sjecqu	t1_hvk95ec	/r/russia/comments/sjecqu/is_nato_being_a_dick/hvkjwfe/

When I think about China, I think about chinese culture not the CCP. And it's the same for russia. Russian culture wasn't created by Putin but by Rus'/Russian etc. people and everybody in France could say easily that russian people are nice and russia has a great  culture.   When Europe criticizes Russia, they only criticize Putin and his government and I completly understand that you are not agree with this opinion.

35hvl8y6	I'm glad you've learned something. Except  >not all types of labor camps  isn't true again, because there were prisons, settlements, filtration camps and labour camps. All different ;)  >English-language speakers also use the word gulag to refer to all forced-labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union  Yeah, they also tell there was communism in USSR, which led the younger generations to actually believe it. But we there prefer to keep it historical.  >18.000.000 people  **Your** estimates. How about you look at mine? According to the report, ordered by Nikita Khruschev in 1954, the total amount of sentenced people was 3 777 380, including 642 980 executed, 2 369 220 in camps and prisons, 765 180 relocated. Okay, we know that USSR was even worse than Nazi Germany and cannot be trusted, so let's double the numbers. 7,5 million in 33 years... 230k sentenced every year. Ofc these number must be crazy for Luxembourg with it's population of 633k, but for a 150 to 180 million country that's Tuesday.  >with little to no trial  Wow, you've just offended the entire penitentiary system of USSR/Russia. ...  Oh, and, speaking of points. Your initial point was that the numbers coulb be altered, because of Gulag and all those poor people who suffered from the government. I pointed out that these were also counted and taken care, plus the numbers you mentioned cannot alter the number of the casualties of war.

p7h2ze	I have seen several of his videos. I got the impression that he works for MI6. A blog is a very convenient thing for an alibi to visit different places, including secret and semi-secret, and collect information about the country. The blog also allows him to offset his costs.    The way he shows Russia is a separate issue. Yes, he speaks politely to Russians and outwardly respectful. Clever. But see what places it shows. These are mostly abandoned places in different wilderness, where almost no one lives.    He is 100% is not a friend of Russia. He also had a joint broadcast with a Russian liberal Russophobe who openly pours dirt on Russia. These two bloggers are very popular in the West because they show "stereotypical Russia" and what the West wants to hear about Russia.

They‚Äôre a truly brainwashed and lost people.	1643993283.0	hvkxdd6	t3_skb1x7	t1_hvkw6gk	/r/russia/comments/skb1x7/–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–æ–µ/hvkxdd6/
hvp2lljs	Crimean War (1853-1856)   The reason for the Crimean War was a dispute over the keys to holy places in Palestine between Catholics and Orthodox. The Sultan handed over the keys to the Bethlehem Church from the Orthodox Greeks to the Catholics, whose interests were protected by the Emperor of France, Napoleon III. Russian Emperor Nicholas I demanded that Turkey recognize him as the patron of all Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire. On June 26, 1853, he announced the entry of Russian troops into the Danube Principalities, declaring that he would withdraw them from there only after the Russian demands were satisfied by the Turks.   On July 14, Turkey addressed a note of protest against Russia's actions to other great powers and received assurances of support from them. On October 16, Turkey declared war on Russia, and on November 9, an imperial manifesto followed on Russia declaring war on Turkey.   The Allies planned to land the main landing in the Crimea in order to deprive the Russian Black Sea Fleet of its bases. Attacks on the ports of the Baltic and White Seas and the Pacific Ocean were also envisaged. The Anglo-French fleet concentrated in the Varna region. It consisted of 34 battleships and 55 frigates, including 54 steam ones, and 300 transport ships, on which there was an expeditionary force of 61,000 soldiers and officers. The Russian Black Sea Fleet could oppose the Allies with 14 sailing battleships, 11 sailing and 11 steam frigates. The Russian army of 40 thousand people was stationed in the Crimea.............   Where is Ukraine here? fucking moron! Ukraine as a state officially appeared in 1991!	1643993289.0	hvkxdyd	t3_sjnmv0	t1_hvkq599	/r/russia/comments/sjnmv0/question_from_an_american_about_the/hvkxdyd/

9ym6raal	As I understand it, the U.S. Congress did not pass the legislation authorizing economic aid that Yeltsin came to request which contributed to economic unrest in Russia which compelled Yeltsin to unseat the Parliament with implicit U.S. support since the politicians who wanted to remove Yeltsin wanted to return to a Soviet-style planned economy and the U.S. did not want this.   My opinion? A Soviet citizen who lives in a government apartment with a stipend all his life does not all of a sudden know how to go out and start a business or manage it. It should have been obvious that the economy would collapse when the government stipends went away. The U.S. and Western Europe has plenty of money to fund a smooth transition and to stay involved to prevent the outright theft of state assets by the (now) oligarchs.  We stayed in Germany and Japan after WWII to make sure they were rebuilt such that an economic crisis would not lead to WWIII, but we had no such concerns in Russia. It was like we didn‚Äôt really care that much.   So, yes, he came to the U.S. Congress where he ‚Äúbombed‚Äù which led to him having to actually bomb the Russian Parliament in order to save his own skin.  –ù–∞—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—é, –ö–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å –°–®–ê –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω, —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ—à–∞—é—â–∏–π —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫—É—é –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å, –∑–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –ø—Ä–∏–µ—Ö–∞–ª –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω, —á—Ç–æ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º –±–µ—Å–ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫–∞–º –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤—ã–Ω—É–¥–∏–ª–∏ –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω–∞ —Å–º–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –ø–∞—Ä–ª–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ –Ω–µ—è–≤–Ω–æ–π –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–µ –°–®–ê, –ø–æ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫—É –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª–∏ —É–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω–∞, —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –∫ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞, –∞ –°–®–ê —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª–∏.  –ú–æ–µ –º–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ? –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–∏–Ω, –≤—Å—é –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –∂–∏–≤—É—â–∏–π –Ω–∞ –∫–∞–∑–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∫–≤–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–µ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∏–ø–µ–Ω–¥–∏—é, –≤–¥—Ä—É–≥ –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç, –∫–∞–∫ –ø–æ–π—Ç–∏ –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ –∏–ª–∏ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å –∏–º. –î–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å –æ—á–µ–≤–∏–¥–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–∞ —Ä—É—Ö–Ω–µ—Ç, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –∏—Å—á–µ–∑–Ω—É—Ç –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—Å–æ–±–∏—è. –£ –°–®–ê –∏ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø—ã –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Ñ–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Å–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞—Ç—å —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä—è–º–æ–≥–æ —Ö–∏—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–æ–≤ (—Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å —É–∂–µ) –æ–ª–∏–≥–∞—Ä—Ö–∞–º–∏.  –ú—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ –ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∏ –Ø–ø–æ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –í—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —É–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç—å—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω—ã —Ç–∞–∫, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∏–∑–∏—Å –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª –∫ –¢—Ä–µ—Ç—å–µ–π –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω–µ, –Ω–æ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ç–∞–∫–∏—Ö –∑–∞–±–æ—Ç –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. –ö–∞–∫ –±—É–¥—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–º –±—ã–ª–æ –≤—Å–µ —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ.  –ò—Ç–∞–∫, –¥–∞, –æ–Ω –ø—Ä–∏—à–µ–ª –≤ –ö–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å –°–®–ê, –≥–¥–µ ¬´–±–æ–º–±–∏–ª¬ª, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª–æ –∫ —Ç–æ–º—É, —á—Ç–æ –µ–º—É –ø—Ä–∏—à–ª–æ—Å—å —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –±–æ–º–±–∏—Ç—å —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–∞—Ä–ª–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å–ø–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–æ—é —à–∫—É—Ä—É.	1643993637.0	hvkyc9o	t3_sj7p3l	t1_hvkevze	/r/russia/comments/sj7p3l/boris_yeltsins_address_to_congress_imagine_the/hvkyc9o/

The goal of declassifying this information is to make it more difficult for Russia to move troops into Ukraine. Russia has already moved 100k+ troops to the border of Ukraine and also forces into Belarus. To most people watching it doesn't look like the Russian army is there to provide humanitarian aid if you get my drift.

3n2lk34c	This  is going to be a long post so bear with me. Iran is a majority shia country and they aren‚Äôt like the Sunni wahabbi terror groups we see in Syria,Yemen, Afghanistan etc. matter of fact Iran and Russia are on the same side in Syria. Iran‚Äôs proxies are mostly defensive in nature and don‚Äôt have a dream of creating a caliphate. They just want to push out US interest in the Gulf. Secondly Iran shares the same ideals as Russia and China. They want to end US unipolarity and bring back multipolarity. Iran‚Äôs goals is to push the US out of the Persian Gulf same was China wants the US out of East Asia, the same way Russia wants the US out of Eastern Europe. They are regional powers who feel surrounded by the US strategy of encirclement.  Thirdly Iran is the perfect ally to have. They are a stable nation. They have thousands of years of history. Compared to the Persian Gulf monarchs who were just created a hundred years ago by the west. And these nations were lucky to have oil which kept them afloat. These countries have tribal divisions, sectarian divisions, royal family divisions that get pampered over because they have a lot of oil money and they are supported by the west. Think about it without oil Saudi Arabia would become like Yemen on steroids. So the US has to back these countries because the petro dollar is what makes the dollar the world reserve currency. And think about why with all billions of US military equipment and arms that has been given to the Persian Gulf states they are afraid to fight Iran alone? Iran has been sanctioned since the 1970s. It‚Äôs arms embargo was lifted last year. You would think the GCC nations would work together and fight Iran who doesn‚Äôt have modern military equipment. The big reason even with the arms embargo and with the latest  western top notch weapons they still would get crushed by Iran thanks to their asymmetrical military capabilities which would lead to the collapse of the GCC monarch and the collapse of the petro dollar in general. This is why the US, Israel and the GCC nations have been avoiding war with Iran for the last 20 years when combined they have the technological advantages. If China and Russia arm Iran to the teeth this makes things even worse for the US. Because now they can‚Äôt pivot to China. They will have to sink even more billions in the Mideast while China and Russia continue to get stronger and provide and alternative to US unipolarity. Basically turn Iran into a Turkey. Large Muslims powerhouse with a top notch military. Arming Iran and developing stronger economic ties would be a geopolitical game changer that would hurt the West significantly.  Iran‚Äôs leadership are very practical. They aren‚Äôt like ISIS or al qaeda which are Sunni jihadist who aren‚Äôt rational. Iran is the key to end the petro dollar and dollar imperialism which would help Russia and Chinas goal to end US unipolarity. Russia and China seem to know this hence why they are making economic deals with Iran. Iran is more stable than the Gulf countries which are fragile societies. And they know it. Hence why they don‚Äôt want a full scale war with Iran. They know it would be the end of them.	1643996504.0	hvl67yr	t3_skeypg	t1_hvkxzyo	/r/russia/comments/skeypg/china_joins_russia_in_opposing_nato_expansion/hvl67yr/

32nd3	Thank you learnt that some 25 years ago in school.   Ok, so you missed the point or somehow failed to grasp it.   As mentioned above, and what I replied to:     >According to some modern Russian historians, not 27 million inhabitants of the USSR died during the Second World War, but almost 40 million. This was calculated on the basis of the fact that in 1946 the USSR had 170 million, and the estimated population should have been 209 million .  My point was and still is that there are probably more to this 39 million discrepancy than just the German invasion (although no doubt the main culprit directly, or indirectly) but none the less. It doesn't matter how you define the Gulags. It was one of many alternate non-German related ways of dying in Soviet times.   And I know that this is the wrong part of Reddit for critical thinking. But a lot of numbers back then was manipulated to fit the political narrative true on both western and eastern sphere. I can imagine that such as the true number of East block civilians escaping to the west would not be publicly reported. 20 million extra dead during 34 months is quite noticeable as it would be almost 600 000 more dead per month.	1643997550.0	hvl93bn	t3_sij237	t1_hvkmmai	/r/russia/comments/sij237/how_come_nobody_mentions_the_mass_murders_of_slavs/hvl93bn/

I think it's worth thinking carefully about what dictatorship means and comparing this definition with the latest achievements of China both inside the country and in the foreign arena.

Fighting insurgents is good and all but doesn‚Äôt require the same amount of innovation and development to say invade a advance country with arms matched up. They will push for bigger and better and more expensive weapons because many weapons won‚Äôt die. They will push sale of arms to be expanded and sale of arms to outside countries. Lobbying campaign thirsts for this war as we see with the media and politicians just driving it to be. America and other coalition countries won‚Äôt be able to justify another insurgent conflict war after Afghanistan for awhile. So they can justify a war with Russia or China.

You did the same last week.  If it's NATO then perhaps add a homeless man, who is your cousin to the story? This passer by tried to help him, giving aid all while you were shouting to people around that no one should help your cousin, demanding from the passer by to never ever help him and other homeless people in this neighborhood since they are in your sphere of influence. You also took your cousin blanket last week and getting ready to rob him again, cause you can't stand the image that more passers by might start to help and he might start a normal living.	1643999247.0	hvldp8t	t3_skgp9x	t1_hvkyxn9	/r/russia/comments/skgp9x/watch_this_heated_exchange_as_journalists/hvldp8t/

ms6e8	There were two. Second one, Yves Rocher, is more simpler. His brother, Oleg Navalny, held a senior position in Russian Post department in some city (Yaroslavl, IIRC). When e-retail boomed in late 00s and that department could no longer handle the load of Yves Rocher packages, Oleg Navalny instead of fixing this problem suggested Yves Rocher to send packages to Moscow first and then deliver them to Yaroslavl by trucks. He suggested using services of a company which was established by his brother, Alexey, not so long ago. Yves Rocher did not know about this conflict of interests and kept using this scheme for 3 or 4 years, while Oleg Navalny continued to do nothing with the package overload.	1644002581.0	hvlmmf0	t3_sk9vjw	t1_hvlgf2b	/r/russia/comments/sk9vjw/was_the_fall_of_communism_mostly_optical_within/hvlmmf0/

p7h2ze	We inherited the internal division with ethnic regions from Lenin. It was he who was a supporter of this option. Stalin, on the contrary, proposed a united Soviet Union, where there is no ethnic division. This encourages separatism. It was along these internal borders that the USSR collapsed. Putin called it a time bomb. I think that in the future we will change the internal structure, eliminating the ethnic principle.	1644002613.0	hvlmpfq	t3_skkx6p	t3_skkx6p	/r/russia/comments/skkx6p/i_wanted_to_understand_politicaladmirative/hvlmpfq/

Consider this as a humanitarian deployment like many country and US also does (remenber 1999 and Serbia). The best way for Ukraine is to do like US did with Serbia and Kossovo and split the country according ethnical population.

3k2qjc1w	A strong delusion that Hitler was a tyrant and a dictator. A bunch of capitalists invested in it.   There was a plan for a quick war. And as they moved deeper, the chances of success increased. Stalingrad, Leningrad and Moscow were the last points for victory. But their attack stalled. Technologically, by the way, they also did not succeed much.   Name at least one massive heavy tank of the Reich for 1941? in the USSR there was a KV-1.   Name the submachine gun with which they could equip their assault groups en masse.

fs3n7	It's inaccurate to say that they have evidence if all they have is what their intelligence told them. But it is also silly to demand a proof. Obviously they cannot say how that information was obtained without endangering the source. Ultimately it all boils down to how credible the US government is and how competent their intelligence is. Definitely not pristine history, but compared to Russian government (Putin denying with a straight face that he has anything to do with the little green men is a classic) they are credible. Their intelligence is probably the best in the world. I also fail to see what they could have to gain from lying about this. Nobody is putting any sanctions before something actually happens anyway.

Also after so many embarassing defeats nobody in Europe trusts Biden as a military leader. I don't trust him to run a Hot dog stand on the beach,not lead a war against the Russians. He has so many corporate leaders up his ass that he can't decide one simple thing without changing. Recent interview from State department showed that 80's propaganda simply doesn't work anymore. From bad Russia good America angle to Work Ward to achieve the American Dream. People have realized that these are frauds one way or another.

ihrckv8m	It is incidents that give rise to people rejecting the validity of a school shooting like Sandy Hook or the Parkland shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The news coverage was bizarre. The children of law enforcement offers knew there was going to be staged shooting before it even happened, then the helicopter footage of the victim being rushed into the hospital and it was clearly visible there was no one in the hospital gurney.  While this guy from the US State Department was talking that was all that went through my mind. He was describing previous false flag school shootings in the USA.	1644007613.0	hvlzyz6	t3_skgp9x	t1_hvlct7s	/r/russia/comments/skgp9x/watch_this_heated_exchange_as_journalists/hvlzyz6/

6vk5m	Source: "Trust me bruh. Russia the regime has Putin as a dictator. *You wouldn't trust a dictator, would you?* We just have intel and we can't share sources for their protection despite this being declassified. Just trust us."  It's either classified or it's not. Say what needs to be said and stop dancing around it. Why are we sending our troops over to areas near Ukraine, when we have other issues to attend to? Ukraine is not even a NATO ally!  Also, how convenient is it that we pull out of Afghanistan, end a war that way, just to *think about* going into another one? You know how much of a shit show and blood bath there would be if we went to war with Russia? Massive casualties on both sides. What's funny is that Russia is being contained by NATO countries and the USA, while we continue to expand NATO. If Russia can't expand, why should we?

2w4rckok	1. Age   >Average age for people that lived to adulthood was a lot older.  Given that the majority of the population in (pre-revolutionary) Tsarist *Russia* was economically destitute, had little to no access to healthcare for medical emergencies, had little to no access to proper sanitation, was recruited for deadly Imperialistic wars every decade, had little to no social mobility due to ethnic/racial/class/gender discrimination, lived in one of the harshest & longest winter climates in Eurasia, had little to no access to industrial machinery for agriculture (having to resort to archaic ploughing methods instead), and had to deal with sporadic famines caused by pestilence & draughts on top of everything ‚Äì I highly doubt that the average was ‚Äúa lot‚Äù older under such challenging life conditions.        Russia was not like England or the Mediterranean where there‚Äôs green grass, year-round vegetation and far easier farming.        The BBC summarised the dire situation in the Tsarist Russian countryside as follows:  >‚ÄúFamine was a common occurrence at the turn of the century. There was widespread famine in 1901. Even though they did not have enough to feed themselves, peasants were expected to produce surplus grain for export. \[‚Ä¶\] The Tsar taxed the produce of the peasant farmers to raise money to maintain his regime. The burden of taxation was so great that periodic riots broke out.‚Äù  And the equally dire situation in urban centres and factories was summarised thus:  >‚ÄúWorking conditions were terrible and trade unionism was banned. There was little to protect the pay or safety of workers. Laws protecting workers brought in under Alexander III and Nicholas II did little to improve the situation as the working day remained at 11.5 hours.‚Äù        ‚ÄúLiving conditions were horrendous as developers struggled to deal with the demand for accommodation. Many lived in communal houses similar to army quarters, where kitchens, toilets and washrooms were shared. Others were forced to sleep in the factories where they worked, with little in terms of bedding. There was limited sanitation and running water in the cities, and the mortality rate was high. There was an economic downturn in the early 1900s, leading to a lack of jobs and regular income. This was disastrous for those migrating to the cities looking for work.‚Äù   Next issue:  >Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th‚Äì19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a medieval person survived childhood ‚Ä¶   In order to contextualise *Nicholas‚Äô* age, I referred to data about average life expectancy *in Russia in the 1890s* (at the time of Nicholas‚Äô coronation). Whereas your above Wiki quote is not very helpful as it appears to focus more on the Middle Ages and doesn‚Äôt even seem to relate specifically to Russia but to some vague world aggregate.        But even if we take 55 as an average ‚Äì that still makes Nicholas essentially middle-aged at 26 when he‚Äôs crowned. His father and predecessor died aged 49.   >We certainly don‚Äôt believe 35 year olds have the wisdom and experience to be world leaders.   ‚ÄúWe certainly don‚Äôt believe‚Äù? Who is ‚Äúwe‚Äù? And are ‚Äúwe‚Äù now talking about history or modernity? Well, anyway, here on the Eurasian continent many people don‚Äôt have hangups about our leaders‚Äô age. Here are some examples:        Napoleon became Emperor at the age of 35. His elevation to Emperor was overwhelmingly approved by French citizens in a constitutional referendum. He graduated from school at the age of 16 and was immediately commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant (Officer‚Äôs rank).        Sanna Marin was 34 when she became Prime Minister of Finland. Sebastian Kurz was 33 when he became Chancellor of Austria. The last Kaiser of Germany (Wilhelm II, a.k.a. Nicky‚Äôs cousin Willie) was crowned at the age of 29. Queen Elizabeth II was 27 when she became Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and other realms and territories, and Head of the British Commonwealth. Queen Victoria was crowned at 18. Ivan IV became Tsar at the age of 16. Heck, a large number of European monarchs were sworn in at half Nicholas‚Äô age. Kolya was a ‚Äògrandpa‚Äô compared to the coronation dates of most British & French monarchs.   >18 year olds aren‚Äôt children, but modern 18 year olds are rarely very mature ‚Ä¶ which is why I called them kids.   Sounds like North American culture :). They keep bizarrely referring to all young adults as ‚Äúkids‚Äù over there, even if the ‚Äúkid‚Äù sports a lumberjack‚Äôs beard and has produced 2 kids of his own. That culture of infantilisation is self-perpetuating: the more they call adults ‚Äúkids‚Äù, the more it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, with more and more adults acting like ‚Äúkids‚Äù way into their 30s and 40s.	1644008461.0	hvm27pa	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvm27pa/

2w4rckok	2.1 Inequality   >Yes we all say we believe wealth inequality is unfair. But when we have extra money few of us go around looking for the needy   Again, who is this ‚Äúwe‚Äù? Ukrainian expats? North Americans? Many average Europeans barely have ‚Äúextra money‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a credit-card illusion and a capitalist pyramid scam. Most are neck-deep in debt. Average people can‚Äôt even get on the property ladder until their mid-30s and can‚Äôt pay out their mortgages until they‚Äôre pushing 60. And many will get royally screwed when they reach retirement and notice that their basic pension is a joke.        The ‚Äúneedy‚Äù do get sporadic charity handouts. But handouts won‚Äôt save them. Ad hoc handouts are a Band-Aid, not a solution. They need permanent basic universal rights (free housing, free higher ed, free healthcare, guaranteed employment). All those things Russia once had. It was called Socialism. People didn‚Äôt value it enough. They kept looking enviously at the West and whining: ‚ÄúOh, but the capitalists have more consumer stuff!‚Äù. No one told them that ‚Äúthat consumer stuff‚Äù is either due to living on credit or thanks to Big Corps thieving and racketeering resources from half the Planet and throwing their Western minion-employees a bone now and then (the darker side of ‚Äòtrickle-down economics‚Äô).   >We go to restaurants, buy more expensive groceries, buy coffees, buy nice new clothes, buy new smartphones, buy home decor, buy comfortable furniture, buy cars, buy larger apartments/houses, go on vacations etc.   Yes, but that‚Äôs how Capitalism 101 works ‚Äì its entirely reliant on consumerist culture. If consumer spending rates suddenly fall significantly ‚Äì then the entire Capitalist economy will collapse ‚Äì and millions of workers will end up unemployed on the street, joining the ranks of the ‚Äúneedy‚Äù.        For example: if people suddenly stop buying takeaway coffee and start donating that money to ‚Äúthe needy‚Äù instead ‚Äì then Starbucks, Costa, etc will see their corporate profit margins fall and start cutting costs to stay afloat (mass layoffs, salary reductions, etc). And if Starbucks goes under and enters bankruptcy ‚Äì then 350 thousand suddenly unemployed baristas (as well as thousands of other slashed office jobs) will join the ranks of ‚Äúthe needy‚Äù.        Same thing with the tourist & hospitality industry ‚Äì if people skip going on vacation, thousands of workers (airplane hostesses, tourist guides, hotel employees, restaurant workers, beach vendors) will suddenly end up without an income.        So society won‚Äôt materially ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything by diverting money from, say, Starbucks to a homeless shelter instead. Because the whole Capitalist system is an intricate spider‚Äôs web and a Jenga-like pyramid-scheme scam. They‚Äôve essentially got us all hostage. Simply re-distributing consumers‚Äô cashflows as a Band-Aid while not bothering to address the root of the problem (Capitalism) will still screw over workers, one way or another, you‚Äôll just be shifting poverty from one sector to another.        And, frankly, since Capitalism is essentially based on, and incentivises further, individual greed (private capital & wealth accumulation and exclusive property ownership) ‚Äì there‚Äôs little motivation in such a system to ‚Äúhelp the needy‚Äù. Capitalism encourages sink-or-swim Darwinian market competition, not solidarity and cooperation (that would be socialism/communism).	1644008588.0	hvm2jpl	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvm2jpl/

26um0b7u	Fuck you!  As a result of a government coup initiated by Western countries, elites loyal to the United States, as well as neo-Nazis, came to power in Ukraine. Even before the beginning of all the events, when the Euromaidan was just beginning, anti-Russian slogans were heard in Ukraine, many of which were extremely radical, for example, to hang Russians. Seeing this development of events, the regions with a predominantly Russian population considered it impossible for themselves to continue to be part of Ukraine.        As a result of a referendum in which foreign observers were also present, Crimea became part of Russia. This made it possible to avoid the genocide of the Russians in the Crimea. The embittered Ukrainian government, with the support of the West and neo-Nazi battalions, began the genocide of Russians in Lugansk and Donetsk. I do not understand why the Russian authorities allowed this to happen and did not hold the same referendum there. The population of Lugansk and Donetsk began to resist because they did not want to be destroyed, and later proclaimed their regions as independent republics - LPR and DPR.        Many volunteers from Russia began to fight on the side of the LPR and DPR, hence the talk about Russian aggression. But I do not see anything aggressive and illegal in preventing the genocide of people. Volunteers from Serbia, France and even the United States also began to fight on the side of the LPR and DPR, but for some reason Ukraine has no claim to these countries.        As a result of the hostilities, the armies of the unrecognized republics managed to defeat the Ukrainian troops (Ilovaisky cauldron, battles near Debaltseve). This was followed by the Minsk Agreements.        And now the army of Ukraine, pumped up by the West with money, weapons and equipment, is striving, contrary to the peace agreements, to return the territories of the unrecognized republics under its control. Naturally, all this will be accompanied by genocide of the local Russian population. Russia cannot allow this to happen for obvious reasons. Therefore, if Ukraine attacks the LPR and DPR, Russia reserves the right to DIRECTLY intervene in the conflict in order to protect the Russians in Ukraine. Until today, there has been no direct intervention of the Russian armed forces and there is no evidence of this.	1644008838.0	hvm37e4	t3_skmfaz	t1_hvm2jb4	/r/russia/comments/skmfaz/why_is_russia_playing_the_victim_when_the_nato_is/hvm37e4/
2w4rckok	2.2  >Unfortunately when talking about wealth inequality people rarely think of themselves, but instead look at the money of billionaires. It‚Äôs never about their own money, it‚Äôs about the money of the people richer than them.‚Äù  Well, sure, but *what else* does one expect from people when one *teaches* people that Nicholas II was a role model of a ‚Äúkind man‚Äù? Look, Nicholas II was an autocratic, capitalist, antisemitic Monarch who bought his wife expensive diamond-encrusted Faberg√© eggs instead of sharing all his ill-gotten wealth with his people. He lived in a glittery palace while most of his population lived in mud-huts. Yes, he sometimes gave to charity, but so did George W. Bush and Al Capone (he famously donated to soup kitchens, while pocketing money from other victims). If that‚Äôs what one considers a so-called ‚Äúkind man‚Äù ‚Äì then one is essentially teaching people that general selfishness (covered up by a few acts of charity) is ‚Äúkindness‚Äù and that extreme wealth inequality is ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô. If Nicholas ‚Äì who is praised by pro-Western revisionists as a ‚Äúkind man‚Äù - can amass personal wealth by exploiting workers (and by refusing to share most of his jewels with the needy) ‚Äì then all the other citizens are justified in parroting him and behaving the same way. After all, social elites like Nicholas II set the example of behaviour for everyone else: ‚Äúmonkey see ‚Äì monkey do.‚Äù        As for modern-day billionaires, many of them became ‚Äúbillionaires‚Äù to a large extent by dodging tax. Same goes for multi-billion corporations. Middle-class wage-earning people are ‚Äòchumps‚Äô who usually pay their taxes in full (up to 40% - 50% across Europe, or 15% in Russia but with lower wages). Whereas, as a trend, many billionaires don‚Äôt pay tax. It should be a crime that they get away with this.        For heaven‚Äôs sake, Starbucks at one point paid 0.005% tax in the UK. Obviously it makes sense to go after these people & these corporations as a priority, not after middle-class wage-earning people who have *already* contributed their *full* share of tax (nearly half their salary across Europe) to social welfare programs via systems like PAYE (automatic monthly deduction of income tax from wages). The middle class is already screwed as it is (with 40%-50% tax, a 30-year mortgage and dwindling pensions).        What next? We‚Äôre going to ask coal miners to skip coffee and donate to charity instead, while the billionaire capitalist owner of the mine pockets the *lion‚Äôs share* of the profits from the mine and stashes it in an offshore Caribbean tax haven?   >Yes the top 1% has most of the money but the top 79% can solve most of the hardship issues for the bottom 20% in countries like the USA and Russia.   By doing what? By keeping a capitalist system and simply stopping ordering so-called ‚Äúsmall luxuries‚Äù from Amazon/Ozon and, as a result, having the out-of-work deliverymen and small businesses default on their rent and join a *food-bank*?        And why should ‚Äúthe top 1%‚Äù get off the hook? As they tend to be the CEOs and managerial decision-makers who set the level of wages and house rents for everyone else ‚Äì then they should be the ones to cough up their *disproportionate* wealth. After all, they‚Äôre the ones who set the wages too low and the rents too high, leading to homelessness and food poverty. The CEOs and landlords are the cause of this, not the wage-earners.        As for comparing Russia and the U.S. in terms of disposable income: Russians are far more averse to getting into a debt pit (and maxing out multiple credit cards) than U.S. citizens, so most of the ‚Äútop 79%‚Äù of Russia don‚Äôt have much disposable income. That‚Äôs why small businesses are struggling in Russia ‚Äì because average consumers (outside of Moscow & St. Pete‚Äôs) don‚Äôt have enough savings to splurge on ‚Äúsmall luxuries‚Äù.        The only way the top 79% can instigate actual wealth redistribution is by getting proper socialist leadership (if they can find it) to the steering wheel and re-nationalising all the stolen (privatised) main resource companies (which were originally built by the public taxpayers).	1644008846.0	hvm386j	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvm386j/

2w4rckok	3. The Elite‚Äôs warmongering ‚Äògames‚Äô   >You don‚Äôt just invent new terrifying weapons for 3 decades just to let them sit around in the back room.   Maybe that‚Äôs the case for war-loving North Americans and Western Europeans. But not for Eastern countries like Russia, China, etc. Russia invented the Zirkon hypseronic missile. China invented a similar missile system. And both are exactly ‚Äúletting them sit around in the back room‚Äù. And that‚Äôs for the best.   >The assertion that Nicholas just ‚Äúsent unprepared Russian peasants to fight to protect Serbians and kill Austrians‚Äù is really simplistic and leaves out give or take 30-40 years of various historic events and political alliances.   Look, I don‚Äôt care about those poncy ‚Äúpolitical alliances‚Äù. I don‚Äôt care about the *Machiavellian chess-games* that all those inbred aristocrats, exploiters and elitist parasites (Romanovs, Habsburgs, Windsors, capitalist bankers and weapons manufacturers) were playing. What I do care about is the fact that all those upper-class leeches were playing with regular people‚Äôs lives. Those ‚Äòaristocratic war games‚Äô ruined regular people‚Äôs lives.        The regular people did *not* want to fight and kill. Encyclopaedia Britannica writes:  >"The Russian people did *not* respond to the war with real enthusiasm."  British and German soldiers even famously played football together over Christmas, showing that the people of both countries did not inherently hate each other. It was the psychopathic aristocrats & bankers who were brainwashing & cajoling people to hate each other. Just like they‚Äôre still doing to this day.   >it also fails to consider that Germany declared war on Russia first   Regardless of what anyone declared, Germans did *not* actually invade Russia in WW1 ‚Äì it was Nicholas who pushed his poor, under-equipped troops to physically invade Germany‚Äôs land, illegally occupy half of East Prussia, and perish there. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_invasion\_of\_East\_Prussia\_(1914)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_East_Prussia_(1914))          Wiki says that the Germans were understandably "\[outraged\] at the *violation* of \[their\] national territory \[by invading Russian troops\] and Tsarist atrocities‚Äù committed on their land.        Look, I‚Äôm not defending Germany‚Äôs actions against some faraway foreign countries like Belgium, etc. But, in the relationship between Russia and Germany, Nicholas was the first to invade Germany‚Äôs East Prussia (not the other way round) ‚Äì and let's at least agree that this wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúkind‚Äù on Nicholas‚Äô part. He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúkind‚Äù to his own troops (he didn‚Äôt spare them) and he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúkind‚Äù to the populated German lands that he invaded.        There were even *desertions* and mass capitulations in the Russian army ‚Äì because many Russian conscripts didn‚Äôt understand why the heck they were being sent to invade Germany‚Äôs land and kill Germans. Many Russian soldiers didn‚Äôt want to fight and occupy Germany ‚Äì which is one of the main reasons why the Russian offensive eventually stalled ‚Äì because the troops‚Äô morale was very low, even they themselves didn‚Äôt see the invasion as right or ‚Äúkind‚Äù at all.	1644009571.0	hvm54hw	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvm54hw/

2w4rckok	4.1 Western Russophobic so-called ‚Äòallies‚Äô   >Could Russia have seriously sacrificed its Balkan interests, and abandoned its allies France and the UK? Perhaps.   What do you mean ‚Äúcould it have seriously - perhaps‚Äù? That‚Äôs exactly what Russia actually did in 1917. No ifs or buts about it ‚Äì it was literally done.        And most Russians are better off today without those so-called ‚ÄúBalkan interests‚Äù. Thank heavens the Balkans weren‚Äôt incorporated into Russia. The Balkans are more trouble than they‚Äôre worth ‚Äì a potpourri of tribes that keep genociding each other. Thanks but no thanks. Russia already had more than enough on its plate with the Baltics, the Caucasus tinderbox, the Central Asiatics, etc. How many more ‚Äúinterests‚Äù did the Tsarists need? That Imperialistic megalomania was unhealthy. Russia already had the biggest territory on the continent.        As for ‚Äúabandoning its allies France and UK‚Äù ‚Äì good riddance to such *toxic* so-called ‚Äúallies‚Äù. Britain and France were two of the worst, most racist, genocidal, xenophobic countries on the planet at that time, killing and raping other races across the entire globe. The French even killed *Russians* in the 1810s (Napoleonic Wars), then the Brits & French killed *Russians/Ukrainians* in the 1850s (Crimean War, when the Brits even resorted to such low tactics as attacking Russian monasteries). Britain‚Äôs Elite always despised Russians/Slavs. The British Monarchy even *refused* to give *refuge* to Nicholas and his family which would have *saved* them from execution. In WW2, Churchill secretly advocated for destroying Russia and refused to share with Russia crucial British intel about the Nazis‚Äô attack plan. With back-stabbing, *Russophobic* ‚Äúallies‚Äù like that - who needs enemies! As Nicholas‚Äôs father (Alexander III) reportedly warned: ‚ÄúRussia has only 2 real allies: its Army and its Navy‚Äù.   >But would this have led to peace and prosperity in Russia? Maybe, but probably not.   What do you mean ‚Äúmaybe, but probably not‚Äù? After kicking its racist, Russophobic Western faux-allies to the curb, Russia teamed up with far better allies (Central Asian republics, etc) and created a Union that offered exactly ‚Äúthe most peace and prosperity‚Äù that that Eurasian region ever had in all its history.   *Ditching your friends and political alliances means everyone around is your enemy*   Britain and France are *not*, and never were, Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or *genuine* ‚Äúallies‚Äù. Russia never once initiated any unprovoked attacks on Britain or France ‚Äì whereas Britain and France kept attacking Russia every few decades since the 1800s, like clockwork, until Jugashvili (Stalin) finally commissioned defensive nukes to stop these constant attacks from happening. You can bet that if it wasn‚Äôt for Russia‚Äôs nuclear shield, Britain and the U.S. (with their inane, non-stop Russophobia) would have already b0mbed Moscow. And even today *xenophobic* Britain and France are slapping sanctions against Russia, to stop its economy from growing.        As for Serbia‚Äôs Black Hand terrorist group ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúfriends‚Äù either. They apparently didn‚Äôt even negotiate their regicide plot with Russia, like considerate ‚Äúallies‚Äù would have. They decided to achieve their selfish nationalistic goal by shifting the main burden of the war unto Russian shoulders and by spilling Russian blood. That‚Äôs not how ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or ‚Äúallies‚Äù behave. And even in modern times Serbia applied to join the EU ‚Äì the same xenophobic EU that is slapping economic sanctions against Russia.        ‚ÄúEveryone around is your enemy‚Äù? No, the *Russophobic* *West* is not ‚Äúeveryone around‚Äù on this *Eurasian* *continent* or moreover on this planet. Russia (with most of its territory located in Asia) should logically look towards *East Asia* and South Asia for allies (as Putin is correctly doing now), not towards the *toxic* West. Western Elites have always generally despised Russia. Even Pushkin famously wrote about it. Please read his (very apt) poem here: [https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/–ö–ª–µ–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º\_–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/–ö–ª–µ–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º_–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏)        >and no matter who came out on top of the conflict in Europe, they would have likely tried to get themselves a peace of Russia as a nice victory prize.   Britain, France, Austria didn‚Äôt need or want a ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of Russia as any ‚Äúvictory prize‚Äù. Britain, France, Sardinia, Austria attacked Russia in the 1850s and annexed the Crimean peninsula (60 years before WW1) ‚Äì and yet they surprisingly gave Crimea back to Russia immediately after. They just wanted to stop Russian Elites from having any influence over maritime trade routes near Istanbul. But they didn‚Äôt want any ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of Russia ‚Äì because that would mean they would forever have to share a hot, war-prone *border* with Russia.	1644009965.0	hvm6669	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvm6669/

26um0b7u	You're even dumber than first thought. Kievan Rus is a historiographical term for the confederation of Russian principalities with a political and economic center in Kiev, the inhabitants of Russia at that time did not use this term. But I was not talking about Kievan Rus, but about Little Russia. And you would understand it yourself if you were at least somewhat educated. I said about the 14th century, while the collapse of what is called Kievan Rus in historiography occurred in the 12th century.	1644009986.0	hvm685p	t3_skmfaz	t1_hvm54a4	/r/russia/comments/skmfaz/why_is_russia_playing_the_victim_when_the_nato_is/hvm685p/

2w4rckok	4.2   >Empire don‚Äôt make alliances or go to war for nothing: they do it to defend their interests. And abandoning war and allies would have meant that Russia had to abandon a lot of its own interests.   I don‚Äôt care about ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äôs interests‚Äù. Empires are racist organisations that only serve the ‚Äúinterests‚Äù of the upper class, not its downtrodden, disenfranchised people and discriminated ethnic groups.        My ancestors (of different races) lived in the ‚ÄúImperial‚Äù region, some of them even in dugouts (zemlyanka). The vast majority of the population couldn‚Äôt read or write ‚Äì because the ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù didn‚Äôt even bother providing nationwide primary schooling to its illiterate peasant children. So those fancy faraway ‚ÄúBalkan interests‚Äù did not correspond to the interests of the average people, most of whom just wanted to *peacefully* live in their own village on e.g. the Volga river or in the Kazakh steppe and had no idea what a ‚ÄúBalkan‚Äù is and couldn‚Äôt even find it on a map.        If the Elite Patricians wanted to have those ‚ÄúBalkan interests‚Äù ‚Äì then they were more than welcome to go fight for them themselves. But not at the expense of the working-class villagers, who had other more urgent problems on their plate.  >‚ÄúCountries broke off alliances all the time. It wouldn't have been exactly unprecedented‚Äù yes that‚Äôs true. But usually alliances were broken off during times of peace, not all out war. And usually breaking off one alliance meant finding another alliance. In theory Russia could have abandoned all Balkan interests and backed out of the French alliance, but the only viable alternative meant fighting on the side of Austria and Germany.‚Äù   Again, there‚Äôs no ‚Äútheory‚Äù involved ‚Äì it all actually happened in practice: in 1917 Russia abandoned all its vague ‚ÄúBalkan interests‚Äù and exited the war. France didn‚Äôt seem to care that much. And, no, Russia didn‚Äôt end up having to ‚Äúfight on the side of Austria and Germany‚Äù.        Look, I don‚Äôt understand this fixation on clinging onto ‚Äúalliances‚Äù with *backstabbing* Western countries (as if the Sun revolves around them). The Russian ‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù was a *humongous* Eurasian Empire, with a humongous population of 164 million people (it basically already was, in itself, an *‚Äúalliance‚Äù* *of nations & races* stretching across literally half the continent: Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Finland, all of Central Asia, etc). So it didn‚Äôt necessarily always need external ‚Äúalliances‚Äù with toxic Western states as much. The Russian Empire usually had enough capacity to protect its mainland borders or, in a worst-case scenario, plenty of space for trick-manoeuvres like to retreat far inland and then counter-attack (like it successfully did against Napoleon). It‚Äôs the far smaller Western and Central European countries (like e.g. Belgium, which had an itty-bitty population of only *150k* and itty-bitty territory) that needed ‚Äúalliances‚Äù more desperately.	1644010714.0	hvm84qi	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvm84qi/

Navalny is an opportunist as well as a known right-wing nationalist. His idea of a pure and good Russia would involve no immigrants being allowed at all.

duvtza38	Having lived in both the US and Russia, I've got to say that there is honestly not that big of a difference in quality of life.  Russia's got a lower average salary, but taxes and cost of living are also lower so it tends to even out.  The old Soviet apartments and such are still leaps and bounds above things like mobile homes IMO.  While for more "middle class" housing it's about the same quality. Cheaper though.  In terms of infrastructure and public transport Russia has the US beat so hard it's not even a competition.  The metros are clean enough to spot your reflection while in New York (the only us city I've been in with a metro) you can hardly see the dimly lit rough concrete beneath the grime.   Most us cities just don't have trains or subways and few have buses.  Public parks/plazas are also far better than any I've seen in the us.   There's no oppression of average people to speak of, but it's generally agreed that the UR party is always up to something shifty.   Generally just the normal rumors of scandals and such that you get anywhere else.	1644012042.0	hvmbl6m	t3_skmzyw	t3_skmzyw	/r/russia/comments/skmzyw/how_is_life_in_russia/hvmbl6m/
2w4rckok	5. WW1 and preceding Tsarist/Imperial massacres of workers in Russia   >first Austrians decided that in return for the murder of the Duke they will murder thousands of innocent Serbs who had nothing to do with the assassination. If you want to talk about the morality of the situation, then Nicholas has the moral high ground by deciding to defend Serbians from a morally inadequate reaction by the Austrians. (Of course it‚Äôs a lot more complicated than that, and for Austria the murder of the Archduke was only an excuse to pursue their goals.)   The murder of the Archduke and Duchess Sophie wasn‚Äôt simply ‚Äúan excuse‚Äù. He was the upcoming leader of Austria. It‚Äôs like saying that assassinating Canada‚Äôs leader Trudeau and his wife Sophie is ‚Äújust an excuse‚Äù and no big deal ‚Äì no, it‚Äôs a very serious event and it caused widespread outrage among Austria‚Äôs population.        As for Nicholas ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt even bother directly ‚Äúdefending‚Äù the Serbs! He ordered an attack on East Prussia which was *nowhere near* Serbia; East Prussia was *over 1,000 km away* from Serbia. If he had wanted to actually ‚Äúdefend‚Äù Serbians ‚Äì he should have sent troops to Serbia itself.        As for ‚Äúmurdering thousands of innocent Serbs in return for the murder of the Duke‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs apparently not true. After the assassination of the Austrian Duke & Duchess, the reprisals against Serbs and Serbian shops in Sarajevo were reportedly mostly carried out by *Sarajevo‚Äôs resident Croatian nationalists* like Josip Frank, by *Bosniaks* (Bosnian Muslims) and by the Czech-ethnic governor of Bosnia-Herzegovina (Oskar Potiorek), not by actual Austrians! Sarajevo (the regional capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina) was a very diverse, *multi-ethnic* city and the Croats, Bosniaks and Czechs (3 Slavic groups) living there deeply disliked the Serbs (another Slavic group). So it wasn‚Äôt the Austrians‚Äô fault that various Slavic groups in the Balkans hated each other. Read the section titled ‚ÄúAftermath‚Äù here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination\_of\_Archduke\_Franz\_Ferdinand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand)        Austria held a criminal trial for the organisers of the assassination plot (the members of Young Bosnia and the Black Hand) ‚Äì and, surprisingly, Austria showed some mercy and leniency to most of them: only a few were hanged and the rest were simply given prison sentences (and not even life sentences). Austria did not even give the death penalty to Gavrilo Princip (the assassin) ‚Äì they only put him in prison. If this had happened in North American countries like the U.S. ‚Äì he would have been executed without reprieve.        Moreover, Nicholas didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúmoral high ground‚Äù ‚Äì because his own troops actually murdered his *own* Russian citizens regularly. First, the Tsarists organised cruel, frequent *pogroms* against Russian/Ukrainian Jews, killing them and destroying their property, forcing them to live in remote ghettos, without even the right to live in big cities (they could only live in the so-called Pale of Settlement). This was one of the main reasons that caused many Slavic Jews to either join the Revolution or flee from the Russian Empire entirely as refugees ‚Äì because Nicholas was an antisemite and flat-out refused to outlaw discrimination and pogroms against Jews. Some of my ancestors were Jews in the region.        Second, the Tsarists massacred even regular ethnic Russians, like mass-shooting unarmed demonstrators in St. Petersburg during Bloody Sunday in 1905 (killing ca. 200 and injuring up to 800 people).  And before you say 'he didn't give that order' - he refused to prosecute or court-martial his troops for this (essentially favouring, & extending nepotistic protectionism for, his murderous loyalist/Monarchist troops instead of justice for his dead & injured civilian citizens).       And then in 1912 (just 2 years before WW1), emboldened by this protectionism from the Tsar, the Monarchists committed the Lena Massacre (killing close to 300 Russians and injuring about the same number). The capitalist Lena Gold Mining company (LenZoloto) gave huge profits to British investors and to Russia‚Äôs Dowager Empress, meanwhile the workers were working like slaves for 15-16 hours per day in harsh conditions and for little pay! So the workers called a strike ‚Äì and were shot by the Tsarist troops. And Nicholas didn‚Äôt even call for anyone to be prosecuted for that atrocity! How is that ‚Äúkind‚Äù? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_massacre)         The point is that Emperor Nicholas didn‚Äôt seem to care much about his *own Russian* workers being regularly *massacred* by his own Imperialist troops, he never even called for his troops to be punished or jailed for this ‚Äì and we‚Äôre asked to believe that he suddenly ‚Äòcared‚Äô about the safety of the faraway *Serbs*? If Nicholas‚Äô troops were allowed to massacre their own Russian citizens (out of antisemitism and for capitalist profit) and get away with it ‚Äì then how was Austria any worse? Nicholas had *zero* moral high ground.	1644012122.0	hvmbsiy	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvmbsiy/

2w4rckok	6.1 Reforms   >Reforms and Nicholas II. History has been incredibly unkind to Nicholas by failing to remember any of the reforms done during his time or projects planned during his time.   That elitist autocrat Nicholas had nothing to do with the reforms. It was Stolypin who pushed for them ‚Äì while Nicholas actually refused many of Stolypin‚Äôs best suggestions and hindered the best reforms (like Stolypin‚Äôs suggestion to stop discrimination and pogroms against Jews).        And can we please stop saying that ‚Äúhistory has been unkind‚Äù to antisemites like Romanov, ok? What next, expats in Canada will start saying that ‚Äúhistory has been unkind‚Äù to Jim Crow/KK\*K and to Apartheid rulers in South Africa?   >Although to be frank it wasn‚Äôt history that was unkind, but the revisionist history writers in the Soviet Union.   Since when is the BBC and Western sources called ‚ÄúSoviet propaganda‚Äù? The BBC has pushed Western pro-Capitalist, pro-Imperialist, anti-Soviet propaganda against the USSR for over a century. But even the BBC and U.S. sources had to concede that the USSR was correct about the cruelty of autocratic Monarchism/Tsarism and Nicholas Romanov.        Look, even vehemently anti-communist subreddits like r/EnoughCommieSpam agree that Nicholas II was a cruel, antisemitic tyrant.        The real unacceptable ‚Äúrevisionism‚Äù (trying to whitewash Romanov‚Äôs sanctioning of Imperialist crimes) is being done by Russian capitalists and members of the Christian Church (a religious cult / sect). Since the 1990s they‚Äôve been busy erecting many statues to the Romanovs & Nicholas everywhere, as if people (especially Russian Jewish people) are supposed to kneel down before him and kiss his feet for the ethnic cleansing that he sanctioned against them. The Xtian Church even sanctified Nicholas as an official cannon ‚Äúsaint‚Äù and painted him in Churches with a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù over his head. Now *that* is jaw-dropping ‚Äúrevisionism‚Äù.   >For the Soviet Union it was important to claim all victories and progress of the era as their own (the building of the bailar Amur mainline, the national electrification plan, lots of secondary rail lines, building of power stations) but truth is these were all already plans that were developed and would have been implemented with time in Imperial Russia.  ‚ÄúPlans‚Äù? It doesn‚Äôt matter if they had ‚Äúplans‚Äù to fly to Mars or to develop flying cars. One judges a system based on what it actually achieved in reality, not on what it ‚Äúcould have maybe or maybe not‚Äù achieved. E.g. Trump had ‚Äúplans‚Äù to build a wall, have ‚ÄúMexico pay for it‚Äù and ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù. He even started building it. But all that Americans got in the end was a ramshackle half-fence. Biden had ‚Äúplans‚Äù to abolish lifelong student debt ‚Äì and then he half-arsed it. So I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúplans‚Äù and half-empty, half-baked promises ‚Äì I only believe actually delivered products.        Here‚Äôs the objective truth: the Soviets *delivered* on their Union-wide engineering and electrification promise for nearly 300 million citizens (*the biggest, most challenging engineering project in human history*, apart from socialist China‚Äôs massively successful engineering feats). Whereas the Tsarist Imperialists didn‚Äôt deliver and massively under-performed (and instead wasted money on a xenophobic world war that regular people didn‚Äôt even want and didn‚Äôt support).        Look, the Tsarist regime had ‚Äúplans‚Äù to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the war against Japan (epic fail). The Tsarist regime had ‚Äúplans‚Äù to bulldoze Germany in WW1 (epic fail). So the Monarchists‚Äô track-record in terms of delivering on their grandiose promises was humiliatingly dismal.        Ironically, one of the few projects that the Tsarists / Romanovs achieved with ‚Äògreat‚Äô success (/s) was ethnically cleansing Russia‚Äôs hard-working blue-collar Jewish population, leading to millions of Jews fleeing from the Russian Empire to the United States. I am critical of the U.S. for many things, but even I have to admit that the U.S. was far more tolerant towards Jewish-Russian refugees than the antisemitic, chauvinistic Romanovs.        Moreover, in order to achieve any mass-scale engineering ‚Äúplans‚Äù ‚Äì you need a large and very educated workforce. Whereas most of the Russian Empire under the Romanovs couldn‚Äôt even read or write (didn‚Äôt have even basic literacy). The only way to achieve helpful mass-scale engineering ‚Äúplans‚Äù across a country so big was to have *socialist* programs for everyone (free universal primary & secondary education for all citizens, and free higher education for the working class). And, according to socialist principles, such universal free education should be an innate right not just for Russian ‚Äúwhite men‚Äù with their ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù, but for Jewish women, Central Asians, etc, for everyone *regardless of ethnicity, race or gender*.        And this is the revolutionary, unprecedented *breakthrough* that the socialist Soviets achieved ‚Äì they were the first to openly take a stand against racism, elitism and misogyny - and turned one of the most illiterate Eurasian countries into the most literate one, encouraging women and men of colour to become architects and engineers. Without this, no ‚Äúplans‚Äù by the chauvinist, misogynist, racist, insular Monarchists would have ever succeeded ‚Äì they wouldn't have enough skilled people to achieve helpful projects of such immense scale.        I‚Äôm mixed-race (Kazakh, Russian, Ukrainian-Jewish) and half of my family is Kazakh ‚Äì and we will forever be grateful to the socialist Revolutionaries for extending funding and teachers to us in the remote Kazakh steppes, so that even Kazakh girls from Muslim villages could go to university for free and become educated women (doctors, scientists, engineers, etc). Eastern European socialists (including socialist Russians) were the first ones to treat Central Asians as equals, as ‚Äúcomrades‚Äù (and not as second-class ‚ÄòUntermensch‚Äô citizens like the racist Monarchist chauvinists (mis)treated us, or as the ‚ÄòYellow Peril‚Äô like the North Americans smeared us).	1644012848.0	hvmdn23	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvmdn23/

16xq5o	You have some serious white washing of Russian/Soviet reputation here. Russia was never so fluffy or innocent. Yeah Russian history portrays any Russian expansion or wars as something justified, but so does any domestic history justify it‚Äôs own expansion.    ‚ÄúBritain and France are not, and never were, Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or genuine ‚Äúallies‚Äù‚Äù   Counties are never fiends. Even being an ally is temporary, as long as interests align. But the biggest problem with allying with the east in the late 19th or early 20th century is distance. China wasn‚Äôt as strong back then, and certainly wouldn‚Äôt have been able to ever support Russia in any way against the west. It‚Äôs simply too far away. And why would it want to? Just sending soldiers to another country to deal with issues with countries it doesn‚Äôt even border?   ‚ÄúLeft the war in 1917‚Äù yeah did you notice the loss of territory and other concessions that came with that ‚Äúpeace?‚Äù. Maybe the government in 1917 backed out of the war with very peace loving intentions. But soviet leaders tried to reclaim those territories and more afterwards, and that definitely came with loss of life.

2w4rckok	6.2   >And what did he give them instead of land reform‚Äù well actually Nicholas did give them land reform. You should look into Stolypin reform, which was an agrarian land reform. In 10 years of reform alone, 40% of all peasant households in the Russian Empire became landowners.   That ‚Äú40%‚Äù figure is incorrect. Encyclopaedia Britannica writes that its was no more than 20% and only ca. 10% had consolidated plots:   >‚ÄúThe reform was only a moderate success. By the end of 1916 no more than 20% of the peasant households had title to their land, although fewer (some 10%) had received consolidated plots. The reform did not transform the peasantry into the bulwark of support that the autocracy needed; and during 1917 peasants everywhere participated in the revolutions, seizing properties belonging to the Stolypin farmers.‚Äù   Also, Stolypin only started his reforms (from 1906 onwards) because the people organised the 1905 Revolution and the Elites got *scared*. The Elites didn‚Äôt do the land reform because they wanted to - they dragged their feet, and only did it because they had their backs pressed against the wall after multiple peasant revolts threatened their large capitalist holdings. So the feasting aristos decided to ‚Äòthrow a bone‚Äô to the peasants ‚Äì to try to ‚Äòpacify‚Äô them (but that scam didn‚Äôt work because the peasants weren‚Äôt as dim as the aristos thought).        **Moreover, Stolypin increased peasants‚Äô so-called ‚Äòfarm-ownership‚Äô via a program of ‚Äúresettlement‚Äù to Siberia.** My own maternal (Russian/Ukrainian) ancestors (ex-serfs) were apparently part of the scheme. They moved from Ukraine and the Volga region to Siberia because destitute peasants were promised ‚Äòbigger land plots in the East, beyond the Urals‚Äô. They‚Äôve obviously never been to south Siberia before (it was very far away from the Volga) and didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to inspect the land plots before making the move. When they arrived, peasants made the *shocking* discovery that the land they got in Siberia was pretty dismal and not very arable. So **the scheme was a capitalist scam**. [https://www.britannica.com/event/Stolypin-land-reform](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stolypin-land-reform)         That land in south Siberia was land that the aristocrats often didn‚Äôt even *want* ‚Äì it was *poor-soil* land (at least compared to the much richer soil in Ukraine and the Volga basin). The land that my maternal family got didn‚Äôt even have any *trees* for timber (it was basically steppe), so they had to live in a dugout. The peasants (including apparently my ancestors) were *duped* into getting 'land titles' to that Siberian land based on Stolypin‚Äôs scam. Some of those 'land titles' in Siberia weren‚Äôt even worth the paper that they were written on. This is one of the reasons why many people like my ancestors joined the Revolution ‚Äì because Stolypin scammed them and screwed them over.   >The Soviets like to claim otherwise, but the vast majority of land already belonged to the peasant class.   You do realise that ‚Äúthe vast majority of land‚Äù in Russia (and the wider Russian Empire) was almost barren or barely liveable due to extreme weather, right? Just like in Australia ‚Äì lots of land, but most of it is barely arable.        ‚ÄúThe vast majority of land‚Äù in the Russian Empire was in Siberia and Central Asia. Most of ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù is also in Asia - but some of the best land for farming is in the European part, where aristocratic landowners dominated. Though the European part was subject to frequent droughts, causing sporadic famine (one of the few advantages of Siberia ‚Äì few to no droughts, but long winters and very short farming season). So saying that ‚Äúpeasants‚Äù owned most of e.g. Siberia or Kazakhstan is not as great as it may sound.   >That‚Äôs right. The rich weren‚Äôt getting richer. The peasant farmers were.   That‚Äôs not ‚Äúright‚Äù. Rich Monarchists were indeed getting richer ‚Äì because they kept most of the best, most arable land, while the peasants often got the worst, most barren land, usually on the cold eastern outskirts of the Empire (like in freezing Siberia).        Moreover, when the serfs were originally so-called ‚Äòfreed‚Äô ‚Äì they had to buy the land from their former owners, so the rich were getting richer via cash ‚Äúredemption payments‚Äù. It‚Äôs the same old scam that big U.S. landowners pulled on African-Americans and that British landowners pulled on the subjugated Irish: the serfs/slaves were ‚Äúfreed‚Äù on paper, but in practice often had no other option but to keep on working for the landlords for many years as ‚Äúhired labour‚Äù and ‚Äútenant farmers‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt have enough income or savings to ‚Äúredeem-purchase‚Äù the land. The big landowners put that cash that they received from exploited peasants into banks and profited from getting bank interest. The Tsarist gov‚Äôt did nominally provided loans ‚Äì but the state loans were subsidised by taxing the peasants‚Äô produce! So it became a vicious circle of debt.        Britannica adds:  >‚ÄúIn fact, though an important class of well-to-do peasants did emerge in time, **most remained poor and land-hungry**, crushed by huge redemption payments. It was not until the revolutionary year of 1905 that the government terminated these payments. By then, the peasant loyalty that the emancipation was intended to create could no longer be achieved.‚Äù   Next issue:  >The Soviet narrative about poor landless peasants suffering under the yoke of Nicholases rule is disproved by history itself: during dekulakization the victims were not rich aristocratic land owners but peasant farm owners who owned their own land and toiled for their own benefit.   As Encyclopaedia Britannica underscores, *most* of the peasants were dirt-poor. A (small) class of peasants became middle-class ‚Äì but not necessarily because they ‚Äútoiled‚Äù more than the others. Look, they were called ‚ÄúKulak(s)‚Äù (i.e. **‚ÄúFist(s)‚Äù** / ‚ÄúTight-fists‚Äù) for a reason. They were nominally farmers, but often also acted as the village‚Äôs *Bank* / as *Creditors*. They were the few who originally lucked out by getting better plots of land which generated more income (since allocation was a chaotic lottery) ‚Äì and then, in order to become more rich, they *lent* that money out to other peasants (who were often in *debt*, e.g. for redemption payments to their ex-landlords), in exchange for *interest payments*.        Here‚Äôs the problem: the debtors sometimes *defaulted* on the debt capital or interest. And when that happened, bearing in mind that this was back in the 1900s when corporal punishment was allowed ‚Äì the ‚ÄúKulaks‚Äù (‚ÄúFists‚Äù) could beat their debtor with their *fists* in order to reclaim their debt. Or they could outsource this task by hiring gangster-type village hooligans to beat up and threaten the debtor until he pays out the debt in full. THAT is why they were called ‚ÄúFists‚Äù, for Pete‚Äôs sake. Because if you didn‚Äôt pay them back in time ‚Äì you risked getting punched & beaten up. Many Kulaks operated a racket, similar to neighbourhood petty gangs in the US who lent out money for profit and then harassed anyone who didn‚Äôt pay back the debt capital plus interest fast enough. Were all Kulaks necessarily gangsters? No. But enough of them were - to merit other villagers calling them ‚ÄúFists‚Äù (out of fear). Many villagers despised them ‚Äì same as many people despise Debt-collectors today.        Moreover, Kulaks were often farmers who \*hired\* other peasants to ‚Äútoil‚Äù on their farms. The pay that those ‚Äòhired hands‚Äô got was often quite small. That is another reason why Kulaks were seen as an exploitative class ‚Äì similar to modern-day British farmers who hire Romanian temp labourers and pay them peanuts relative to the fat profit margins that the Brits keep for themselves.        And I‚Äôm telling you this as someone who‚Äôs actually descended from one ‚ÄúKulak‚Äù in my family tree. And, yes, he was ‚Äúde-kulakised‚Äù. And, no, his grandson (my grandpa) doesn‚Äôt see him as a ‚Äòvictim‚Äô. I guess maybe he was one of those village debt collectors and wasn‚Äôt very popular.	1644014399.0	hvmhj0w	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hv663sf	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvmhj0w/

yqhvm	Well if you've read it, you may recognise this passage:  > But  if  we  talk  about  new  soil  and  territory  in  Europe  today,  we  can  think  primarily  only  of  Russia  and  its  vassal  border  states.   > Fate  itself  seems  to  seek  to  give  us  a  tip  at  this  point.  In  the  surrender  of  Russia  to  bolshevism,  the  Russian  people  was  robbed  of  that  intelligentsia  which  theretofore  produced  and  guaranteed  its  State  stability.  For  the  organization  of  a  Russian  State  structure  was  not  the  result  of  Russian  Slavdom's  State-political  capacity,  but  rather  a  wonderful  example  of  the  State-building  activity  of  the  German  element  in  an  inferior  race.  Thus  have  innumerable  mighty  empires  of  the  earth  been  created.  Inferior  nations  with  German  organizers  and  lords  as  leaders  have  more  than  once  expanded  into  powerful  State  structures,  and  endured  as  long  as  the  racial  nucleus  of  the  constructive  State-race  maintained  itself.  For  centuries  Russia  drew  nourishment  from  this  Germanic  nucleus  of  its  superior  strata  of  leaders.   Hitler specifically states that Slavs, and Russians in particular, are an inferior race. He attributes all the major historical achievements of Russia to Germanic leaders.   Jews were of course persecuted more than anyone else, and following the thoughts of the inventor of the whole "superior Aryan race", de Gobineau, Hitler associates Slavs with Jews. Not surprising, considering that most Jews lived in Slavic countries - mainly Poland and Ukraine. But they weren't Western Europeans like the French, or the British. Which was my point in the previous comment.   Of course, Nazis often went against their "ideals" in favour of political gain. Bulgaria (Romanians aren't Slavs) was an example of that. So was their alliance with Japan, since Asians were an inferior race in their view as well. And so was their non-aggression agreement with USSR, despite claiming to be a "bulwark against communism". As well as the many examples of recruiting people from occupied territories to serve as their enforcers (from the Croatian Usta≈°e, to Vlasov's Russian Liberation Army, to the countless collaborators from all over Eastern Europe).	1644077936.0	hvpnqgp	t3_skszuu	t1_hvpfk32	/r/russia/comments/skszuu/no_you_cant_just_triumphantly_celebrate_your/hvpnqgp/

isozk	The leaders of the USSR at the time didn't feel that way though, that's the point Im trying to make. That and our 2 countries got so tied up competing with each other, we forgot what I saw as a great friendship. America wasn't out of the war for much longer than the Sovoet Union either, the USA was surprise attacked by Japan in December of 1941, so only 6 months between your surprise invasion and ours. We spent more time and effort fighting the Japanese than we did Germany. On a totally different note,  I take great pleasure in knowing that the Japanese, even at war with America, was too afraid to sink planes and ships headed for Siberia, because of how badly the Soviet Union had defeated them at Khalkin Gol. I also take great pleasure in knowing that the Soviet Union kept it's promise to invade Japan after Hitler surrendered. The point Im trying to make is, why are we fighting about it? We helped each other destroy 2 evil fascists and we should celebrate it together as friends.	1644078130.0	hvpo7pd	t3_skszuu	t1_hvplyjs	/r/russia/comments/skszuu/no_you_cant_just_triumphantly_celebrate_your/hvpo7pd/

In 1974, Portugal authoritarian regime, the Estado Novo (New State) was toppled. Thanks to a coalition of socialist, communist and other opposition groups in the armed forces (MFA). Then, 1 year later, the radicals attempted an coup.  Kissinger's actions to make Portugal a vaccine against communism, in other words let radical communists rule Portugal and purge the moderates. In other words replace a dictatorship to another. All so that other European nation would see why they should purge the left.  He omitted and didn't wanted to help Portugal even though we were/are a founding member of NATO and he had evidences of a possible coup. Even saying that "we should attack Portugal and expel it from NATO" if the communists had won.  Welp, the radicals lost on 25 of November 1975, the Socialists and Mario Soares won (he is seen as the father of Portuguese democracy, died in 2017)  Then you have the death of S√° Carneiro, a popular Social Democrat politician.  Even after 42 years, there's no evidence of what actually happened, he died when the plane he was on crashed by accident... Or by sabotage.  There's a connection with the CIA here, Fernando Farinha Sim√µes and Jos√© Esteves testified that they had a relationship with Frank Sturgis (one of the guys of Watergate).	1644079327.0	hvpr7we	t3_skgp9x	t1_hvm58m7	/r/russia/comments/skgp9x/watch_this_heated_exchange_as_journalists/hvpr7we/

The US government is condescending by nature, that's why it's time for Europe to show she is not just an extension of the US, but an independent entity and start to treat Russia the way it deserve to be treated, as a major nation that you respect, not because of her military arsenal and the damages it could cause us, but because of what we can accomplish in collaboration with her. We have to trust Russia, and we have to hope that with time Russia will start to trust us. Learning from each other, we can only become greater.	1644079465.0	hvprkha	t3_skyrin	t1_hvpnkui	/r/russia/comments/skyrin/if_only/hvprkha/

Pull out your little green men, stop massing troops at the border, an respect h sovereignty of your neighbors.''  Look. I get that English is probably not your first language, so now and then things can get a bit lost. But at least have the intellectual honesty to admit that to yourself and ask what I meant.   If you can answer me why the NATO countries would want to force a war with Russia and are the aggressors here please explain, because to me it seems that most European countries are divided and there is no universal 'push against Russia'. The build up of European troops and materials has only happened AFTER Russia has been starting to amass troops there. Does Russia fear an invasion?  &#x200B;  Explain to me why it is impossible that Russia is the aggressor and why they would have no benefit in taking Ukraine, and tell me how NATO countries are the aggressor and what benefit they have of it, including how  the conflicting stances of EU countries align with that assessment.	1644080009.0	hvpsysv	t3_sl556l	t1_hvpk7au	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvpsysv/

I wondered if the people consider me a "westerner" or have a bad view of me like they would have if I was American. The people I interact with treat me very well and there's no sort of "xenophobia" but I wonder how do strangers perceive me when I'm walking around the streets of a small Russian town speaking English with my friends and barely able to speak Russian (I spend most my time in Kamensk-Uralsky/Sverdlovsk and Kataysk/Kurgan with my friends)  When I first entered Russia in December, I naturally spoke English at passport control and I remember overhearing some babushkas saying that I'm a "spy". This made me feel like strangers might dislike me...

2t068aaa	Democracy is a very beautiful name that very often hide an ugly truth. Big concerns control the politician, largely control the public opinion and in the end control who gets elected.   For a real democracy to work, you would need people to be very highly educated to be able to have an informed opinion about everything pertinent to political decision, you would need these citizen to be highly trained in critical thinking (bullshits detectors if you prefer), you would need citizen with a very high degree of abnegation to choose a leader even if is not the best for them as individuals provided it's the best for the nation...  Have you ever seen a nation, democratic or not trying to equip its citizen with that kind of competence? No, you try to feed them enough entertainment for them to leave you do your dirty deeds in peace.  Is democracy a beautiful idea? Yes. Is there a working democracy currently in operation?

Why do we need more ports? We have Novorossiysk, and now Crimea, Odessa will only be a competitor of these ports, logistics is also unfavorable.. It is even more ridiculous about the industrial base of Ukraine, it was in the USSR, now it has degraded and is of no value.. The most developed region is Donbass, but it is no longer Ukraine.. Russia has completely replaced all supplies from Ukraine and removed the best specialists.. Investing in the economy of Ukraine is the same as carrying water in a sieve..

eh3blt68	NATO is not an alliance of equals, it just so happens that American dominance has allowed these countries to slash their military budgets. It is still, however, an American-led alliance, meant to serve American interests. It is not in Europe's interest to go to war with Russia, but it is in America's interest. Nobody fears Ukraine, Germany, or Poland, or fucking Belgium; the danger is in *American* troops being on Russia's doorstep. Russia would have no need to start a costly war in Ukraine if they didn't think it was the preferable alternative to being surrounded by, as far as anyone can tell, bloodthirsty chauvinist Americans.	1644081834.0	hvpxmns	t3_sl556l	t1_hvpsysv	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvpxmns/

60b4dnou	I would like to recall an episode from the recent past. We all remember the tragedy of 9/11. The Russians, along with the rest of the world, mourned the deaths in America. When the U.S. government asked Russia for help, Russia responded immediately. The U.S. (NATO) was provided with military airfields on the territory of Russia and allied countries to support the military operation in Afghanistan. That was in 2001. Now appreciate what thanks Russia received from the U.S:        A list of coups d'√©tat, the so-called "color revolutions" that the U.S. has staged in countries bordering Russia:        Georgia 2003. "Rose Revolution." Anti-Russian pro-American forces came to power.        Ukraine 2004 "Orange Revolution. Anti-Russian pro-American forces came to power.        Kyrgyzstan 2005 "Tulip Revolution".        Belarus 2006 "Cornflower Revolution" (unsuccessful)        Moldova 2009 "Purple Revolution" (unsuccessful)        Ukraine 2014 "Revolution of Dignity" Anti-Russian pro-American forces came to power.        Armenia 2018. Anti-Russian forces came to power.        Despite this, NATO used Russian territory for the transit of supplies and troops until 2014.        Such wonderful friends the United States is. We have a saying: "You don't need an enemy with such a friend.	1644082424.0	hvpz55f	t3_skl5fi	t3_skl5fi	/r/russia/comments/skl5fi/question_to_russians_about_current_situation/hvpz55f/

6vk5m	What‚Äôs funny is that I refused to join the U.S. Army 5 years ago because I didn‚Äôt want to go to Syria, as I didn‚Äôt want to get in the Russian‚Äôs way. (Which ultimately we lost in Syria‚Ä¶) So 5 years later, I figured the air was clean and decided to enlist in our Air Force, and now the Ukraine situation is happening‚Ä¶ I pray to sweet Jesus I don‚Äôt go over there and get involved with that. When it comes to Russian conflict, I turn anti-war real quick. A war with Russia is a guaranteed death. If I had a country of my own, Russia would be the last one I‚Äôd want to go to war with.  I‚Äôm very happy Moscow wants diplomacy. I feel like we can work something out. Genuinely, many wish the elite in Washington DC would just sit back and breathe some fresh air for once and look at what‚Äôs going on. I personally oppose Ukraine being in NATO, I think it‚Äôs highly unsafe if NATO expands East, and diplomacy is the best way to go about this.

p7h2ze	There are many myths and lies about Stalin in the West. He was feared then and still feared today on the West. Why? He did many great things. Among which stands out victories in the most terrible war in the history of mankind. And the biggest economic growth in human history. Everyone is silent about this. But under Stalin's rule, the growth of the USSR economy was at the level of 15-20% annually for 30 years, except for 4 years of war. This is higher than the growth of the Chinese economy in recent decades.	1644083455.0	hvq1v3p	t3_slci95	t3_slci95	/r/russia/comments/slci95/the_greatest_ruler_in_the_history_of_russia/hvq1v3p/

3dfxgwiz	The United States literally has the most immigrants, as in foreign born people who moved to the United States, according to UN statistics. Meanwhile, Russia is pretty high up on the list of countries with the most emigrants, as in domestically born people who moved away from Russia. When taking into account immigration to and emigration from Russia there is only a slight net positive toward immigration, and it doesn‚Äôt look great when compared to other developed countries. It‚Äôs not surprising that countries like Canada, the United States, Australia, Denmark, Sweden have a higher ratio of people moving there compared to leaving. Russia isn‚Äôt very impressive from an opportunistic and economic point of view. Poland has a higher GDP per capita PPP than Russia. The State of California has a higher GDP than all of Russia. Rather pitiful for Russia considering the economic potential it could have.	1644083665.0	hvq2e8m	t3_skmzyw	t1_hvpzzkm	/r/russia/comments/skmzyw/how_is_life_in_russia/hvq2e8m/

p7h2ze	This is how the majority of Russian people think. And the fact that he had a team with him. Right. And in the West they don‚Äôt know that there were 2 wings inside the Communist Party: the Bolsheviks (the Stalin group, they are Russian patriots) and the Trotskyists (Jewish globalists who were sponsored by Wall Street bankers). When they talk about Stalin's repressions. In fact, these were Trotskyist repressions. Because it was the Trotskyists who then headed the law enforcement agencies and all the Gulags. In the West, they are very sorry that Stalin's group won, and not Trotsky's. Therefore, so many lies were poured on Stalin.	1644083829.0	hvq2t6o	t3_slci95	t1_hvq0krb	/r/russia/comments/slci95/the_greatest_ruler_in_the_history_of_russia/hvq2t6o/

4h4mk	And there you have it. The moment Germany tries to have economic relations with Russia "something magically happens" to break up such deals. For example, Germany tries to buy more Russian gas? -> Ukraine crisis. What a "coincidence".  The last thing US interests want to see is exactly what Putin describes as the combination of European (German in particular) industrial know-how and the vast resources and work-force of Russia.

ikxidbgw	Everyone is talking about the threat of a war, but the war began in 2014, when the US and Poland supported the coup d'√©tat in Ukraine, in Kiev.   I note that there are more ethnic Russians in Kiev than Ukrainians.   There is an old American idea that in order to maintain dominance in Europe, America needs to tear Ukraine away from Russia, draw Ukraine into the EU and NATO and squeeze Russia out, push Russia away from Europe, because it is a competitor. The prize is dollar dominance.   The problem is that vast areas of Ukraine are populated by ethnic Russians who are not immigrants there.   The United States believes that they will either completely tear Ukraine away from Russia, or destabilize Ukraine by projecting instability on Ukraine.   Either way, they win.	1644087584.0	hvq9sjc	t3_slc6hd	t3_slc6hd	/r/russia/comments/slc6hd/about_the_whole_russia_issue_can_someone_explain/hvq9sjc/

hhyge6m2	Well, I live in –û—Ä—ë–ª (Oryol) and it‚Äôs a small city, about 400,000 people live here. When I say small, I don‚Äôt really mean ‚Äúsome town with a couple of 5-story apartments and a tiny convenience store‚Äù, but the kind of small where you can fit about 15 of this city in Moscow. We don‚Äôt have quite a few luxuries the bigger cities have, like a metro, though we don‚Äôt need one. The city is ripe with both older Soviet apartments and modern buildings (such as shopping centres), and it‚Äôs kinda weird seeing an old apartment building from USSR times right next to a modern one that‚Äôs still under construction. Transportation here is fine. We‚Äôve got quite a few car dealerships with relatively normal prices, and there‚Äôs loads of buses and trolley buses for public transportation. Oryol has all kinds of stores. There‚Äôs lots of small convenience stores, bakeries, beer stores, and there‚Äôs even some big shopping centres. I don‚Äôt know much about the salaries here (I‚Äôm still in school), but every job here seems to be liveable. If you want to earn a lot of money, however, your best shot is some sort of government-related job. The parks are nice (we even have a Ferris wheel) and everything overall is great. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs great. I personally like it here!	1644089041.0	hvqcyz6	t3_skmzyw	t1_hvmi440	/r/russia/comments/skmzyw/how_is_life_in_russia/hvqcyz6/

America and Russia starting a war with specifically the other one would have to start in like the Bering Strait, and wouldn‚Äôt make any sense whatsoever.  America and Russia have always avoided conflict because it‚Äôs just not worth it, so any start to war between the two would almost have to be a Russian invasion of a NATO state or NATO aligned state like Finland because America isn‚Äôt gonna invade Russia or Belarus any time soon.  As for the rest of the reliability of this question, this graph alone doesn‚Äôt show how many people asked, how old they were, if the question was a leading one, etc‚Ä¶so it‚Äôs entirely unreliable as it stands.	1644089677.0	hvqe7zw	t3_sl556l	t1_hvpe4bo	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvqe7zw/

vhux6cl	Visceral reactions aren't absolute in a particular direction. This isn't pre internet, pre September 11.  People have seen and had a gutful of the lies from politicians that are supposed to be representing their interest, and the media that is supposed to be providing the checks and balances by holding them to account.  People aren't stupid, look at what is going on in Canada and many other countries right now.  I think the continuation of these types of tactics the media use has reached a tipping point where it actually works against their interest instead of for them.  There is nothing misleading, they are continuing to dig their own hole and the data backs that statement up.	1644093091.0	hvqjpvl	t3_slf3d8	t1_hvqi8le	/r/russia/comments/slf3d8/western_propaganda_sir/hvqjpvl/

So is its technological competitiveness (just a dozen years ago, who thought companies like ZTE, Huawei or DJI would compete with anything the West has on equal footing?). The birth rates of its native populations are below replenishment rate. Western military domination is also faltering, and with it, its political influence - the Western forces run from Afghanistan tail between legs; allow Iran to fire missiles on their bases without retaliation; fail to walk the walk after talking the talk about "punishing" Kim.	1644095924.0	hvqpjv3	t3_sl9s5k	t3_sl9s5k	/r/russia/comments/sl9s5k/open_discussion_do_you_b√©live_the_west_is_in/hvqpjv3/

axj03	Yes, both de EU and the US.    Order and stability are not the status quo. They take effort and a high trust society. Some simple things that I think lead to decline:   \- Low trust in your neighbour. Too much political fracture, because by design, it enhances national conflict. Believe in democracy is on a decline.   \- Increased referencing of good and evil by personal perspective makes it hard to rally around the flag. Not that I like nationalism, but the relative unity of the 50's are far away.   \- Increased corruption allround, even though it's still relatively low.   \- People thinking in rights over responsibilities. There is a time for both, but in the West, I would say it's more time for the latter.   \- Population decline.     The West still has some amazing features in corporate innovation, strong bureaucracy and a great ease to rise the ranks. It gains power by sacrificing social control, and as long as CEO's and politicians have a moderate common goal, I think it does great. But the latter is obviously falling.   That said, I wonder if the Brexit will revitalize UK identity one way or another. Will take some time.

1es257i5	the current conflict between Nato and Russia has no right to exist because the only reason driving it is the fear of the other while none of them want to attack the other. But Nato will not accept Russia out of principle of course, but i am personaly not sure if that is the rational choice. The collapse of the Soviet union was a very extreme and unpredicted event. The borders of countries now were drawn up by Soviet bureaucrats and are in a few cases not that compatible with ethnic groups. The way Russia handles this is in my eyes wrong, as military occupation and illegal intervention like hacking and funding rebbel groups is never a good thing. There should however be more international discussion of legal redistibution of formar soviet territories according to the people that live there. The situation now could be resolved with diplomacy in a way that is fair for all.	1644099481.0	hvqxbhv	t3_sl556l	t1_hvqu9e7	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvqxbhv/

Back then, in 1938, when Allies of Czechoslovakia were negotiating with Germans on the matter of dividing said Czechoslovakia - without even bothering to call them to the conference. France had all the chances to threaten  Germany with two-front war, preventing takeover of Czech industry and arsenals. Also, as Germany at the moment was in fact bankrupt, failure with peaceful annexation could lead to German economic crushing under the debt, so WW2 wouldn't even happen. At least, certainly not in the format we know from history.

fgpfr	Consider the fact that NATO's entire purpose was to oppose the Soviet Union - a country that by now has not existed for 30 years - and yet NATO continues to expand eastward and position troops and materiel closer and closer to Russia. Look also at the rhetoric of NATO countries throughout this period in relation to Georgia, Syria, Ukraine, etc. Everything suggests that NATO countries absolutely desire a war with Russia (albeit through proxies rather than direct invasion) and still see Russia as a geopolitical enemy to be opposed and even toppled.  With all that in mind, I do think you're correct that NATO isn't ever likely to actually invade Russia directly and has no intention of doing so. But equally, I think Russians have every reason to feel threatened by NATO. The last time NATO countries got involved in Russia's internal politics the life expectancy of Russians dropped by like a decade. Russia has no reason to trust NATO.  I should divulge here: I'm not Russian, though I've spent a couple of years there and talked to many Russians about this type of subject and I think a lot of them would echo what I've said.	1644100883.0	hvr0g9x	t3_sli6do	t3_sli6do	/r/russia/comments/sli6do/why_does_russia_fear_nato_it_is_fundamentally/hvr0g9x/

Furthermore, people also lived in Siberia, so if that was their place or residence then it made sense for them to get land there.    If you can read Russian check out this source. It‚Äôs a book called Russian Agriculture before the revolution by Professor Chelintsev. He says that more than 90% of land for cows, horses, pigs, wheat, grains in general (89.3%) belonged to peasants. Also he states that the majority of vegetables, potatoes, linen were raised in peasant farms/households.    https://library6.com/books/411607.pdf   As for your information about Kulaks: again you‚Äôre repeating a lot of Soviet information here. In agriculture there is almost always hired hands that help during harvest. Yes the Kulaks were the richest of village peasants, but calling hiring helpers for seasonal work exploitation is a bit much.    Case in point: during Soviet times the Kolhoz system still didn‚Äôt have enough people to deal with the harvest.  Instead this labour was outsourced to school students and university students. Mandatory unpaid child labour. Cute, right? (Ok they were teenagers, but still school children).   So what‚Äôs better? Paying landless labourers to help with the harvest? Or having school children spend 2 weeks of their vacation working fields for free? And university students spend a whole month in the beginning of the school year? Mandatory? Unpaid? While living in barely adequate conditions? And still that wasn‚Äôt enough. Volunteers came to work the harvest in return for some crops. They would then take these crops home and sell them in markets (some of my relatives had a nice side hustle in the 90s working in Apple orchards during their vacation and then latter selling apples). An argument can be made that at least this way nobody is getting rich on the backs of the poor, but calling peasant farmers rich is a really really big stretch. They were people who toiled on their farms year round, lived in villages and worked for everything they had. Yes they were more successful than others, and they did somewhat better. But enemy or exploitators they were not.    Largely in the case of peasant farmers the only thing the Soviet Union achieved is to make everyone equally miserable.

An argument can be made that at least this way nobody is getting rich on the backs of the poor, but calling peasant farmers rich is a really really big stretch. They were people who toiled on their farms year round, lived in villages and worked for everything they had. Yes they were more successful than others, and they did somewhat better. But enemy or exploitators they were not.    Largely in the case of peasant farmers the only thing the Soviet Union achieved is to make everyone equally miserable. But equality I guess.	1644101033.0	hvr0s92	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hvmhj0w	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvr0s92/

I always thought that is was because the gouvernment was corrupt and not functioning wel (although it is not doing that either now) Personally i cant say much about the Minsk agreement as I have not read it, but if russia is intervening militarily in those regions as you suggest than that is not democratic either is it. And yeah the Russian army is stronger than that of Ukraine but is that really that weird?

16xq5o	You also speak a lot about Kulaks. But from what little research I‚Äôve done the people that were initially called kulaks and wealthy peasants WERE NOT THE SAME GROUP.    One group was the flippers, speculators, and userers. These were the guys who gave out loans and collected on them. And yes, no doubt many of them were essentially gangsters and loan sharks. But then the Soviet Union did a clever trick and labeled another group, the more well to do peasant landowners who were just FARMERS kulaks.    Nowadays in the west there are other nonviolent methods to prevent non-payment. Courts can ensure part of your paycheck goes to pay debts. Credit reports will tell potential landlords, employers  and  other creditors that this person will not pay. Essentially if you default on repaying what you own modern financial institutions have ways to ruin your life without resorting to violence. So many pay. In the early 20th century these methods did not exist. And so the only thing that kept people from defaulting on debt payments and never giving back the money because they don‚Äôt want to was violence. I am not really excusing the methods, but that‚Äôs the only way it could realistically be done back in those days (specifically for regular people).	1644101768.0	hvr2fyz	t3_sbkhcu	t1_hvmhj0w	/r/russia/comments/sbkhcu/king_george_v_king_of_great_britain_and_ireland/hvr2fyz/

Although I should say (not american) but I understand why 9/11 was seen as an attack basically equating to war, so there is some justification for the initial decision to go to war. The rest after... yeah it was not very defensive. I should stress though that it did actually start as a defense, which is my point with Russia. If 9/11 didn't happen neither would have the wars in the middle east. Unless Russia strikes first, NATO wouldn't go to war. Or if they do...

The expansion, also yes, but it's not like NATO is taking over countries. They all voted to join, so shouldn't they? I mean if they join voluntarily, what's the alternative, being forced to stay in the USSR/warsaw pact?

fgpfr	The alternative would be NATO refusing to take on new members on Russia's border, on the basis that recruiting new members is provocative and is a betrayal of promises that were made to Russia/the USSR in the 90's.  Another alternative - if we're to assume that collective security really is NATO's goal and not just opposing Russia - would be including Russia in future decisions in some capacity. What that might look like would be anyone's guess, but it's a possible compromise at least.  The other alternative would be to just drop the pretence of NATO being a legitimate 21st Century institution and disband the damn thing. It existed to counteract the Warsaw Pact. It doesn't need to exist anymore, except to advance the US' geopolitical interests in Europe, Libya, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Its members' own interests don't even align anymore.  Having said all that, Russia is not blameless in all this and I do think there's a need for Eastern European countries to have some kind of collective security, which is a role I'd like to see taken up either by those countries themselves, or potentially by the EU. But I really don't think NATO survives this century either way.	1644103656.0	hvr6nqt	t3_sli6do	t1_hvr4x1d	/r/russia/comments/sli6do/why_does_russia_fear_nato_it_is_fundamentally/hvr6nqt/

I don't think it can ever outright ban new members, because it is built on the right of countries to choose who to ally with, which in principle can't just drop.  Second point I agree with. Diplomacy is essential, I think the mutual lack of trust just doesn't help. Problem is generally there is little compromise that countries wish to agree to when dealing with border issues, alhough that's an age-old problem.  Third point, that's kinda the point though. If it lasted long enough that it is no longer essential, it means it works. So it wouldn't make sense to drop it, since no other alternative has prevented war in europe to that extent.  Fourth is appreciated, and I somewhat agree. Problem is there is no viable alternative for NATO currently, and we don't wanna take many risks trying them. Also a new alliance would still be provocative and have the same issues. Sure NATO isn't perfect, but europe relies on it for some certainty of peace. There is virtually no european NATO member that joined to intimidate Russia.	1644104866.0	hvr9cep	t3_sli6do	t1_hvr6nqt	/r/russia/comments/sli6do/why_does_russia_fear_nato_it_is_fundamentally/hvr9cep/

6dgifn16	I read a history book (I believe the title translates to "Stalin's marshals") there was writen that Bulgarians despite being in axis dont fight Soviet Union, because of tradition of Russian-Bulgarian friendship. I forgot exact name of soviet marshal, but it was something like he wanted to avoid unnecessarlly spill of blood, so he make a radio announcement to not fight the soviets troops, becouse they are here to fight the nazis not Bulgarians. And i went smoothly.   I'm really curious what is your point of view on this, becouse I know that this book is writen by Russian historian and there are a couple things that are not exactly right. But as you are Bulgarian you maybe can say a me a little more about it?	1644104953.0	hvr9j7v	t3_sl556l	t1_hvp2io1	/r/russia/comments/sl556l/and_whose_side_are_you_on/hvr9j7v/

You can't go to a restaurant or mall without a QR code.  Things are not great here.

But facts are that pashinian invoked Article 2 and Russia did all they could based on Article 2. He never invoked Article 4, [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lZ-qvMopI&t=34s&ab_channel=YerevanToday) \- so now you're making up falseclaims about pashinian testing something and making up Russia rejected anything just to whitewash nikol pashinian  >I know this is hard for you comprehend when you are 24/7 drunk.  I aint the one who makes up fake stories to blame Russia  >We don't need intelligence to tell us when it was public information that Russia in Syria (another country allied Putin) failed to stop these terrorists from flying to Artsakh. If Russia gave a shit why they let this happen? Oh sorry they were busy selling s400 to Turks.  sigh, you're making up another false claims. Naryshkin, intelligence director of one the major powers, of Russia, was first to support Armenia's claims followed later by Macron, but you don't need him too? And how exactly Russia failed in Syria? Allepo is liberated, Homs is liberated, Palmyra, Deir-ez-Zor as well as suburbs of Damascus are liberated from terrorists. Syria is basically saved from terrorists thanks to Russia and Iran, terrorists remain now only in Idlib under control of NATO's major ally Turkey (that flew terrorists there) and that of US in at-Tanf. So, only thing failed is your ability to make a research before claiming something.  &#x200B;  >Oh so 4000 Armenians died for no reason cause we didn't recognize ourselves, so foolish of us that state building is simply self recognition. I'm sure if we recognized Russia would have helped us and Azerbaijan would never attack. So once again it's our fault. Thanks for kicking us while we down, is what Russia does best.  Do not put your words in my mouth. 5000 Armenians died due to literal treason from pashinian's government and there are tons of facts backing it up.  Armenia had to recognize Artsakh's independence during war - pashinian didn't. And he is now rooting for all out normalization with Turkey and Azerbaijan.   And while we are on recognizing issue - Armenia had to recognize Artsakh even before it, in 2014 doing so while recognizing Crimea's reunification with Russia. Sargsian didn't do it.   So once again, you're making up false claim number 3   &#x200B;  >Ahh once again Armenia the losing party is at fault. Not that Azerbaijan was winning and wanted Shushi. Another foolish mistake by us. I never knew defeated parties had so much leverage to decide when a war ends and what they can keep. üòÜ  September 29 Shushi was under Armenian control  mid-October - Shushi was under Armenian control  Both times Putin mediated agreement - both times pashinian refused - this are fact. Get serious, face them and stop making up false claims (number 4 btw)  &#x200B;  >So Putin own words don't count, your mental gymnastics is what people should take face value  [Pashinyan officially applies to CSTO Collective Security Council Chairman-in-Office to execute Article 2](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1052329)\- not Putin's words  [CSTO Rejects Yerevan‚Äôs Appeal for Help in Armenia Border Breach by Azerbaijan](https://asbarez.com/csto-rejects-yerevans-appeal-for-help-in-armenia-border-breach-by-azerbaijan/) \- fake headline by news agency - again not Putin's words  [Putin Says Karabakh is Azerbaijan, Adding Ankara Defended Baku‚Äôs ‚ÄòJust Cause‚Äô](https://asbarez.com/putin-says-karabakh-is-azerbaijan-adding-ankara-defended-bakus-just-cause/) \-  manipulating headline to present Putin as someone pro-Turkish.   In reality, [Putin said: Turkey defended what the deem to be Azerbaijan's just cause.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmoqBoHsxN4&ab_channel=%D0%A0%D0%91%D0%9A) Fact checking shows your (and Asbarez's) another big fat lie.

Vladimir Putin](https://www.1lurer.am/en/2020/11/17/Refusing-the-current-agreements-will-be-suicide-for-Armenia-Vladimir-Putin/361119) \- we've seen pashinian, his orders during war (like disasterous lele-tepe operation carried out because of pressure on HQ from him, his wife and loyal samvel babayan, and see his pro-Turkish policy. Putin's isn't wrong - renouncing agreement now with that traitor in power equals to suicide (and we've seen how he invokes wrong articles)  &#x200B;  To conlcude, you are lying again and again. Lying so bad that simple fact checking shows how bad you are at it. Make some research, read history books before making false claims.   **No one, not pashinian, not bots like you who spread fakes can do anything to divide Russo-Armenian brotherhood**	1644424044.0	hw8pn5r	t3_so8y46	t1_hw8lwk2	/r/russia/comments/so8y46/russia_strongly_condemns_israeli_airstrikes_in/hw8pn5r/

Here are the facts: 5 countries have new bioweapons labs:   USA, UK, Sweden, Poland and Czech Republic,   We've heard the same rubber stamp allegations - "very likely" that Russia is responsible, this has been repeated over and over and as Robert Parry points out, lies are repeated over and over in the MSM until they are simply accepted as fact , truth!

hvp2lljs	Russophobia is actively inspired by some   Western media and even governments to achieve   their political or economic goals through   Russia.   A great example is Nord Stream 2.   Any use of the term ‚ÄúRussian aggression‚Äù is   Russophobia.   The most striking example of Russophobia was the mental   illness of the United States Secretary of Defense   James Forrestal. Yes, this is the famous ‚ÄúRussians are coming‚Äù.   Russophobia refers to a deliberate attempt   blame Russia for all the troubles in the world, based on   lack of hard evidence or evidence,   distorted half-truths or even outright lies. USA   are the epicenter of Russophobia, followed by   UK, Canada, Holland, Australia, countries   Baltics and Sweden...   Downed MH17 aircraft over eastern Ukraine, before   after the plane hit the ground, the US blamed Russia,   even Putin himself! John Kerry gave a press release   which said: "We know where the rocket came from,   we know who launched it, Russia was involved in   this."   !!!!!!   Russia intervenes in 2020 campaign to help Trump   and Sanders! Apparently, the House Intelligence Committee   representatives were instructed by Intel that   Russia intervenes   CNN and MSM immediately played the Russian   interference!

Most of the alive Russian ‚Äúveterans‚Äù didn‚Äôt even see this war, as it was far from them (to the West). Russia loves to show up their veterans for propaganda concerns, but most of these people in uniform are overvalued. They are not the ones who really impacted this war.	1644428715.0	hw92ec0	t3_pqql88	t1_hddqr0a	/r/russia/comments/pqql88/the_last_soviet_veteran_of_his_battle_group/hw92ec0/

sg8yz	Let me preface with that I'm not a specialist nor am I in this field. Just commenting through personal experience. Leaving for 2 days will not work as it's 12 months rolling. So you will need to leave for the remainder of 365 - 180 days. I think this is valid for both tax and your visa. Once you leave, the 180 days does not "reset". It only resets once a year has passed since you checked in. As example, you arrive 20 March 2022, and stay for 180 days. Then you'll need to leave and will only be able to start a new 180 day cycle 21 March 2023. This is how my visa rules worked, so check yours.

ikxidbgw	To tell you the truth, I don't know who killed these people. Skripal cooperated with the intelligence services of several countries, Litvinenko had many suspicious connections.   If they were killed by Russian intelligence, I do not condemn, because I believe that treachery in Russian intelligence should be punishable by death. And in any territory.   Intelligence professionals wouldn't kill with radioactive material. This is ridiculous. "Novichok" is a weapon of mass destruction, they would not use it either. This is also ridiculous. You believe that Russians are capable of anything, but it seems to me that professionals would not work like that.   Therefore, I admit that this is a disinformation anti-Russian project, of which the United States and Great Britain are launching a lot.   I believe that the UK is always ready, if necessary, to kill people in other countries, since historically your nation is one of the most cruel on Earth.	1644430042.0	hw9627u	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw9627u/

(TERRORISTS ASSISTANT!)    cooperated with militants of banned terrorist groups such as Tahrir al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra), participated in sabotage and even executions, spread disinformation against Damascus, staged attacks using banned poisonous substances and filmed fake videos ‚Äúfrom the scene‚Äù, to blame them on the Syrian government and army.   https://img.projektn.sk/wp-static/2018/04/syria-hoax-I.jpg?fm=jpg&q=85&w=2400&h=1260&fit=crop&fm=png&markx=10w&marky=5w&markpost=bottom-right&markw=15w&mark= 2019/06/sk.png   the entire Syrian government arsenal of chemical weapons was eliminated a few years earlier - under the supervision of the OPCW and the world community, and even with the direct participation of the United States, Great Britain and other Western countries.   And this is where the White Helmets with their fakes came in handy. Footage of civilians killed and suffocated by poisonous and nerve-paralytic gases by this organization regularly appeared in the global media space. The White Helmets churned out videos with fake ‚Äúbombed out hospitals‚Äù and ‚Äúkilled civilians‚Äù due to Russian and Syrian air strikes. However, when checking, it turned out that the footage was a production, for participation in which money was paid, and the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù from the video were wearing makeup.   Russia and Syria signaled the staged nature of the content of the White Helmets, presented evidence to the UN and the Hague Tribunal, systematically exposing these British terrorists!   These combined efforts have paid off. In particular, due to the fact that a large number of facts indicated that the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma was in fact an act of fraud, Washington decided in 2018 to suspend further funding for the White Helmets project. As Bild wrote, at the request of the United States, Canada and a number of European countries, Israel then evacuated hundreds of NGO employees and their families from Syria to Jordan, from where they were later taken to the UK, Canada and Germany. The Americans were forced to rethink their military, political and media strategy in Syria.	1644430132.0	hw96b3y	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw96b3y/

p7h2ze	When it happens once or even twice, you can say that it is an accident. But when this is repeated many times over the past 10 years. And often there is a direct connection with London (Litvinenko, Berezovsky, Skripali, I haven't forgotten anyone). Colony of England and USA Ukraine, where Mi6 and CIA have full power. Then the answer becomes obvious. This is further enhanced by whipping up hysteria in the Western media. Sometimes even to the moment, as was the case with Boeing. He had not yet managed to fall to the ground, and the Western media were already blaming Russia. Such things in the style of MI6.	1644430211.0	hw96ipz	t3_soig3i	t1_hw942f6	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw96ipz/

ms6e8	1999 house bombings - absolutely out of Putin's character. Multiple videos, interviews, pressers for all these 20 years have shown him to value highly lives and problems of common Russians.  Litvinenko - I don't know enough to talk about it.  Magnitsky - definitely a hoax. Watch "The Magnitsky Act - Behind the Scenes"  MH17 - I don't trust Bellingcat (parallel lines blatantly do not converge into a single point on some of their photos), but I'm not 100% sure that separatists didn't do that.  Skripals - poisoning is, obviously, true, but I'm not sure who is behind it. Petrov and Boshirov in their only interview to RT left an impression of a not-came-out gay couple who were either doing some shady business or doing some sex trip in Salisbury. Sergei Kapchuk's story (Russian businessman who had to run for his life from England to Russia after Skripals) and overall coordinated media assault also raise some doubts.  Navalny - definitely no poisoning, He had pancreatitis, got hospitalized, moved to Germany and there either Novichok traces were planted on the evidence or chemical labs were coerced into faking tests.	1644431380.0	hw99pg3	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw99pg3/

iy0hnr3k	I'm not Russian but I have an opinion on this.  So Russia inherited the KGB now the FSB, one of the most highly trained and experienced secret services in the world. They spent literal decades having a secret war against the likes of the CIA and MI6. They aren't amateurs.   Now does it really seem plausable that this highly competent organisation will send Russian nationals to the UK to poison the Skripals. With a compound as overt as Novichok.  Russia like most States has ways the deal with problem people using black ops. But these people usually have a heart attack or dissappear never to be seen again.   Seriously think about how ridiculous it is, the idea of a Russian intelligence agency ever sanctioning an attack like this.  And at the risk of going into conspiracy territory. This all happened in close proximity to Porton Down, the British laboratory known for housing things such as Novichok, anthrax, etc. In the area of the UK with the best chemical attack response ability.  I don't believe it was Russian intelligence that carried out the attack. If they did the Skripals wouldn't be alive.	1644431514.0	hw9a2l5	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw9a2l5/

8fsiy8kv	There is a rather big difference between very conservative and extreme conservative. Almost as big as between a liberal and an anarchist, or autonomist, etc. National Socialists aka Nazi's did subscribe to an extreme right-wing political ideology. While extreme left-wing political ideology takes its roots in Marxism /Communism. What I find humorous though is the fact that most of those who subscribe to an extreme left-wing ideology profess their love to   Such organizations as such as Irish Nationalists and Palestinian Liberation Orgizanization...who in turn idolize Hitler..

121hik	I think litvinenko was most probably killed by command of someone important in FSB or someone even more important from government. And while it's shitty, he was their part and it was their inner thing. It's moving this assassination into weird territory of "its bad but it was well understood by everyone involved well before it happened that it may be a thing and most surely they had an opportunity to not became a part of this at that point of time but they didn't"   As for Skripal tho, this is interesting how usually Russian agents are painted as qualified, efficient and scaryt, but then this thing happens where every single thing screams incompetence if we assume that it was done by Russians.  We didn't have motive, and if we are moronic enough to make attempt like this, I think no man in western country have the reason to care about any danger coming from Russia, because we are too stupid to really achieve anything.	1644433891.0	hw9gh81	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw9gh81/

c7attelg	Thanks for posting OP. Also a British person here who has become suspicious of the official line. I've been learning Russian for one year now becuse I want to be able to get the whole story and hear from ordinary people. Its pretty clear at this point that Russians are no more or less oppressed by Putin than we are by Boris Johnson and Russia is no more or less evil and cunning than England and all that's done in its name. Only the Russians aren't involved in military nonsense all over the world backing up America. Its all finger pointing and I don't buy it. Every year the same story Putin has troops lined up to invade Ukraine. Maybe he will make a fool of me and do it but things don't add up and I do believe we have been brought up with propaganda our whole lives.  My family can be traced back to Russia or possibly Belarus on one side so its been an interest of mine for a long time.	1644434048.0	hw9gwe4	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw9gwe4/

Grigory Potemkin quickly set to work.  By spring, the first streets appeared in Sevastopol, the embankment was finished with stone, houses and palaces grew, sidewalks lined with fruit trees were laid. In July, the laying of a water supply system with a water tower began in the city, at the same time Potemkin himself visited the city for the first time. Sevastopol will become the capital of the Black Sea Fleet, the city of Russian maritime glory.	1644434148.0	hw9h5tm	t3_solac3	t3_solac3	/r/russia/comments/solac3/on_february_10_1784_by_decree_of_catherine_ii_the/hw9h5tm/

Mossad, MI6, CIA do assassinations every year that don't get publicized or mentioned, it would be stupid but easy to blame Russia (as you said it's a meme now). Same with Navalny as well, nobody with a brain would think he was poisoned by Russia, allowed to leave (despite restrictions from being a criminal), allowed to be looked at by multiple doctors, then returned if it was an actual assassination attempt. Also, even if Litvinenko WAS poisoned by Russia, he chose his own end by aligning himself with many of the wrong people, whether it be life in prison with 1 hour of sunlight, or an early grave (according to US/UK treason charges)	1644437368.0	hw9pnyz	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hw9pnyz/

26um0b7u	After the war, Adelia and Zinaida lived together in the city of Leningrad (St. Petersburg). Zinaida, after Arthur's death, got married for the second time. Her husband was an ordinary administrative employee of the railway station, well, he had an award - the Order of Lenin. He said that he received this award because he was the person who, under Lenin's dictation, sent a telegram to Moscow that the Great October Revolution had taken place. I don't know if it's true or not.    Zinaida survived the siege of Leningrad because her second husband was the commandant at the station and he had a reinforced ration.    The whole family of Zinaida (in particular, my father, who is her grandson) often went to Estonia to the farm of a forester they knew named Mikkhel. Somewhere to the lake V√µrtsj√§rv.   Zinaida lived to be 95 years old.   I have almost no works of Arthur, only a few sketches and one painting. He made copies of paintings to order. The painting is hanging in a dark corner, I don't want to take it off, so the photo quality is poor.

ekm60bbq	Oh, I understand you well. Let me simplify this:  Imagine two separate group of people need to communicate somewhere in-between. This is the way pidgin creates. Can we name it "naturally occuring language"? Sure, it is absolutely natural. Now, ask yourself, what is the difference between mentioned before Russenorsk and Esperanto, if Esperanto was based on EXACTLY  the same principles  - assembling some into one? Here is the clue: Esperanto is pidgin that was created systematized, having developed grammar and such. But if one wants to systematize any pidgin, the result would be the same	1644439643.0	hw9vx6n	t3_so6hs9	t1_hw9r0jt	/r/russia/comments/so6hs9/russian_languages/hw9vx6n/

This is not popular thinking in America but my husband visited Russia with his grandpa who had business and pals in Russia.   It is a beautiful country that we, Americans, are supposed to dislike because of all the American propaganda.    I wish to visit Russia one day and see certain buildings and cities that are more beautiful than can be imagined.  When Putin said America is riddled with pedophilia and satanism, he is correct and brave to say so.

e40g2dvs	Never once did I say American intervention was ‚Äúgood‚Äù for these places. I am simply trying to illustrate the fact that these were always unstable areas regardless of American intervention or not. Obviously no one is arguing these places are better for American intervention, that‚Äôs a whole different argument that I am not going to make. These areas have history‚Äôs of instability and conflict that would have happened and continued to happen regardless of who intervened militarily or not. I know many people like to operate under the notion that these countries were not war torn hell holes for most of their history and that the US is the harbinger of their instability and the root of all their problems. However this is false no matter which way you put it. Perhaps the population feels differently and longs for what they knew before which was still a third world country ridden with conflict and oppressive governments and hotbeds for terrorist organizations. I‚Äôm not arguing with any local who feels things were worse after the US invasion because they are most likely correct, however let‚Äôs not pretend these have ever been good places. If not the US it would always be someone else. The problems with these countries and their conflicts both internal and external stem from long before the US got involved and would still be a problem had the US never gotten involved. Trust me if it were up to me we would have never had anything to do with any of the places on that list and they would have been left to their own devices wether that would have been better or worse.	1644442891.0	hwa4uyg	t3_snh8i0	t1_hwa0ay5	/r/russia/comments/snh8i0/its_not_for_you_now_representing_the_anglosaxon/hwa4uyg/

6cyj1rs	I'm half-Russian, half-British and in my experience everybody lies. I've seen BBC making a special about how the last Tsar's daughters were clubbed to death by barbaric commies (absolute bollocks, they were shot) and I've seen some very questionable RT programs.   Basically, in my opinion, if any powerful organisation wanted someone dead, they would be dead. Skripal case makes no sense to me and it's well-known how the British media likes a good ol' mass hysteria. But I don't believe the Russian media either. Honestly, we should all learn to separate people and politics. Russians revere at the thought of British culture, it's seen as cool. British folks loved to learn a bit of Russian.

b87p5	America has existed for a few hundred years and has been in over 200+ international conflicts. Man of which it instigated. It has more in prison than the next 20 countries combined. Insane gun violence and worships currency. This isnt a case of both are bad. This is a case of a bully with a stick in the playground sticking his nose in every countries business and lecturing other cultures and countries about situations it cannont fully comprehend. Gossips behind their backs and throws a hissy fit when it doesnt get its way. Read a history book in america. They are the heroes. When Russians sacrificed over 10million to liberate EU from nazis with their blood. But hey america is the hero for throwing in 326 thousand and only the last year to get some spoils of war. But with the amount of movies where they are depicted as heroes just makes those who actually know history sick. America isnt a hero. ITs a bully. USA isnt a first world country. The insane debt it has, levels of homeless and poverty they try to hide, violence and underfunded education. Not to mention warmongering makes it a 3rd world country with a giant ass Gucci belt covering up its shame. So dont come at me with your "aggressor" shit when you cant even point to crimea without a map without names. Nor without ever having even visited nor lived there.

I'm a socialist, and don't support US imperialism, but this doesn't mean I'll remove 90% of my geopolitical knowledge to just abandon the countries and issues that we created. Ukraine is a bulwark to Russian aggression, and so is the rest of eastern Europe. If you allow Russia to invade Ukraine and annex the territory, then what happens when they target the Baltic states? Are you gonna sit on your isolationist ass? Sorry, but the revolution deserves to be spread in as many independent territories as possible, and allowing Russia or even China to expand without check is a massive mistake, because they'll just do the same we have done, and much worse, because they don't believe in limitations.	1644449430.0	hwaloam	t3_so9fun	t1_hwakb2i	/r/russia/comments/so9fun/azov_battalion/hwaloam/

In their vision they fight with Russia so they need examples to relate with, and who fought with russians in the past? Germans, so ukrainian SS volountiers are perfect for them.

If this is a style you tolerate or even LIKE, try Zivert, Max Barskih, Artik & Asti, Lesha Svik, NILETTO, Vanya Dimitrienko, Dima Bilan, Klava Koka‚Ä¶ (not bands really, all just singers)‚Ä¶ I could go on but they‚Äôre some of the bigger pop acts at the moment.

You cannot deny the amount of trash America has been  doing to and around the world and no amount of denying of distracting will be enough. People are not stupid. And again you Americans keep saying Russia is invading tomorrow since august. Yet here we are in the new year, in middle of February still waiting for Putin to drive the tank himself and burn the babies and hack Ukraine babushkas last 30 grivin. Look up at the Fascist Ukraine fotos. That is the situation that is literally there and spreading. But of course https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States Obviously if you look at this. You're next reaction is still going to say "nuh uh, Russia still bad". *sneezes in Guantanamo* Sorry im just allergic to bullshit, since you know America makes such a deal about Russian Gulags but having Guantanamo still disappear people is perfectly alright. Educate yourself about the insane chaos your country is doing around the world then come back with your "closeted pro-Russian fascist" comments you sad sad little man.	1644450278.0	hwanquu	t3_so9fun	t1_hwaloam	/r/russia/comments/so9fun/azov_battalion/hwanquu/

Hello. You asked an interesting question. First of all, I want to say that I feel sorry for the affected people. Answering your question, Could Russia and Putin personally order the elimination of these people, I will say Yes. It's possible. If this is the case, then the chosen method is very unsuccessful. Radioactive substance and nerve gas are too much.  But to be honest, these two stories cause bewilderment and distrust. These murders are sloppy and unnecessarily provocative. I very much doubt that the Professionals in Russian intelligence acted so dirty. All this is reminiscent of a movie where the main villain, sitting in his castle, somewhere in Mordor, sends his evil orcs, kill good elves ... This is roughly how the Western media described this story. Very implausible.   Was it Putin, Shoigu, Kadyrov, Boris Johnson, Tony Blair, the Clintons, MI5-6 or someone else... I don't think there will be evidence. Whoever did it, he added a couple more points to the already long list of claims between Russia and the UK.	1644451054.0	hwaplpb	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hwaplpb/

Look at the first Chechnyan war a huge amount of deaths from an apparently poorly organised and equipped Rebel force. The second Chechnyan war wasn't much better but lasted almost 5x longer so not as much of a shock to the system. Russian losses would be too high even if they wiped out the Ukrainian army in the first week I doubt the population will take kindly to russian tanks on the streets.	1644452436.0	hwasvsv	t3_sonxg5	t1_hwalg35	/r/russia/comments/sonxg5/the_worlds_most_powerful_militaries_jan_2022/hwasvsv/

a69hz	Well from what I saw from both sides of the media: I think its was more of a con, UK gov got one up on russia, staged a falseflag poisoning, blamed it on novichok and russia day 1, before any samples were even taken to a lab let alone processed.   How they got the russian spies on every camera, and in the area of the novichok just so perfectly framed and tracked. Almost as if they knew, and this was what, less than 3 weeks after the event? Meaning it was either a very well organised effort, or a preplanned stage.   I think its all a stage. UK got russians to send their spies because they had an upper hand and invited russians into a con. Thats why its all so convenient and plays into the narrative of the UK without actually making much sense at all from the outside looking purely oat facts. Russians bought the bait, and got skewered by the media.   Meanwhile, why would they kill a spy already living his life, and fgail to do it properly. Why did they use novichok, its like russia wants to send a message but why victim has been living in UK for so long he had a fucking a family and everything.... ANd he survives a super deadly poisoning.....Like cmon, how stupid is all this....Its like russia is so incompetent that it took decades to get to a spy that has already defected and spilled all the secrets. COunterproductive use of time isnt it.   Fact that this was such a media show, with the fact that russia acted so incompetently. Honestly from footage the russian spies looked more like tourists, probably because they were there to scout out, and conveniently everything else happened.   The reason why i think its a falseflag entrapment is because just like with syrian gas attacks, with iraq wmds, the media ran hype day one with 'sources' and accusations well before any real investigation could take place. Just seems so weird that people have not learnt to wait for proper peer reviewed work before making decisions, but this proves that its irrelevant. If russia wants someone dead, they will be dead, just as if US or UK wanted them dead. Wouldnt be much use to poison someone with a deadly novichok gas that is directly traced back to russia and fuck it up so badly that UK media can discern the entire plot day 1 of the event.  I dont know why you think russia was both the mastermind and this level of incompetent at the same time lol. Esp considering UK has everything to gain from villinasing russia, and nothing to loose.	1644453399.0	hwav455	t3_soig3i	t3_soig3i	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hwav455/

That $700 billion is probably really $200 billion after all the price gauging and overpaying is eliminated. And then of that $200 billion a lot is for stuff that doesnt win modern elite wars like Aircraft carriers, ground conventional forces. Russia invests in nukes, missiles, bio, chemical, cyber and air defense. And of course submarined and maintaing a decent ground force.   The US has too many planes and expensive things that can be made useless by moder chinese, or russian elite missiles. Like all the destroyers or aircraft carriers.

2kk082mt	In the mod, the world is far from ideal. Hitler is dying and his Reich is about to devolve into a brutal civil war from the power vacuum, some leaders can bring Germany harmony and stability once more whilst some will only drive the entire world further into madness. Asia is in a mess with Japan as their overlords which is also crumbling. Central/West Europe is rough with UK being fragmented and England in political turmoil between the Loyalists and the Collaborators. The remnants of Russia have fragmented into several warlord states, each with their own ideology, back stories, and beliefs. Most of them have their own story of potentially reuniting Russia in their own ways. Some end I'm the reunion of the USSR, some are brutal tyrants who are literally worse than the Nazis, some can turn the nation into a democratic Repubic, some theocracies, and many many more other outcomes.  In other words, TNO is just a mod that plays out as an interactive novel based on a dystopian timeline where the Nazis won, there's little to no joy, just horror and cruelty, not a story where the Nazis are hero's and are making the world a better place.	1644454861.0	hwaygqq	t3_somfrr	t1_hwasoa8	/r/russia/comments/somfrr/satire_trending_on_r2russophobic4u_my_ideal_map/hwaygqq/

Because if russia can peacefully just appropriate land, US with its 800B military just fucked up, and the civil conflict that they created in ukraine is actually in favour of russia esp on the regions closer to russian border, and other geographically strategic locations.   So russia doesnt need to invade, it can just do what US does, fund terrorists or separatists, or insurgency (whatever you want to call it), just like US/nato is funding them. Wait for conflict to get too much and offer salvation.

5xafz7uu	Russians are generally quite reserved, and flirting in a "western" way is quite new to the country.. In general, Russian women still prefer a man to be quite (respectfully), and the ways to court a Russian woman lie more with "old school" chivalry, strong&respectful character, and have a soft spot for a well hidden (Sto√Øc) sensitive side you only show to her every now and then.. but nothing too weepy.. just the right amount of passion..   Generally, Russian women (nor men) like to discuss or talk about nonsense "the birds and the bees".. so this also interferes with possible flirting/socializing, if this is your go-to move to break the ice..   And Russians only talk about their personal lives & feelings with very closely trusted people, and nearly never want to discuss it.. and when asked "how are you?" , it's considered a bit rude/inappropriate to say that you're not doing very well, and refuse to explain why.. you either say you're fine and move on, or entrust someone with feeling bad, and briefly explain why..   *(I'm Belgian, but these are my impressions of Russia(ns) from my travels & experiences there)*	1644455751.0	hwb0ifr	t3_sose5z	t3_sose5z	/r/russia/comments/sose5z/flirting_in_russia/hwb0ifr/

iy0hnr3k	There are thousands of ways they could have reliably killed Skripal using poisons that wouldn't have had a red carpet right back to Russia. And ways that would have just made it look like a natural death.   Novichok isn't something quiet and untraceable. And only Russia and Iran are known to produce it in bulk. But all the big military labs around the world have it. Including Porton Down in England which is only a few km from where the attack happened.  It could have very well been a group in Russia that did it, I don't dispute that. But it's all very amateur for Russian intelligence to carry out such a failure of an attack. The Skripals survived.   Not only did they survive but two Russians that were on a "sightseeing" tour to England to look at a church building was the cover story. Again, seriously amateur.   Feeling that one thing doesn't add up doesn't have to come with a neatly packaged alternative. I don't know who did it, and we will probably never know for sure. It just doesn't add up in my mind that it was done by one of the superpowers of this type of thing.	1644456163.0	hwb1grq	t3_soig3i	t1_hwavmsv	/r/russia/comments/soig3i/as_a_brit_i_tend_to_view_putin_and_russiaits/hwb1grq/

iluejm1f	To understand what is happening, you need to take a look away from Ukraine. Ukraine is only a haystack that is going to be set on fire. And the goal is Western Europe.    1. The United States needs a provocation in Ukraine to draw Russia into a military conflict.    2. Under this pretext, the United States will force Western Europe to break trade and economic ties with Russia. For this purpose, the United States is ready to sacrifice not only Ukraine, but also Eastern Europe.    3. In the future, Western European industry, having lost access to cheap Russian energy, will cease to compete with American industry, which will allow the United States to restore its industry and eliminate European. Briefly, Western Europe will turn into a larger Ukraine, economically.    4. Additionally, this conflict will connect Russian resources in the western (European) direction, and will untie US hands in the Pacific direction to confront China.    This is brief. Total:    USA - arsonist of war. Ukraine - haystack. Western Europe is a victim. Russia has no interest in this.     Western Europe is sorry because its political elites cannot take a tough stance with the US. And precisely, their weak position to protect their national interests makes American provocation in Ukraine inevitable.    The goal of the Western media is to narrow what is happening to the level of Ukraine so that a Western European citizen cannot understand that he will be robbed...	1644463153.0	hwbhy0a	t3_sk3b08	t1_hvjnvtw	/r/russia/comments/sk3b08/theory_i_have_ukraine_actually_will_attack_russia/hwbhy0a/
7ddt7so7	Viewing people and leadership of a country in separate context is a common western practice. It allows people feel free of all responsibility and puts blame for any misshaps solely on the government, in addition making citizens idle consumerist spectators. Sad but true.  Additionally, what's this endless obsession with a single person in power? How is that different from a multi-party system that is entirely designed to endlessly loop funds through privatisation-deprivatisation of services and increasing-decreasing taxes simply to redistribute money and uses well known manipulation tactics to shift votes in favour of planned strategy?

In the US, working for a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman is considered the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù job for engineers because deadlines are super relaxed, not much pressure, and not much work. Explains why so many projects are delayed and over budget. It‚Äôs a whole industry built upon nothing, just to keep money flowing and people employed. Similar to American healthcare. Highest government expenditure on healthcare per citizen in the world and yet Americans don‚Äôt even have universal free health insurance.

Anyway, It‚Äôd still be not out of the ordinary for an intelligence service like FSB, CIA or MI6 for that matter to assassinate people who are enemies of the state. With the case of Skripal this would actually be 100% justified.

He has had Navalny locked up and tortured even though Navalny has the support of the youth of Russia. He has made himself and his oligarchs extremely rich by stealing from the US. He has assisted countries and dictators across the globe. He works with China to undermine the US   And worst of all He pushes for war for claiming the US is  causing it cause we won't comply with his demands about who joins Nato. The US has both respect and admiration for the people of Russia. We do not however have any respect or patience for Putins games anymore.	1644465448.0	hwbn0ng	t3_so9fun	t1_hw8fvyg	/r/russia/comments/so9fun/azov_battalion/hwbn0ng/

4q2hj3e1	Okay, sorry for the glibness, I will try to actually help this time. If you want to learn more, I encourage you to look it up on a reputable and preferably scholarly source or as many as you like, really. That way you don‚Äôt have to take anyone‚Äôs word for it, but the academic consensus is overwhelmingly that they were primarily an ultra rightwing movement, and that includes accounts by people who had expertise in these matters and were persecuted by the Nazis. The only other thing I‚Äôll mention is that Nazis considered socialists to be their primary ideological enemy, socialism, a leftwing movement, and if you look at neonazi groups and other fascist groups that exist today, they support rightwing causes and politicians. You can see this in pretty much any European country and in North America, so look at the situation in many countries if you want. It‚Äôs also why antifa, or to use the full word antifascists, are often considered left. But don‚Äôt take my word for it, look into it yourself if you‚Äôre interested. Or read a book about it, but by someone with expertise in the subject rather than a pundit or anyone who makes their living talking about politics or the news.	1644465752.0	hwbno2v	t3_so9fun	t1_hw9j96z	/r/russia/comments/so9fun/azov_battalion/hwbno2v/

hwl3m59i	I know hating your own country is the coolest thing on Reddit. But what you fail to realize is that by nature humans are violent. We are tribal. We are violent and we crave confrontation. We have been waging war since the beginning of time. The US has absolutely done some evil shit. We have hurt many. But we have always tried to correct and find a moral obligation. We are also in a very unique position as we have been the only superpower in the world for the last 75 years. It forces us to act as an authority. We have both a moral and human responsibility to attempt what's best for mankind and not the individual.   Kinda like the old condrum of if a speed train is heading strait towards 5 people who will die if you do nothing or there is a fat man on the track you could push in front of the track and will save the 5 at the cost of the fat man's life.

Crimea voted to seceed from Ukraine, and its parliament declared independence and applied to join the russian federation.   Ukraine view the delaration as illegal and moved in, russia viewed the declaration as just, and moved in to protect the new state.  It is similar to a alternative  if Quebec voted for independence, and Canada decided to militarily occupy it to prevent secession, and France view it as an attack on the french population and moved in as well  It is rather messy.

hwl3m59i	Only speak for yourself, not the rest of the world. Cause I can assure you plenty of countries want American involvement.   As for the not American part, dude. Unless you have lived in the US for any considerable time you have no idea what Americans are. Let me tell you right here and now, Reddit is not a representation of America ideals.   More importantly, most Americans would much rather spend our money on ourselves, not having to intervene and police the rest of the world. However, we often have no choice but to be involved because of the lack of accountability by the rest of the world to governe themselves accordingly.  You see while we have had to deal with being the "bad guy" and the heaviness of some of our actions hurting others we often have no choice as there would be much more suffering without our involvement or presence. You can deny that all you like, but without American the European Union would not exist, the Euro would not exist. Peace in Europe would not exist. Stability or as much as we can call it that would not exist in Asia and The South China Sea. America's armaments is what keeps the world stable. Americans tax dollars are what keeps the world from falling into disaster. We lead the way and you have no idea what that means or the responsibility of it. As other nations follow our example we usher in humanity to a new dawn of civilization.   And I won't respond later so to the anti American people who are American. Yes big pharmacy is a gross example of greed. Politicians often are self serving we are very much guilty of many things including squeezing the very life of the bottom class in America. But there are many good people fighting the good fight. Humanity is an ugly species filled with violence, but by God we are trying.	1644468303.0	hwbsvtr	t3_so9fun	t1_hwbpvod	/r/russia/comments/so9fun/azov_battalion/hwbsvtr/

I don't think Putin's goals align with what's best for me (not that my politicians really do either) but this is very, "Be a shame if something were to happen to your pretty wife and she got killed you know?

The operation was attended by formations of Kiev and   Belarusian military districts, reinforced by units   Kalinin and Moscow military districts.   England and France, which concluded with Poland   allied treaties and also preparing for combat   actions, instead of providing the promised military assistance   Poland continued the search for ways of appeasement   Germany!   After the end of World War II,   Nuremberg trials former head of the Supreme   Command of the Wehrmacht Jodl argued that "the process   similar to Nuremberg, did not start in Germany in 1939   only because approximately 110 French and   English divisions that were stationed during our war with   Poland in the West against 23 German divisions,   remained completely inactive!      Contrary to the assertion of a number of authors about the preparation   partition of Poland between the USSR and Germany, nor the Soviet   special services, nor the top leadership of the USSR before the invasion   Germany was not placed in Poland on September 1   information about the preparations for such an invasion and themes   no longer coordinated with her any actions.   Relations between Poland and Nazi Germany from 1934 to   early 1939 were great!

hvp2lljs	Occupation of Poland!   Now it is fashionable to say that the Russians did not liberate Poland, but captured it. An interesting occupation is obtained if Poland received a quarter of the territories of Germany for free: moreover, hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers shed blood for this land. Even the GDR did not want to give Szczecin to the Poles - the issue with the city was finally resolved only in 1956 under pressure from the USSR.   Jozef Lipski (Polish diplomat. In 1934-1939 he served as ambassador to Germany.)   \- If Hitler solves the Jewish question "we will erect a beautiful monument to him in Warsaw."!!!!! September 20, 1938   Already during the German occupation in December 1939, the Poles staged a Jewish pogrom in Krakow. In 1940, the Jewish Easter pogrom in Warsaw was marked. In July 1941, in the village of Jedwabne in the Bialystok region of the BSSR (now Poland), where the main population was Jews, the Poles living in the same village as a result of a pogrom organized by them killed, as witnesses stated, more than one and a half thousand Jews. Most of them were burned alive in a barn.   By the way, the Germans paid the Poles money and groceries for every Jew they caught: tobacco, sugar, liquor. In Warsaw, one head of a Jew was estimated by the Germans, in addition to everything, also at 1-1.5 kg. apple jam. And not a single Polish ‚ÄúJew hunter‚Äù had anything sticky in the ass from this jam !!!   The Baltics are also greatly outraged by the occupation. It is worth remembering the current capital Vilnius also gave Lithuania to the USSR; the Lithuanian population of Vilnius was then 1%, and the Polish majority. The USSR returned to the republic the city of Klaipeda (Prussian Memel), which belonged to the Lithuanians in 1923-1939. and annexed by the Third Reich. The Lithuanian leadership condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact back in 1991, but no one returned both Vilnius to Poland and Klaipeda to the FRG.	1644471335.0	hwbysfe	t3_smc9fa	t1_hw93pr6	/r/russia/comments/smc9fa/this_is_how_history_is_rewritten_by_hollywood_and/hwbysfe/

hjtcpzel	>So then how do strangers flirt with each other in public?  You probably mean in public transport.  Let me illustrate it by male code on public toilets:  * It's unnatural and uncomfortable for a man to urinate in public. Therefore everyone attempts to shut inside and pretend as if others do not exist at the urinals.  * This result in following: men do not talk at urinals, they do not greet eachother and shake their hands, they don't even look directly into the eyes of another man.  * Public toilet for men is not a social gathering where you can make friends. Not a word is uttered there unless it's strictly necessary.  The same applies to public transport:  * It's unnatural and uncomfortable to cram 80 people into a tiny bus. Therefore everyone attempts to go into their happy place in their mind and pretend no other people exist around.  * No direct eye contact is preferable. Not because everyone dislikes you, but because it's easier to tolerate the trip that way.  * Nobody acknowledges each other. Unlike men at the urinals, you may chit-chat with a friend of course, but you don't greet strangers unless it's a more private affair (for example, a shared compartment on a train).  * Relax your face entirely, and you will find that you are not smiling. You may think that you are frowning, but it's your neutral face. Some say it's resting bitch face and it's specific for certain people, but I think everyone has it¬†‚Äî it's just that some people never fully abandon any attempt to emote.	1644475016.0	hwc4wxv	t3_sose5z	t3_sose5z	/r/russia/comments/sose5z/flirting_in_russia/hwc4wxv/

4dw6yvkp	As an economist, it's painful to see people toss around purchasing power parity figures for every economic comparison.  Purchasing Power Parity is a tool we use to compare the standard of living for people within different economies on a relative basis.  A hair-cut in China costs much less comparatively than a hair-cut in France, a burger in China also costs much less than a burger in France; in other words we use a basket of good and services approach to comparing RELATIVE LIVING STANDARDS.  PPP is used entirely too much outside of what it is meant for.  It is entirely inappropriate to use PPP as a basis for comparative economic strength in development terms, or capacity terms.    A barrel of oil costs "pretty much the same" wherever it is across the globe, titanium and steel cost the same across the globe, silicon and copper cost the same pretty much across the globe.... you see where I'm going, I hope.  For these types of comparisons it's entirely inappropriate to apply a tool used to measure relative LIVING STANDARDS with a basket of common consumer goods to something like military manufacturing that utilizes materials that are purchased and sold on much wider markets.	1644478369.0	hwc9s4y	t3_soaq89	t1_hw81bu8	/r/russia/comments/soaq89/military_expenditures_of_nato_countries_russia/hwc9s4y/
hlf7pf11	I can already tell you just think everything Russia does is for the sake of aggression, it's just how your monkey brain was trained to perceive Russian politics. Let me just give you an example, since you mentioned Poland. You're making redundant pretenses about Russia wanting to take Poland I guess, do you know if you thought the same way about the west as you do Russia, you would think that Nato's aggression into Russia's domain should have already been met with military retaliation years ago. Russia does not have weapons on America's border. NATO is fully armed to destroy Russia. NATO's only goal is to prevent Russia from growing powerful. You mock the Russian economy and standard of living and compare it to modern western hedonism as if they are in anyway comparable. The reason the entire first world is using Crimea as a pretense to sanction all of Russia and it's people is to keep the country from growing economically and becoming the strongest country on earth. That is the only way to keep Russia down. It's a tale as old as time. Look up the Crimean war if you don't believe me. The west has always maintained alliances to check Russia's growth anytime it can get too strong. It's done for the sake of "balance of power". But this time, after trying to destroy Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin is not going to let them do it.	1644478374.0	hwc9sfp	t3_soupri	t1_hwc7hif	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwc9sfp/

hy5g2klo	In short : Crimea was a Russian land since it was conquered by the Russian empire from the Ottomans. It was populated by by tatars who's entire economy was based on slavery and slave trade. They raided Russia and Poland for slaves and Russia put end to it by conquering Crimea. The population became mijoriry Russian during the Russian empire , during the Soviet times Nikita khrushchev, who was a Ukrainian , transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine. When the USSR collapsed Crimea stayed in Ukraine, in the 90s crimea tried to separate from Ukraine and join Russia but Ukraine didn't allowed them. In 2014 the maidan protests happened and there was really strong anti Russian sentiment, some Ukrainian politicians even promised to genocide Crimea, they even had such slogans "crimea will be Ukraine or depopulated". Crimea decided to separate from Ukraine and join Russia by voting on referendum. Not a single shot was made and no one died in Crimea.	1644479078.0	hwcarz6	t3_sp0ied	t3_sp0ied	/r/russia/comments/sp0ied/what_happened_with_crimea_in_2014_did_russia/hwcarz6/

The global economy is far smaller that OTL, Asia is exploited by Japan, who is a corporatist shithole. The US is kinda okay, depending on what path it goes down(there are some really blessed paths, where you land on Mars and wipe out poverty). Germany is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship, where half the population is in poverty the economy has been stagnant for a decade(the economy is reliant an mega corporations that use tens of millions of slaves) and is about to have a civil war, because Hitler is dying. Germany also has a lot of paths. In one Germany can be reformed into a democracy, slavery gets abolished and living standards massively improved all across its sphere. There are also cursed paths for Germany, in wich it ceases to exist and it turns into an anarchy. In this mod Russia is fragmented between a bunch of warlords and it can be reunified either by communists(there are good wholesome communist paths and kinda cursed communist paths) who restore the USSR, by capitalists, by military juntas, by fascists or by insane madmen who turn Russia into a wasteland.	1644481062.0	hwcdgbw	t3_somfrr	t1_hwb68ll	/r/russia/comments/somfrr/satire_trending_on_r2russophobic4u_my_ideal_map/hwcdgbw/

sk8uuwd	First: There are no "bad" or "unsafe" areas in Moscow.   Second: It really is up to your budget and taste (what kind of night live, what kind of restaurants etc.).   Without knowing your budget, it will be quite hard to really recommend you something useful. Are you a dollar millionaire/billionaire? Go for the Posh areas like: Patriarshiye Prudy, Tverskoy, Arbat, Zamoskvorechye.   If not you have a lot of options. Here some of the Metro Stations where the areas are nice: Universitet, Kutuzovskaya, Poklonnaya Gora, Park Pobedy....  Moscow is about 50% larger than Mexico City, so keep that in mind because you will be doing A LOT of commuting with the Metro. So check that a Metro station is within walking distance otherwise you will be doing a lot of walking (or use the minibus).	1644481267.0	hwcdq3k	t3_sotqb1	t3_sotqb1	/r/russia/comments/sotqb1/best_areas_in_moscow_to_live_as_a_single_34_year/hwcdq3k/

kx7i1	People state a bunch of nonsense about smiling and stuff but lemme just say that you can act as you wish until it is a genuine behavior ‚Äî if you want to smile, then smile.  I‚Äôm from Russia and I smile whenever I want lmao. People (even Russians) like to demonize Russians as people who do not smile but actually that is not true ‚Äî people do smile but when they feel like it (happy, funny, etc) not because society requires it or something like that. Russians do not smile that often because life in Russia is not that happy most of the time especially for common folks, hence non-smiling faces.  As for flirting: again, do whatever you want but just keep in mind common sense, like people in public transport might not be in the best mood to flirt or even chat, I mean the are going somewhere and quite busy. Overall, if you want to talk to a girl on the street then why not? Though, in this day and age people might see it a bit different than veggie because dating offline is rare (I guess?).  TL;DR: act genuine ‚Äî wanna smile, then smile, wanna talk to a person, then do it just not keep common sense in tact.  That being said, if you are a gay, then all these tips won‚Äôt work for you but you already know it. I would not say Russia is extremely homophobic (it is but to a certain extent) but most men can be offended if another man tries to flirt with them. At least, that is my guess. I‚Äôve stumbled upon such men two times but they were weird rather than doing flirt-stuff normally. Again, I‚Äôm heterosexual man and a tolerant one so I was not offended but rather scared by those weird dudes lmao. As for lesbians, well, I have no idea.

A deployment to the Middle East with coalition forces during the early 00s saw them heavily protected.   My understanding is this is to prevent political repercussions from any casualties. There has been a movement to toss the yoke and allow themselves to be autonomous, but this is still heavily debated.

alvxyak	I thinks it's crazy that for the last 15 years, every time Putin says "No NATO in The Ukraine.", the U.S. keeps subverting him with bad press, a smear campagn, and propoganda.   And meanwhile, the U.S. organizes a coup and over throws the Ukrainian government, installs a puppet Ukranian President, gets the World Bank and IMF to steal the Ukranian's rich agricultural land for the U.S. megacorps via debt based diplomacy, and start spreading poisonous GMO seeds across the land, all while making plans for the Ukraine to join NATO so the U.S. Megacorps can protect their newly acquired assets (thus making Ukraine a major threat to Russia's backdoor).  Yeah, Putin is a nefarious character. But the U.S. is an even worse one. And the sad thing is, much innocent blood will be spilt in the name of Democracy and Freedom, when it's really about enriching the U.S. Megacorps, thus only benefitting the few elites at the top, sitting comfortably in their mansions a million miles away from the crisis.  Once again, "No NATO in The Ukraine." Yet the USA keeps countering that statement with so much subversion and conjecture. And now we are potentially heading to war.

Then in 2014 there was a referendum to see how people felt about it. About 95% of the crimeans voted to begin a new life.

8tw2s4sc	First of all there is no way for independent choice when you live on same planet you know? If your choice move world balance closer to next world war its not your choice anymore.   And about democracy. Democracy is just a word. There is always rich and powerful people behind who control the media, control industry, control politic of the country. If they feel they can make money joining NATO they will do it for sure. Later they just buy houses in USA, send their children study to GB and so on. They dont care about thier countries anymore after all. Thats how US democracy works.   And honestly if you compare Crimea with zero shots fired, with alot of improvements done to people life after russia anexia to Iraq... well. Better to be Crimea. Because if USA had power to call any EU country terrorits, like they did on east they will do it. No one else droped nuclear bombs on civils in the end.	1644485276.0	hwciqhx	t3_soupri	t1_hwcf2zd	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwciqhx/

Usually diminutive version is being used by family members, close friends and a partner and demonstrates a strong attraction or even attachment which is barely could be ‚Äúprovided‚Äù by a stranger. Probably there are people who can accept it easily but you should be ready someone reacts as you said something rude.

NATO is a defensive alliance, if it wasn't for NATO, Russia would probably invaded more countries from the east without impunity.   People from Ukraine want to be independent, people have spoken. Ukraine wants NATO because it's the only instrument that can defend their country.	1644489569.0	hwco2b0	t3_sp2itd	t3_sp2itd	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwco2b0/
hzfuz6q9	Ok, but why exactly would the Anglo-Saxons want Russia not to play under its own flag? I haven't lived in US/UK/AU, but I don't think that the Anglo-Saxons go to sleep every night hoping that one day Russia will play a stupid sport contest for a couple of days with another name.	1644489593.0	hwco3dj	t3_soz0ly	t1_hwcglkl	/r/russia/comments/soz0ly/why_is_russias_olympic_team_named_roc/hwco3dj/
6mp3t1pz	Yes, you are right, the number of people employed in production is decreasing, but this is happening because there is (was) an old industry. That is, in order to produce a new microprocessor, a machine must be available that will produce it. In order to produce this machine, there must be blast furnaces, mining industries and a million more different enterprises in which people must work ... And after a nuclear strike, neither these enterprises nor people will exist (and there will be no way to restore them). Even if these richest people keep the technology, they will not be able to use it, much less advance.	1644489600.0	hwco3ot	t3_soq7dl	t1_hwcmwcl	/r/russia/comments/soq7dl/what_do_you_think_of_statement_yesterday_by/hwco3ot/

Basically, if you have something they need, and you don't want to give it freely - then they'll find bioweaponry in your country and boom, your country slammed into medieval age. Oh wait, they already found bioweaponry in Russia. Or "highly likely" as they claimed. We don't want this. We don't want this threat upon us, so what we are left to do?  We don't need Ukraine. Nor Poland, or Baltic States. But we also don want to be with a gun pointing at US.  Ukraine joining NATO is an existential threat to Russia. Having a few dozens of potentially hostile military bases within 500km from your capital and most populated and developed region.  This will lead to either a bloodshed, or a complete loss of sovereignty by Russia.  Our military is a significant force, but it won't be enough to defend if NATO will try to conduct joint operation against Russia. There either be a bloody and devastating stalemate, or a defeat.	1644489650.0	hwco63f	t3_sp2itd	t1_hwcmdqz	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwco63f/
lbn063	dude are you dumb? read some history books, those are free in libraries ;) the (Russia‚Äôs president) statement is such a cliche, when one side wants to occupy other‚Äôs CORE teritories and and want to catch enemy (in this scenario Ukraine) off guard and without allies. It does not matter what army is in Ukraine. the allies could be every douchbag country (I mention this to state that I do not support any country in particular) and still Russia would be creating tension, since once again they would need to take fight on larger enemy. the so called glorious president is playing mind games. he‚Äôs a charismatic person and he knows that his statements have a huge (if not the largest in the world) impact not only in politics but also on people of all countries. consider to hold your conspiracies defending the one‚Äôs who sacrifies their own people life quality for their outrageous dreams of world domination ;)	1644489799.0	hwcocz3	t3_soupri	t1_hwcgtmt	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcocz3/
apf1esb9	If Mexico and several other countries felt threatened, then sure they could start a defensive alliance. I would have no problem with that. But somehow, there has been no impetus for this, because Mexico doesn‚Äôt feel threatened by the USA (at least territorially.)  Poland literally borders Russia, so I‚Äôm not sure why Germany + Ukraine are you‚Äôre 2 options there, especially when Germany is also a NATO member.  I didn‚Äôt say that Russia was bad. I asked why Ukraine might feel threatened. Maybe Russian military action in Georgia, or in Crimea, has made countries fearful that they will be next  Russia is free to strike up alliances with whoever it wants, Mexico, China, whoever, as it‚Äôs an independent country. But the same applies to other countries	1644489846.0	hwcoezj	t3_sp2itd	t1_hwcn6pv	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcoezj/

apf1esb9	Iraq was not a NATO operation. The only time the relevant NATO article has been invoked is Afghanistan, after 9/11  I don‚Äôt think anyone in Europe wants to somehow ‚Äúinvade‚Äù Russia, everyone knows Russia has a large military.  But as a free country, Ukraine should be allowed to choose its own path. IMO NATO would reject its request to join, as it has done so far  Nobody wants war. But action against Ukraine by Russia achieves what? IMO I think this is more about Putin halting Ukraines growing ties with the EU, as he‚Äôs worried about neighbouring countries succeeding economically, and then his domestic audience asking why he isn‚Äôt delivering the same results	1644490550.0	hwcpb13	t3_sp2itd	t1_hwco63f	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcpb13/

If NATO hadn't been expanding eastwards more and more and wasn't making itself seem like a threat, then Russia may have not even taken Crimea, the major point of which was because of its strategic location in the Black Sea ("to protect the people" is just a bonus) - and now ask yourself why does Russia feel like it needs a strategic location in the Black Sea despite knowing that having it would bring major sanctions and set back important relations with EU decades away?	1644493107.0	hwcspez	t3_soupri	t1_hwcf2zd	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcspez/

16nipk	I find it amusing and terrifying how the liberals are the warmongers. The U.S. has a $30 Trillion debt but want more wars, more military/NATO expansion. Libertarians have been advocating for non-interventionist foreign policy. Like him or not, Trump didn‚Äôt escalate these tensions during his 4 yrs. That tension was primarily with the liberal allies who don‚Äôt share this point of view. Liberals also characterize NATO expansion as the freewill of those Eastern European countries who joined but overlook the economic bribes that make that alliance a lucrative proposition while also overlooking the threat Russia has continued to articulate that this presents to Russia. Seeing the other side is strongly advised but it‚Äôs unlikely liberals have any desire to do so.	1644493292.0	hwcsyot	t3_sp47u5	t1_hwcrlbb	/r/russia/comments/sp47u5/an_alternative_western_story/hwcsyot/

697hi00l	Um... Poland borders Russia...where? Only in Kaliningrad?  I don't think Kaliningrad is a good place to start an invasion for some reason.  So I don't see reasons for Poland to join NATO and placing there missile systems which can be converted into offensive weaponry in no time.   Both US and Poland claimed in 2009, that they building this system to defend against potential missile strike from Iran. I don't think Iran threated Poland in any way.   But then Russia offered to build radars station in Azerbaijan, because it is closed to Iran, and it would be easier to detect launched missile, both US and Poland rejected this offer. Leaving missile systems in Poland, and covering quite big portion of Western Russia.  Soon after, Georgia had a revolution, and a russophobic Saakashvili comes in charge. Then suddenly Georgians felt threat from Russia (who else?) 20 years of peace doesn't mean a shit)  and decided to join NATO. Abhazia and Osetia was independent from Georgia, but Georgia had claims on them, and this interfered with plans to join NATO. So what did Saakashvili? He razed capital of Osetia with rockets.  And a few years later, in 2014, Ukraine banished thier Yanukovich, and installed russophobic government, who also decided to join NATO. And not every Ukrainian agreed with that. So some - joined Russia (In Crimea, they was a autonomous Republic within Ukraine), and Donbass stood against new government. And this all also prevents Ukraine to join NATO right now.  And if you research all that cases carefully, and compare this with NATO expansion in 90-00s, when Russia was literally ruined, and would still think NATO - is just a defence... Well, I don't believe we can understand each other in that case.	1644493354.0	hwct1r9	t3_sp2itd	t1_hwcoezj	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwct1r9/

I believe you've heard about the Moldavian Republic elections where Igor Dodon was against Maia Sandu and the battle was who's pro Russia and pro West. It was never about their leadership capabilities, only about their political view. Put yourself in the shoes of Putin. You know NATO Is an against Russia organisation where Russia has been denied entry in the past for this specific reason, you see NATO expanding right at your doorstep, basically surround you with enemy military bases. What would you do? I guess the same thing as Putin or a variation of it. Ukraine is also a prime ground for Russian invasions were those to become a thing. The US especially taunts Russia into stepping wrong just to have an excuse to attack them. The correct thing here is for Ukraine to mind it's own business and not join NATO, join EU for example if it so wants as EU is about economics more then military while NATO is only about military and being against Russia.  If Ukraine were to get pounded by Russia it's their problem and choice. They caused it by wanting to join NATO.	1644495579.0	hwcwful	t3_sp2itd	t1_hwct6lf	/r/russia/comments/sp2itd/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwcwful/

The military industrial complex owns both parties; there are however a few exceptions on each side but they usually don‚Äôt get too far up the ladder. The powers that be don‚Äôt care what policies get made as long as they get another war.  What‚Äôs hilarious though is how anti-war the left pretends to be when a republican is in office. You saw anti-war protests non stop when Bush was in office. They disappeared overnight as soon as Obama got into office (while the same wars raged on). At least the neocons aren‚Äôt hypocrites about it, the left however certainly are.

Most of Europe, under German occupation, dutifully worked for the German armaments industry against us and supplied a variety of Nazi volunteers from France, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Spain, not counting Hitler's open allies. As for our so-called "Anglo-Saxon" allies, they were in no hurry to openly entangle in the war in Europe and hated us as well as the Germans, watching from afar how the Russian bear fights the German eagle in order to finish off the first one to fall.

me8sk	Copy/pasting other redditor's comment that I've saved regarding the issue, in full:   Oh, yes, fun "fact". I remember how Reddit was flooded with similar posts yelling "Beatings of women has been decriminalized in Russia".  Welcome to the post-clickbait world of paraphrasing. Circle jerk already started, points already earned and misinformation worked  The Russian judicial system has two branches of codes: the Administrative code and the Criminal code.  The Administrative code deals with low-level crimes: theft, fraud, violation of fire safety rules. Serious crimes: theft with a particularly large size, crimes harmful to human health, etc. - the Criminal code.  "Poboi" - a single act of assault against a person without causing harm (Slap, push, etc.) is an administrative violation included in the administrative code. This is followed by a penalty of 2 weeks detention, a large fine, etc.  If a person commits "Poboi" in second time, or his actions are systematic (not just a slap, but a purposeful beating or inflicting pain), or they have caused harm to health - this falls under the jurisdiction of the Criminal code. The punishment for this crime starts from 2 years in prison.  "Decriminalization of beatings" is the transfer of the "Beatings against relatives" from the category of Criminal code to the category of Administrative code (where the punishment for beatings for "not relatives" is located").  If the person repeatedly commits this offense; If it causes harm to health; If it's a systematic manifestation of aggression and offenses - it again becomes a matter of the Criminal code.   Why? Because very few victims in the families wanted to go to the police, when the punishment begins immediately with a criminal conviction and prison.   Only the most desperate people went to the police. And even they would come back a couple of weeks later and pick up their charges, because their husband/wife "apologized and promised not to do it again." Administrative cases are handled much faster and executed much more efficiently than criminal cases - Which require appropriate documents and hearings.  Now, when the first punishment for beating is punishable by detention, a fine and other things - people are much more willing to go to the police and report the attackers from their families.   It's much easier for victims to talk themselves go to police (I don't send my husband/wife to jail for three years). The attackers are given a chance to correct their behavior without breaking their life in a Russian prison. And if the beating is repeated or it was tough - person immediately went to prison.	1644498599.0	hwd1q8a	t3_sp5b89	t3_sp5b89	/r/russia/comments/sp5b89/did_putin_really_decriminalize_some_forms_of/hwd1q8a/

He doesn‚Äôt know what Anglo-Saxons are XD that‚Äôs hilarious, I guess Britons should check their ancestry because 1/3 of them may not be allowed according to Lavrov. Even less so for Americans.

The United States could not defeat Korea, or Vietnam, or Afghanistan. The United States has overthrown at least a dozen legitimate leaders of countries. The US claims world hegemony, and its lobbying system is institutionalized corruption.

uj3m2	I think you are right, though I think it‚Äôs less about agriculture and more about energy delivery. A lot of European gas flows through Ukraine and Belarus. Another source is LNG cargo from the US. Nord stream 2 is set to bypass transit across the Eastern Europe and bring gas directly to Germany. Decreasing its and Western Europe reliance on LNG deliveries. Ukraine is more of weapon to force sanctions and rally other countries to support them, in order to block additional gas sources for EU.  EU has long been on the march to phase out coal which currently US supplies 18% of. I‚Äôm guessing loosing that over the next decade is not great for the US. Similarly natural gas production has gone up in the states and surpasses consumption. Half of US natural gas exports are now headed to Europe. If Europe relies less on that import, US is going to lose a lot of money.	1644501536.0	hwd7s0q	t3_soupri	t1_hwcgtmt	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwd7s0q/

ipxp70pl	The western media is just... Astonishingly bad when it comes to foreign policy. Some of this is malice, but a lot of it is just an quasi religious attachment to liberal ideology. When Eric Li said "westerners like to convert people", it kind of clicked for me.  Running alongside this is just an astonishing lack of knowledge about foreign countries in foreign policy and foreign journalism circles. I'm talking people who have lived in Russia for years, call themselves "kremlinologists" and yet can't speak a word of Russian.   It's mind boggling. Trump was right about journalists.

uj3m2	It‚Äôs not. But Ukraine is in the strategic geopolitical zone of Russia‚Äôs interests. Other countries go to great lengths to protect their strategic interests. Russia is simply doing the same. I imagine US would have had similar reaction if Mexico or Canada wanted to join a military alliance with China.

Domestically we determine rank by # of medals, then break ties by colour of medals. I actually think it's the better way to rank Olympic achievement.

7s28j8e5	The British Foreign Secretary told the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry about the need to withdraw Russian armed forces from the Ukrainian border. Sergei Lavrov replied that the military is on the territory of his country. Liz Truss repeated that they should be withdrawn. To this, the Russian minister again objected that the military did not violate anything, since they had the right to conduct any maneuvers on the territory of the Russian Federation.   After that, he himself addressed a question to his British colleague: **‚ÄúDo you recognize the sovereignty of Russia over the Rostov and Voronezh regions?‚Äù**   **‚ÄúGreat Britain will never recognize Russian sovereignty over these regions,‚Äù** the Foreign Minister replied after a short pause.   British Ambassador to the Russian Federation Deborah Bonnert had to intervene in the situation, who delicately explained to Mrs. Truss that **we were really talking about Russian regions.**   The British Embassy in Moscow **did not comment on the situation.**	1644503639.0	hwdclyt	t3_sp7i1r	t3_sp7i1r	/r/russia/comments/sp7i1r/british_foreign_minister_the_uk_will_never/hwdclyt/

uj3m2	Historically Ukraine didn‚Äôt want to be part of USSR or Russia. And two countries have conflicts to prove that. However culturally Ukraine consists of both Russians and Ukrainians, and a part of the population is more aligned with Russia. Additionally there are a lot of economic ties that go back to USSR period that Ukraine has benefited from - cheaper gas, is one of them. So I think viewing this situation as Russia being a bully is overly simplistic. Russia‚Äôs interests in Ukraine are more tied to strategic energy transit zone, bordering country (you wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to put a few missiles outside your door), access to Black Sea and its old naval base, and ethnic population. Most of that hasn‚Äôt been an issue for a long time, why has it become a hot topic in the recent decade???	1644504783.0	hwdfdi8	t3_soupri	t1_hwddvck	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwdfdi8/

eqs0s	That's a big if. Technology will most likely be lost and survivors will have to fend for themselves in pre-industrial like conditions. The high quality of life and abundance of choices people have depend on globalised trade and knowledge share.      It's not 1st time for a civilization collapse. When it does people survive by subsistence agriculture and all other fancy stuff such as high culture, learning and even literacy decline or cease to exist.	1644504837.0	hwdfi8y	t3_soq7dl	t1_hwcjcxv	/r/russia/comments/soq7dl/what_do_you_think_of_statement_yesterday_by/hwdfi8y/

3g0fw	Anyone who is familiar with history is aware of the many times Russia has been invaded and has had to defend itself at great cost: the Mongol invasions, Napoleon's Grand Armee, the Ottoman/British/French Crimean War, the Russo/Japanese War, Hitler's Operations Barbarossa and Typhoon, and more.    When Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Italy were not fighting each other, which was often the case, they were allied with each other in fighting Russia.    Putin will simply not allow yet another Allied war upon Russia.  He has no choice, Russia has no choice, but to defend itself against the threats and military machinations of the Allied nations of  'The West'.  Putin and the Russians know full well that the intent of the Allied nations is to destroy Russia, as Russia's neighbors and the Allies have tried to do many times in the past.  The Western media have painted Russia as the West's enemy and have gone so far as to declare even that Russian military forces on Russian land are an act of war upon the West.	1644505150.0	hwdga4r	t3_soupri	t3_soupri	/r/russia/comments/soupri/president_of_russia_vladimir_putin_warning/hwdga4r/
