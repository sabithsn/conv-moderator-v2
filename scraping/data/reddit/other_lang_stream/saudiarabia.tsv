e3kd9b7b	I have read a lot of the comments and I will just give my opinion. This request of her sounds like "how much you love me?" but why not to put it as "how much are you willing to let me go (husband)?" This is clearly a negotiation and as such think of your BATNA (middle ground), the top you are willing to go and start the negotiation <<on the lowest reasonable offer>> start haggling from there. Besides you have traditions on one side but the country's law on the other so a prenup agreement is a must here. Don't let anything to chances or verbal, everything in writing. Remember that nobody remembers ten years from now and less if is the losing party.  Also know that you "have the pan by the handle". What is she bringing to the negotiation? Social relationships beneficial to you, access to more capital, other nationality otherwise you cannot access? Sit down, think, strategize and haggle smoothly and being willing to leave makes your position strongger than showing you are not willing to let her go.	1641550091.0	hrmat2i	t3_rxbkmi	t3_rxbkmi	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rxbkmi/dowry/hrmat2i/

Usually the amount the girl asks for would tell us a lot about her personality and how she views marriage. I personally would run away if i was in your situation to be honest. But you know best!

4ehoj	American born and raised here who lived in Saudi in the past.   As a former medical student we had a lot of GCC students come through one of our programs and they were split in the categories you described plus the cafe type. They are r he ones who hang out exclusively at malls and cafes usually with other GCC guys. Also I’ve almost never heard or seen Saudi women in clubs, partying, getting drunk, etc.  There would be American guys that would try their luck sometimes but a few minutes there and they’d usually leave due to going absolutely nowhere. Now I’m not saying it doesn’t happen, I’m sure the presence of other GCC men was enough to have them stay away from those places or activities but it also seemed like they were genuinely not interested at all.  Many of them continued to wear the hijab (though not all). Also they were probably some of the most fabulously dressed. The Saudi brothers were a mix bag of really nicely dressed to I wanna go back to bed.

At first it was confusing due to the notion that Arabs are Muslims (most Arab immigrants in the UK tend to at least not drink alcohol openly). A friend even had an Emirati girlfriend and when her mother visited they went to a restaurant buying a bottle of champagne for 8000 pounds.

a0nnn40h	I'll be completely honest with you, but from what you are saying it sounds like they are trying to turn you down by asking for difficult demands, or it could actually be what they want. First, the 20K($) dowry is not so surprising it's really about the circumstances and such, like:  \-She might be from a rich and prominent family so its what they expect (She could be related to the royal family)  \- She probably set this price according to what her father expects (he might be trying to scare you away)  \- She might think this is what you can afford  Also , the dowry price is changeable you can negotiate with them (but TBH it sounds like they are looking down on you and don't expect you to actually marry her). The dowry price could be set by the father to scare you away or see if you truly are committed. Jewelery usually means a necklace, bracelet, and ring, but considering the expensive dowry you can just get a simpler set (gold is preferred, since its considered an investment). About the 5 acres of land and five bedrooms, keep in mind whatever they demand has to be in the contract so I doubt they would put something that ridiculous in the contract (it is considered shameful). She probably means she wants to have a house and not live-in with your parents or something but again that depends. The wedding cost is traditionally covered by the groom's family with help from bride's family. If you are serious about her you can try to make some tweaks to make things more agreeable. I advise her to ask her what's going because this is not the norm (especially the 5 bedroom stuff).	1641561697.0	hrmsej2	t3_rxbkmi	t3_rxbkmi	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rxbkmi/dowry/hrmsej2/

9cxwmqhz	>Show me the clear cut evidence as to how you determined music and free mixing are forbidden by Allah (the two issues that the OP in this thread rather deterministically claimed are Haram).  I have done so in another comment but I guess you're the lazy one now eh?  >Both issues are open to interpretation and not explicitly forbidden in the Quran.  The Sunnah is also a primary source in Islam from which rulings are derived.  >Regarding music, there are contradictory Hadith on the matter from Sahih Bukhari  There is no contradiction except the one in your head. The first hadith forbids music generally, and the second one is the hadith from which we can derive an exception to the general rule (the scholars have said the daff is permissible in certain cases).  There are many ahadith in which a general rule is established, whereupon exceptions are made and expanded upon in other hadith. This principle is well known but I wouldn't expect you to know that of course.   Sahih al-Bukhari 5590  Narrated Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari:  that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, "From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection."    Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came to my house when two girls were beside me singing songs of Bu’ath. The Prophet laid down and turned his face to the other side. Then, Abu Bakr came in and spoke to me harshly, saying, “Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet?” The Prophet turned his face toward him and he said, “Leave them alone.” When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signaled to the girls and they left. It was the day of Eid and the Abyssinians were playing with shields and spears. Either I asked the Prophet or he asked me whether I would like to watch and I said yes. Then the Prophet made me stand behind him while my cheek was touching his cheek and the Prophet was saying, “Carry on, O tribe of Arfidah.” I became tired and the Prophet asked me, “Are you satisfied?” I said yes, so I left.  Source: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 949, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 892 Grade: Muttafaqun Alayhi (authenticity agreed upon) according to Al-Bukhari and Muslim     >and I am not of the opinion that we should claim as forbidden something that Allah has not explicitly forbidden.  You and I don't get opinions. We are layman not scholars, and so we only stick to what they say when the Qur'an or Sunnah does not contain a ruling on the matter.	1641563768.0	hrmwr1o	t3_rtj4g8	t1_hrmo15t	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rtj4g8/the_constant_back_an_forward_between_religious/hrmwr1o/

Check out some of the DayZ videos on YouTube from streamers like ‘TheRunningManz’ , ‘Soursweet’ , ‘JLK’ etc and you’ll have a good insight to the game before you pay 😊  Good luck and happy gaming! 🤲🏼	1641564307.0	hrmxy0e	t3_ry7hyh	t3_ry7hyh	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ry7hyh/online_gaming/hrmxy0e/

n68wy	Volume 2, Book 15, Number 72: Narrated Aisha:  Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, "Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah's Apostle !" It happened on the 'Id day and Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu Bakr! There is an 'Id for every nation and this is our 'Id."  Narrated Abu Musa: That the Prophet said to him' "O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David .'

You should avoid aspirin and ibuprofen due to side effects.  Runny nose and congestion: Antihistamines like loratadine taken once daily before sleep can help Nasal drops from sodium chloride to xylometazoline also helps   If by any means you start having chest tightness, persistent constant cough, shortness of breath. You should head to the closest tataman clinic and ask them for pulmicort.

I did observe in the states many of those from the GCC tend to really overdo it, with other drugs other than alcohol too. That said, the biggest shock I have had here is how many people use cocaine, especially the wealthier families. That said I tend to work with Westernised Saudis but still, even women discuss drug use which in a workplace in the West even is not common.	1641578907.0	hro0wjy	t3_ry2rph	t1_hrm4upd	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ry2rph/australian_traffic_police_says_that_among_the/hro0wjy/

There are also somewhat obscure ones like fighting game communities, those are filled with high level players that will always want to play and will teach you. There are also obscure games like D&D that have a very small group of players.

81tml6gd	If your schools followed a Saudi curriculum then yes.  If your school followed an international curriculum then you'll be compared to that curriculum.  Your country of origin will be Saudi but your school's curriculum is what matters. Incase they run into a curriculum that's new for them, they ask for their respective ministry of education and/or foreign affairs to equate it to some other curriculum so that they can make sense of it.  But I think enough Saudi students have gone to the u.s. so have an equivalency.  So its just better if you try sending respective universities an email and they will be able to give you clearer answer.  Also most of the universities have a self-evaluation on their websites for you to figure your own standing as a potential applicant.	1641583245.0	hrocwkt	t3_ryajcd	t1_hroc67p	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ryajcd/studying_abroad_us_as_an_expatriate/hrocwkt/

It shows that on 'Id certain instruments are allowed.  >Narrated Abu Musa: That the Prophet said to him' "O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David .' (Book #61, Hadith #568)  These references aren't complete, whose book is this in, and what is the full hadith? From what you've given me all that is mentioned is that abu Musa (R.A) has been given a flute, and doesn't mention it's permissibility. If you are using Dawud's (A.S) family as proof, then that isn't valid as the sharee'ah at the time was different, just like in previous sharee'ahs drinking alcohol was permitted.   This answer is complete bogus. The ahadith of Sahih al Bukhari have been vigorously researched upon and authenticated and the scholars have universally agreed upon the book's trustworthiness. To even imply otherwise is shameful and would have you laughed out of any reputable scholarly circle.  >Meanwhile the scholarly dispute on the matter is well captured here. https://www.virtualmosque.com/islam-studies/sciences-of-quran-and-hadith/regarding-the-permissibility-of-music/   https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5000/is-music-haram  Here is an actual scholarly answer on the matter.	1641584478.0	hrog920	t3_rtj4g8	t1_hrn2m8f	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rtj4g8/the_constant_back_an_forward_between_religious/hrog920/

Do you that if you die, they'll replace you within a week. Making others compete to satisfy pure capitalism is really sad.

3yemok5	Since you didnt specify your gender, I'm going to assume you are asking males.   Personally, cold approaches would stress and I will immediately think "why is this lady interested in me, is she gonna scam me, am i gonna wake up in a bathtub missing a kidney" so I don't recommend it. I'm also not gonna be on a good mood all the time, so sometimes it's instant rejection regardless of how you approach.   What I prefer is smooth transition over a shared interest. For example, if I'm attending a pottery class, we can start there and talk about pottery, art and go along the subjects until we decide to exchange contact infos.   Also, dont be "I like you" within a week, that's too early. Be prepared to find actual reason for liking me and also specify them. The "I dont know, i just do" would get a doubtful look from my side. It works between teenagers, but we are much older than that now.   Online is alright too, but again, no long distance relationships, they are -mostly- doomed to fail, and it wont work with me.   With online, again, start with common interests and let things go smoothly without pusbing them.   What I prefer personally is through workshops and social events where the common interest is established, we have something to talk about already.	1641594235.0	hrp6869	t3_ryjkgn	t3_ryjkgn	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ryjkgn/in_terms_of_dating_and_get_to_know_the_opposite/hrp6869/

3yemok5	In my opinion, it wasn't logical.  It was put to halt the operations of picking up and dropping off passengers from and to other cities which was illegal and unregulated. It is legal for saudis but they didnt want non-saudis to do the same. Also it wasn't just pick up, any vehicle that has more than 5 seats, so they could also halt unregistered businesses.   I assure you, everyone with a brain went like "lol whoever made that decision is lazy". Our country is known for laziest of decisions. Instead of educating generations about driving, let's just install saher everywhere to punish the poor.	1641606077.0	hrpz037	t3_rydam5	t1_hrpx28k	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rydam5/i_want_a_raptor/hrpz037/

3yemok5	You mean "than" the US. I do agree here is way worse, but suddenly placing saher in hidden areas to just punish those who speed with money is the laziest idea to control the accidents. They just wanted to make the likelihood of statical accidents less in certain areas. Reckless driving is still going wild along with every driving and road safety violations out there.  Road safety should be included in first grade curriculum up until they graduate from high school. A points system should be implemented rather than a "pay to speed" type of punishment. Those who reach a certain number of points get their licence automatically suspended and must attend classes on road safety and complete few tests.   I can think of lots of smart ways to help minimize reckless driviny and actually implement road safety awareness in the society.   Saher is the laziest idea, only punish the poor, and it's idea aiming to profit.	1641608885.0	hrq5f2p	t3_rydam5	t1_hrq474x	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rydam5/i_want_a_raptor/hrq5f2p/

4b1ikdjj	Allow me to share my experience.  I’m what people call a “pretty” boy. Also I’m a foreigner who was born and raised here in ksa. And I’ve experienced and seen HORRIBLE things. Stuff that has traumatized me, stuff that made me wanna leave this country forever but I couldn’t, stuff that made me despise saudis.   Boy on boy sexual harassment is super common here. It’s worse if you are a non Saudi. It’s truly disgusting and fucked up. I pray that it doesn’t happen to anyone. I got used to groping and all cuz it was the lowest form of harassment.   Throughout my life I’ve had shit experiences with saudis and it was mostly in the form of harassment. I’d frequently ask, why did I have to look like this ?. So, to all those who read this and have experienced similar stuff. Please know you are not alone and it’s NOT your fault. I never had anyone to talk to but please talk to someone. Just cuz you are a man doesn’t mean you can’t express emotions.  Lastly, I don’t hate saudis just cuz I’ve had shit experiences with some. In fact I have more good memories with Saudis than bad. But the bad experiences is what affects you the most. Most of my friends are saudis and I really like ksa and look forward to staying here specially cuz of the direction the country is moving.  Everything I said above was about male saudis. With female saudis I’ve only had pleasant experiences, they are kind and fun to talk to, and what surprised me the most is how almost all of em know some level of English. I’ve always been treated with respect with no form of racism (I guess the “pretty” boy factor also plays a role here). I’m so happy with how the kingdom is supporting women and they truly deserve it.

3n88dg9n	Maybe off topic but, what about relationships from work? These days it seems much easier for Saudi men and women to get to really know (and possibly become interested in) one another. That is probably the easy part. But I have a feeling that taking this relationship to the next level -while having both man and woman stay in the same job (specifically in the same department or the same team)- could lead to some serious awkwardness at work (and perhaps outside of work too).  I feel it would be interesting to at least talk about this or similar experience.	1641618843.0	hrqq4m7	t3_ryjkgn	t3_ryjkgn	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ryjkgn/in_terms_of_dating_and_get_to_know_the_opposite/hrqq4m7/

me29pux	It was and still is illegal to transport passengers without a license, either taxi license (for individual freelancers) or a company-related licenses (working under uber, careem, or intracity services). This applies to both Saudis and non-Saudi. There’s no discrimination there. But this law has not always been enforced and in some areas like Jeddah and Makkah still isn’t.   I have never heard of the expats’ suv restrictions until now.	1641633026.0	hrrb45l	t3_rydam5	t1_hrpz037	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rydam5/i_want_a_raptor/hrrb45l/

frq9glcm	As a non-Saudi, and someone who has lived in this glorious Kingdom for a little over 6yrs, I am fascinated with the continued developments, leadership vision, the involvement of Saudi nationals to not remain somewhat dependent on expat workers to drive the workforce requirements.   This country, and particularly the Saudi, made me feel instantly more welcome and at hone even more than my own country (UK) makes me feel. On top, the country and special people afforded me the opportunity to get involved with some of the largest projects ever commissioned.   To all my Saudi male and female friends who may read this - your country is watching you, the world is watching you, you are part of a global game-changing future vision and one that has already started to become a reality.  Saudi Arabia will remain forever in my heart 💚 🇸🇦 💚	1641636288.0	hrrf7m0	t3_ryvo7v	t3_ryvo7v	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ryvo7v/i_love_my_country/hrrf7m0/

You could talk to IGEC, they are a consultation agency, to see if there is any good university still accepting applications now, or you could wait to apply next year.  US schools are quite expensive, you will be needing a scholarship, good for you, your SAT score can get any scholarship you want, but again, to apply for scholarships you waited too long, my best advice right now is for you to wait a year, and apply next year, sorry, but time wasn't on your side.	1641641933.0	hrrme5z	t3_ryajcd	t3_ryajcd	/r/saudiarabia/comments/ryajcd/studying_abroad_us_as_an_expatriate/hrrme5z/

She was the one mandated by the Catholic Church/Vatican to find a leading figure to convert the sons of Ismael who didn’t accept the Trinity as the Nicea Council defined it. I’m sorry if I strike a nerve but Islam is just a creation of the equally/more evil Catholic Church and is a way for these elites to have a tighter control of Jerusalem. If you can/want, we can discuss it more. I’m a former muslim and my whole family is muslim, I’m not just some USA neckbeard shitting on something he has no clue about.

The council was planned to function as an ombudsman of Islamic activity concerning educational, economic, and foreign policy matters.  He took steps to support the conservative Saudi religious establishment, including spending millions of dollars on religious education   He is credited for having introduced the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia in 1992.  he reformed the educational structure of the country, investing more on education.  his reign saw the saddam invasion of Kuwait, seeing how his army was worthless, he reformed the army.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  he did a lot of good things, except for the religious police	1641988415.0	hsc67vk	t3_s0oj07	t1_hsbf6d7	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s0oj07/does_anyone_actually_miss_the_religious_police/hsc67vk/

at6ias1f	It's a great decision. Jeddah or Riyadh is where you'd wanna go for more money and opportunity. You'd need to get sponsored before being able to work, so if that's set up, then you actually have the opportunity. You'll also see more of a progressive outlook on things in the cities as you would anywhere else in the more developed areas.  More savings and spending options, people are nice to foreigners and don't apply the same cultural expectations to you, which would be less of a deal since you're a guy. As prices are going up, salaries aren't following very well. Who you know makes all the difference.

6k62z4	This is a highly intricate topic and the survey does nothing but to stigmatise individuals with ADHD-OCD-Depression etc which are extremely common forms of mental health issues, then they are lumped with schizophrenia and bipolar which are serious mental challenges individuals would face.   I am extremely surprised that the professor has allowed the wording of this survey to go through, it serves nothing but to isolate these individuals and painting them with a wide brush of اضطرابات عقلية. Which honestly is as insensitive as using the word معاق جسديا to describe those with physical disabilities.  Every single one of us will face a form of depression, or have a quirk about how they do their way, the test as presented will not cause us to talk more about them, but to hide them and try to shame them as “psychologically lesser”.   This survey speaks to the general state of psychology in Saudi and why it is extremely hard to find a good psychologist.	1642008827.0	hsdfyi6	t3_s2973s	t3_s2973s	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2973s/mental_health_premarital_screening_in_ksa/hsdfyi6/

Note, I am from the east coast (Alkhobar) so to me Albaik is exotic as it was not even available a couple of years ago so i have no bias. But Happyland  broasted in my town is lightyears ahead.

1smiwaks	Fair enough, it’s not going to be for everyone. I’ve not tasted the other place you mentioned and maybe they are better, but I’ve not had better than al baik personally.  I’m not saying it’s the best in the world, just the best I’ve had from the few countries I’ve had similar food at the places I’ve tried. Another thing is al baik weren’t even doing broast when I was there, it was only their burgers, sandwiches and shrimp available. So for all I know the broast isn’t great but it’s not something I typically order from anywhere to be honest, so I wouldn’t have got it either way. With how busy they are aswell, it wouldn’t surprise me if the quality of items aren’t quite up to scratch sometimes.	1642015380.0	hsdxkv4	t3_s1zqb8	t1_hsdw211	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s1zqb8/i_ordered_from_albaik_and_i_got_this/hsdxkv4/

bci24ojc	**[Mirage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage)**     >A mirage is a naturally-occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays bend via refraction to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the French (se) mirer, from the Latin mirari, meaning "to look at, to wonder at". Mirages can be categorized as "inferior" (meaning lower), "superior" (meaning higher) and "Fata Morgana", one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly-changing mirage.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642022891.0	hsehq9u	t3_s2fois	t1_hsehodd	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2fois/people_who_live_in_riyadh_explain_whats_in_this/hsehq9u/

Reduce the amount of laborer visas and pay the Saudis a living wage.   Maybe a minimum wage law is required. Push back will always come from companies who don’t want to pay a living wage and who know that they cannot treat Saudis in the same way they treat Southeast Asian laborers.

hm2ocse7	> I am extremely surprised that the department has allowed the wording of this survey to go through, it serves nothing but to isolate these individuals and painting them with a wide brush of اضطرابات عقلية.  They're literally called "Mental Disorders." That's the clinical term for it. Perhaps if they used the term "Mental illnesses," I might understand your frustrations; but they didn't.   > This is a highly intricate topic and the survey does nothing but to stigmatise individuals with ADHD-OCD-Depression etc which are extremely common forms of mental health issues, then they are lumped with schizophrenia and bipolar which are serious mental challenges individuals would face.   Does the prevalence rates matter though in the context of marriage? The idea is having a mental disorder might lead to a dysfunctional marriage, so it's better to avoid the issue from the start.

Not all live like that,all the workers I personally know from this countries take 2000,paid internet,food.have their own personal room and bathroom, occasionally get gifted with clothes or phones. In whatever conditions you think they are living they knew exactly how it was going to be and they willingly and happily accept it because here the conditions and the salary are better than their home countries and that’s exactly why they come here, to save money and send it back to their families back there.

I was alone for about 30 minutes, and I saw what I thought was a soccer game. I recognized it from school, because we played soccer with all the international kids.  I ran towards the crowd but then I quickly realized that it wasn't soccer. A man came out with his face covered and a giant sword, and quickly sliced off a man's head. When the head rolled on the floor everyone cheered, and they even picked it up and kicked it around like a soccer ball. I will never forget it.	1642049629.0	hsg6i8h	t3_1vaqer	t1_ceqkpps	/r/saudiarabia/comments/1vaqer/chop_chop_square/hsg6i8h/

Recently a neighbour of mine died in Saudi and the company he was working hasn't paid him salary in 8 months. The company suddenly had the money to release after his death so they don't get fucked by the police and government. I have heard numerous cases where saudi companies don't pay wages for months.

3ru2aks3	I guess it depends on what exactly your intentions for moving are. Both are nice places, but the obvious comparison is that Medina is much smaller than Jeddah. Jeddah is a large coastal city, with great fish markets and huge shopping and Medina is in historical and in the middle of the desert. The job market in Jeddah will definitely be much better. One thing to consider is that Jeddah is near Mecca, so it is very strict and religious influenced, compared to cities like Riyadh, which in my experience was more tolerant of other religions.      I went to international school in Jeddah in 1991, and it was a very good school with kids from all over the world. I am unsure what education you seek, but I am sure there is something suitable. I know most rich Arab families send their kids to American schools.     I am unsure about healthcare but I remember getting vaccinated in Jeddah for meningitis. It was a very nice hospital, but again, I was like 11.  I think Jeddah would be a great place over Medina. I think Medina would get boring after a while, but Jeddah is a lively city. I would also suggest visiting Taif and exploring the mountains there.

Al Waleed bin talal was the primary source of funding and he got arrested and only got released after 3 months after he signed some agreement. To this day seems like the construction to the tower is on hold.	1642052370.0	hsgbjrj	t3_s2h7ob	t1_hsg8jnk	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2h7ob/found_these_recent_photos_of_what_the_new_jeddah/hsgbjrj/

6kiqt	Well, you are obviously within your right to decide how you live your life. Dating before marriage is a fairly new concept in Saudi, and does not agree with the Saudi traditions. whether we like that or not, It still remains a fact in this day and age.     Both ways have their pros and cons, and I personally don't believe one will give you a better chance at a successful marriage than other.     I should note that an arranged marriage does not mean that you are going to marry a complete stranger, that is simply not true, as you and your match will have a lot of time to get to know each other, and you both can agree on how long this will take before deciding to actually get married. On average I'd say that takes around 6 months to a year.       About the marriage from different culture, it shouldn't be a problem to marry from a different culture. However, some families and tribes either do not allow intercultural marriages, or demand a higher mahar and overall cost.      Lastly, what you see in the public places and social media does not tell the entire story. The people I meet through work for example are very different in their beliefs and conduct from what I read on social media.	1642052737.0	hsgc6pi	t3_s2rden	t3_s2rden	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2rden/marriage_for_life/hsgc6pi/

81tml6gd	I'd approach this with an understanding that whoever i meet and decide on settling down with is going to change after marriage. Everything changes after marriage. You ease into things and are more relaxed. So try not being too analytical of things and keep a margin for error.  I completely agree with your points. It's always better to get to know someone and see if there is a possibility of an emotional connection because looks eventually fade away.  Try to find someone whose demons play well with yours.  Best of luck!  P.S. one of the best things about getting married is; you get to make dark jokes about marriage and married life.	1642055290.0	hsgg9qj	t3_s2rden	t3_s2rden	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2rden/marriage_for_life/hsgg9qj/

580vk743	Thank you for opening up such a discussion, And I think it’s great that you think of marriage that way, an important project bc most ppl don’t prioritize it and leave it to chance. Second from your expression ( feminine but not a feminist) I can gaze that the relationship dynamic which your comfortable with is the one where you are the main bread winner and you take the lead in the relationship which is ok, but I don’t think you have a good perception about what Saudi girls are like. I know girls how would love to be in such a relationship where the male will take the lead. You problem is accessibility, saudi girls are not approachable as other cultures. Not bc they are not friendly but in social context, you can’t just walk to a girl in the street for example. I would suggest going to social event a lot and be open to get to know new ppl.  Good luck in your pursuit!	1642058336.0	hsgkolr	t3_s2rden	t3_s2rden	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2rden/marriage_for_life/hsgkolr/

They'd yell at him to make my mother cover up.  My father always told them, that he's been married to her over 25 years and cant tell her what to do, that it was impossible. He would tell the muttajeen "You tell her to cover her face, she wont listen to me!!". They never knew how to respond to it. They'd try to arrest my father but he always produced some official papers that made them scared.

However if working six days the number of hours are supposed to be reduced by 2 hours daily as per law.

kgs59	I'm 31M. Married for 10+ years. I understand what you are going thru. It's a very difficult decision, and the stigma of being a divorcee (M/F) is kinda of annoying. So I understand your concerns of not wanting to nose dive into this and create a big mess. Me and my wife are not a match made in heaven, we have our differences and our own opinions on different subjects. But mutual respect is present in the relationship and we understand where our opinions are coming from. As long as the core values of what you both believe in align, I think it's good enough. Things changed from when we first got married, we both changed as we grew older together. Our stand on many subjects differed. As someone else here said don't be analytical about it. Keep a margin of error. Things will change and keep changing as you grow older. Don't judge the majority based on the vocal minority on social media. Focus on the core values that you hold and would like you future partner to share same values. Good luck and I wish you a bright future.	1642064937.0	hsgt679	t3_s2rden	t3_s2rden	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2rden/marriage_for_life/hsgt679/

7t7cahto	As far as I heard from close friends who are also young, they struggle to find jobs in Jeddah and looking for jobs in Riyadh or Khobar. Jeddah is an amazing city to live in not gonna lie (Riyadh based). As far as healthcare all jobs provide health insurance but depends how good is it. Overall checkups at large hospitals will not go over 200riyal (my copay is 10% so 20 riyals there). Schooling on the other hand also depends on your job. You can continue your schooling here but might cost you a bit. If you are a STEM major look at KAUST for a possible scholarship. Great place.

Sadly there’s no listing for ‘useless’ when trying to update the professions. . . .

Have you heared of Shauna Rea? She is islamically legal to wed, even though she looks 8. Aishah was much more mature probably than her, probably also physically more mature than here during that time!	1642096291.0	hsiikg5	t3_s0oj07	t1_hs6wsyc	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s0oj07/does_anyone_actually_miss_the_religious_police/hsiikg5/

However, in jobs like accountant or engineer it’s possible to find a foreigner who receives much more than saudis.

4b1ikdjj	Expat here.  Born and raised here and been living in the eastern province.  About racism - yes you will face it. Not everywhere but you definitely will, specially if you don’t speak Arabic. I myself have faced a lot of racism but I guess that was because I was living in a shitty neighborhood.  And yes you will most likely be blamed if you ever do get in trouble with a Saudi. That’s just how it is, sad Ik. But I’m assuming you know Arabic and you can try to defend yourself. Probably won’t work.  I myself am moving out of the country cuz of “Saudization”. I suggest you look into it cuz some sectors are now 100% for saudis. I’ve nothing against saudization, heck if I was a Saudi it’s the best thing ever. But I do think it’s kinda not right to kick off ppl who played a huge role in building the kingdom. Personally Ik a lot of well qualified non saudis who will be an asset to the kingdom but aren’t getting jobs cuz of saudization.   Also Ik you said your American. But TRUST me if you don’t look American you won’t be treated American. You are an Arab here.   I still love it here despite all the bad experiences I’ve had. Cuz I cant judge an entire country based on the few dickheads I’ve met lol.  Lemme know if you need any more info.

Existence tax is known officially as dependence fees but unofficial people tend to call it the existence tax since u pay a tax with absolutely no benifit at ALL, LIKE none, no free education or free health care or anything at all noting....ಠ_ಠ  It 400 riyal per depend and it's add up quickly if u have a family here. But seeing ur coming America i don't think it will even impact u. So don't worries at all, also I think u can negotiate to employer to cover it for ur family, the company is required to cover employee's dependence fees but not the employee's family.	1642189045.0	hso2mrx	t3_s3sm34	t1_hsncjbs	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s3sm34/people_who_have_immigrated_to_saudi_how_has_your/hso2mrx/

Also the fee is not for family of 5..... It like is a fee that u have to cover for any family member that u have under u. Like ur married and ur wife is a expat as well still u have to pay the fee.

Maybe they’ll get citizenship if hell freezes over. Also if your wife passes away (god forbid but this is all hypothetical) you and your children have to leave the country or find another sponsor and you will be treated exactly like any other expat who just came yesterday.

Never know what kind of stuff they may try.	1642200631.0	hsowas9	t3_s3xsiy	t1_hsovf9p	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s3xsiy/when_the_local_driver_outperforms_the_professional/hsowas9/

n68wy	I was just discussing this with my dad this evening while we were on a drive. MBS' reforms are steps in the right direction, but there is SO MUCH more yet to be done if Saudi wants to stand a chance towards economic sustainability in the long run. Take a page from Canada's book in terms of attracting talent and driving growth. Unless Saudi opens up a points based immigration system, I don't see the reforms serving their intended purpose. Projects will turn out like KAEC, promising on paper but real world application is nil due to the lack of incentives for people and business to move in.	1642205343.0	hsp7du5	t3_s42yaw	t3_s42yaw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s42yaw/saudis_how_do_you_feel_about_the_reforms_under_mbs/hsp7du5/

I have read many books and watched several documentaries that covered the history/politics side of the region but have now moved on to wanting to get a better understanding about modern day to day life and views. A friend from Oman recommended this show in particular. I found a documentary in English about it (which I watched) but no translations of the show. My Arabic is still very basic so I can’t understand without translation.   Happy to hear any other recommendations that anyone might have - especially if they are accessible in English.	1642208474.0	hsped3u	t3_s44y5d	t1_hsp865f	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s44y5d/does_anyone_know_where_to_find_episodes_of_kalam/hsped3u/

156qmt	yes i used eatmarna too, went in end of november   before i went i had heard mixed things, like that if i book 5 for example, and then one or two prayer bookings had passed, then i'll get to book one or two more at that point, so i just booked as much as i could as it was available, & toward the end to my surprise i was just not able to book at all even tho it was showing available.   maybe bc there was vacation days going on for saudis that week?   well inshaAllah i got another amazing opportunity to go again next week so thats good to hear	1642211723.0	hspli26	t3_rsdmtg	t1_hspky5i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rsdmtg/can_children_come_on_umrah/hspli26/
htm4r5kx	Aight. I work there. You have asked a lot of questions and I’ll try my best cuz I’m a Saudi who lived as an expat elsewhere for 10 years.   In four months, we will move our offices to the tallest tower in Riyadh, which we own not lease. It’s prestigious. It has the same capital as Aramco and only a 1000 employees (as opposed to 65000). The country’s new direction is investing the oil money into diversified portfolio.   Yes Saudi is hella white washed. Fuck dat shit. I don’t like it. But the recruiters are telling you the truth. It’s a very palpable melting pot. It’s still conservative country in total but now you have outlets/options for alternative lifestyles.   We have a few expats. Perhaps a bit over 10% but this is my personal guesstimate. Europeans, Americans, Asians etc…  Also I have yet to write a single email in Arabic in my job and I am comfortably a bilingual. I have Saudi coworkers who use Arab-English and EVERYONE speaks it in the job. But outside you will find people enough English speakers but not everyone.   I had a job offer from Big4 in SWE and turned it down for PIF. Granted I love my family and my dad needed me to be there for him.

2zxgrhza	Sounds very inconsistent. Only time I had issues booking prayers was when I booked umrah first and then tried to book prayers. I got an error something like "maximum permits exceeded" but when I had 5 prayers booked and then booked umrah after it was all good. Good luck with another visit.

762r2nt3	Racism. There’s no way around it. These people refuse to take a look in the mirror and acknowledge that their country is the biggest abuser of human rights in modern history. The atrocities they committed against Iraqis and afghani are well documented, yet they refuse to acknowledge them. It baffles me.   As for Meltzer, he’s a “pro-wrestling journalist” who has no credibility because he makes shit up as he goes. He’s been very vocal against the Saudi-wwe relationship. He lies constantly just to make Saudi look bad. When the plane carrying wwe wrestlers out of Saudi after a show had mechanical issues, he said the wrestlers were held captives, which the wrestlers themselves denied. Now, I don’t know if Meltzer is a complete racist or he’s just being very anti-WWE. But one can assume from his unfounded statements against Saudi that he’s a fucking racist bigot bastard.   Keep in mind, >!the pro-wrestling community is a bunch of left leaning fatties in their 30s with low testosterone levels. Most of them still live in their parents’ basement. On top of that, their whole identity and existence is to bash wwe creative and collect wrestling funko dolls. Some of them are married to ugly pigs, the rest have orgasms to female wrestlers posters.!< What I am try to say is, their opinion of Saudi doesn’t really matter.	1642215575.0	hspts2g	t3_s490bx	t3_s490bx	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s490bx/this_is_insane_people_are_literally_comparing/hspts2g/

But if you're sending it through Saudi Post or regular postal service, then you should get the National Address. That's the address registered to the receiver. Saudi Post also has a service called EMS which is similar to courier, that should be fine too. Bottom line, if it's tracked, it should be OK with the address where it contains the house number and street name. Again, I'd contact the receiver and make sure.	1642222805.0	hsq82mp	t3_s2onfc	t1_hskv1jb	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s2onfc/yanbu_rc_46451_what_does_this_rc_belong_to/hsq82mp/

6cgpiheh	I remember watching Spacetoon. I started watching during the 2005 "reboot" at approximately 2010, and I was amazed at all those shows I could watch. When the actual reboot came in during 2013, I was amazed at that new style and the new shows, and confused because of the removal of 3 out of the 10 planets. I just snapped when علوم came back a few months later (thank Allah you weren't even close to me that day, or else your eardrums might have exploded), I forgot what they put that day as it was 8 years ago. And then during 2017, another example of me going through hype was when أفلام came back, the second I heard those lyrics, you know it was time to to to the other room, as I just realized what planet I was seeing five seconds later. I heard that تاريخ is making a comeback, I'm not sure if it already did because I don't have Spacetoon on my TV no more.

wqvn5	Try toale your profile 100% based on bayts metrics. Then login every couple of days and apply to positions. There's a button to refresh the date of your resume. Once you do that frequently it will show employers that your CV is up to date and you are actively applying for positions. Because most employers I've worked with really are interested in people who can join immediately so a person actively applying can join quicker than others who need to give a long notice period. Also don't show that you're unemployed currently even if you are. I found that employers are hesitant to hire someone who hasn't been working for a while. If you're a fresher put your dad's company as a place you're currently working/training/intern at. Ask your dad about work culture and commonly used terminology that's used in the field so that you can use it for when you arrive at an interview. I know it might not be as ethical but we're competing against wasta and nepotistic culture here so I say fight fire with fire. Do what you gotta do to survive.	1642241505.0	hsqzn6r	t3_rnaxrg	t1_hsmxdyy	/r/saudiarabia/comments/rnaxrg/whats_the_best_way_to_get_job_from_your_experience/hsqzn6r/
378ukei	Well I didn't want to go in to politics but being that you are so curious..  Oh there are many issues being a Zionist today.  It has always been a sad truth.  For me being a Zionist has nothing to do with Arabs or nations.  History has taught my people we have no where safe, so we need to create safety ourselves. So being a democraty, only when we feel safe amongst Palestinians, we would let go of the nation and accept one israstine for all.  Right now, and for the past 100 years in the Levant, it has been the opposite.  So no it's not wrong, but history and humanity are a bitch.	1642241508.0	hsqznaq	t3_s4fhsa	t1_hsqyg55	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s4fhsa/noticably_jewish_in_saudi_arabia/hsqznaq/

Beside the traffic, the location is great, new restaurants and cafes opening lately. Regarding PIF, it is highly reputed in the kingdom and hard to get accepted there.  Mostly government agencies are becoming powerful. PIF invested in many successful businesses and they own 64% of Saudi Telecom Company, not to mention their 26 billion stake in Lucid Motors. We’re very welcoming to foreigners, most of the population speak English and understand the western culture so you’ll fit easily.

dy1i9mqp	Forced saudization of industries have led to squeezed economy and so the opportunities for Saudis as well. Moreover, instead of embracing expat and assimilating then into economy, they are treated as disposables, however this is has long term effect, where the brightest of them leave for Western countries, leaving only a pool of mediocre work force of both Saudis abd expats behind. Saudi just have to ponder why the West is accepting these well educated people and what would they get out of them. If only Saudi can harvest this talent pool, they can have a smart economy that would be competitive, once the oil revenue dwindle or else it could be a scary situation.	1642243152.0	hsr1t2z	t3_s3m3f2	t3_s3m3f2	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s3m3f2/thoughts_on_employment_or_lack_thereof/hsr1t2z/

57ftuxsl	For expats it is actually 2.5k but can be broken down as saying, 500 for rent and 100 for electricity with a base pay of 1.9k, so as long as your total compensation equals 2.5k there is no problem, but yeah if they are getting 1.5k then no way in hell is their total compensation package hitting 2.5k, for Saudis it is 4k, with around 10% getting taken for Social insurance and retirement, so your take home becomes 3.5-3.6k, for Saudis it is enforced as Saudis have options but for foreigners not so much, their residency is tied to employment so without a job they are out of the country.	1642243944.0	hsr2vly	t3_s3m3f2	t1_hsqkbcc	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s3m3f2/thoughts_on_employment_or_lack_thereof/hsr2vly/

378ukei	Ever heard of whatabouism?  Well...  6mil out of 1.2bil is 0.5% genocide 6mil out of 14mil is almost half population, so forgive me if I don't see them as the same.  Of course they are not.. Have you heard of the final solution? Germany actually made technical and logistical plans to destroy an ethnicity, and they actually went through with it.  British colonialism was violent and destructive like south American colonialism and Australian, Israel is not the same.  We did not colonize for economics or geopolitics, we colonized to create, and we wanted everyone to be a part.  Do you know of the other communities living and cooperating with IL? There are many, you only think about Palestinians but what about Druze, Beduins, Sameritans, Christians and so on?  >seen as hero by the British people,  Our luck is that Hitler was crazy enough to attack everyone, if it was just internal, no one would come to help us, just like no one is helping Uighurs.  >richest in the world to the poorest  If in 3 generations you did not better your situation, that's culturally on you and not the British, they left you alone, that's what you wanted. Now it's time for you to create your nation, it is not easy at all. If you are on reddit I assume you are one of the more "better off" Indians so the blame is very much on you.. as a strong citizen, make something great for the glory of you country, that's what we do in IL and in 3 generations it made Israel a wonder to behold.  >do u think the british have right to india???? can the later genration have right to claim india??  The British of course do not have any right to India, they where foreign colonizers.  I anyway have a genetic test and all my ancestors are Levantine, from 100,000 years ago up until the last genetic ancestor that lived 6,000 years ago. And then my family has been Jewish for about 3,500 years. Always praying towards Jerusalem so it is my homeland.  During 1,948 years of living in Europe we have been attacked so many times that yeah, I have a right to live safely, it could not happen anywhere else, we are always looked at like outsiders even today...

Also 300,000 SAR or 65,000 USD is an insanely bad price for what you’re getting lol	1642247752.0	hsr81bq	t3_s4g5ty	t1_hsr0ff7	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s4g5ty/surfing_thru_riyadh_this_is_the_raw_footage_from/hsr81bq/

8042pg6m	My grandfather was an intelligence officer in the Saudi government and he helped Saudi armed forces storm the place and take down Juhayman and his clique.   He told me how the Saudi military flew a couple of helicopters over the Grand Mosque in order to intimidate the rebels and they have him a shield plaque for his service.   The country basically adopted many of his ideas after his death and that really set the country back which upset my grandfather and he also told me that it was one of three events (the other two being the Iranian Revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) that started the 'Sahwa' movement in Saudi Arabia.	1642260646.0	hsrwdi2	t3_s1e2ou	t3_s1e2ou	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s1e2ou/1979_siege_of_makkah/hsrwdi2/
wg1pz	Yep, at least what I’ve seen on Haraj.com. The thing is like someone else has mentioned there’s a shortage in supply so prices will naturally go up. I think originally the retail price was set at 30,000 USD but Ford didn’t anticipate the amount of demand they got for the Bronco (kinda stupid). Now if you go on Haraj you’ll find imported models from the US going for upwards of 60,000 USD here in Saudi.	1642260705.0	hsrwijj	t3_s4g5ty	t1_hsrw4be	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s4g5ty/surfing_thru_riyadh_this_is_the_raw_footage_from/hsrwijj/

68rzb	> Dude ... I'm a nuclear medicine tech, I scan lungs (and other organs) for a living.  No offence but doctors and medtechs are not (usually) scientists. Is there some specific issue you have with the sources I provided? Do you disagree with how the data is being interpreted? In the Twitter thread that I linked to especially, most of the data is available to read.  > Some of the information you provided are false.  Which information specifically, and how is it wrong?  > 50% for whom? which age group? which ethnicity? (apparently that makes a difference) > it's not a clear cut answer.  Because it takes a long time to gather information on the long-term impacts of any illness, and because vaccines have only been available for children for a couple of months at most, the data on vaccine efficacy against long-COVID is mostly about adults. But why would we simply assume that children are less vulnerable than adults? Especially since [there are actually loads of kids with long-COVID symptoms](https://twitter.com/jneill/status/1479066859270025219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1479067776866213888%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nakedcapitalism.com%2F2022%2F01%2Flinks-1-8-2022.html) and, at least pre-vaccination, kids with documented cases of COVID have [more than 50% higher long-term morbidity](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.21265133v1.full?s=08) than kids who haven't contracted it. Given that vaccines don't seem to give great protection against long-COVID symptoms in adults, why would we assume that it's different for kids?  > Give this a read for more info about vaccines: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32623-4/fulltext?rss=yes&utm\_source=nl\_landingpage&utm\_medium=web&utm\_campaign=covid\_bytes\_daily\_newsletter  I'm not actually sure why you linked to this. Are you assuming that I'm an anti-vaxxer or something because I don't think it's fine and dandy for COVID to rip through the child population? Is there something specific in that study that you wanted me to read?

And you don’t need zain to reply, go to their shop and pick the package you want, and mobily isn’t that bad but not as good as stc, tried all 3 and i can say that, zain is really good if its covered around your area, stc have really good support and like zain, mobily is not so good i would say from my experience customer service is slow and they don’t actually help that much, they take too long to send someone to check on the box( sometimes a wire would shorten) and their coverage is good but their wifi is bad, this whole thing i wrote is from experience, so if someone has anything different they would like to add then go ahead.

iumw2	Government started pumping a huge amount of money there because the weather is less awful in the summer than Riyadh and Eastern, so Jeddah is the only real major city that can be a tourist destination in the summer right now.   With that infrastructure money, there are more jobs. More jobs equals more people with money, more people with money means more customers for businesses, more customers is also more jobs created, which feeds into the loop. Jeddah is a great place to be for entrepreneurs. In fact, my entire company moved to Jeddah, except me, cause I don't like it.	1642476257.0	ht4osoz	t3_s68its	t3_s68its	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s68its/why_have_people_been_praising_jeddah_as_of_late/ht4osoz/

But don't forget that Jeddah is home tk a LOT of royals' summer residences, so even 'private' royal funds are being spent like crazy there.

Limiting it to once a life time is a really bad idea because it is not certified if you do that every other muslim will come some people will still can’t afford it or don’t have the physical ability. My grandma died 20+ years ago and she didn’t go to Hajj and I wanna go to Hajj on behalf of her and on behalf of myself if you limit it I can’t go to Hajj for the dead and they need it way more than the alive.

Deciding who is going is the responsibility of the other countries, so for example, Egypt has a raffle system to determine who will go for Hajj. For anyone who lives in the KSA, a Hajj permit is granted once every Five years, and a citizen or an expat can see his/her Hajj status in Absher.	1642498048.0	ht5owtz	t3_s6rqz5	t3_s6rqz5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6rqz5/since_there_are_roughly_2_billion_muslims/ht5owtz/

Because if these projects get fully built and the money is spent on them then the projects failing could and probably would bankrupt the country. Not to mention show investors that this country is not a suitable investment. And lets not forget all of this is supposed to be here by 2030 or at least useable.   And i know the "financial" heads don't call the shots and they would have wanted to do something else or disagreed on some projects but it just proves the point that they are not always in control. and if they are not in total control i would never trust any figure.   &#x200B;  I would never want anything bad to happen to the country and i only wish for it to thrive, but sometimes you do doubt what goes around.	1642500367.0	ht5rq77	t3_s3m3f2	t1_ht2sxn6	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s3m3f2/thoughts_on_employment_or_lack_thereof/ht5rq77/

The issue is not the permit, it’s the price. Even if they do limit it to “once in life time”, most Muslims cannot afford it.

2atqtmc	And who exactly Should be isolated in this situation?   I talked about the situation in the kingdom and how the government treats covid now. You brought kids and their education here. and honestly making this whole just bullshit situation that "kids can't learn from online school" is honestly stupid. Sure in person is better but honestly studying and learning all comes down to the person himself. Parents should look after their kids and their studying. And if they are teenagers then there shouldn't be a problem with them comprehending the subjects through online classes and they can ask the teachers when they don't understand something or go to youtube to look for a video on it. I went through online school for my last year for high school and other than math which i already don't like. I learned everything just fine. And the same in college before i dropped out. I look at my classmates tahsili scores and I see people who actually studied for themselves and did well. I got an 81. 2 of my friends got an 84 and an 86 and are currently doing preparatory year in KFU for engineering.	1642502459.0	ht5uboq	t3_s616tt	t1_ht5r2en	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s616tt/why_doesnt_the_ministry_of_education_make_school/ht5uboq/

h8vz1dte	Exactly right. Each country is different. OP is likely from a western country where, yes, there are less Muslims and you can go every year. In most Muslim majority countries, no, you cannot go every year.   You also have to take into account that the vast majority of Muslims unfortunately cannot afford to go for hajj, even once in their life. So the limit would be futile unless you started paying for people who cannot afford it.   Also don’t forget that despite equality of Ihram,  Hajj is segmented by class, and you have X number of rooms in the clock tower that need to be filled by “rich” people, and if you limit the “rich” people that come often, then the clock tower will be empty.	1642502899.0	ht5uvgv	t3_s6rqz5	t1_ht5owtz	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6rqz5/since_there_are_roughly_2_billion_muslims/ht5uvgv/

t28x0	I know this is a late answer that will get buried, but I must point out that it is particularly hard for expats to learn Arabic even though they live in Saudi Arabia. There are a few places offering courses but they are incredibly overpriced, have limited options and frequently have teachers that are not qualified to teach the language effectively.  To me it is so surprising that this is the case since we are in the heart of the Arab world.  So to summarize, a decent Arabic language institute for non-native speakers.	1642504906.0	ht5xhrv	t3_s60p7c	t3_s60p7c	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s60p7c/which_companymarketbusiness_is_missing_in_saudi/ht5xhrv/

wytm427	Good thinking You can buy stuff in poorer countries. But maybe not much in KSA With this amount you probably can: 1. A small amount of sugar, or tea leaves. Can be used for occasional tea craves.  2. 1 lime 3. Some really cheap colored sphere gums.  4. Soap It all depends on the merchant if he decides to open packages and sell rations out of them. Usually done in poor places. ( I lived in both syria and yemen).	1642512031.0	ht68m35	t3_s6tq56	t1_ht5yaji	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6tq56/what_can_you_get_with_this/ht68m35/

9dm52y47	>It’s 7th century, when Arabia is made up of rival, feuding tribes, disunited and forever at each other’s throats. Emperor Kisra (Kingsley) has a fearsome reputation for being utterly ruthless. But when the Arabian Princess Hind (Hart) refuses to become the emperor’s concubine, the stage is set for an epic confrontation. It is a battle that, by its conclusion, will have changed the region forever and echo throughout history. Escaping with her father, King Numan (Massoud) into the vast and unforgiving desert, Hind is pursued by Kisra’s seasoned mercenary Jalabzeen and his bloodthirsty troops.	1642520167.0	ht6r0g5	t3_s6zg1i	t3_s6zg1i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6zg1i/hollywood_and_saudi_arabia_teaming_up_to_produce/ht6r0g5/

a3c6f	It’s better to get the same vaccine if the first dose didn’t give you any side effects. Cocktailing may give you enhanced immune response but it’s only used if you’re in a country with a shortage of a vaccine type.  This is why I fly back to the U.K. to get my vaccines. Only issue I’ve had is that if a country is on a red list and you travel to it, you can’t come back for 14 days after spending it in a non red list country.  Plus it’s much easier to have NHS vaccine certificate accepted than trying to prove it with Tawakkalna.	1642521644.0	ht6uvbj	t3_s6vql3	t1_ht62igh	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6vql3/i_got_my_booster_shot_yesterday_and_later_found/ht6uvbj/

gkmaqyfj	Haha will do.   My symptoms were: coughing a lot, my voice changed so much, my temp was high, unbearable headache, I remember waking up in middle of my sleep just bc my throat was so dry I would cough a lot, along with the flu  But now is better alhamidllah, yes I still cough, yes my heart hurts, yes I still get headaches but they’re all mild, also I noticed my body is weak and my hair was falling out (and still is)   Edit: forgot to mention prior of me getting rlly sick, I noticed my heart beat was not normal, I didn’t do any wild physical activity, I was sitting and all of a sudden my heart starts pouding, I don’t know if it’s related to covid symptoms, but this was the earliest thing I’ve noticed before getting actually sick, and it’s still happening but not as strong as it first started	1642589034.0	htawspq	t3_s7kln9	t1_htavrxg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7kln9/tested_pos_for_covid/htawspq/

mkefn	I just want to say, thank you for explaining how it works, a lot of people say “I know, I work there” and don’t explain because racist idiots should do their own research rather than get all the facts for free (no effort involved), but the fact that you took your time to explain this means that you both care about your field and its reputation as well as relationships between expats and Saudis in the community. It’s sad how people are pitted against each other just to push stereotypes and self-serving agendas promoted by closed-minded people who are afraid of everything “other”, on both sides of the community.	1642598579.0	htbbwx6	t3_s6vql3	t1_hta7qe7	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6vql3/i_got_my_booster_shot_yesterday_and_later_found/htbbwx6/

Because I went to college in the U.S for computer science and when I compare myself to my colleagues in Riyadh they're doing as good if not better especially in Software Engineering. Look at the programs carefully since most universities here im the U.S don't even teach software engineering.

czdxwnsk	I personally am not opposed to them criticizing our Human Rights Violations, they have every right to do so. But it gets annoying when they do It on every post that mentions Saudi Arabia.  Hell, I can post a picture of my Cat and were I found it, and the comment section would devolve in to a political shithole.  Imagine if we did that everytime some posts about China or the US or Europe?  Imagine if some posted an image of the Grand Canyon and I commented something like "Glad there aren't any schools there or they'd probably be shot up"?	1642608815.0	htbzupt	t3_s490bx	t1_hsqvp0k	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s490bx/this_is_insane_people_are_literally_comparing/htbzupt/

4kdlunom	Not sure what he did, but if you feel it's warranted, I'd suggest you contact the company and lodge a complaint. If he was bold enough to do it with you, it's fair to assume it's because he may have done this in the past. If you used Uber, click on your profile and you'll find the "Help" icon under your personal uber rating. Scroll to the bottom and you'll find the "Call Support" option.                                 If it was Careem, click on your profile page, it should bring up your past rides and should have the option of "Get help with this ride" in Green.                                FWIW if you receive any messages or calls from their number, make sure to document and screenshot these, without providing them any responses. Let them talk themselves into a corner they can't back out of.  Sorry about the experience, I know what it's like to feel unsafe and having other people know where you live or work.

eqk4quw3	As a woman, I would agree with the above comment. Assuming you find the RIGHT girl and are sure about her, it would be better to get married young and grow together as a couple. The older you get the more life experience you will have and the higher your standards will be. I wasn’t able to get married until after I got my master’s degree and if I could change anything it would be to get married earlier. My husband also has the same idea, and says the longer he put it off the more difficult it was for him to find someone with the specifications he was looking for.  I’m not sure how religious you are but if you are worried about taking on the responsibility of marriage if you are not financially ready, I would suggest looking into the Quran verses and hadeeth that talk about how Nikah actually increases your sustenance. Perhaps that might give you some clarity.  But again, just make sure you are choosing the right person and not marrying the first person that comes along just for the sake of getting married.	1642611162.0	htc60t0	t3_s7lyep	t1_htbku8f	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7lyep/someone_is_asking_to_get_married_to_youyour/htc60t0/

5w5w8i2w	Advice from a loving brother: Getting a scholarship the way you are planning to do is really hard and almost impossible. It was made like this since the former minister of education took place in office and the situation is still the same today.   I’m telling you this because I am studying abroad and personally know many Saudis that did the same and been trying to get a scholarship for years, none of them got it. I also know a couple of employees at the Saudi Cultural Mission. They all advise against this. Unless you have a guaranteed scholarship from the ministry, don’t go abroad. There’s a big chance that you will waste your time and money and come back with nothing if you cannot afford the full tuition from your pocket.  If you can get into one of the top universities in Saudi Arabia, I advise you to do so before it’s too late. KAU can accept you for orientation year if 5 years haven’t passed since you graduated high school. Quality of education is good and there A LOT of majors to choose from. You just need high grades, which should be easy for you if you have this passion.	1642614652.0	htcfgna	t3_s7lyep	t3_s7lyep	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7lyep/someone_is_asking_to_get_married_to_youyour/htcfgna/

e7yl1ro7	I think you need a friend more than a wife. Marriage is a huge fucking responsibility, I don't think you need that at 22, you still young, don't put that wight on your back. Go make/find friends, it's gonna be hard at first but it will be worth it.  I know how being lonely makes you feel you think having a wife will give a life-long best friend, but that shit ain't true, a friend is what you need at your age, a wife will stress you out, I don't meant it like "wife is bad, women are bad", it nice to get married but it's best when you're old enough to put up with the responsibilities that come with it.   So take my advice, try to look for friends that are interested in the same things that interest you, for example if you are interested in football, you should attend football matches, or if you love anime talk with people in anime forums and so on. Don't feel down about not finding a friend you just keep trying and you will find someone inshallah.  Ps. don't look for a gf no matter what you do, don't, that comes with unnecessary responsibilities too.	1642614775.0	htcfsii	t3_s7lyep	t1_htaq4q6	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7lyep/someone_is_asking_to_get_married_to_youyour/htcfsii/

There's a possibility he will cheat while away (22 years old, you ain't started living yet) . Are you ( the daughter) ready to deal with that if its thrown at you? 5- life isn't perfect,  if you're making good money at Aramco and NEED to get married , it would be better to stay and try and save some more.  All this has been said with great consideration for your culture.	1642618757.0	htcqm15	t3_s7lyep	t3_s7lyep	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7lyep/someone_is_asking_to_get_married_to_youyour/htcqm15/

3yemok5	It was not important for parents to teach their kids about road safety, nor the government ever did any proper road safety awareness campaigns, and when they started, it was mostly too late. It's the easiest thing to get the license and the punishments are only monetary.   We have a really big problem in the upbringing when it comes to respecting others rights and safety. No parent used to bring it up or care about it. Only recent parents started doing so, so hopefully it gets better and better.   We need harsher punishments that's not something that you can simply payoff.

70u10zty	2400 SR (nearly 99%) is only £471.00 GBP, which is slightly less then my rent for my house. The expat fee for me personally wouldn’t be an issue simply because in the KSA, I would get paid about 200% (3 times more) at least then what I do right now here in the UK. Plus on top of that, there’s a high possibility that I would get free housing or a housing allowance to cover all my housing costs within Saudi via the company that I’d work for. If not then I definitely get this in the UAE (it sure if they have expat fee though) as I am open to moving and living/working in either KSA or UAE in the future.  Even if they made the expat fee £300.00 a month so 1,500 SR. IMO it would still be very manageable.  I don’t think you understand how expensive it is to live and work in the UK compared to working within KSA as a white British male.

2wo1z4po	with a huge number of ex-pats working, a portion of their monthly salaries gets transacted to their families abroad.  let us say for the sake of argument, each ex-pat sends 100 riyals per month to their families (of course the number is much higher than this), 100\*10,000,000\*12= 12billion riyals being transacted out of the country annually, this is a big case, that is why the reduction of the number of ex-pats is necessary.  but people usually come to the conclusion that "SA doesn't want expats, so who will work their jobs", this is a wrong statement, SA is still reliant on Expats, just with the big number of unemployed nationals (11% for Saudi males and 21% for Saudi females), a reduction in the number of ex-pats is necessary for the rotation of revenue in the country and not outside of it.  does that mean I am a supporter of the drastic measures taken here? no, but for the overall picture for Saudi Arabia, it needs to do this, I know it is harsh, very harsh, but this is the fastest way, but this way's downside is that it is harsh.	1642630796.0	htdn9lp	t3_s7xkst	t1_htcx41a	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7xkst/on_other_news_why_are_expats_sending_more_money/htdn9lp/

The others who are saying that it's not a young age, I think their only life goal is to get married so that's why they're rushing to it. 0-18 years old was spent in schools, 18-22 is spent in colleges(if not then it's spent on experiencing life with less responsibilities) 22-26 is where you should enjoy life as much as you could before walking into huge responsibilities.

Like life is so much harder in the US, more difficult to keep the faith when surrounded by disbelief. So if you're able to keep your faith, even when surrounded by kufar, then I think there is more blessing in it. It is more of a test, the mountain is steeper and the reward greater. If you're surrounded by Islam life is easier, harder to commit haram, less temptation, obv there is benefit but less tests and difficulty. My teacher used to say tie a dog to a lamppost and it will fast. Doesn't make it a believer.

Foul Tamez is to live for :p  Foul Tawwa Aadi with extra extra Tahini (Foul "Frypan" plain no cheese or eggs) is my go to order, with Shaye / Chai Addani without milk, chef's kiss to me.  Plus any mainstream Shawarma Restauraunt like Mama Nourah or Shawarma House gives Falafel sandwichs, just ask without Egg and you're good to go.

3qwb5qzr	Dont get married until you are settled in. My opinion is to wait until you graduate and land a job in saudi honestly.  If your main worry is that you dont want to be alone, thats not a good reason to get married. Its a lot of responsibility.  Keep in mind that whoever you get married to would have to spend a lot of time away from her family, which she is probably not used to, so it will be difficult on her and on you.   Honestly just go to university, get your degree and land a job, then think about marriage.	1642647729.0	hteqe1l	t3_s7lyep	t3_s7lyep	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7lyep/someone_is_asking_to_get_married_to_youyour/hteqe1l/

There’s not a single Saudi wedding I’ve ever been without being served a tea. Many like it flavored with some local fresh (or dried) mint leaves or basil (habaq). My favorite tea is the one that is sold by street vendors and cooked over charcoal in the winter 🤤🫖.	1642649135.0	htetjen	t3_s7ynpo	t3_s7ynpo	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7ynpo/tell_me_about_the_tea_culture_in_saudi_arabia/htetjen/

flebsdi7	I meant the experience of having a traditional Saudi tea. Tea is much cheaper than coffee which makes it affordable to every social class as an everyday drink. Therefore, it’s not common that Saudis gather in a fancy place to enjoy some fine specialty tea (many regard “specialty tea” and “tea houses” as silly concepts in Saudi Arabia), but we do it for coffee. Tea here is linked more to simplicity and affordability.	1642650624.0	htewsvq	t3_s7ynpo	t1_hteuoqq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7ynpo/tell_me_about_the_tea_culture_in_saudi_arabia/htewsvq/

eqk4quw3	The point I was trying to get across is that both men and women should get married as soon as they are able to and not delay marriage for education. However, that’s not saying that you can’t get married and study at the same time. There are A LOT of men and women who got married while in the middle of their education or continued with grad school after marriage (either together or separately). I also know a couple of families where the parents continued their education after having their children. In my case, I simply did not get married because I was not able to find a suitable match until I started working.  I don’t think you will be infringing on the woman’s rights at all. At the end of the day it all depends on the woman and her family and what she is willing to accept. If she is righteous and logical though, I don’t think that will be an issue because she will understand that the more qualified you are the better able you will be to provide for the family and might in fact encourage it. I know many couples like this. I think the better question to ask is whether you think you will be able to balance your responsibilities.  Also, why do you assume she would get bored? She can also work on doing something for herself in the meantime and even after having children (again, IF she can balance her responsibilities). You can encourage her to do so as well. Whether that’s getting a degree or just taking classes on something she’s interested in, running a business from home, picking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, volunteering at a women’s group, increasing her knowledge in the deen, spend time with her family, etc. There are SO many possibilities for things to do to feel accomplished so I really don’t understand when women say they are bored at home.   Again, it all depends on who you are marrying. My advice would be to communicate with the person you are considering very transparently to make sure you understand each other and avoid surprises after marriage. Don’t withhold important information because you are worried you will be rejected. I’ve seen a lot of people make this mistake and then suffer after marriage because their partner’s expectations doesn’t match the reality. If you want to study, make it clear. If you’re planning to move countries, make it clear. Make sure you understand each others’ values and are on the same page about your goals. And also make it clear what you are willing to compromise on or not willing to compromise. I can’t stress this enough, but try to get to know the other person and understand how she thinks as well as you can before marriage.  Just to add, I do think postgraduate education is more important for a man than a woman. I do think all women should insist on getting a bachelor’s at least, but beyond that, I don’t think women should make it a priority to get a master’s or PhD. Reason 1 is that a man and woman’s roles within marriage are different. For you as a man, being more qualified can help you fulfill your role of providing better. For the woman, having a masters and PhD isn’t going to help much with running a household and instilling good values in the kids. Reason 2: women generally look for men who are superior to them (taller, stronger, makes more money, etc). For men, that’s not what they look for in a woman. They generally look at things like how attractive she is, how she will be as a mother, etc. So for you as a man, your interest in getting a masters is actually a good thing, it will definitely improve your marriage prospects.  So if you can, strive for marriage and continue your education at the same time.   Hope this helps and sorry for rambling so much, I do get very passionate about this topic when I see what’s happening with marriage in our society right now and how the youth are struggling.  Hope you are able to find the right woman and have barakah in your future together in shaa Allah.	1642654026.0	htf3tcn	t3_s7lyep	t1_htcwshx	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7lyep/someone_is_asking_to_get_married_to_youyour/htf3tcn/

3yemok5	Losing weight means strict diet first and foremost. Start calculating your calories intake and make sure not to exceed 2400 Calories a day, along with selecting what to consume. Stay away or lower your carbs intake, from bread and rise, fries and all the other carbs if possible.   Through the gym, take it slow, 15 to 20 minutes on the treadmill, even if you felt you could do more, dont, but try to keep it constant. On weight machines, follow instructions, start with the lightest weights even if you felt you could left more, you need to be constant.  If you're messed up your diet or missed a gym day, dont beat yourself too hard or punish your body for it. Go back to track smoothly like nothing happened, but do try to be constant.	1642688431.0	htgl8jg	t3_s835dl	t1_htgg7ui	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s835dl/what_do_you_do_first_when_going_to_the_gym_for/htgl8jg/

oe8eq	I honestly don't know. Maybe people with more knowledge can answer this.  In my anectodal evidence, My family was 4 members here in 2019, with 2 earning and spending. Now its 3 with 1 earning and spending. By September, once I leave, it will be 0 here. Most of my educated and skilled friends are moving to USA, Canada, EU or NZ.  Another is, my company was 9 people in 2019. Its 2 people in 2022. With my departure, they have slowly started transferring my responsibilities to the Dubai team. With the rise of remote work and pre-established market its not that hard.   Its the same stuff all over again with expatriates. Why hire Saudis to be Brand Managers or Marketing Managers and pay high salaries, when you can outsource the jobs to expats in Dubai. You can even hire executives and interns and just take the major decisions.	1642689301.0	htgn81i	t3_s8g06i	t1_htgk4ka	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8g06i/105_million_foreigner_workers_leave_179k_saudis/htgn81i/

This was a long time ago obviously, and now we have MBS’ brother suggesting they’ve changed their stance on it.	1642693378.0	htgxcae	t3_s7yf4j	t1_htgw291	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s7yf4j/mbs_brother_recently_suggested_yemen_may_join_the/htgxcae/

a3c6f	Looking at the number of jobs is only a partial picture. What's more important and insightful is the productivity of the labour (those employed). That's what gives you a trend to see the level of economic growth, tax revenues, inflation and real wages.  For KSA, productivity has dropped 2019 (6%) and 2020 (4%). Now, look at UAE productivity, this has grown over the last 2 years by (2%).   So, irrespective of what jobs are being back-filled by Saudization or by expats etc it's clear that labour productivity is worsening over the last few years.   Now, compare this with the UK, which has been affected by Brexit and Coronavirus more than KSA. Productivity has increased only marginally over the last two years.  Now, why is this happening? There are experts who may have the data and can answer these questions but it's clear that some of the causes are: Reduction in the actual quality of labour as highly skilled folks retire from the market or leave the country and are replaced by younger, less-experienced workers.	1642693893.0	htgyoqg	t3_s8g06i	t3_s8g06i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8g06i/105_million_foreigner_workers_leave_179k_saudis/htgyoqg/

Im seeing a lot of companies write only “saudi nationals” in its job listings and its increasing by alot. In the past It would be rare to spot a “Saudi nationals only “ now its rare not to. Companies are proudly writing with bold text made in saudi Arabia “as if saudi products are  known to high quality”   Couple months ago there was a campaign to boycott noon because they fired 15 of their Saudi employees.  On immigration, USA , canada , nz are good countries that even a lot of saudis actually immigrate to. I have met a couple of saudis who have permanently immigrated to USA and Canada. So its expected that non saudis that have it worse would too immigrate.

2r4t7gsh	I used to get paid way less even though I’m Saudi. When I graduated from high school I decided that I want to work instead of “wasting my time” studying under the influence of family members. After looking so hard everywhere around me since I don’t have a car and can’t work far from home, I was able to find a job for 1200 riyals. After working for 3 months, I discussed with the manager that it is not enough and I need more, he was so generous to offer me an extra 100. There were expats working in the same shop and do way less work yet they get paid +2k. I continued to work there and look for another job at the same time with no luck. After 1 and a half year, i decided that I had enough. I tried my luck with applying to a local university and I was accepted. I told my boss that I quit, and he told me he’ll give me 1500 or more if I stayed. I kindly rejected his offer and left. I worked my ass off studying during the past 6 years and I just graduated from medical college in 2021. I’m getting payed +9k during my training, and my salary will double when I finish my training in 6 months.   Moral of the story, if you think you deserve more for the amount of work you do, then you are working in the wrong place/field. People will do their best to get the most out of you for a fraction of your worth if you accepted it.	1642704472.0	hthrokb	t3_s8ggdu	t3_s8ggdu	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ggdu/anyone_else_feels_that_the_salaries_of_young/hthrokb/

d4gck6nx	I can’t compare? I just did.  Why does Saudi make it so difficult? Why is there clear legal superiority of Arab over non Arab Muslims? Tbh I don’t really care if someone calls me abed- happily take their good deeds later. I’d just like to living eventually in Muslim land and be able to regularly perform things like Hajj and Ummrah.  And then you have Saudis coming to America to train. No universities there? Of course there are. So it that not Haram?   Yet if even educated Muslims want to emigrate, wait 10 years as a non citizen let alone second class and maybe prime minister says ok?   I don’t mean to rant or vent. If you ever look at my comments I don’t shy away from being blunt if I have to.	1642704784.0	hthsjgo	t3_s8ps22	t1_hthrosg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/hthsjgo/

Zionism: is an ideology and nationalist movement that espouses the establishment of, and support for a homeland for the Jewish people. Their goal is to establish a nation solely for the jewish people, which there are many islamic nations.   Someone else mentioned that Israel stole land from palestine, and need inhabitants to occupy the country of palestine. They need as many people as they can to achieve their goal of a jewish state.	1642704815.0	hthsmiy	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/hthsmiy/

Even moved here with my dad to try and like get a change of scenery and a new perspective which has helped a lot. Let me tell ya a piece of advice a friend has told me tho that really helped me. Even tho we feel like talking about how we feel doesnt do shit, but ever since i started to open up to my friends about how i'm feeling i found out that wow it actually makes a difference.

decvz4a6	Mate you should’ve done some research before you posted this. Being a jew is not just a religion, it’s an ethnic group. Of course if you are part of an ethnic group you can get citizenship from the country of which the ethnicity is part of. Israel is an ethno-state, meaning jews get citizenship. You are only ever a jew if you were born a jew.   Try converting to judaism and tell Israel you now want to get citizenship, haha that would be very funny.

7uy9v5x6	There is no superiority. We mistreat all non-Saudi Arabs equally.  But regardless. Saudi Arabia is not founded on Islam. It might have Islamist roots. But just like Sudan or turkey that doesn't mean it's pan-Islamic. Today Saudi Arabia is just a country that it's only dedicated to the natives and residents of the land.   You can dislike it. You can complain about it. But it's not going to change. It's going to continue to drift into nationalism. I don't mind giving favoritism to Muslims or allowing people to become citizens. But the days where a complete foreigner and Saudi get treated equally just because they're both Muslims are long gone.	1642708007.0	hti177e	t3_s8ps22	t1_hthsjgo	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/hti177e/

One of my family friends daughter who is Yemeni wanted to enter university but her family didn’t have the money, so they sent her to a government university in Yemen instead where it was free.   In terms of health care, I thought they had to pay for that as well each time they visit the hospital? Including monthly iqama fees.

The inflation is high but the salaries are the same or lower. The prices and greed are still high. Taxes are still high, rent just doubled in Jeddah. Simply having a decent life has become a dream that's getting further and further away to many youth and adults.  Yes it's similar in other countries due to global inflation.	1642703008.0	hthnmxt	t3_s8ggdu	t3_s8ggdu	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ggdu/anyone_else_feels_that_the_salaries_of_young/hthnmxt/

With sadness you know the reason, with depression you don't. Do you remember any major event that happened before you became depressed? Or maybe it was not something major but rather an accumulation of events?  It took me a lot to start getting out of depression (I'm still getting out of it), but meditation helped me a lot.	1642703809.0	hthpu0z	t3_s8opt1	t3_s8opt1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8opt1/new_chapter_depression/hthpu0z/

Of course if you are part of an ethnic group you can get citizenship from the country of which the ethnicity is part of. Israel is an ethno-state, meaning jews get citizenship. You are only ever a jew if you were born a jew.   Try converting to judaism and tell Israel you now want to get citizenship, haha that would be very funny.

7uy9v5x6	There is no superiority. We mistreat all non-Saudi Arabs equally.  But regardless. Saudi Arabia is not founded on Islam. It might have Islamist roots. But just like Sudan or turkey that doesn't mean it's pan-Islamic. Today Saudi Arabia is just a country that it's only dedicated to the natives and residents of the land.   You can dislike it. You can complain about it. But it's not going to change. It's going to continue to drift into nationalism. I don't mind giving favoritism to Muslims or allowing people to become citizens. But the days where a complete foreigner and Saudi get treated equally just because they're both Muslims are long gone.	1642708007.0	hti177e	t3_s8ps22	t1_hthsjgo	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/hti177e/

ouolz2h	Hajj being there = all Muslims should be able to get citizenship? I don’t know how you’re drawing these connections but it doesn’t make sense. The history of the formation of Israel is the reasoning behind their laws. Saying it’s transferable just because you can draw a faint comparison that there are holy sites in each country is not enough reasoning to justify your argument. Plus, ignoring all historical and cultural logic, it’s completely unscalable. There are 15M Jews AND Jews have the highest average income of any religious group. It’s almost as if it’s even a strategic approach for Israel to have such a policy to increase there population for economic reasons. Imagine opening the flood gates to almost 2 billion Muslims, most of them low income. KSA already donates unmeasurable amounts of money to Muslim nations, and it is their responsibility to upkeep their citizens livelihoods first.	1642712196.0	htibd3g	t3_s8ps22	t1_hthxm5j	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htibd3g/

decvz4a6	No offence bro, but how old are you? First you say the “gulf states are basically cousins that separated to form their own countries” and now you are saying North Africa + Levant and Iraq are Arabs?   You should have paid more attention in history class. North Africa and Sudan didn’t speak a word of Arabic before the spread of Islam during 7th century Umayyad Caliphate. Do you think their ethnicity changed to Arab when they were taught how to speak Arabic by the spread of Islam? In that case, Spain would be Arab too because they once also spoke Arabic.   You also had no clue about the Sykes Picot agreement between the British and the French, it was they who drew the borders of the Middle East today, not the gulf states who “decided to separate”.   Not to offend you or anything, but please at least learn about your own history and the Middle Eastern history whilst you are at it.

I did feel the same way as you though when I came back to Saudi after spending a few years in my home country, also feel the same every now and then. Obviously the best thing to do is speak to a therapist. But what worked for me (I consulted a therapist as well), was journaling, mindful meditation and more than anything going to the gym, it gave me something else to enjoy, something else to work towards.

zsrpv	I thought about DM'ing you but I'll post it here for the general benefit.   Tbh I'm actually very happy to learn that Saudi Arabia interests you solely for religious reasons. Keep your intentions pure and ask Allah for ease and doors will, God-willing, open for you. *And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out.* [at-Talâq:2]  I am in no way an expert on the matter but here is me applying a little good-intentioned reasoning:  It feels much easier to get citizenship of some countries because those countries benefit from having more citizens. A good percentage of your income goes to the government as taxes. In fact, from what I've heard, if you're an American citizen you have to file taxes no matter where you reside in the world. Saudi Arabia doesn't collect high taxes from its citizens despite providing them with benefits like free health-care, interest free housing loans, unemployment allowances, education and other facilities.   Maybe not all but a good portion of the negative stories of expats in Saudi Arabia are of those that didn't exactly have a very legal status. At the very best they were in a gray area. If you're dealing with people that are already involved in something illegal or borderline illegal, you're likely to get mistreated.  Isn't knowing the language of a land a prerequisite to reside there? Aren't people who apply to immigrate to English speaking countries required to submit their IELTS/TOEFL scores before even immigrating there? Aren't they required to go through an interview in English before their applications are considered? It is Saudi Arabia where you don't need to know a single word of Arabic to obtain a work permit. It is Saudi Arabia where you will find people that have spent more than 40 years doing pretty well without knowing almost any Arabic. It is Saudi Arabia where you will find road signs in Urdu/Hindi (they're probably not common but I've seen them with my own eyes in Riyadh). It is Saudi Arabia where at the airport you'll hear public announcements in multiple languages. It is Saudi Arabia where in the Holy Mosques you'll see signs in a dozen languages.   No land is perfect. No people are perfect. But your Muslim brothers here aren't wholly as bad as some people will have you believe.   You can DM me for further information.	1642714422.0	htihk57	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htihk57/

What is the point of talking history with someone who doesn’t understand history, to make matters worse, it’s his own history that he doesn’t understand. Seriously, how old are you?  The reason I didn’t include the Levant states and Iraq, is because these borders in the Middle East have been drawn by the British and the French, and they’ve drawn it rather poorly (on purpose but that’s a whole other topic). There are portions of Southern Iraq, Syria and Jordan that are Arab as well, hence why I isolated North Africa for argument’s sake.   Regarding customs and traditions, they are similar all over the Arabian Peninsula, with differences and exceptions of course. For example, You cannot say a Aseeri has more in common with a Kuwaiti than a Yemeni. Or a Omani having more in common with a Bahraini than a Emirati.

iumw2	Here's the problem:  Judaism is a faith.  Jewish is also an ethnicity.    Israel is an ethno-state built for those who are of Jewish ethnic descent, not for practicing Judaism. This js why black jews who immigrate have a tough time, they have the religion but not the ethnicity.  It's also racist in the sense that Polish/Slavic and white passing practicers of Judaism can get in easier than the blacks despite both only having a tenuous ethnic link at best.   Saudi Arabia can also be defined as an ethno-state as it is predominantly peninsular Arabs that are citizens, or those who resided in the Arabian peninsula during the foundation of the Kingdom. You can get citizenship if you prove your descent from the tribes here both by tribal elder recognition and other official documents.  As part of the reform, new immigration policies for skilled work are coming, so stay tuned for that.   Kind reminder that Saudi Arabia isn't just the two holy mosques, and despite our pride in serving them, we're not responsible for all nearly 2 billion muslims.	1642720703.0	htivu7b	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htivu7b/

iumw2	Nope. The prophet himself prohibited writing it during his lifetime. For fear of conmen and mythos hijacking the religion.   Hadith os a collection of oral history and tradition written centuries after his death.    The appearance of dajjal contradicts the promise in the Qur'an, that Muhammad pbuh is the last prophet, messenger, or instrument of god.   The word Mursalīn in Qur'an was used to describe anything sent by god, whether mercy, punishment, or a message, and Muhammad was the last of it. The origins of the Dajjal story come actually from Jewish tradition and not Muslim.	1642722266.0	htizmbq	t3_s8ps22	t1_htiz6gl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htizmbq/
2z2k2h4t	Converts to Judaism are considered as Jewish as any other. While it is true Judaism is an ethnoreligion, genetics doesn't play much of an actual role in Jewishness, genealogy is what's more important. If a patrilineal Jew wants to be considered Jewish under Jewish law, they are entitled to expedited conversions as long as they were raised with Jewish culture to a degree.   Converts are just as Jewish as any other Jew, the only disagreements that come is whether a conversion from one denomination is valid.   The Orthodoxy does not consider conversions from Reform or Conservative schools of Judaism to be valid conversions. However, the state of Israel has allowed that any converts to any recognized denomination to Judaism can come to Israel. Patrilineals can also come to Israel.  The thought process behind it is, if you're Jewish enough to be murdered for it, you're Jewish enough find sanctuary in Israel.	1642722278.0	htizncw	t3_s8ps22	t1_htixl0o	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htizncw/

Maybe Alabama sucks in that sense but there are other states that are much better to live in. I spend half the year in California and the rest in Jeddah where some of my family is. I love both places but I’ll be honest I feel more comfortable in California. I’m just used to it more but Jeddah is great too.   Unfortunately, Arabs are not great to each other and treat non Arabs even worse. Don’t hate on the US trust me there’s a whole lot of other places that are much worse. You will make more money in the US as a doctor and have access to the best and most cutting edge medical advances where you can further your career.   It’s better that you build your future in the US and visit Saudi every few months for umrah and visiting the Prophet’s (PBUH) mosque.

So how can someone who isn’t a semite nor a Jew get the Israeli passport?   “Converts are just as Jewish as any other Jews” Realistically, how many number of Jews agree with you on this? Maybe 200?

2z2k2h4t	Tenuous? It's not tenuous at all. There is significant evidence that Ashkenazi Jews are semitic and genetically speaking are more genetically Israelite than other Jewish groups, but there are groups that are more Israelite than Ashkenazim as well. I know it suits some sort of racist fucked up narrative to separate azhkenazim from Jewishness, I hear it a lot, but there is little evidence to back this nonsense.   This has nothing to do with race, but rather the burden of proof. Ethiopian Jews are not a singular unified group, but rather several distinct ones. One of these groups were Jewish but converted to Christianity centuries ago. They're the ones that are currently having problems with going to Israel. If you cannot prove that you are Jewish, you are not going to be able to make Aliyah. This is most often proven with documentation. These could be conversion documents, bar mitzvah certificates, marriage certificates, circumcision documents, etc.	1642724160.0	htj46cz	t3_s8ps22	t1_htivu7b	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htj46cz/

2z2k2h4t	You are the one coming with a lack of knowledge. Any convert to Judaism can make Aliyah as long as it's from a recognized denomination.   There is no forced sterilization of Ethiopians, that is such an insane conspiracy that had little backing to it. Birth control was given to Ethiopian women who needed it, and it had bad effects. Pfizer was the manufacturer of the birth control and the Israeli government sued them for it. Nobody was permanently sterilized. Why would Israel go through the trouble to bring thousands of Jews to Israel just to sterilize them?   What are you talking about? There are tons of Ethiopians in Israel who have citizenship. The Ethiopians who don't get granted citizenship is because they are a Jewish group who converted to Christianity a long time ago. Claiming Israeli citizenship through Aliyah requires evidence. This means documentation.  How many Jews agree with me? It doesn't even matter. It could be 99% or it could be 1%. Jewish law is VERY clear on conversions and what they mean.   Maybe instead of acting like you know what you're talking about when you're not even a Jew, you do some actually research. Not some idiot's opinion, but actually read Jewish law on conversion.	1642724755.0	htj5l25	t3_s8ps22	t1_htj1xv4	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htj5l25/

Lets say Saudi had an open boarder which grants citizanship to all muslim. You’re not the only who wishes to be in driving proximity to Mecca and Madina my friend. It would be a massive migration wave the likes of which were never recorded in history. Out of all muslim lets say only 1% decide to come to saudi. That is 190 million people moving into the country.

decvz4a6	So first you tell me converts to Jews are just as Jewish and every Jew can get citizenship and now you’re telling me that the Ethiopian Jews aren’t getting citizenship because they were (forcibly) converted to Christianity, even though they have reverted back to Jewish practises. And yet, they aren’t recognised by the ISRAELI GOVERNMENT as Jews. And so cannot come to Israel. You see the problem?   Does this make any sense to you?   Btw how are you telling me I’m not a Jew? Maybe I’m not by religious beliefs, actually most definitely not. However, I’m still more of a semite than you ever will be. There is a good chance my ancestors were Jews, but alhamdulilah we are Muslims now.

2z2k2h4t	Evidence of Jewishness requires documentation when you make Aliyah. All Jews are entitled to make Aliyah. If they no longer have this documentation then they cannot come. These people would need to legally convert to Judaism and have proper documentation in order to do that.   Other African groups who claimed Jewish decent but with no evidence are in the same position. There are rabbis currently in Uganda making conversions so they can come to Israel.   Those who make the effort are being let in and given citizenship. This isn't an issue.   You're probably not a Jew and you having a Jew somewhere in your lineage doesn't mean much. You have no evidence of being Jewish, no documentation of it, so your point is completely meaningless.   >However, I’m still more of a semite than you ever will be.  Ok? Good for you? Jewish law doesn't care about that? Do you think you're somehow superior to others just for being a semite?   >Ever heard of the phrase “Yemeni Jews are the most Jewish of Jews”?  They're in the middle as far as Jewish ancestry goes. This is a claim, and it isn't even really true. Although, their pronunciation of Hebrew is more like that of Tiberian than any other group. I don't make Jewishness into a competition, and it's even more bizarre for non Jews to act as if they have a stake in it.   Not all Yemenis are Jewish in decent. Pretty much all Yemeni Jews left for Israel.  Anyways, maybe do something about your slavery problem before you go around falsely claiming Jews are a bunch of racists.	1642726201.0	htj8zf8	t3_s8ps22	t1_htj7dj2	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htj8zf8/

This means the environment signal our genes . And everything in out environment is associated with an emotion . We have different for our parents for our friends for our pets . Break those emotional bonds you are just freezing your reality by thinking and feeling in the same loop. As soon as u break this chain of emotional bond . You will see there will be a new opening for you and who knows that opening is the door to your happiness.

4oli3wnx	For me, the most feeling that brings me depression is the feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness. These feelings make me feel hopeless then depressed.   The most thing that helped me with that is finding new meaning in my life. What do I really want to be? Why I’m I doing what am I doing? It was not easy for me to answer these questions but I eventually did. I want to be a person who can take care of his family. This is my duty in life. And how can I be that person? By doing what that person will do in his daily life. Like exercising, waking up early, sleeping early, being nice to others, getting work done, or trying to. Each day I do these things, I become closer to the person I want to be or sustain myself as that person. Everything I do every day I relate it to my duty so it doesn’t feel meaningless.  This way of thinking helped me a lot in depression. I’m still not the perfect person I want to be. I still slip here and there, but I’m sure that I will stay on track to fulfill my duty.  I advise you to go to therapy to get a professional help and I hope you good luck with that.	1642727463.0	htjbwjr	t3_s8opt1	t3_s8opt1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8opt1/new_chapter_depression/htjbwjr/

52xcobsh	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the land of the Arabs (hence Arab-ia). If you're not an Arab descending from one of the regions inside the country, nor have the Arabs considered you one of them, then you're not entitled to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia.  Demanding to be a Saudi just because you're Muslim is like a blond man demanding to be a Norwegian just because he's blond, when he doesn't know the language, the costumes, nor the traditions of Norway.  You're welcome to come and visit Makkah and Medina whenever you want to practice islamic duties, but they're Arab lands belonging to Arabs only.

decvz4a6	So Ethiopian Jews just need to convert to Judaism to be allowed to come to Israel? Hahahaha what a huge insult to black Jews. I still remember that Ethiopian Jew in uniform getting beat up by two Jewish cops. What a sad reality for black Jews. Can’t even get citizenship, and the few that do, get treated as second class citizens.   I’m indeed most definitely not a Jew, and I thank God for that.   Being a semite doesn’t make me superior either, contrary to many Jews who believe they are God’s chosen people and therefore superior.   There are indeed very few Yemenite Jews between the period where they were carried to Israel and today. Because, thank God, the vast majority converted to Islam over 1400 years ago. Including my ancestors.   Also, where did I say Jews are racist? Why are you putting words in my mouth? All I did was highlight practises of the Israeli state towards Ethiopian Jews and how Israeli society treats them.   Also, please enlighten me about the slavery problem? What are you referring to?

68i9txgp	They taught me to be generous,  honest, considerate,  consistent, humble, hard working,  and brave. My father taught me to forgive but not forget. To be strong but not harsh. To always support my family . To give charity to poor people. To help the weak and destroy the unjust. I'm who I'm not just because those teachings, but also because of my hard times spent in sorrow.  I went through so much pain and learned from it . That only made me stronger.  I'm proud to be telling who ever reads this comment that the suffering your going through isn't going to last, look at as a lesson you will learn. Set your goals and go for them like I did to mine. I'm a dad of a 1 year old beautiful daughter and a loving husband. I'm doing my masters in the UK as I am a lecturer in a university, which was my first step to achieve one of my goals in life. I am happy and I hope you're happy too. If not, don't worry,  you'll find your happiness eventually.  I don't know really why I'm writing this much, maybe just to tell there's always hope.  Maybe there's someone who needed to be told that things will be OK. Whatever reason it is, make sure you always put your health and happiness first.

9o3ducxx	It is normal if it’s because of the new changes, the job, stress and anxiety that comes with it.. But, no matter what’s the reason or cause of this feeling.. don’t accept it, don’t let it settle and try to bury it..  Trust me that doesn’t work at all and one day you’ll fall even deeper and you won’t be able to do anything about it   So.. my advice is, don’t let it get worse.. sit down with yourself and think of what’s really causing this? If you can’t figure it out it’s okay too just work on yourself and enjoy the little things.. read or check out videos of people with similar experiences and if thinking about it make you feel worse, don’t.. Cause if you do and you keep doing it, it becomes a bigger problem and a part of your life and thoughts and worsens your mental health.   Remember that your not alone.. There’s always a light and a solution for every person. Your job is to figure it out.   Reach out to a therapist if you feel like you tried everything and it didn’t work.. Don’t take antidepressants or anxiety medicine unless you’re sure it is the problem and don’t start with a strong type of medicine especially if it’s addictive like benzodiazapines. And please don’t try smoking and experiementing with drugs cause that’s just a temporary solution that f*cks up your life for good.   Hope this helped and remember that only you can really fix this in the end.. So stick to god, pray for better days and take it one step at a time.   Don’t forget to enjoy the little things!	1642729404.0	htjge2q	t3_s8opt1	t3_s8opt1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8opt1/new_chapter_depression/htjge2q/

3rvj6xwa	Israel has only been a country since the late 1900s. Saudi Arabia has been established much longer, and not based on religion as much as the tribal families that lived in the region. There’s multiple countries with majority Muslim population, why do you feel entitled to go to Saudi just because you’re Muslim? That’s like someone saying they can move to Vatican City because they’re Catholic, or to Rome because they’re pagan. It’s also completely normal to learn a countries language when you immigrate there. You have to at least be willing to learn.   I’m confused as to why you think you deserve a Saudi citizenship simply because you’re Muslim. That sounds very entitled and definitely invalidating of the fact that SA is it’s own place with its own culture.	1642730110.0	htji0du	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htji0du/

Go to the north of the central region and you find Sudair, Tumair, Majma'aah, and go north far enough and you hit Ha'il, which all good places to stargaze. I saw the 2012 Leonid meteor shower in Sudair.  The south also has high elevation and lots of places to stargaze from. I am not knowledgeable enough on it to recommend an area.    If you dont care about elevation and want something relatively close, and have a reliable 4x4 vehicle, there's the area between Uqayr port in Al Ahsaa and the Salwa area on the border with Qatar.

g5egxu1u	All i can say is, i can see your intentions as pure and you want good. The way you see it as a westerner with some what high standard of living and you think its straight forward to gain a citizenship its just not like that. Saudi arabia is the richest muslim country in the world, imagine if they said we are giving away free citizenship to everybody ? What would happen? .   I have lived in saudi and these arguments always comes from people from europe/US they have alot of passion and love but do not know the reality of the situation in saudi. The mentality is just way different for you to even think about gaining citizenship, if you only knew ! Then comparing jews moving to israel to muslims moving to saudi just think about what you wrote carefully.	1642735287.0	htjtwfg	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htjtwfg/

qe1og8x	I hope you get over this terrible state very soon. But I have to say there is misconception that getting a degree and have a decent job is the most important thing in life, but it is not.    Try to do things that are meaningful outside of your job. For women, they are more social and emotional, try to spend more time with family/friends.     And it can also be a sign to get married if you are not yet. Islam emphasize on importance of marriage, it could the thing that is missing.	1642735385.0	htju4dk	t3_s8opt1	t3_s8opt1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8opt1/new_chapter_depression/htju4dk/

fnhfqcdj	Lmao NGL as a South Asian muslim I would never go to Saudi other than for Haj or Umrah. It is important to me only because of the Hejaz. Idk maybe my family should make Haj before start  normalising with Isr@el like their friend UAE. To all my fellow South Asian muslims,they aren't what you think they are(also add extreme racism towards others,idk who their stupid scholars think they are before calling others slaves and second class muslims,when in reality if Saudi doesn't have money they are nothing more than dessert roming bedouins,idk where this pride comes from), they won't do shit for any of us for the islamic cause,their only cause is money. They sold their brothers in Palestine and Yemen,you think they'll care about us and our problems? Just make your religious visit and come back,if you want to make money, Canada is a much better option(they give you PR). If you're making hijra there,I'm sorry my friend you're making a huge mistake(they probably won't even let you stay without a job). You should rather move to Houston or Illinois,their you can practice better by living among muslim communities.

Tho nowadays many gyms have coaches and many will provide you with a diet plan and a training plan. tho imo, youtube has many great videos regarding these subjects. Jaxblade, Alpha destiny, and geoffrey verity schofield all have great contant regarding the subject. Just make sure you stay away from the fake naturals and people who are even open about their use of steroids. Their training is different from you and will only set unattainable expectations	1642748701.0	htkj3pt	t3_s835dl	t3_s835dl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s835dl/what_do_you_do_first_when_going_to_the_gym_for/htkj3pt/

Cannot sleep at night if they don’t express their hatred to the country on the daily, simply for existing, under the cover of being concerned about the state of our “ummah”  Yet they are the same ones immigrating to the US and UK, willing paying taxes that supports anti “ummah” causes.  It can tell you that KSA is moving in the right direction and it REALLY UPSET THEM to say the least.  Stay where you are. We don’t want you.

I am sure if I have pushed harder I’d have gotten more  way faster but I was following a career path I set for myself and didn’t want to jump jobs so fast.

I noticed a lot of my Saudi colleagues are spending theirs on things already provided at work (meals from fast food restaurants while work is giving them a meal on duty) or coffee from starbucks or whatever then they have a coffee maker in the office etc. All those expenses will eat up a 4k salary very quickly.	1642750782.0	htkm1z0	t3_s8ggdu	t1_htklnyd	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ggdu/anyone_else_feels_that_the_salaries_of_young/htkm1z0/

Don’t bother saying it’s for the holy cities, you can visit Makkah or Medina, but don’t ask for citizenship, Saudi ARABIA isn’t a caliphate it’s a kingdom for arabs that lived here for centuries, if you come to Makkah or Medina you’ll be welcome to stay, if you work here you’ll be treated well and will be welcome to stay, but don’t expect citizenship	1642758354.0	htkvzhz	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htkvzhz/

Also I took into consideration the Saudi culture,  if a guy works for that amount or there about and goes to ask for someone's daughter's hand in marriage, he most likely won't be accepted.

in9ns	Why do you think that being a Muslim means that you have an ideological right to settle in Saudi Arabia?   This land belongs to the Saudi Arabs, the descendants of those who inhabited it before and after Islam. There are those who obtained citizenship later, but their Islam was not the reason. You view Saudi Arabia from the scope of a colonial person with a mentality (all countries in the world should be open to immigrants) and since you happen to be muim now you think of yourself as above other expats well guess what you are not. As a Saudi, I find your mentality absurd and unreasonable. There are no countries in the world founded on the basis that it is a country for a religion other than Pakistan and Israel. As for Saudi Arabia, it is a land for its people, regardless of our religion and while the majority of us are muslims it doesn't mean that we're obligated to naturalise billions of muslims like yourself, we're different even if we share the same religion, we have our Arab identity, our culture, our history and our inheritance for a thousand years and more. I find this notion of why don't you Saudis give all muslims the nationality ridiculous to say the least, no one is asking Italians to naturalise all Christian catholics. Be reasonable.   I hope you now know the reason why we are a country that does not accept these ridiculous suggestions.	1642763282.0	htl26h7	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htl26h7/

cd3e3w9l	"Less racist in Alabama".  Are you serious?  Imagine you start looking for a Saudi citizenship and the first thing you do is spit on the country law.  If your intentions are based on the idea of doing hijra then Saudi Arabia is not the only muslim country (Daar Al Islam). This is important regarding Allah because it is not the same wanting to live in a Muslim country or specifically requesting living in Saudi Arabia. One is true hijra because you want to fulfill your religion, the other is more than that: you reject the other countries and you either go to Saudi Arabia (or let's say any rich country in middle east) or you stay in the non muslim country you are currently in (which therefore make the intention other than hijra).  If you want to be part of Saudi Arabia and contribute to the society, it's not a good idea to talk dirty about country laws, as your act contradicts your goal.  If you want to be near Madinah and Mekkah, you should know that people that get to these holy cities are chosen by Allah. Just because you are muslim does not entitle you to live there, or even go there. And living in Saudi Arabia is not the only path to go there. One solution, which is the most common one, is asking Allah for having the financial abilities to go there whenever you want.  You know your intentions but you also need to be honest with yourself: Why Saudi Arabia?   You are not alone with this goal. I am sure that among muslims in the world the most wanted citizenship is Saudi citizenship (regardless of why). I am one of them. I am currently working (on the path to get a living permit), it is hard but the path exists and I pray Allah everyday to fulfill the goal to citizenship. And I pray Allah and hope the same for you, but you need to be more respectful towards a country you want to live in.	1642765517.0	htl59pl	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htl59pl/

When he visited kingdom for ummrah he loved the Islamic atmosphere so he asked my dad about the citizenship, well everyone know its near to impossible to get one. So my dad told him to try to get a job here and MashaAllah after 6 months he got a good job in a bank and he is living in Jeddah for like 18 years. So why not you try to get a job, not all jobs in the kingdom are "Saudi-exclusive" jobs (as some people say) and expatriates are given Respect and safety, and honestly for me there is no country in the world like Saudi Arabia. It will be worth trying. Good luck brother.	1642765894.0	htl5twj	t3_s8ps22	t3_s8ps22	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htl5twj/

t28x0	I'm an expat but work with Saudi kids.  There are obviously exceptions and some kids are incredibly well mannered and kind, but in general what I see with this generation of Saudi children is a complete lack of manners and compassion for people outside of their family circle, kids that don't even return a good morning, that won't say thank you, or that will even ignore the existence of others.  You don't even need to interact directly with the kids, just look at how loud and rude they are at restaurants and shops, running around and screaming like crazy, throwing products from shelves, and giving dirty looks to strangers. In this country people just brush it off as "kids will be kids" or "kids are a blessing from God so let them be". What these adults are creating is kids without empathy, compassion, or just regular public decency, we sometimes call them "feral kids".  Of course the people commenting here going to say that they were raised well, people don't normally go out admitting that they were raised to be little assholes to strangers, but if we look at how the driving works here, you can see that there is no display of empathy, compassion, or respect for strangers as soon as you get behind the wheel, most parents here forgot about that lesson and people seem to conveniently forget about that detail.	1642766970.0	htl7gvp	t3_s8f8ez	t3_s8f8ez	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8f8ez/as_a_saudi_what_did_your_parents_teach_you_about/htl7gvp/

in9ns	Honestly, I'm Meccan and I don't support this whole mass immigration thing. If i want to visit Sweden or Japan, I want to see the locals not finding them a minority in their own country. Same for us as Arab Saudis from Medina/Mecca. This land is ours, the bond is historical, cultural, not just religious. Many muslims upon leaving Islam will lose their religious bond to Mecca and Medina but we will never lose the bond because it is far more stronger than that. I've known an Iranian muslim who used to say Mecca should be separated from Saudi Arabia and pretty much parroting the same nonsense as the OP after four years he left Islam and became one of those angry exmuslims he then again expressed his thought on Mecca but this time saying that it should be bombed, no exmuslim Saudi Arab would say that. What many muslims fail to understand is that this land belonga to its inhabitants. Being a muslim is not justification to go around claiming that you own this place.	1642771131.0	htleq1s	t3_s8ps22	t1_htkqury	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htleq1s/

The problem here in Saudi, is Saudis want to buy coffees each day, live Apartement by themselves, marry and pay dowry of 50k and marriage expanses of 100k, get villa and bring 6 children and get a maid on non useful govt job. And they think the govt responsibility to fill their fantasies.

3x00m5ob	That's not the problem, the thing is that the Zionist ideology views Judaism as an ethno-religion and Israel is the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. Everybody who has Jewish ancestry or his mother is Jewish can immigrate to Israel and get Israeli citizenship, the thing is everyone who converts to Judaism (which is a very arduous process unlike us in Islam) can also immigrate to Israel and get Israeli citizenship. Important to note Jewish people, who immigrate get tax deductions and get a sweet deal when immigrating.

hgr8pkui	It's simple! The crooked, gangster family of Al-Saud/AlSalool think and treat this land as if it's their very own, and now they have ignited and are feeding off of the racism they ignited in the Saudis to the point of where some Saudis say to other Saudis in a racial remark "WE ARE THE ORIGINAL SAUDIS! WE ARE TRULY, TRULY SAUDIS TO THE CORE!!", forgetting that it is truly only the name of a gangster, dictator family that rules with the might of steel and fire, and any opposer is chopped up and thrown into acid.  AlSaud/AlSalool family feeds off of dividing and conquering the people like this. They don't give a shit about religion, they only care about their thrones, really. They'll lick the boots of the US, Israel, and even the Devil if it means increasing the security and to retain their thrones even by 0.0000001%.

faumwy6r	There are two points that I feel are relevant, would omar tell people from non Muslim lands such as Rome or persia to return after hajj? What you are describing seems some what similar to saudi telling saudi citizens not to return to Riyadh or jeddah after hajj and not stay in Mecca, it doesn't sound the same as telling some one to return to Iran or the USA. Secondly where do you think a migrant would be better off economicly in order: saudi, uae, UK or usa?  Also I think it is true that you would get more migration ofter the oil boom, some just for money but I expect some would be for religious reasons but previously they wouldn't have migrated because of the difficulties involved. The same as it wouldn't surprise me if someone didn't want to migrate to libya, yemen or lebanon right now because of the economic and security situation in those countries. But I admit I don't know how the situation was in saudi pre oil boom compared to the other countries I mentioned.	1642775462.0	htlo45p	t3_s8ps22	t1_htkq26p	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htlo45p/

It takes awareness وعي to accept and acknowledge them to ultimately treat them. May Allah grant you comfort and happiness, sister.

3yemok5	Hello Ghada, first and foremost you must recognize that you have strength, the strength to face this truth, and also the strength to seek help. This is a rare treat on it's own. So, kudos to you for that.   Second, you might be feeling depressed, and it happens for no reason. Like there's something missing, incomplete and unsolved. Along with seeing things in a negative light, feeling the pressure of disappointing others, uncertainty and many other things that trigger you or make you feel lost.   There are amazing therapists out there that will help you to help yourself. They will guide you further in and seek the answer and source to this depression. Therapists will not give you medications at all, they are not authorized to do that. Psychologist also can't give medication, only psychiatrist (دكتور نفسي) who can and might give you medications which I believe in this stage is way too early.   I know couple of good therapist, and I know one that's online who's really great. Reply or DM me with which city you live in, and I'll do my best to get you someone who'll be very helpful to you.   And like the first comment has declared, reddit is not a good place to get advices on mental health, but still, the step you took to seek help is admirable.	1642777717.0	htltna3	t3_s8opt1	t3_s8opt1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8opt1/new_chapter_depression/htltna3/

Their great-grandchildren are now being born here in Saudi Arabia, some of whom are Saudi citizens (due to being born to Saudi fathers).

faumwy6r	I don't think anyone has a problem with telling people to go back home after hajj, millions of people come for hajj and if they all just stayed it would ruin saudi. So I feel this athar is possibly being used wrong, a more accurate  one would be if you could find omar telling a Yemeni that came to madina outside of hajj  that he can't stay. Also from what I can tell the athar is talking about people from Muslim lands so it doesn't seem right to use it to talk about people from non Muslim lands. Also the athar seems to be talking about people from one state  so they are all under the same ruler, its not like some one trying to move from Syria because they don't want to live under bashar Al asad.   Basically nothing about the athar seems to have anything to do with the issue being discussed except on the most simplistic level.   In the end I don't understand the issue, some Saudis complain about people asking for handouts or that they would be a burden etc. I don't know if I am missing something or they are being disingenuous, saudi and any other Muslim nation doesn't need to give them handouts, they could just open up citizenship for muslims  with stable income, a fixed amount of savings, beneficial skills, high education, who have been vetted to make sure you aren't letting in extremists  and so on.   If the issue is a matter of economics and security then there are clear ways to fix that, but if its just simply not wanting people who are not saudi by ethnicity  to live in saudi then they can be upfront about that and not muddy the waters. If that's the case then Allah knows best if its ok to block Muslims from living in Muslim countries because of ethnicity, I haven't seen any scholar talk on the matter so I won't attack anyone for having that view but if it turns out it was oppression then I can collect in the afterlife insha Allah.	1642779843.0	htlz662	t3_s8ps22	t1_htlqzq1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htlz662/

170i3r	There is a program now to give citizenship to remarkable people    I think personally my issue with the post is, why single out saudi arabia, why would you demand saudi arabia to give muslims citizenship why not turkey for example, or why not the countries that those emmigrants originated from, why must saudi arabia aoldly bare the burden of muslims.   I think what you mentioned regarding the complaints originated from a rhetoric that has recently emerged from arab and muslim countries that the oil in saudi arabia should go to all Muslims  Or that the revenue from hajj should go to all Muslims.    Which is disingenuous of you consider that in 1919 when tha famine hit saudi arabia no government from those Islamic countries helped them. Or when king abdulaziz called on a Islamic congress to discuss the cost of renovating the holy mosque in mecca. They convened and argued about who should be in charge of the hajj and left without providing financial aid to renovate the holy mosque   And when we were blessed with the oil and invested hundreds of billions of dollars in mecca  which led to the fact thay the hajj  was generating revenue. Some people from neighbouring countries started to claim that it was OUR money not only for saudi arabia	1642781160.0	htm2mhj	t3_s8ps22	t1_htlz662	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htm2mhj/

Not only you're the typical Islamist moron but you're also parroting the typical anti-Saudi propaganda here.You know absolutely nothing, so stop acting like an expert when you're just a sour loser.  You didn't make it about your skill in the main question, it was all about your religion, you kept parroting that same old I'm muslim, gimme citizenship and let me live in your land or else you're racist. Well guess what, you're not special person for being muslim. You're actually the tribalist/racist here for implying that being a muslim is the most important thing.   The best most respected community in Saudi Arabia are Filipinos. They're not muslims, they're hard workers, respect the law/the local culture/people. Whilst those who always brag about their Islam are the top 5 criminal nationalities so again being muslim is not an expertise. Keep your religion to yourself.

faumwy6r	I'll put a disclaimer first, I haven't checked with a scholar what the actual Islamic ruling is, but I lean towards it being at least good if not a duty for every Muslim country to assist Muslims who live in the west with no citizenship in any Muslim country to move to get a citizenship in some Muslim country. Yes I'm including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi  etc. As for the handouts, aside from free heath heathcare what is there? And you could always fix this by limiting immigration to people with a stable income, savings, education and so on.   If your issue is people taking advantage of saudi then there are things that can be done to fix that, if your issue is you don't want non Saudis living in saudi then be upfront about it.  And for your second point, I could understand a Shia saudi thinking that Iran should take him in and I could understand a sunni Iranian thinking that sunni nations should take him in and I could understand a salafi from a non salafi country thinking saudi should take him in.	1642786255.0	htmgf0m	t3_s8ps22	t1_htmcuau	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htmgf0m/

faumwy6r	"There is a program now to give citizenship to remarkable people"  Alhamdulillah, sounds like a step in the right direction.   "I think personally my issue with the post is, why single out saudi arabia, why would you demand saudi arabia to give muslims citizenship why not turkey for example, or why not the countries that those emmigrants originated from, why must saudi arabia aoldly bare the burden of muslims. "  I agree that if saudi has a duty to take in muslims then why shouldn't the other Muslim countries. But I do think that it is understandable that if someone is leaving a western country for Islamic reasons then it makes sense that their top country  to migrate to would be saudi due to Mecca and madina and because saudi is the closest countries to an ideal Islamic system I think.  "I think what you mentioned regarding the complaints originated from a rhetoric that has recently emerged from arab and muslim countries that the oil in saudi arabia should go to all Muslims Or that the revenue from hajj should go to all Muslims."  If all muslims have some right over saudi oil then it would make sense that all muslims have some right over Qatari gass and Egyptian money from the sueze canal. And I don't see why all muslims should have a special right over hajj revenues, but I do see the argument people make about putting laws in place so hajj doesn't become too expensive but maybe those laws are already in place.   "Which is disingenuous of you consider that in 1919 when tha famine hit saudi arabia no government from those Islamic countries helped them. Or when king abdulaziz called on a Islamic congress to discuss the cost of renovating the holy mosque in mecca. They convened and argued about who should be in charge of the hajj and left without providing financial aid to renovate the holy mosque  And when we were blessed with the oil and invested hundreds of billions of dollars in mecca which led to the fact thay the hajj was generating revenue. Some people from neighbouring countries started to claim that it was OUR money not only for saudi arabia"   I think you will find that some people are opportunistic and jealous of saudi.	1642787355.0	htmjfqr	t3_s8ps22	t1_htm2mhj	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htmjfqr/

faumwy6r	I can't speak for him, but it is a no brainer why someone looking to migrate for Islamic reasons would pick saudi, mecca, madina, government system that is probably the closest to and ideal Islamic system in the world, no war on its land(many westerners picked yemen precisely because of shaykh muqbil and dammaj but had to leave because of the war), salafis in particular would pick saudi because of the scholars etc.  If they were just after money why not go usa, Canada, UK, uae?	1642794750.0	htn3j1k	t3_s8ps22	t1_htkvzhz	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htn3j1k/

xjwme	I’m sure you know Tawakalna is only in Saudi and the conversation was about a shortcut for it. so clearly by your initial comment you meant by majority in Saudi not the world or else why would anyone outside of Saudi use it. And of course no one said iPhones are the only option but you never having one or never buying one doesn’t make you the majority just go to any public place or gathering and ask how many use iPhones and you’ll have your answer. Sure iPhones are overpriced but in my opinion while trying other OS’s I think IOS is superior.	1642797515.0	htnb5mn	t3_s9aqeh	t1_htmvizq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9aqeh/fun_fact_tawakalna_keeps_track_of_your_location/htnb5mn/

The fact that it common in Saudi mostly social as we are more of a tend following culture. I.e what are most people buying just copy them. I am not a majority but the point is I can vouch for Android format as it is a more versatile easy to use format.

I'm of the opinion that it atheist good if not a duty for them to assist muslims in non Muslim lands to move to an Islamic country. One way for saudi would be to only accept people with a specific level of income, savings, education, skills etc. They could also decrease the social benefits for new citizens for a generation or two to make sure its not people coming in to take advantage.	1642801921.0	htnnfnd	t3_s8ps22	t1_htnm469	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s8ps22/why_can_any_jew_move_and_gain_citizenship_to/htnnfnd/

me29pux	My experience was quite a while back but I remember that the universities in the central region (aka Najd) had a unified, centralized platform where you can apply to multiple institutions. Otherwise, it is more typical to find each university with its own website.  Each university has its own enrollment dates and you can usually find a website that makes lists for those dates.   Check each uni’s system. Some might accept you in the program and require you to finish preparatory year, but the majority would accept you for their prep year and you get to compete on seats according to your performance. Having decent English is very helpful. Acquiring IELTS or TOEFL would help reduce the load if you could apply for the English curriculum exemption.	1642811695.0	htocmtt	t3_s82vy9	t3_s82vy9	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s82vy9/i_want_to_be_a_doctor/htocmtt/

My advice from someone who have been healed fully from a hell of depression/anxiety and trauma through my entire 27 years life ( you have a job now so try to spend your income on things that will improve your mental/physical health such as healthy supplements, a gym membership, visiting multiple therapists, going to social event’s thats you like and so on )  Try to stay around positive people and keep in mind we are human’s and we’re not supposed to feel good all the time , our hormones and brain chemicals control’s us but we still can feel peace either ways with practice and time .

8o3vdgcw	Salaam. I'm planning to do Umrah Insh'Allah from Canada and I have a layover in Cairo for 8.5 hours. I am fully vaccinated with a third booster. Of course, I will be getting a PCR test done as well approx. 36 hours before my departure. I was thinking of leaving the Cairo airport to check out Pyramids but concerned about whether I would need to get PCR test again to be able to fly to Jeddah after and not having to quarantine. Can I confirm that you actually had to get PCR again just because you had a layover in Cairo even though you were fully vaccinated and your PCR was still within the 72 hour window to your flight to Jeddah from Cairo?

27t9p3s1	 In addition to any visa and quarantine requirements as applicable to you and your country of residence, you need to register on the Muqeem platform up to 72 hours before arrival in the Kingdom. Upon arrival in the Kingdom it’s mandatory to download the Tawakalna app within 8 hours. You should then be able to book a slot for Umrah through the app. You could also try the Eatmarna app for booking an Umrah slot.  Slots are normally made available a week in advance and if you would like to go during peak times (e.g. Thurs night/Friday) try and book a slot timeously as these slots tend to fill up quickly. May you have an accepted Umrah and remember us in your duas.	1642833752.0	htpo8my	t3_s9qyxc	t3_s9qyxc	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9qyxc/can_you_perform_umrah_on_a_business_trip/htpo8my/

Not everything has to be fair rn, everyone will get their share of punishment that they deserve in jahanam, maybe i didnt get my punishment by law now, because its not perfect but i will get it later from allah, sadly people only think about this life and not the one after.	1642842263.0	htq0zan	t3_s9y84k	t3_s9y84k	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9y84k/reddit/htq0zan/

hy5wxagx	That's not how it works. You're making it seem as if Islam is subjective and open to interpretation.  It's not. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم told us to follow the first three generations of Muslims. So, the Quran and Sunnah should be understood with the interpretation of the Salaf. This is objective.

aqcjn	This is the best and most helpful answer. We came on a tourist visa, filled in the muqeem, downloaded tawakkalna (it won't work until you get to Saudi) and then also got the eatmarna app. I highly recommend getting the eatmarna app, it was very was to use. We never booked through tawakkalna. There are some restrictions, Rawdah at Masjid Nabawi in Medina can only be visited once every 30 days (they don't tell you this before you book). Umrah can technically only be booked once every 10 days, but sometimes there is some glitch and people qere able to go in a shorter time period (pr maybe just a Gift). But you are able to pray at Makkah any time you want by booking through the app. Always carry your passport and visa with you, but they never checked us.	1642845066.0	htq4sgc	t3_s9qyxc	t1_htpo8my	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9qyxc/can_you_perform_umrah_on_a_business_trip/htq4sgc/

It's not a surprise that you notice them and you did not notice straight guys because they want to attract you, get your attention and makes you look at them by their behavior. That's what they are trying to do.  Unlike straight guys they won't try to get your attention and you won't notice if they exist  But let me tell you something may shockyou.

You can make your own Customs Declaration (at your own risk, just add insurance fee as an add on to be safe) so you will pay less Customs Tax. Lets say original price is like 1000 USD and you just declare 600 USD, you will only pay the customs tax you declared.        Free 6 months storage locker.        Free pictures of your items in your locker.        You can purchase addons 5 usd each (take pictures of the contents of your purchase, test your purchased products if working properly or not, double sided packaging, clear plastic sheet on your final package)        Choose your desired forwarder ( FedEx, DHL and other shipping companies) to ship to your address.

gbmunb6b	OMG, I'm from a different Arabic country ( Libya ) and I've noticed the same as you , I've always wondered why,  here in Libya most of the Filipino I've met are feminine, I swear to god I'm not exaggerating at all, I always said to myself, maybe it's just cultural differences, but I've met Filipino who are very straight.  Another reason is that the  vast majority of Filipino who came in our country start working as nurses in the hospitals( is it the same in saudi arabia ? ), which is a female predominant job, and one of the careers that many gays choose to pursue worldwide " even the Arabs ". One of the stereotypes about men who work as a nurse is being feminine, which is relatively true!    not all of them though.  &#x200B;  صاحب المنشور ماقال حاجة عنصرية، هو فقط يسأل لماذا تتواجد هذه الظاهرة ! ووضح وجهة نظره، ابتعدوا عن المثاليات، كل شيء قابل للنقاش والراجل وضح انه لايقصد العنصرية ولا يعمم	1642850875.0	htqcroe	t3_s9yt5s	t3_s9yt5s	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9yt5s/filipino_men_in_saudigcc/htqcroe/

As a Filipino (woman) myself, I've met and worked with some fellow Filipinos here and based from experience they are the most alpha males that I've met, not to mention homophobic, misogynists and just plain racists.

6wsipvth	Actually similar thing happened to me but with Zain. When I purchased the 5g router which came with a free unlimited one month internet. I used it for a month and stopped. They black listed me cuz I didn't renew the contract. I didnt even know that but when I wanted to close the line, they said I was black listed for not paying the contract.   Told them I didn't even renew to begin with. In the end they unblock me.   My best tip is he goes to another branch and ask another employee.  Just as they black listed him, they can remove him from the black list.	1642855938.0	htqkecm	t3_s9fhji	t1_htpocnm	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9fhji/stc_blacklisted/htqkecm/

2wo1z4po	governments don't fear their populations, governments respect and protect their populations.  the Tawakkalna app is a good app overall, you have your ID and driving license automatically in it, removing the need for wallets, it helps track where you are if you were in the case of an emergency, and as an idea, it is great.  but since the technology hasn't advanced as much as this Tawakalna app needs, this means that to use it properly with all of its functions, your battery will be depleted so quick you can't even get to enjoy your phone, so while the idea is great, the implementation is lackluster.  maybe we could wait a few years for a technology that would achieve every pro in the tawakalna app without any cons, or just wait until the covid pandemic is over and just delete the app.	1642861309.0	htqu91d	t3_s9zxcz	t1_htqpat3	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9zxcz/god_bless_android/htqu91d/

2wo1z4po	I mean, of course, tell me an example of a Saudi who doesn't want to be tracked, and his reason isn't "battery drain".  we arent American SJW, crying over anything and everything, so let us be real, when do you not want to be tracked?  I have heard of dozens of examples where being tracked actually helped the person, whether it was on a medical emergency, when in a dangerous situation, calling the police, and so on and so forth.  so unless the person is a criminal, I cant think of a reason when someone doesn't want to be tracked for "non-battery related" reasons.	1642865333.0	htr31lb	t3_s9zxcz	t1_htr2e6l	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9zxcz/god_bless_android/htr31lb/

2wo1z4po	yes, you are right, there are people who don't want to be tracked, but when I think about it logically, being tracked is good, the positives outweigh the negatives, but you are right, there are people who don't want to be tracked no matter what, even if it is against logic sometimes.	1642865603.0	htr3o9w	t3_s9zxcz	t1_htr3fwc	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9zxcz/god_bless_android/htr3o9w/

7zqpj2gi	I'd say I'm pretty good at dealing with the heat, here are some of my tips: * Fill a jug up with water, put it in the fridge and use that water to shower or really whenever you feel hot. * Try using a fan instead of an AC * Buy sprayer thingy that sprays liquid, I don't know how to explain it, like a windex bottle lol. Fill it up with water and spray yourself whenever you feel hot, extra points if you leave the water in the fridge. * Buy long shorts so that you can cool off while staying halal (this is mainly works for guys, as for girls I guess maybe this works at home) * Cover excess windows that do nothing but make you sweat more	1642866455.0	htr5p0v	t3_s9z6sg	t3_s9z6sg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9z6sg/what_are_your_tips_and_tricks_for_staying_cool/htr5p0v/
83peyuju	I wear wool socks. Hear me out. I don’t wear sandals, only sneakers.   Cotton socks make my fear sweat regardless.  Wool socks wick sweat away and they stay dry.

6wlbhuxz	Best suggestion I can give (Unfortunately not everyone is comfortable doing this) is getting a very short trim and going bald for the summer. Trust me when you put some water in that shiny scalp, it feels like you are in wonderland........Winter Wonderland maybe(Sorry)  Other than that, wear cotton and loose clothes. Walk or workout in the morning so that you can get rid of some heat qnd you feel cooler during the day.

4jxcvzrs	Whether you leave to see the pyramids or not, you will be required to get 2 pcr tests and do a 5 day quarantine. Saudi has Egypt as a red zone so if you're flying through there they require the added quarantine and pcr test. And it doesn't matter that you have your vaccine/booster up to date.  To be able to get the PCR test you would need to make an appointment through the "hunger station" app and they'll come to your hotel and do the test.  I would honestly try to see if you can switch flights to see if you can fly into a different country for a layover or just fly into Medina or Jeddah as a direct flight. Because when they make you quarantine you have to be quarantined.    Check this website for updates on Saudi Covid travel rules/guidelines for countries.  https://www.saudia.com/before-flying/travel-information/travel-requirements-by-international-stations  Once you get there assume you will be on your own. No one at MOH or tawakkalna hot line are any help.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

a3cnr2j0	Not really. Once I remember some foreigners went straight to Makkah. They were so mesmerized that they accepted Islam.   I was once travelling with German (Christian/Jews) consultants to Madinah for a project. This was in 2010, they were so nervous that even the boarding agent didn’t know if non muslims were allowed or not. Anyways after reaching Madinah they went very close to the Haram as the project was near by.	1642882606.0	htsag11	t3_saauic	t3_saauic	/r/saudiarabia/comments/saauic/does_anyone_check_if_youre_muslim_or_not_in_the/htsag11/

me29pux	The fatwas I mentioned are typically different takes on the same verse. The verse states that non muslims should not get near this holy mosque. The ambiguous part is “get near”. Some went to say that was relative to migration and settling, while passing by is okay. Others included passing, and referred to get near as in physically. They take examples from how the prophet behaved back then, like stopping non muslim traders outside of Makkah and let whoever wanted their goods to go to them instead.   Deciding on variation you think is right is your duty to accomplish.

me29pux	Wrong again. First, the Quran did only mention the holy mosque, but it has used it before to refer to the region rather than the exact location of the mosque. If you look up the verse of ascension, you’ll find the Quran says that the prophet was sent from “the holy mosque to the Aqsa mosque (in Jerusalem)”. The prophet wasn’t exactly in the holy mosque when he left for Jerusalem, so it refers to the region. The region is referred to in Arabic as “Al Haram (Almakki)” (aka The Bounds (of Makkah)). Those bounds are defined in hadeeth and include the majority of current day Makkah, but not all.   Secondly, when it comes to Medina you’re not wrong. I was not aware of it until now. Supposedly, Medina is not banned for non Muslims. It shares some aspects of the holy lands like the banning of hunt and woodcutting, but in Islam is open to non Muslims. As a matter of fact, the prophet pbuh died while his shield was mortgaged to a Jew. So, I don’t have enough understanding of the current ban from Medina tbh to form an opinion yet.	1642906403.0	httvs3t	t3_saauic	t1_httedo2	/r/saudiarabia/comments/saauic/does_anyone_check_if_youre_muslim_or_not_in_the/httvs3t/
dtdp24gl	To be honest it depends on the person and the vibe she gives off, for example if she seems to be friendly small talk is ok. A lot of the women here unconsciously set boundaries with the opposite sex so if you're great at reading the atmosphere you're good to go. And in case you see any of them out in public it's best to pretend you didn't see them because it might put them in a difficult situation with their families (Better safe than sorry).	1642906506.0	httvzzu	t3_sahuf0	t3_sahuf0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/httvzzu/

96mv7oz9	First, i will say once you have children you don't want to raise them in environment where disbelief and sin is rampant - if you want to raise your children on the faith that's not the environment for it. Second, even before you have kids, you should strive always for what's good , not necessarily what's easy or hard, and attempt to earn allah's approval in everything you do - and you don't necessarily want to be tested on your faith. If living in America allows you to earn a much better income than overseas and with that income you can support your family and donate much of it to starving muslims overseas, then there's good in that (but if it's merely to hoard wealth or waste it on luxuries then that's not the right path to take). If you can also at the same time be a good role model as what islam looks like, for example by helping your neighbors (smile, greet them, shovel their driveway, give them gifts, invite them over for dinners) and spread dawah to people who are receptive of it then there's even greater good in that.  So living in a country like America can be better or it can be worse for you, it can bring you closer to Allah or further - depending on your actions. For most unfortunately it is worse for them.  قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّىٰهَا  وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّىٰهَا	1642910928.0	htu5z7o	t3_s5uiw0	t1_hte54sc	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s5uiw0/american_looking_to_move_to_saudi_arabia_near/htu5z7o/

989v8bre	I'm an expat in Riyadh.  I agree with the comments that say you should judge the 'vibe' of the person. It is ok to speak to a woman if you need to (e.g. if they left their card in an ATM). I would avoid small talk if you see a woman in a supermarket etc. It just puts them in a slightly uncomfortable position. Of course if they initiate it that's fine.  I know some Saudi women who wear a veil in front of Saudi men but not in front of me (a Western man).   In the workplace most of my female colleagues are very friendly. I avoid asking if they are married or about their family circumstances. Other than that I'm fairly open once I get to know them (I've asked if they have drank alcohol, ate pork etc - many have on foreign trips).	1642915240.0	htufb33	t3_sahuf0	t3_sahuf0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/htufb33/

3jjwqxxe	KSA has significantly changed. It is not as conservative and gender segregated as it used to be. In fact, many coffee shops and restaurants no longer have a segregation between "singles" (males) and "families" (females or families). That being said, KSA is not as "open" as Western culture.  It's good that your conscious and don't want to offend or intrude on anyone. In my company, many Saudi males and females work together, chat about life, and have lunch together, whether in groups or one-on-one. But of course every institution is different and also every person is different (a female friend of mine who works in a different place which has a different environment) . My advice would be for you to initially be formal, then feel the vibe and atmosphere of the place you are in and the people you are dealing with, and become chill as the place you are in.	1642926104.0	htuwgq1	t3_sahuf0	t3_sahuf0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/htuwgq1/

For example, we used to have a female employee who I can have a good conversation like food cravings (coz she's pregnant that time), culture differences, some photo editing, etc..

10udxe	FYI about the last line you wrote - you will likely make some people uncomfortable if you start asking them about things which are sins in Islam. Even if they have done it, a Muslim is not supposed to reveal their sins to others.

oiu2v5p	I read the transcript. I don't agree with anything he said about America being great but everything he said about Saudi Arabia is true.   The best king Saudi Arabia had imo was King Khalid but his reign was also the shortest 🥺. He increased government worker's salary, he improved healthcare and education in Saudi Arabia and so much more. Life of citizens and foreign workers living in Saudi Arabia greatly improved during his reign (no tax, no dependent fee back then). We may not have cinemas or concerts back then but at least living was more comfortable and affordable. His reign was called Saudi Golden Era or the Era of goodness.

Don't start spreading so called democracy as if you're Bush Blair. We have less deaths over here and more cohesiveness and that's just our general take on things. In the Micro Matters you're western democracies are dying and the so called "theocracy" is doing just fine. You're nothing but another strain of the pretend to be an anarchist but really a rich mans tool for colonial oppression. In other words stop peddling your rubbish around the world so you can do what you've done in Rwanda and DRC! We have had enough of your hypocrisy and cheap propaganda.      I offer this as a challenge if your system works so well how come Sakosy Bojo and Trump have all held the highest offices in their lands.   &#x200B;  Face it ! you are offered a shitty choice by those in power to make you feel you have choice and power whilst you get robbed blind! Who paid for the 30Bn track and trace? Or the contract went to Randox !      Behave Son ! I would rather have testing paid for by the government here and traced effectively and low death rates that being robbed blind and told that i can't attend my granny's funeral because of covid but Johnson  and co can have a boozey do. that i live with that indignation because of a vote i don't use because lets face it 50% of the electoral regularly don't !      Therefore before so called western freedoms get waved in the faces of other countries do a Michael Jackson and   &#x200B;  Start with the man in the Mirror!  &#x200B;  I wonder  will you !	1642930946.0	htv2ow2	t3_s9zxcz	t1_htqpat3	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9zxcz/god_bless_android/htv2ow2/

ezvixq1l	honestly good for you man. for us it cut out constantly for 2w straight. i called time and time again, but nobody bothered to answer, and when they did, they said they'll send a technician which never came. another instance of my shit experience.  i called customer support, asked them to change the contact details where they send SMS to, provided iqama and new contact number. next day, i get a text message on the OLD number. horrible experience.   not to mention, the salesman lying to us saying, 'oh you can cancel after a month if u don't like it, you get 1 month free' the part about us getting a month free is true BUT i called up to cancel, they said that this is simply not true, and that we're locked into a 1 year contract. poor experience, plus around dhuhr time speed goes to shit. sorry if i ranted on for too long	1642938830.0	htvcy4z	t3_s66rfd	t1_hthkuwn	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s66rfd/best_internet_provider_in_saudi/htvcy4z/

i07wdwwu	Welcome to Saudi Arabia. I’ll be direct to the point: small talk is fine in a professional manner. Smiling is also fine, however don’t be the flirty type. I know if you are a dignified individual you will respect a woman’s values. I believe you will fit in like anyone else as long as you are doing your job professionally. A teacher you say? Well, students- male and female- schools are separated, therefore, you needn’t worry about encountering female faculty.

15zclwm8	If your intention is only to get into Islam for marriage, that’s a weak foundation for what you’re about to build, and eventually, what you’ll demolish later.   My advice to you is to ask her to teach you about Islam. You’ll accomplish two things:  1- learning about the religion. 2- bonding and spending time together.  She’s looking hoping one day you’ll lead her in her daily prayers, don’t disappoint.

he6u07j5	I moved to Riyadh two weeks ago from Eastern Province and I really hate driving here too!  Another problem is the obviously terrible infrastructure, forcing people to slow down suddenly, make rapid lane changes and all sorts of sudden moves.

2wo1z4po	I also went to international school about 12 years ago, I remember the classes were segregated between genders, but all women including boys from kindergarten to grade three can interact with each other outside of class since their classes are close to each other and don't need complete separation, but once the boys get older (grade 4+), they are moved to a completely different side of the school where you cannot interact with the other gender.  &#x200B;  but I am talking about American schools, I hear they run American tests (SAT), European tests (AP tests and classes), their curriculum is 100% English, they have after school activities like clubs and whatnot, but they are expensive AF, I hear 1 year for a kindergarten in 70K riyals.	1642954545.0	htw736h	t3_sahuf0	t1_htw6egz	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/htw736h/

2wo1z4po	LMAO  when you talk about approaching strangers, do you mean you are planning to get married this way (dating)? or is it just small talk to strangers?  >!the advice I'm about to give you is from a fellow introvert to another, so i still haven't figured out the secret to communication lol!<  for small talk with complete strangers, then it is ok, as long as you have something to say like if she forgot her wallet, forgot her order, forgot something or anything that would come out as natural when talking rather than creepy.  if you are planning to get married not the traditional way, then you could join clubs or places where they have the same interests as you, you know, social clubs, whether it was a stand-up comedy, board games, anime conventions, or coffee culture, or anything else.  remember tho, you are not there to date, you are there to meet good people and potential friends, make your conversation natural, you are trying to find the "good people", then you will try to raise your relationship with those "good people" to "friends", then if you ever felt a particular feeling toward someone, then you might ask them as a friend to hangout more, ask them about what they find in a future husband, and gradually yet steadily, try to convey you are interested in them.  though i myself prefer the traditional way since there are very little chances of doing something "haram" intentionally or not, but if that is what you prefer, then go ahead.  just remember society doesn't look highly towards "dates" among non-married/non-engaged, and in the traditional way, you would most likely get to spend 3months-12months engaged, meaning you could see the other's true self and personality.  anyway, good luck, and if anyone has any comments on anything i said, please go ahead and say it, I'm happy to know where i am wrong.	1642955286.0	htw8yjl	t3_sahuf0	t1_htw6kga	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/htw8yjl/

e3kd9b7b	I will take the chance to vent what I always have thought: If driving in Riyadh followed the rules of civilised driving, the quality of life would improve. This means less stress for all passengers, less traffic accidents (big and small) and orderly transit.  Here the speeding driver never do the math, if you increase speed 10 to 20% , you are not going to save time in the same proportion, you will double the risk for everbody (yes!! For you too), if you departed late you will not arrive on time by speeding (but you may arrive early to the afterlife, may be even with some company too, isn't it wonderful?!)  For those Fast & Furious, remember, death will be your best option, killing others and go to jail or being paralyzed from the neck down is also a feasable option. Don't try to prove it, you won't have a second chance.	1642964895.0	htwxy2h	t3_saufz3	t3_saufz3	/r/saudiarabia/comments/saufz3/we_need_to_talk_about_driving/htwxy2h/

4jxcvzrs	We quarantined at our hotel room in Jeddah.   We were actually unaware of having to quarantine so, we stayed in our room trying to figure out what was going on and didn't know there were government facilities where we had to quarantine.  If you are able to wait to register on your app, do so. My app went from green to purple (immune to institutional quarantine) in 2 hours. Honestly, if we know that was going to happen we would have waited until we got to Medina to register on the app.   The people only care that your app is green and don't make you scan in. So I suggest that you take a picture of your app when it's green and then try to make umrah with that if you're unable to get your app to work. Because even if you do your pcr tests and quarantine there is no guarantee that the app will update in real time.  I recommend that you carry around your vaccine cards with you. A lot of people are running into this issue of the app not working and depending on the guard at the Haram you might be able to talk to them and explain the situation and still be able to do umrah.	1642965711.0	htx00sr	t3_qtc06u	t1_htwxxxw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/qtc06u/im_on_a_tourist_visa_how_do_i_register_on/htx00sr/

4db4mch7	General rule of thumb: don’t engage unless they do.   1- in a public place with a none employee, it’s the general rule.   2- in public with an employee, depends on how they interact with you, are they smiling and seem to be open ? Yeah go ahead.  3- work place: kinda depends. Even though I am a college student, I’ve participated in a startup accelerator (not my company) and my mother is a business woman (owns a restaurant in Jeddah) in general it’s really normal to have small talk and opening conversations from your side. But if they look like they are modestly dressed + they are reserved, go to the general rule. But it’s really normal now in the work space to talk with your female colleagues even if it’s not work related.   At least that is my impression and what I’ve experienced.	1642969021.0	htx8evb	t3_sahuf0	t3_sahuf0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/htx8evb/

d8lqu95h	\- You need to be vaccinated, and have at least 2 shots. Vaccine rules for Hajj 2022 hasn't been released yet  \- How the lottery works is that you register your interest along with a pool of other people. Then a random person is picked by an algorithm until all the spots are filled. You have to then go to the website and finish your application/pay within a set period of time.  \- As a saudi citizen, your qualified for local hajj, which is handled differently that hajj from outside the kingdom. You would use the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah website. They will make their portal available when its time to register for hajj. Honestly, its best to follow their arabic twitter account to keep up to date.  \- Having an expired ID can ruin your chance of being able to sign up, depending on the filtering process they set that year. You can get your ID renewed, just contact the saudi consulate in your country.	1642970370.0	htxbxll	t3_sagdp9	t3_sagdp9	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sagdp9/hajj_2022_questions/htxbxll/

39gnys5m	No. Definitely not. Why would a girl get harassed for not wearing a hijab? That used to happen many years ago. Not anymore thankfully.   When you asked would it get attention, of course it would. You're walking around, showing your blonde hair. Yeah people would look, stare, but NOT harass. Not negative attention. Of course there is a possibility, like there is a possibility of getting a heart attack.

flebsdi7	In general, smiles and talks are acceptable. Just use your common sense (no politics, religion, sensitive or sexual talks and jokes).  Other than that it depends on the person, some females are not comfortable talking and engaging with stranger mens and you have to evaluate their reaction and engagement with you and decided whether to stop or continue. However, because you are not Arab, most people will take that into consideration and won’t judge you for doing something unacceptable in the Saudi culture, so don’t worry. Also again because it depends on the person you are engaging with, some women do shake hands.	1642980742.0	hty3aaf	t3_sahuf0	t3_sahuf0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sahuf0/hello_all_i_would_like_to_inquire_about_some/hty3aaf/

Always stay calm,cool ,collected and sharp when driving in this country. Those crazy drivers don’t value others lives or their own.   Had a guy tailgate me, pass me on the left, try to cut me off and hit a cop that was right in front of me. On a 60 speed limit road lol.  Another time in khobar at 4 am, my light turned green and a guy who was going fast behind me  thought it was a good idea to drift on this turn. While this sedan is drifting on this turn going left, an FJ cruiser was trying to make the light that intersects going minimum 160 kph. Huge crash,all involved died.

1bi752hw	Couldn't agree more.   If i may add, tipping incentivizes businesses to give less salaries.   If the business cannot afford to pay it's employees it shouldn't rely on customers to do so. The business shouldn't exist if it's not able to keep up with its costs.	1643007882.0	htzpm0r	t3_sbcnzq	t1_htz6hvj	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sbcnzq/tipping_delivery_drivers/htzpm0r/

13rz81	I am from Alkhobar which is part of the metropolitan area of the three joined cities the others being Dammam and Dhahran.  Alhasa which is the district name has many small villages and two cities Hafouf which is the capital and Mubaraz. They are relatively large and there are historical sites dating way back as it was a bastion of the Ottoman rulers during the Ottoman rule there hundreds of years ago. You can get a tourist guide to arrange for sight seeing.   Anyway the other points you could easily look up online.  Distance is something you should consider as it will take 4 hours to get to Doha from Dammam if you take the coastal road (95) not selected on Google maps for some reason...  Alhasa is slightly less at around 3 hours.  However consider,  boarder control whichl takes around half an hour or so depending on the number of people going through.   It may be that during the games lots of Saudi sports fans will be doing the same and that could easily rack up the load on boarder formalities taking a couple if hours maybe more to go through.  Similarities between getting from Alkhobar to Bahrain border on normal days it takes 30 to 25 minutes and you are through. On a weekend it may be 40 to an hour. On holidays it may be up to two hours.  Why not eliminate boarder control element search in North Qatar or the west...  If I was so keen I would simply get a tent rental with all the conveniences. Lots of locals and Saudis do this but you have to be used to camping life for an extended period and depending on the quality it may be a bit pricey.

4llutef	People especially women consider mall hopping as a recreational activity here and since there are cinemas in every mall people have an added entertainment reason to visit more often. Also buying clothes online is still not as common as one might think. A large population of locals and expats prefer not to use credit cards/debit cards for e-retailers especially thoses wary of fraud and ignorant of the concept of returns and refunds.   Malls in the U.S. didn't go out of business because of lack of interest but rather their bad business practices further compounded by the pandemic and bankruptcies of the large firms owning them. Unlike the U.S. you will never find Karens and Kens fighting for their "rights" to protect their "freedom"  from vaccination and masks in K.S.A. Most people here have common sense unlike the idiots living in the U.S. For a small population of stupid people the compulsary vaccination mandate is enough. So if the malls are relatively safe and social distancing is being practiced people will still go. If you need to understand the popularity of malls just try finding parking in one on a weekend.	1643017520.0	hu01zez	t3_sb232x	t3_sb232x	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sb232x/do_you_guys_think_malls_will_decline_in_saudi/hu01zez/

Might as well learn Python language so you can look more appealing to Semens and BMW.  I’ll give you a tip to help you learn a language. Force yourself to use the language. For example, switch the language on your smartphone to German, watch German movies with German subtitles, and try to make a German friend to practice the language with.	1643025029.0	hu0bj8a	t3_sb3ddi	t1_hu0ap8j	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sb3ddi/please_help_me_decide_i_scored_7_in_ielts_and_am/hu0bj8a/

12b8ti	There were moments when I enjoyed it but it is quite the shock to the system to be honest. Even for colleagues from Jordan and Lebanon, the culture shock was real. It’s about trying to make friends in the workplace, and finding ways and reasons to explore the country and the region (Western Asia) in general.   I wouldn’t discourage anybody from trying it, but I would say that you have to manage your expectations. Even when speaking to some of my Muslims friends, they were excited to go to Mecca (the city I was in was about 1 hour away), but for some of them that wasn’t enough to keep them there. In contrast, I’ve worked with people from the UK and other western nations who love the lack of pressure in the workplace and generally enjoy the paycheque.   But yeah, in all it was one of my harder international assignments, and though I wouldn’t do it again, I wouldn’t say I hated it.	1643053039.0	hu24vjr	t3_sbo0ov	t1_hu21c58	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sbo0ov/work_in_the_kingdom_question_from_a_canadian/hu24vjr/

8kavl	I spent a couple of years in KSA a couple of decades ago and loved exploring the country and the meeting the people although some aspects were hard.        I was really glad I had read up on Culture Shock as it had a big impact on me and others from the west after a couple of months there. One thing to remember, it is a very young country/culture so many things such as systems/procedures cultural values are all over the place relative to the west. Typically there are loads of expats at work places to help you out (I was looked after like a child when I first arrived).	1643060168.0	hu2nnpu	t3_sbo0ov	t1_hu24vjr	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sbo0ov/work_in_the_kingdom_question_from_a_canadian/hu2nnpu/

8042pg6m	From what I understand, America basically orchestrated a coup against a democratically elected president in Ukraine (I can’t quite remember his name) for being somewhat pro-Russian as opposed to pro-EU.   So now the Russians see themselves as fighting against a NATO that wants to expand into their own backyard. I get why they see a threat in that, but overall I guess you could say I’m neutral.   However, I do wish we had closer relations with Russia and China. I feel like we rely on the Americans a bit too much at times.	1643062326.0	hu2tbsu	t3_sbbei3	t3_sbbei3	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sbbei3/whats_your_opinion_on_this_whole_russia_vs/hu2tbsu/

The thing is that while popularity of online shopping is definitely rising up over here, we are still far behind compared to most developed regions imo. A lot of people still prefer to physically shop for a variety of reasons.  You also had to add the fact that locals go to malls not just to shop but also to watch movies, take their kids to the playgrounds, chill out at coffee shops or just hang around with their friends. Heck, a lot of Saudis come all the way to Bahrain every weekend just to be at Dragon City and City Center so yeah, it will take sometime.	1643148066.0	hu7ly5b	t3_sb232x	t3_sb232x	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sb232x/do_you_guys_think_malls_will_decline_in_saudi/hu7ly5b/

2wo1z4po	just to be honest, reddit is not a good place to find friends, I would probably suggest discord.  &#x200B;  also, you wont be finding friends without more info, like what hobbies are you into? what do you like? hate?   &#x200B;  but at the end, it would be better for you to find friends in person, tell me what you like, I may be able to suggest clubs or groups that would have the same interest as you, maybe you could find friends there.	1643150802.0	hu7sqlo	t3_scncvy	t3_scncvy	/r/saudiarabia/comments/scncvy/looking_for_friends/hu7sqlo/

4rhwgh	Usually should be fine. Things to look out for:  1. Check if the vehicle is eligible to enter into Saudi by using this link: https://sls.saso.gov.sa/Pages/Vehicles  2. A lot of US cars in the UAE are salvage title vehicles with an accident history. Look up the vehicle CARFAX and make sure its a clean title with no accidents so that it can enter the country.   3. The car should be fine with Saudi weather but if you want to be 100% sure, figure out which state the car was located in through its CARFAX report and find a state with a hotter climate (Texas, California, etc works fine).   4. Get your own CARFAX report for the vehicle, don’t rely on the seller giving you one (it could be fake). You will probably pay $20-$40 for the report.   5. The tundra is a great car.

You can find it sold in ADSLGate.com along with many other infos on then. Also, you can do port forwarding for the online game you need the best ping for it.   Check each company coverage for your area, and also ask them about the 24hrs trial (they might require 2000 sar insurance)  I know Zain offer that.	1643185878.0	hu9rzzj	t3_sczuwm	t3_sczuwm	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sczuwm/stc_fibre_coverage_do_they_plan_to_at_all/hu9rzzj/

Omicron has shown to be the weakest variant yet and with everyday that passes more and more of the Saudi population get vaccinated, we can’t wait forever to open schools back up and now seems like a good time to do so.

1gxrhtvx	Those coverage maps are estimates. My friend was getting the STC 5G modem and his area wasn't covered but the next street was covered. I asked him to try a 5G sim on a phone and check the reception. He was getting medium reception like 3-4 bars.  He ended up getting it anyways, and voila 300-500Mbps for SR 405/m. There's another package that is capped at 200Mbps. He got the Huawei 5G router and STC no longer gives that one anymore.   My other friend got the ZTE one from STC and sometimes he gets around 700Mbps downloads and he usually gets 100+Mbps uploads. He gets full bars as the cell tower is close and he lives on the 4th floor. He only faced degraded speeds just one time, around 50Mbps but it was fixed within few hours.  Getting external antenna will massively boost your speed. Just get a 5G phone or borrow it and test stc's 5G sim and check coverage and speed in your house before making the purchase.  I'd prefer STC over Zain and mobily.  Zain 4G was very unstable during rush hours, not sure how their 5G handles load.	1643209879.0	huavmj2	t3_sczuwm	t1_hua3osw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sczuwm/stc_fibre_coverage_do_they_plan_to_at_all/huavmj2/

2g2k1147	Oof idk what to mention so I will quickly go over a few I encountered recently:  1• Jogging on Corniche minding my own business and stopped by a regular late 40s old man. He asked me to remove headphones 🎧 as it was disrespectful to the public (even though you can't hear it unless you are wearing it).  2• A lady (with abaya+niqab) tried to return her soft drink in a fast food restaurant even though she drank half of it. They tried to give her a discount and not a full refund but she just kept yelling not letting the cashier deal with new customers in line (including me) Idk what happened next as I just went to another restaurant. I know that some soft drinks sold in fast food restaurants are just carbonated water but thats not an excuse to make a hassle.   3• I was waiting in the middle lane at a red light and a lady in a big jeep behind me was turning right. Even though the road was completely empty, she decided to get really close behind me before going to the right lane. She somehow found it difficult to do so as she was honking at me for straight 20 seconds. Once she did and was next to me, she rolled the window and just shouted and cursed me with all her might until she turned right.  4• Another time in Corniche minding my own business and a family approached me. Like a whole family: father+mother+2 sons+3 daughters. And just looked at me asking why I am wearing a mask if the mandate now is not forcing a mask in public areas (at that time)	1643218378.0	hubivfp	t3_sdb1lq	t3_sdb1lq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdb1lq/there_are_karens_and_kens_all_over_the_world_what/hubivfp/

Mbs still signed the Amazon prime deal with him eventhough Jeff Bezos made a claim about MBs that was completely wrong. Mbs forgave and signed the deal because he had a country to look after, e0 million people to lead, and you cant let a personal grudge get in the way for your peoples happiness.  Same thing here with Thailand, he forgave them for nothing in return, because he has a country to look after, an economy to manage, 30 million human being's  prosperity depend on him.  He truly is a leader, willing to overlook everyone who have wronged him for his people.	1643222938.0	hubvr3d	t3_sclf41	t1_hubt01i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sclf41/thai_pm_arrives_in_saudi_arabia_easing_diamond/hubvr3d/

ae5d9x4z	Happened long time back. I went to Centerpoint to get some dresses, was standing in line to pay while an guy in his 40s came in to exchange clothes he had bought a month ago. The cashier who was a foreigner told him we can’t do it since it’s too old and he started yelling telling him that this is his country and he can do whatever he wants and started cursing at the fellow saying him to go back to where he came from and then the manager came out and agreed to let him exchange the dress	1643226335.0	huc5a2x	t3_sdb1lq	t3_sdb1lq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdb1lq/there_are_karens_and_kens_all_over_the_world_what/huc5a2x/

f554r71	I don't know if this guy is a Ken or just a racist ass. I'm a Filipino btw and this is one of my first experience in Saudi. I was second in queue on an ATM and a Saudi woman arrives to withdraw. She politely asked me if she could go first but before I could respond(I would let her obviously), the Saudi guy behind me gave me a slight shove and told the woman to go ahead(in Arabic) acting as if I couldn't speak for myself.  &#x200B;  After that, the woman thanked me for letting her go first and not the guy. The guy then proceeded to cut me right after as if helping a woman to get in line first gives you the benefit of also going ahead. I tried arguing with him in English. He then proceeded to shout in Arabic and told me "Mafi English".  &#x200B;  Other Saudi guys behind talked to him in Arabic and they seemed to be arguing. The guys behind then talked to me and told me to just let the guy go because he's crazy.	1643227100.0	huc7g8e	t3_sdb1lq	t3_sdb1lq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdb1lq/there_are_karens_and_kens_all_over_the_world_what/huc7g8e/

The only problem with Zain is thier coverage area. There might be a place which you do not have a signal. I usually use them for sim cards which would stay at a one place inside a router.  Yagoot is a service by Zain which I hear a few good reviews about it lately.	1643231549.0	huck11k	t3_sd76cv	t1_huau6gh	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sd76cv/what_the_hell_is_going_on_with_stc_credit_packages/huck11k/

jbnhm	Not sure of the availability in any but:  [Bustan Village](https://albustanvillage.com/): connected to the American international school, so all teachers live there, went to high school there and they’re some of the nicest people I’ve met in the country. Kind of far from the “center” of the city, which isn’t always a bad thing.   [Cordoba Oasis](https://www.cordoba.com.sa/): in Qurtubah neighborhood, located in the east of the city. Relatively older than most compounds, spacious and has multiple pools scattered throughout, you’ll find more Arab expats rather than fully fledged foreigners.   [Hamra Oasis Village](http://www.alhamra.com.sa/): located in hamra neighborhood, extremely similar to Cordoba.   [California Compound](http://www.crr.com.sa/): believe it’s only condos, not as big as the others but looks (or at least feels) relatively newer. Around 2 or 3 huge pools in the middle of the compound IIRC.   These are just the ones I’ve been to (excluding hospital compounds) and I haven’t visited any of them in around 4 years so things could be different or there may be newer more popular ones.   Good luck and if there’s anything else you need let me know, I know it can be hard for an expat the first month or two.	1643232055.0	huclg8g	t3_sdfdrx	t3_sdfdrx	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdfdrx/expat_compounds_in_riyadh/huclg8g/
t28x0	I decided to go to a small hill in a residential area with my friends as the view of the city from there was great, we parked our cars near it and **on the other side of the street** from a random villa. Like 2 minutes later a middle aged Saudi guy just barges out of the house demanding that we remove the cars from **his street** plus demanding to know what we were doing on the hill (obviously the hill is not his property, just a nearby plot), we were just a small group of male and female nationals and foreigners. We collectively decided to not give him any info as it was none of his business so he grew even angrier and confrontational, now accusing us of trying to get to the top of the hill to "look at his women", implying that we were there just to peek at his specific villa and the women inside. We just climbed up while he kept threatening to call the cops on us, we told him that he was welcome to do so if he wanted and eventually he gave up.	1643232187.0	hucltjw	t3_sdb1lq	t3_sdb1lq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdb1lq/there_are_karens_and_kens_all_over_the_world_what/hucltjw/

8879jr0o	I went to this story that sold a bunch of random things. Anyways, as I was at the cashier register. There was one person there, so I stood behind them until they finished. As soon as they finished I placed my items so they get scanned. As I do that, this lazy out of no where come from my right side and says   "Ista2then tayeb ista2then" which means "ask for permission" and she said it in a mad pissed off manner that really boiled my blood.  Basically I was accused of taking her place. ALTHOUGH I WAS IN THE FUCKING LINE.   The thing that was more frustrating is that the cashier was with her and said "yeah tbh, she right you should as for permission, be respectful" that pissed me off even more.   I take my items back and said "go ahead"  And she was like, "LA khalas"   I SWEAR I WANTED TO LITERALLY LEAVE THE ITEMS AND JUST LEAVE THE STORE.  I am a non-saudi btw. And just felt like... It was Bec of race or something. Everytime I think about it it makes me made. I wish I left the store without buying the stuff. But whatever.

6ocp5l2n	7 years ago, my dad did a ken. He bought an iPhone from Jarir for his niece, shipped it overseas; then turns out it’s faulty (from Apple); 2 months later, niece managed to ship it back for my dad to return/replace. My dad told me will raise his voice on the customer service if they fix the phone not replace it. Customer service and my dad were arguing for over 25+ minutes because they (Jarir) couldn’t confirm if the phone qualifies for a replacement. Can’t believe he raised his voice a couple of times. I told him it’s pointless to argue with the customer service clerks because replacing phones without checking it’s condition thoroughly is above their pay grade but I felt I was talking to a wall.

Don’t go all the way there and live like you’re on a shoe strong budget, there are other places you can go which are nice and much more economical.

81tt9bd7	I'm an Arab but not from Saudi, but I must say this: A Karen is honestly a very American thing; the sense of entitlement, arrogance, and combativeness is unique. Speaking to the manager is very common all across the world; my mom does it, but when she does it, she's nice and most of the time just ends up having a laugh with the manager even if the manager is wrong. I think this combination of entitlement and combativeness is unique to individualistic societies such as the US, where freedomTM is more important than social customs. I am from Iraq, and our society is tightly nit and familial, so we are taught from an early age to be humble and appreciative; therefore, being a Karen would be an easy way for you to be ousted from your community. This is my own subjective perspective, at least, and if you think I'm wrong, please correct me.	1643243918.0	hudfwqe	t3_sdb1lq	t3_sdb1lq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdb1lq/there_are_karens_and_kens_all_over_the_world_what/hudfwqe/

b1mmh7gc	That explains why the religious police existed in saudi, but thankfully the saudi government is fighting those who can't follow basic common sence which is minding your own business and let other people minding their other business, and stop being pathetic it's the 21the century people don't have to believe in exactly what you believe in even though you both from the same religion, people interpret religion differently and that's between them and between who created them, no human being have ever the right to force something onto another human being but only allah, stop playing allah's role, let allah do their job and you just do what allah said to you which is to worship god only and fasting haj etc.	1643293995.0	hufxqn1	t3_sdvdas	t1_hufwl1o	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvdas/karens_in_riyadh_be_like/hufxqn1/
2wo1z4po	Yes there are.  There have been multiple occasions where I ,or a family of mine, participated in a heavy job that doesnt pay much.  Because the 3 million unemployed people aren't idiots, they want to work, and they would be great workers at that, but there are no chances.   Companies dont like to employ Saudis because of the reputation that Saudis are lazy, that is not true, my cousin was offered a job from a company, where the company would literally just write her name as an employee, pay her 4k, and then she repays 3k of that, eventhough she was willing to work hard, they didnt want her, they only wanted her for the saudization and that is it.  It is really a shame, many talented young people aren't getting offered jobs because the employers believe stupid rumors that:   -Saudis are lazy.  -Saudis want a large paycheck.  -Saudis will never work heavy lifting jobs.	1643294018.0	hufxsic	t3_sd41pm	t1_huewk5r	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sd41pm/bbc_news_blue_diamond_affair_saudis_end_dispute/hufxsic/

And btw according to laws in saudi arabia you are literally supposed to be punished to the fullest extent of the law so i don't see your point of praising the country ?	1643294373.0	hufymqy	t3_sdvdas	t1_hufxqn1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvdas/karens_in_riyadh_be_like/hufymqy/

Let me tell u something, Islam is not time-gated mater( not for one era) Islam is a way of life, it's timeless, it's the only perfectly set laws that can be used no matter when or what or where, unlike man made laws that are full of loop hole, but in the end no matter what anyone might say, u might have an opinion of ur own, which I'm not gonna trash talk it or insult it in anyway, cuz in the Quran ALLAH said (لكم دينكم ولي دين) meaning: u have your religion and I have my religion, though it was said 1443 years ago, yet it still in affect, and from this example u may wanna read the Quran to understand why it's "timeless".

I’ve taken 3 jabs and my tawakkalna status has changed to “immune”.  Also, since you mentioned it too, I think I’m rest assured another pcr test isn’t needed ☺️.  هلا مشكور يغالي	1643317383.0	huhp6jr	t3_se1dso	t1_huho9br	/r/saudiarabia/comments/se1dso/just_arrived_in_riyadh_via_the_jordan_land_border/huhp6jr/
66ttuo7n	Just for clarification, I entered Saudi through the Jordan land border because I’m studying in JU (hence that’s why I’m in Jordan) and I’m on a tight budget, so going there by bus it is 😂.	1643317494.0	huhph6r	t3_se1dso	t1_huho9br	/r/saudiarabia/comments/se1dso/just_arrived_in_riyadh_via_the_jordan_land_border/huhph6r/
e0p4xwm	Thank you happy to see other countries here too. Surprised me that you do speak arabic though and as you said if tawakkalna status is immune then just ignore the pcr test. Though I would suggest you turn off its access to location when not in use as it eats ALOT of battery since it tracks you every minute 24/7.	1643317621.0	huhptjv	t3_se1dso	t1_huhp6jr	/r/saudiarabia/comments/se1dso/just_arrived_in_riyadh_via_the_jordan_land_border/huhptjv/

4ksxq1i3	Welcome to Saudia!  I'm from Madinah and I was in San Francisco before nine months! loveed it.  1. The best transportation option for you will be using Uber, and there’s another car app called Careem.  2. Yes, people here can understand and use daily English but not that good in convo.  3. Prophet Muhammad mosque, and all the area around. I wished you got some time that you can go to Al Ula, it’s like 300km from madinah. Very special place and amazing especially at this time of the year.  4. You can ask the hotel about the nearest private clinic that offer Covid PCR test, It’s everywhere and can provide under 24 results. Just make sure to ask them how and when you will receive the results to confirm.  Wish you a pleasant stay in Medinah!	1643328675.0	huii3va	t3_sebrmy	t3_sebrmy	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sebrmy/visiting_medina_next_week_and_have_some_general/huii3va/

157vbq	Yeah it's fine. Let me give you some important protips  -Don't send it with USPS, send it with DHL or Aramex. If you're gonna send it with USPS use some kind of expedited/premium delivery, only then the local post service will give real attention to the parcel and handle it compentently. A large amount of other parcels coming through the local post carrier will run into hiccups, this is why carriers like DHL and Aramex are way, way better.   -Make absolutely sure to include 3 things front and center, in bold, in multiple fields, just include them as much as possible so they don't mishandle or misdirect the parcel to random locations; her local phone number (very important, they're gonna contact her through it on delivery day), city and the district in the city. Those are the most important 3 bits.   -As for customs, you're fine with almost everything except stuff that will be obviously problematic everywhere, like drugs, food, chemicals, I believe bills are also not allowed. Also alcohol and alcoholic stuff in general is not allowed through customs.	1643367259.0	hukgah3	t3_sdubbp	t3_sdubbp	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdubbp/can_i_send_my_girlfriend_in_ksa_some_gifts_or/hukgah3/

flebsdi7	- Riyadh Front and U-Walk are good options at night with a lot of restaurants and coffee shops (similar vibe to Dubai City Walk) - Al Tahliyah Street is also a great option at night (used to be the only hotspot for young Saudis, and still an amazing distention for a walk, fancy restaurants, hookah lounges, and bar-like coffee shops) - The 303 in King Abdullah Financial District (you probably sick of skyscrapers in Dubai but if you got time check it out. Good for a night quick visit but closes relatively early. There you can get a hookah, food, Cinema and “Salt Camp” is the newest and main thing there)  Coffee shops that I like (not sure if they are also in Dubai or not): - North - Hi Coffee - 66 Cups - Hanoverian - 1/2 Million - Overjar.   If you want a cultural and authentic place where you can meet locals, get souvenirs, and see the old Riyadh, DO NOT MISS Al Masmak, Al Thumairi Street, Altaamer Markets and Souq Al Zel (my favorite) and they are all near each other you can walk to them once you get to the area. (Friday noon is the best time to visit)  If you are into movies, go to Wadi Cinema, they screen independent movies and have discussions about them. Good place to meet and talk to people.	1643367932.0	hukh7d7	t3_sdvwdo	t1_hukdm2h	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvwdo/visiting_riyadh_looking_to_meet_new_people/hukh7d7/

See there are two different patterns of the flying particles.   1) if the green particle, and the red particle pass by each other going opposite direction, then you’re done. You’ll get the red screen.   2) if the green particle, and the red particle suddenly change paths right before they pass each other, then you’re good!   This is what 10 years of experience does.	1643370552.0	hukkyop	t3_sen111	t1_hukb46c	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sen111/kids_today_will_never_understand_the_anxiety_the/hukkyop/

5yj2iwx6	I heavily disagree. However, let me tell you why I used the term frowned upon by our society. When almost every commercial you see and every new type of advertisement you look at either on TV, streets, or malls which includes a women wearing the Hijab. I hardly see any of these ads having models which wear the hijab properly. Which get me back to my point if our own society is advertising this style of hijab as the modern type of hijab. What does that say about the old one?! The one that actually serves as hijab. This has a message of encouragement for the ladies to abandon the traditional hijab for this "modern" Hijab. That's why I used the term frowned upon, and that's how our society is commercializing this new hijab for the new generation.	1643372242.0	huknksj	t3_sdvdas	t1_huj6aa8	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvdas/karens_in_riyadh_be_like/huknksj/
4pcuql4s	i think you should sit down bro nobody is taking it this seriously, it’s not frowned upon to do either bro literally nobody cares  Women in my own family, in different age groups, wear their hijab differently, if you really think commercials are that impactful I believe you’re very mistaken.  Society changes as time goes on, its been happening since humans existed my guy, it wasn’t very long ago that women weren’t allowed to even walk outside, drive cars, talk to men, some were even denied basic fucking education, and on the off chance that they could  go outside they had to dress in full black, sometimes not even their eyes are shown, I’ll take “wearing the hijab incorrectly” over all of the above any time any day.  If you cant handle society changing, for better or for worse in your opinion, then you either accept that fact or just stay grumpy forever lmao.	1643372676.0	hukoar9	t3_sdvdas	t1_huknksj	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvdas/karens_in_riyadh_be_like/hukoar9/

5yj2iwx6	First of all, I did not disrespect you so don't disrespect me. Second of all this is my own point of view then again we don't have to agree about everything to each is own. Then again you talk about being denied basic stuff. Hold on for a second there, there is too much restriction and there is too much freedom. What we have reached now is a westernized society that have been influenced too heavily by the west and is trying to live to the expectation of the western world. There is nothing more to it bro. There is no middle ground here in Saudi. It's either too conservatives or too open.	1643373884.0	hukqdih	t3_sdvdas	t1_hukoar9	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sdvdas/karens_in_riyadh_be_like/hukqdih/

It might work if you know someone with good credit and a high income or with a a lot of assets to become a guarantor for the loan.

There's 3-4 feet of snow in places and I can't walk cuz they only bothered clearing snow on the roads only.   I don't want Riyadh to turn into such a place, we're already getting way too many strip malls with wasted parking space but then again those places are crowded too, public transportation is just not there at all. I used to take Saptco buses in Riyadh but they always drop you off way too far as they have only their designated routes.

cipu6znc	Saudi Arabian society doesn’t have a very strong gaming culture as opposed to as how it is in the west, in fact. Anime and/or superhero culture is usually much much more popular. There’s a lack of appreciation to mediums that were originally made to be video game mediums. So it’s hard for us game culture lovers to acquire our games, let alone getting any merchandise.

His videos need to be taken with a grain of salt since he really is not a medical doctor - think of him more as a "Wellness" consultant. I would look at his advice like I do a traditional Chinese medicine or traditional Indian medicine practitioner - some good rules of thumb (reduce your stress, sleep 8 hours a day , eat plenty of vegetables and more natural foods) , but ultimately someone who's "guessing" at root causes to problems and guessing at the solutions as well.	1643821165.0	hvapu7w	t3_sire61	t1_hvansp5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sire61/who_here_memory_issues_how_do_you_deal_with_it/hvapu7w/

6p3vej3o	As far I know, it works like this: expats are allowed to move around as long as their residence permit/visa is valid. Now if your company cannot issue the iqama and your visa expires, you cannot leave the country because they cannot issue a final exit visa for you. As long as you’re under their sponsorship, its their problem not yours. It will prompt on their system that they have a worker with an expired visa and their systems will close meaning they cannot renew or issue iqamas for any other employees under their sponsorship.  On your part, if you’re working legally under that company and you don’t get caught by the police doing something illegal then I guess you’ll be fine.   Now if you’re planning to escape / runaway from your company without an iqama, then that’s a different story.	1643822467.0	hvatenl	t3_simsu7	t1_hvaq8yx	/r/saudiarabia/comments/simsu7/expiration_of_temporary_working_visa/hvatenl/

I would suggest you do some private projects, build a portfolio, meet with kagglers and try to get some jobs online. Fiverr, freelancer and stuff just to get some experience. It is a good profession most definitely.  The main issue i see is that companies and older management are mostly “traditional” (aka technologically ignorant).

3yemok5	In order to help you, let's fully understand your situation. First, have you talked to your mom and discussed with her the problem without letting emotions get in the way? Like have you sat with her while both of you are in good mood? " Mom, I want to discuss the issue with the cats, is it allergy? If not, is it a cleanness issue? If yes, I can promise you to keep them in my room, also, to be responsible in cleaning after them" this an example.   I understand you love your cats, how long have you had them, and how old are you? Do you have your own room? She doesn't like them for what reason? Have the casued something? Are you the one who clean after them, feed them, take them to the vet or is it someone's else responsibility? Also, How many cats do you have?  I understand your frustration, but believe me, if you don't have a full time job, you will not be able to live on your own at all, and if some shady person promised to take care of you and your cats, they will most likely harm you and get rid of your cats. The world is dangerous out there, and your cats wont be save if you didnt try to solve this with your family, or ask your close friends to adopt the cats if your mom is insisting on not having them.	1643833616.0	hvbn9jt	t3_siyajw	t3_siyajw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/siyajw/im_trying_to_run_away_from_my_family/hvbn9jt/

Is it because she is having an allergic reactions to them  Or they are too much work   Or they cost to much  Have this discussion, try to solve the problem if any, then if she still wants to remove the cat/cats she shouldn't just kick them out, but wait and give them up for adoption.	1643835711.0	hvbt0ur	t3_siyajw	t3_siyajw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/siyajw/im_trying_to_run_away_from_my_family/hvbt0ur/

It's such a waste of energy and time to think about something that has zero existence in the Islamic world (talking about the saudi flag itself btw not what's written on it). I think the only good thing about it is that it's going to spark new conversation without (hopefully) talking about things like "saudi is losing it's identity" or at least I don't wanna listen to the same old conversation of الفساد الاخلاقي اللي قاعد يصير.	1643835777.0	hvbt7i7	t3_sindq0	t3_sindq0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sindq0/thoughts/hvbt7i7/

dk1op	That's the reason taught in schools. History books (at least the ones I've read) all agree that he was deposed by an alliance of his family members led by Faisal because he was perceived to be mismanaging the country's resources, and was reluctant to let go of some of his powers to the office of Prime Minister (occupied by Faisal at the time). The thread's parent seems to hint at a third narrative, one where Saud's reign doesn't come off as negative as the historic records suggest, which is why I'm interested to learn more about this.	1643838147.0	hvbzv1r	t3_siovi0	t1_hvbusip	/r/saudiarabia/comments/siovi0/based_king/hvbzv1r/

Registrar (masters + at least 2 years exp. after): 16-24k  Consultant (doctorate + 5 years exp. after): 23 - 33k Additional if there is a sub speciality  The range is big because it depends on the speciality, experience, and where you got the degree. Like you have higher chances if you’re Indian but got your degree in the EU/ UK.   Although what I observed in Riyadh at least, hiring expat doctors are mostly for really rare specialities nowadays since there are a lot of good Saudi doctors coming from their studies abroad.

u7ed3a3	I don't think we've evolved enough as a species to rid ourselves from our innate inclination towards racism. We are hardwired to believe the group we are part of is "better" than others (you can find this in monkeys as well), and that's mainly what helped us survive since prehistoric time.  We've went through wars against religion, race, sexual orientation, and any other human characteristic prone to discrimination. The sooner we accept it, the better. Personal reflections (such as religion and essentially any other personal belief) are fine if practiced privately or within a like-minded group, but will almost certainly cause strife if practiced publicly.  The only reason why developed countries succeeded (loosely, situationally, and only very recently if you put mankind's history on a chronological axe) at mingling beliefs is because they all fall under the umbrella of civility and separation of State from Religion.  This means that the moment the King of Saudi Arabia stops being the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, we can debate whether it's a good idea or not to introduce more religions publicly.	1643916642.0	hvglblb	t3_sj3obf	t1_hvgiam7	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sj3obf/would_you_react_negatively_if_the_government/hvglblb/

u7ed3a3	Which country would you compare KSA to?  - You can't compare it to democratic countries who have successfully separated religion from state, thus allowing them to treat all religions equally in the eyes of governement. - You can't compare it to other monarchies either because Saudi Arabia is one of the last absolute monarchies.   I've compared it to Lebanon because the latter still has religion actively taking part of its daily governance and public policies, and it's the diversification of opinions on these matters that made it a "failed nation".  Your only solution would be to adopt the UAE model: have churches but implement a set of contricting rules on them to the point where it's nothing more than just a PR stunt to save face with the West. As a Christian, I'd much rather have Saudi Arabia turn a blind eye over what happens in private (which is what they do now), then to use religious diversity as a marketing tactic to further an agenda.	1643925359.0	hvh85nb	t3_sj3obf	t1_hvh48sn	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sj3obf/would_you_react_negatively_if_the_government/hvh85nb/

6ow1chu	فقد الجنسية  السعودية  اجازت النظم القانونية الخاصة بالجنسية للأفراد بتغيير جنسياتهم ، لأن ذلك يؤدي إلى  تحقيق مصلحة الأفراد و الدولة. فمصالح الفرد أن ينتمي إلى الوطن الذي يريده ، دون إكراه أو إجبار ، فمبدأ الولاء الدائم ، و ارتباط الفرد على سبيل التأبيد بدولة معينة  قد انتهى . و مصالح الدولة يكون في الاعتراف للفرد بالحق في تغيير جنسيته ، إذا تحول ولائه عنها ، مما يشكل الإبقاء عليه كعضو في جماعتها الوطنية خطراً على مصالحها المختلفة. الفقد الاختياري و الإجباري للجنسية فقد الفرد لجنسيته قد يكون اختيارياً ، و يأخذ صورة التخلي عن الجنسية ، و ذلك إذا لجأ إلى الدخول في جنسية دولة أجنبية بطريق التجنس ، أو بطريق الزواج إذا كانت امرأة ارتبطت بزواج مع أجنبي الجنسية . و قد يكون فقد الفرد لجنسيته رغماً عنه، و ذلك بقرار من السلطة العامة المختصة إذا ثبت عدم ولائه أو عدم صلاحيته لاستمراره في عضوية شعب الدولة ، و هنا تنزع الجنسية عن الفرد و حرمانه منها ، و يتخذ الحرمان من الجنسية صورتين : السحب و الإسقاط ، و يشملهما الفقد الإجباري للجنسية. أسباب التخلي أو الفقد  الاختياري للجنسية ينحصر في ثلاثة أسباب : أولًا: التخلي بسبب التجنس بجنسية أجنبية  النص التشريعي :  نصت المادة (11) من نظام الجنسية على أنه «لا يجوز لسعودي أن يتجنس بجنسية أجنبية دون إذن سابق من رئيس مجلس الوزراء ، والسعودي الذي يتجنس بجنسية أجنبية قبل الحصول مقدماً على هذا الأذن يظل معتبراً سعودياً ، إلا إذا رأت حكومة جلالة الملك إسقاط الجنسية العربية السعودية عنه تطبيقاً لحكم المادة(١٣)». المتأمل لنص المادة (11) من نظام الجنسية يتبن له أن السعودي الذي يرغب بالتجنس بجنسية أجنبية لا يترتب عليه فقدان الجنسية السعودية ، بل إشارة هذه المادة على ضرورة حصوله المسبق على إذن من رئيس  مجلس الوزراء بالتجنس بجنسية أجنبية . أي أن السعودي  الذي اكتسب جنسية أجنبية قبل الحصول مقدماً على الأذن يظل معتبراً سعودياً . و لكن هذا يقود إلى استخلاص أن السعودي الذي يحصل مقدماً على إذن من رئيس  مجلس الوزراء ثم يتجنس بجنسية أجنبية تزول عنه الجنسية السعودية . اشترطت المادة (11) على كل فرد سعودي يرغب بالتجنس بجنسية أجنبية أن يحصل مقدماً على إذن من رئيس مجلس الوزراء، و ذلك لتمكين الدولة من التحقق من جدية التخلي عن الجنسية و انعدام الغش أو التهرب من الالتزامات التي قد تكون على عاتق الفرد تجاه الدولة . و في حال لم يحصل الفرد السعودي على الأذن من قبل رئيس مجلس الوزراء فإنه يظل معتبراً سعودياً ، أي لا تزول عنه الجنسية السعودية. و هذا يؤدي إلى تعدد جنسية الفرد ، لا سيما إذا دخل في جنسية دولة أجنبية ، و لن تزول حالة تعدد الجنسية إلا إذا اسقطت عنه الجنسية السعودية كما يقول نص المادة (11) «إلا إذا رأت حكومة جلالة الملك إسقاط الجنسية العربية السعودية عنه تطبيقاً لحكم المادة(١٣)».و المادة (13) تقول أنه «يجوز بمرسوم مسبب إسقاط الجنسية العربية السعودية عن أي سعودي في حالة ،إذا دخل في جنسية أخرى مخالفاً مقتضى المادة (١١ )من هذا النظام. ثانياً :- التخلي بسبب الزواج من أجنبي  النص التشريعي :  يعد الزواج سببا لإكساب الجنسية و ايضاً سبباً لفقدها ، و هذا يعتمد على المذهب الذي يتبناه تشريع الجنسية ، و الذي بمقتضاه تقرر إلحاق الزوجة بجنسية زوجها كسباً  للجنسية الوطنية أو خروجها منها . المنظم السعودي قد تبنى مذهب استقلال الجنسية في العائلة بخصوص الزوجة التي تقترن بسعودي ، بحيث لا تدخل في الجنسية السعودية إلا إذا أعلنت عن رغبتها إلى السلطة المختصة، و التزم المذهب ذاته في شأن الزوجة السعودية التي تقترن بأجنبي ، فقرر أن تلك الزوجة لا تفقد جنسيتها السعودية ، بقوة النظام ، بمجرد زواجها من الأجنبي ، بل جعل ذلك رهن إرادتها و رغبتها في اللحاق بجنسية زوجها الأجنبية .و هذا ما نصت المادة (17) من نظام الجنسية على أنه «لا تفقد المرأة العربية السعودية جنسيتها إذا تزوجت بأجنبي إلا إذا قررت وأعلنت التحاقها بجنسية زوجها، ودخلت في هذه الجنسية بحكم القانون الخاص بها».  شروط التخلي عن الجنسية السعودية بسبب الزواج :  حتى تفقد المرأة العربية السعودية جنسيتها السعودية بالزواج من أجنبي يشترط ما يلي : الشرط الأول : أن يكون هناك عقد زواج صحيح بين سعودية و أجنبي ، فالزواج هو السبب القانوني لفقد الزوجة جنسيتها ، و عن طريقه يتحقق زوال الجنسية . ففي حال انعدم الزواج انعدمت فرصة فقد الجنسية . و تحديد صحة الزواج من عدمه يرجع إلى الأنظمة السعودية ، لأن الأمر يتعلق بفقدان الجنسية السعودية . الشرط الثاني : أن تعلن الزوجة رغبتها في الحصول على جنسية زوجها . و يمكن للزوجة إعلان رغبتها بالتخلي عن الجنسية السعودية في أي وقت ترغب ، سواء عند انعقاد الزواج أو بعده . المهم أن تعلن الزوجة رغبتها أثناء قيام الزوجية ، فإذا انقضت الزوجية بالطلاق أو الوفاة ، كان إعلان رغبتها عديمة الجدوى . الشرط الثالث : أن تدخل الزوجة فعلا في جنسية الزوج . وفقا لنظام الجنسية السعودي إن الجنسية السعودية لا تزول عن المرأة السعودية المتزوجة بأجنبي إلا إذا دخلت فعلا في جنسية زوجها بحكم القانون الخاص بها . فلا تفقد جنسيتها بمجرد إعلانها الرغبة في الحصول على جنسية زوجها ، فلا بد أن تكون الجنسية الأجنبية للزوجة قد منحت لها وفقاً لقواعد قانون تلك الجنسية و أحكامه.  النظام القانوني : لفقد الجنسية بالزواج :  تفقد المرأة السعودية جنسيتها السعودية ، في حال توافرت الشروط التي تم ذكرها ، و تزول عنها الجنسية السعودية من اللحظة التي تدخل في جنسية زوجها ، و دون أي أثر رجعي ، دون حاجة إلى لصدور قرار من وزير الداخلية ، بل أن وزارة الداخلية ليس لها سلطة تقديرية في هذا الشأن ، فلا تستطيع أن ترفض زوال الجنسية السعودية عن تلك المرأة . ثالثًا : التخلي بممارسة حق الاختيار   الفرق بين الحرمان من الجنسية و التخلي عنها.  الجنسية كصفة تفيد الانتماء و الولاء إلى الدولة ، و لكن يمكن أن تزول الجنسية عن الفرد بإرادته و اختياره بتغيير الجنسية و اكتساب جنسية دولة أخرى ، و أيضا يمكن أن تسلب منه رغم إرادته بقرار من الدولة ، إذا أتى  عملا يخل بأمن الدولة ، و عدم اخلاصه لها ، و هذا هو الفقد الإجباري ، أو الحرمان منها . الفرق بين التخلي و الفقد الاختياري أو الإرادي للجنسية ، و الحرمان أو السلب الجبري لها :  يتم الفقد الاختياري بإرادة الفرد نفسة و بمشيئته ، و لا تزول الجنسية عن الفرد مطلقا ، بل يستبدل جنسيته بأخرى . فيكون هناك نوع من الحلول في الجنسية . أما في الحرمان أو الفقد الجبري ، يتم سلب الجنسية بإرادة الدولة وحدها ،، و تزول الجنسية عن الفرد بصفة مطلقة ، دون أن يستطيع أن يحصل على جنسية أخرى . و بالتالي قد يترتب على زوال الجنسية صيرورة لفرد عديم الجنسية .  التخلي عن الجنسية أو الفقد الاختياري يتم إما بالتجنس أو بالزواج ، أي من ممارسة الشخص لمبدأ حق الفرد في تغيير جنسيته و عدم حرمانه منه ، أما الحرمان أو السلب الجبري يتم من ممارسة الدولة لمبدأ حق الدولة و حريتها في تنظيم جنسيتها بإرادتها وحدها .  إن الحرمان أو الفقد الاختياري هو أداة الفرد في تحويل انتمائه من ميدان الواقع إلى ميدان القانون . فحيث يشعر الفرد بفتور و ضعف ولائه للدولة التي يحمل جنستها و تحول ذلك شطر دولة أخرى ، فيكون له أن يغير جنسيته .  أما الفقد أو الحرمان الجبري للجنسية ، فهو أداة الدولة لمعاقبة و مجازاة وطنييها الذين يأتون أعمالاً تمس كيان و أمن الدولة و تضر بمصالحها العليا.	1643936591.0	hvhzo60	t3_sjynoh	t3_sjynoh	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sjynoh/how_to_renounce_my_citizenship/hvhzo60/

fesuks6b	It is not easy being a foreigner in KSA at all man. Be grateful you have that citizenship trust me you don’t want to be on the other side of things. I’ve lived through it and seen my family struggle, I have friends that their families have been in KSA for nearly 5 generations and still don’t have the same rights or respects that Saudis get. Also it’s not true, the punishments are not reduced I’d say probably more severe. But maybe if you mean by non-saudi as in a white European or white American then they’re doing fine mashaAllah and they get very nice treatment. I’m not trying to be a negative person, I grew up here and this country is my home (although some people would feel uncomfortable with me even saying this very statement :( ) but I just want you to be totally aware that it’s most likely not going to be an easy ride my brother. الله يوفقك	1643944165.0	hvigsx2	t3_sjynoh	t3_sjynoh	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sjynoh/how_to_renounce_my_citizenship/hvigsx2/

I don’t suggest renouncing your citizenship, you never know what will happen in the world and there might be a time when you will need your citizenship.

7ncxg	The short answer: If you’re not in a rush, just take the next one as some women feel uncomfortable.  Long answer: it depends, you have to read the situation, in many cases I’ve had to wait for extended periods for an elevator to arrive and had to get in with a female or two because I was running out of time, the etiquette would be to face towards the door and give them enough room to exit if they’re getting off on a floor before you.

83tcrloi	No clear cut answer to this one OP, unfortunately.   It really depends on the women in the elevator. There are numerous subtle cues that only experience living here would enable you to pick up. We just know instantly if it's cool or not. I don't even know what my brain is picking up, it just makes a snap decision. Things such as, are they fully covered up (conservative)? Do they make space? Do they quickly press the close button? It's a 50/50 honestly.   I'd let the elevator go unless I get a clear signal that it's OK. Clear signals would be things such as making space for you, eye contact while expectedly waiting on you to get in, not fully covered up (definitely a no if wearing an attire like [this](https://i.imgur.com/28z2MRH.jpg), and bigger no if like [this](https://i.imgur.com/OTyf3HM.jpg) - *unless* you get the clear signals).

3yemok5	Anything if abused can be dangerous, do you know who are the experts when it comes to meds? Doctors! That's why I recommended always consulting your doctor if you decided to take that route.   One more general information to share is that there are different types of meds/formulas which our bodies will react differently to it. Meaning, if you started medications and get bad side effects, you tell your doctor who will change the medication and give you something that your body will react better to it.   In some cases, the patient might need two to through two types until they find what's best for them.   I realize the stigma is huge when it comes to medication, and people in the internet almost always share individual bad experiences rather than success stories, but still, one should go after behavior therapy first and hopefully that's enough, but it's not, medication is studied thoroughly to help the people	1643984100.0	hvk9y48	t3_skchap	t1_hvk6geo	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skchap/lets_talk_about_therapists_or_psychotherapist_vs/hvk9y48/

However, people need to seek help for long term issues patiently and not seek fast solutions, especially when it relates to sleep or agitation.

57wfbfih	Thanks my friend.  But I need to correct you on a couple things: psychiatrists know a ton about counseling and CBT; often they are certified as therapists as well. It’s not an issue of training or awareness but an issue of individual psychiatrists and what they do. And psychologists can’t be MDs, MDs are doctors (like psychiatrists).  Both psychologists and psychiatrists can diagnose but the former can’t prescribe medications. CBT can go a long way but there are a number of people who definitely need medication because of organic issues.   Regarding therapist vs psychologist: I’m not familiar with the distinction. But there is a range of people who can do counseling like social workers and marriage counselors. But I’m not sure if those are regarded as therapists.   It’s good to know about this stuff. Thanks again. I only commented because of the practical/conceptual implications and I’m in the medical field and familiar with this sort of stuff.	1643984473.0	hvkas81	t3_skchap	t3_skchap	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skchap/lets_talk_about_therapists_or_psychotherapist_vs/hvkas81/

57wfbfih	Take اخصائي with a grain of salt.   No specific starting age. You can have children on antidepressants (which often are used for anxiety) although it has its nuances.  Yes it’s normal to be on meds for 2 years. It depends on the response and nature of the case.  Schizophrenia needs medication definitely and the sooner it’s started the better. As far as I know they will be for life on medication. But note that psychotic disorders include but are not limited to schizophrenia and they may differ in treatment. Psychotherapy should also help in schizophrenia to teach patients how to deal with delusions/hallucinations etc.	1643986252.0	hvkeyrk	t3_skchap	t1_hvkdvxw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skchap/lets_talk_about_therapists_or_psychotherapist_vs/hvkeyrk/

5pmw6zfc	Don't. Trust me don't. I did the same back in January 2021. Got an offer from jeddah while I lived with my fam in al khobar. My first few months were lonely obviously with brief instances of depression but I started feeling the bachelor vibes of doing everything without anyone's interference. Little did I know, as months passed I started being left out. Loneliness was just a temporary cure but the depression and suicidal thoughts kicked in everyday. It was my first time living alone all by myself. Even though my salary was significant enough to give me a lavish lifestyle but there was something that was missing and kept countering all the good things of living alone. For me, personally that was an experience to learn from. I'm glad that I came back this year, united with my family. Remember one thing, you can be strong financially but mentally it won't last long. This was my experience. We are humans, we have different natures. Your case might be different but this was mine so you can keep this in mind. Goodluck with your future.	1643988290.0	hvkk0me	t3_skfhpl	t3_skfhpl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skfhpl/anyone_else_thinking_about_leaving_their_family/hvkk0me/

62yminpm	I made the decision to leave my family’s home at 17 and it’s been a tough experience so far. I left home because the university in the city my family lives in is new and its reputation sucked. Making that decision was easy but having to live with it is tough, though i had lots of problems with my family as a teenager, i’d still choose that kind of problems over the problems i faced with different roommates across the past 4 years. I think i got used to it now because whenever i’m home for more than a month i feel like i wanna leave and get back to doing what i’m used to do when i’m alone.	1643990243.0	hvkp52l	t3_skfhpl	t3_skfhpl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skfhpl/anyone_else_thinking_about_leaving_their_family/hvkp52l/

From 2019, I was searching for a job and was actually hoping I would get it outside of Jeddah since I just wanted to get out of my parents' house for various reasons, and alhamdulillah, I did.    I believe I made the right choice. I'm not saying that I don't miss my family and friends, but the loneliness is actually nice. I get to do stuff my own way and when I want to do it. I don't have anyone telling me to do something when I'm home.

Why, you ask? because its an anti-social media app. The entire purpose of the app is to be anti-social. Sure you can post pictures of your pets, food, travel and the usual but no one can view it because its an anti-social media app.  Every day you'll get an automated message stating "No communication :-)"	1643998413.0	hvlbg99	t3_skducb	t1_hvl8x5s	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skducb/saudi_social_media/hvlbg99/

Anyone with a job can rent an apartment for a month or so to see how they like it. You can't just say "I don't think I'll like it so no one should even consider it". Living alone doesn't mean forgetting about your family and never visiting.  + I know a close friend who did the same, moved out and everything and he still visits every vacation he gets but he lives the rest of the year alone.	1643999024.0	hvld3l9	t3_skfhpl	t1_hvlbo4g	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skfhpl/anyone_else_thinking_about_leaving_their_family/hvld3l9/

jbnhm	Hello,    I was in your boat a few years ago, currently 23 and just starting to really get the hang of having conversations in Arabic.    Canadian born and spent most my life conversing in English, honestly the most things that helped me is actually speaking to other  people in Arabic,    I hope the lessons end up helping but I feel like our spoken general slang Arabic is way different than the Arabic they teach In lessons, so while they may help it’ll only get you so far until you have to learn to actually converse.   You should find people that talk to you in Arabic but don’t mind you replying in Arabic or English so that you can practice, it’s unrealistic to try and have full conversations in Arabic so try and mix Arabic phrases into your English vocabulary.    Do not be ashamed to ask, I’ve asked my friends countless stupid questions. Lol I learnt what the word اثاث means in my 2nd year of university	1644000159.0	hvlg5qu	t3_skkahs	t3_skkahs	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skkahs/any_saudis_who_struggle_speaking_arabic/hvlg5qu/
cerif5lg	Arabic is one of the most if not the most complicated and difficult language so don’t worry about it. However if you are livign here you will pick up the simple everyday language people use with time just try to use what you learn in conversations	1644000196.0	hvlg9b2	t3_skkahs	t3_skkahs	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skkahs/any_saudis_who_struggle_speaking_arabic/hvlg9b2/
3szsa9r5	Yes 100%. You're entering a new phase in your life and you'll realize that living on your own is a whole different ballgame. Highly recommend.   With WFH I could have moved to my family home in my hometown but I didn't want to go through the comments on how much I'm working (or not), being given house chores instead of having time to myself after work and of course privacy. I have a good relationship with family but once you live on your own   My Saudi female line manager advised me to live alone at that time and I was skeptical but in hindsight it was the right call	1644000228.0	hvlgcf2	t3_skfhpl	t3_skfhpl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skfhpl/anyone_else_thinking_about_leaving_their_family/hvlgcf2/

cfp7stx7	Bro, most of my friends left their family house at 19 off to another city away from Jeddah. They are still living away ever since 10+ years. I left my parents house at 22 as well. To be honest, at some point you have to leave. If you don’t you will never experience life. You get to learn a lot of stuff you would never learn such as: cooking, surviving, budgeting, cleaning, grocery shopping, the ability to differentiate between Coriander and parsly, buy furniture…etc I can go on and on all day.  You will eacape the dependency zone to be independant or even interdependent !  You will have the final say of everything in your life without your parents telling you what to do or what to not do !  The only downside is you will feel home sick or have the felling of lonleness. I never encounter such a thing since I have my schedule full all the time with activites and enjoy my hobbies.  At some point you will need to have a partner (wife) so you can level up or evolve as a human being and reach your psycological needs away from basic needs by eleminatinc intercorse LOL XD…   and Insha’a Allah you establish a very good self-fulfillment needs (google: Maslow's hierarchy)  Hopfully I gave you an idea why you should harry up and start your journey of life as YOU the main Character or player.

It’s very diverse so most of my friends weren’t even Canadian, a few Pakistani, a few Japanese, and a few Jamaicans and it goes on..  The country itself is pretty awesome, really vast; furthest I traveled to was Alberta (right next to BC), amazing weather; especially because I lived in Vancouver it was always sunny and green.

Mainly in the USA but also in other Arab countries... my Arabic was a mixture of all the Arabic dialects....  You will eventually pick it up by time. The hardest thing is not the language barrier... its the mentality/ logics here and trying to deal/ figure it out.

nnael	Ah, of course you had to start with 'pedophile.' You know what a Pedophile is.. someone who rapes children in secret. These girls, and boys also if we're talking about the church, often grow up with mental issues, need years of therapy, etc. It's so common in America that it's a running joke to have a creepy, molesty uncle in the family.     However, when we talk about Aisha and her marriage to Prophet Muhammad, she reached puberty. This is the natural dividing line to start child-bearing age. It isn't some number drawn out of a hat from some old men in an office doesn't take into consideration each individual person's ability or identity. The Prophet died when she was only about 19 years old. Not only was she not a mental wreck, but she was proud of her position as the mother of the believers and continued on after his death for over 40 years teaching his message. She is responsible for about 30% of Islamic law that she continued teaching for many, many years.     So, say what you will.. if that's what you need to make yourself feel better about yourself.	1644081819.0	hvpxldv	t3_shmbyr	t1_hvpw7t6	/r/saudiarabia/comments/shmbyr/number_of_saudi_women_in_the_workforce_throughout/hvpxldv/

gtcujyiq	Oh wow, I can imagine. Especially the openness and acceptance that is present more so today in the country then in the past. And definitely the mentality and lingo is immensely important over here when speaking Arabic.  Also the jokes😂 I feel like it still persists today, but not as much with the younger generation. And lastly for the driving, no need to say more😳 I still get afraid!

I will not be lying, being alone is sometimes good. you have all the time to do whatever you want, literally all the time. but you always will have the missing feeling, I always miss my family, I miss my friends since it's very hard to make friends when you are old and especially here in Riyadh, what I recommend is if you are in the same town your family in, rent your own place but manage your time to spend it with your family and friends. I won't say that this is my pure feelings cause I got the Covid and I am spending the next seven days in my apartment, haha.	1644088256.0	hvqba1b	t3_skfhpl	t3_skfhpl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skfhpl/anyone_else_thinking_about_leaving_their_family/hvqba1b/

I took those Saptco buses around the city and they mostly dropped me nearby wherever I wanted to go and mostly around the same time. Here in Canada it takes an hour an half on bus for the same place I can get to in 25 mins on a car The infrastructure is here but it wastes a lot of time   Uber/Careem is still a lot cheaper than Canada over there and I could ask one of my friend or my father to drop me somewhere in KSA, here I'm just by myself and in the process of getting a driver's license, only got G1 so far.	1644098106.0	hvqub1n	t3_skonqs	t1_hvqs704	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skonqs/what_do_you_think_about_canada_and_canadians/hvqub1n/

9520qw7w	i was not being prideful or thinking that i am superior. there are many things that prove that Islam is the one true religion and you can look them up for example google how Iron came to be on earth and how the prophet PBUH knew that 1400 years ago. we know the Quran was never changed because Allah promised the prophet that he the Almighty will protect the Quaran from "تحريف" {“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its guardian.” (Qur’an, 15:9)} another proof that the Quran is not changed is by the fact that people have been memorizing it and reciting it back to their Quran teachers so we can trace back all those teachers "there's a better word but i forgot it" to the Prophet PBUH.	1644098755.0	hvqvqut	t3_sj3obf	t1_hvqh977	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sj3obf/would_you_react_negatively_if_the_government/hvqvqut/

7g8a5mht	The saptco buses don't have any routes outside of the centre and the older areas. The new bus routes are also not quite the best in terms of someone out in Qurtubah wanting to get to Ishbiliyah, there's basically no coverage. Not to mention the new bus routes are still testing and aren't even open.    The public transport infrastructure is still rubbish here in Riyadh, alhamdulilah changes are being made but they're slow. That's only with Riyadh too, there's no metro or new BRT network under construction in the other cities.	1644098975.0	hvqw80h	t3_skonqs	t1_hvqub1n	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skonqs/what_do_you_think_about_canada_and_canadians/hvqw80h/

86byfhui	Dude Im sorry to dissapoint you but Iron existed on earth way before any of the prophets did, secondly all religions believe they're the one true religion and all of them have their reasons for that and as for the Qurans predictions there aren't special since multiple people throughout history predicted alot of things which ended up being or becoming true does that make them prophets? also again we can never know if God actually said that to prophet Muhammad and we still can't absolutely 100% confirm that the Quran was untouched for 1400 years, Im not an atheist by any means and I do believe in a creator however I believe the almighty wouldn't bother with sending prophets or making religions considering a being of enough power to create multiple planets and universes wouldn't care if humans knew about him or even worshipped him unless he was narcissistic then that's a different story.	1644100501.0	hvqzllu	t3_sj3obf	t1_hvqvqut	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sj3obf/would_you_react_negatively_if_the_government/hvqzllu/

Two major problems: 1- it's hard to find workshop that fixes french cars 2- the car parts are expensive af! More expensive than Lexus parts and im not exaggerating since i had a lexus before.

aw1ll	There are hundreds of online, [atheist, AA meetings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AuWy7FKCG-R_pyRZzEjFXkH-Rw_0VEzi/edit#gid=104829153) in many different languages and a different times. Most use Zoom.  I've found lots of community, friendship and support in staying stopped, without Gods, Supernatural Powers, Spirtual Woo-Woo, Prayers, Mumbo Jumbo or having to twist 'God as We Understood Him' into "not-a-God as We Understood Him".  There's also a WhatsApp group, [Secular Sober Info](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IDCMRyG00Zy8MkJmVKNLGQ). which has masses of information on new meetings, conventions, community information etc. Also, [aaagnostica.org](https://aaagnostica.org).  I know the steps and the Big Book is full of supernatural powers but there are loads of [valid, alternative 12 steps](https://aaagnostica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/A-Collection-of-Alternative-Steps-2012-07-09.pdf), which don't have any mention of God or prayers. The AA fundamentalist will say that isn't real AA but Bill Wilson who wrote the 12 Steps, [supported substituting God for something else](https://www.aatorontoagnostics.com/aa-comes-of-age) for those with other beliefs.	1644149010.0	hvswpec	t3_slgooe	t3_slgooe	/r/saudiarabia/comments/slgooe/is_there_aa_around_here_i_dont_want_to_lose_my/hvswpec/

The person who posted the question asked why Saudi first got involved and I just was giving a very basic explanation. Iran and Saudi are engaged in a proxy war in Yemen but the conflict is much deeper.

b1iwn3u1	I unrooted my phone a few months ago after 10 years of using rooted android phones. Bottom line is that you don't need root anymore with the newer android versions, for the following reasons: 1- youtube vanced works on unrooted devices 2- ads can be blocked using custom DNS 3- new OSs are becoming more and more customizable and the need for a custom room is decreasing 4- avoiding root detection is a hassle because you have to look for ways to hide root for every individual app. 5- companies and corporations are getting smarter everyday at adding security features that can easily detect root that even the root community can't keep up with it. Stcpay is an example.	1644154626.0	hvt5kxr	t3_slpckd	t3_slpckd	/r/saudiarabia/comments/slpckd/you_can_use_root_and_tawakalna/hvt5kxr/

izyh2ebw	That's why it's important to do it in a way that works. As I said, if you just kill them all, they will be replaced by other cats who will want to take over those now free hunting grounds. If you sterilize them, there is less food and space to go around for non sterilized cats and their offspring. This lowers the population over time more effectively than just killing all of the cats, only to have to do it again in a few months.	1644169516.0	hvu3q6w	t3_slhjdf	t1_hvtpbb1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/slhjdf/cats_disappearing/hvu3q6w/

Lawrence (ie. Lawrence of Arabia), except he was sent to the gulf, and after he saw the Europeans screwing Lawrence over and reneging on their promises, he sided with King Abdulaziz over his own country. His son Kim Philby is also famous for later becoming a double agent against the UK for the soviets.	1644217783.0	hvx1i8g	t3_sm68n0	t1_hvuzcau	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm68n0/just_found_out_that_stanna_is_swedish_means_wait/hvx1i8g/

e4alwn5u	Yea so you can't criticize a government that's allowing musicians to come over and is openly letting the sexes mix etc waging a war on another Muslim country .. I wonder where those ahadiths came from that say you can't criticize Muslim governments.(also I love KSA and an don't mind the whole modernization but what I do mind is intolerance). Also I don't care about Sufism and I am no scholar of Islam but I do know this I would put the Qur'an above anything else even ahadiths I believe ahadiths are susceptible to misinterpretations and misrepresentations ..and also if you want someone to come to your religion you should be a little more kind rather than mocking Their faith .. explain to them in a nice an polite way that this is not the way guide them .. do not criticize them for that may turn them further away from the religion..	1644223813.0	hvx9ldy	t3_smi9qv	t1_hvx1v5r	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smi9qv/this_cat_is_a_muslim_astronomer_this_is_the/hvx9ldy/

You can find it on their website and there is a video lecture on the topic that was uploaded to YouTube, if you have trouble reading. Also, Saudi and Iran relations are very new. For many years, they have not had any diplomatic relationship. During the start of the war, they did not have any relationship so you saying “oh but they are friends now” holds no weight.	1644230124.0	hvxhbun	t3_slgbmh	t1_hvxfd86	/r/saudiarabia/comments/slgbmh/why_does_the_saudi_government_attack_yemen_in_the/hvxhbun/
dy2yzpuj	advice from an expat here  ur coming from Germany so remember this, this country is not what u call "normal" in a sense of work ethics and value and pay.  in germany if a employer pays someone less because of his skin colour or his passport, its considers racist and people will boycott that store or that band. here its the norm, its doesn't depend weather if u went to canada or germany for education u will still be paid 4 to 2 times less then a white(person from western countries). generally expat from south asia get 4 times less salary and a saudi 2 or 1.5 less then ur salaries.  2. ur valued more then that man brown man even those u might work less hours, ur give less results.  3. this unfortunately country has white privileges   4. its treats its minority(asian) in a term that considers as apartheid, no place on earth has this much of differing rules  for citizen and expat literally.	1644230157.0	hvxhdcc	t3_sm2j1q	t3_sm2j1q	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm2j1q/i_am_moving_to_ksa/hvxhdcc/

74cg9sr3	1. Houthis do not rule Yemen. A simple google search will tell you that.  2. Do another google search on what muslim countries have supported Yemen throughout its history.  Do another search on Yemeni expats and what countries they live in.  I never said people should go and fight... there are options... like opening negotiations before things escalated.  Right now whats stopping Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, or any other muslim country try to talk to the parties to end it the violence now?  Nobody is doing anything.  Islam teahces us if two muslim parties are about to fight... muslims need to step up and try to resolve it. The party that insists on violence should be fought by all. This is exactly what Saudi is doing. It attempted to mediate between the Houthis and Yemen government (all shia btw) Houthis chose violence.	1644232382.0	hvxk6am	t3_slgbmh	t1_hvxa1e3	/r/saudiarabia/comments/slgbmh/why_does_the_saudi_government_attack_yemen_in_the/hvxk6am/

sd4imp8	First off, I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors, and I'm sorry to hear about your current company not being as flexible as you need them to be.  As to moving to KSA, here's my view after living here for over 6 years  1- This is a completely different culture than EU, the country is tranforming rapidly, and you are moving into one of the most open minded areas in KSA  2- Most of the people in this country are amazing, you will definitely meet assholes here and there, however you will meet the most generous, kind, and welcoming people here  3- In regards to work, there is plenty, and I'm sure you can find something, however you need to realize that there are a lot of localization initiatives, and the labor market is tipping towards Saudi employees more and more everyday, as they have been pushing into qualifying more of them to occupy all positions, so take that with a pinch of salt, thay being said more than 30% of the workforce are expats  4- The quality of life is great, the pay scale is higher than most of world, the expenses had gotten higher lately, but is still very very competitive  5- If drinking is a very dear activity to you, you should already know that it would be very hard to come by "and illegal as well", so just take it in consideration  Just to highlight, no one will care about your religion, racism does exist, but as others highlighted its unfortunately directed towards some asian countries, so you shouldn't have to worry about that  This is a very peacful, and caring country, your rights will be considered, as long as you are respectful of others, and of the difference in culture, you will have great time	1644233998.0	hvxmf26	t3_sm2j1q	t3_sm2j1q	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm2j1q/i_am_moving_to_ksa/hvxmf26/
h2ns8l5i	Replying to comment of people who say salaries and employment is racist:   I think the variance of salaries have completely nothing to do with color. It’s about salary adjusted to country of origin, me in healthcare I worked side by side with American, and French doctors, French doctor have almost one third of his American counterpart in Saudi Arabia, but ofcourse little bit more than what would he get in france, but earns more than what he would in france because tax exemption. Same for a Russian doctor in SA, he would get one third of what a French get, and they’re all white, it’s about country of origin and what would the same employee get back in their country.   That’s a side. Yes you can find a job, jeddah and Riyadh are good market, if you talk fluent English then it’s advantage.	1644234125.0	hvxmlgs	t3_sm2j1q	t3_sm2j1q	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm2j1q/i_am_moving_to_ksa/hvxmlgs/

gra1uc5g	Because al-Jazeera is a news source, they create bulletins for short reads and are therefore not a reliable source. Academic reports are months and years in the making, extensive interviews, analysis, and themes. Al-Jazeera have also been proven to lie. Example: During the Arab Spring, they had a “live broadcast” of a protest. A member of the public who lived in the apartment block overlooking that square, showed that there was non protest happening. This is something that the company admitted to and their reporters were fired. Al-Jazeera has no credibility and I would suggest you read reliable sources in future so you can strengthen your argument.	1644236693.0	hvxqi7l	t3_slgbmh	t1_hvxm457	/r/saudiarabia/comments/slgbmh/why_does_the_saudi_government_attack_yemen_in_the/hvxqi7l/

jbnhm	I’ll try and keep it short since a lot was covered in other answers.   You’ll most likely only find a job if you’re considered a Senior SWE, also there isn’t a huge variety of tech stacks being used so I wish you good luck, most lower level SWE are exclusively being given to Saudis.   Depending on where you choose to live (Compounds) you can have a pretty westernized life, in addition to most of your neighbors also being expats.   Despite what other people say and it’s legality, drinking is pretty common here especially amongst expats, usually the embassy/consulate can help in that regards, and if not it’s definitely still available through “other” channels.   Now sadly we don’t have a Nurburgring equivalent but the car community here is definitely going into the right direction. Jeddah’s track is called square track , although it’s not where near the size of the Nurburgring.	1644236982.0	hvxqyuf	t3_sm2j1q	t3_sm2j1q	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm2j1q/i_am_moving_to_ksa/hvxqyuf/

You are pointing out Al Jazeera and moving the discussion in that direction when no one mentioned it or cited from it. That is called being skeptical. You regard what aligns with the Saudi government as right and what doesn't as wrong. No one mentioned academic reports yet you bring it into the conversation out of insecurity to show that you are smart. You see, the reason why I am saying we will see soon is because nothing will change your heart or mine other than the upcoming events.

h2ns8l5i	You don’t need to apologize, you haven’t committed any offense. Also labeling this problem racism is inaccurate, here is simple definition of racism « Racism is the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to inherited attributes and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another. » that has being said, let’s take this example, Indian born English citizenship holder will definitely be paid multiple times higher in Saudi than Indian born Indian citizenship holder, we can’t deny that, and note they’re the same race. Second: to explain why this exist as a system is for a simple fact, Saudi like GCC, don’t offer pathway to citizenship and doesn’t have income tax, therefore the regulator doesn’t have incestive to focus on creation of highly paying jobs because they don’t have revenue from tax income, that why we have many jobs like cashiers, gas pump worker, jobs that largely automatized in the west and Far East. Also because SA doesn’t have pathway to citizenship, therefore it attract less qualified workers, if you’re Egyptian/Syrian/Jordanian.. etc and you got an offering in Italy, England.. etc, for example, the logical reasoning to go there even if it pay less than if you already got offer in Saudi, for simple fact, you don’t want to see your family and children kicked off country when you retire and you get a retirement stipend even if it is low. The workers who come to GCC from low income countries are less qualified than their collagues who get a chance in the west, that why many will reimmigrate to the west if they get a chance. Also this means why things are done badly in Saudi, foreign workers are not interested to train citizens of country who won’t take care of him if they grow old. That’s why we’re locked in a loop.   Myself, I’m advocate for income tax, and pathway citizenship, this will attract better qualified workers, stop useless jobs like gas pump workers (with all respect, it’s crucifying job sometimes under the heat), but you must realize as well, that you may not find a work visa, since Saudis will start to put regulations to only allow workers from countries of similar income or little less, so they can protect their income, Which may hurt so many workers from very low to low income countries even further.	1644240626.0	hvxxiqj	t3_sm2j1q	t1_hvxqj6n	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm2j1q/i_am_moving_to_ksa/hvxxiqj/

Or they will know the card you used to pay is not an American card. Very rarely you will get lucky and Apple ships it to you but majority of the time the item gets from accepted then processing to cancelled in a week or so. Not worth it.	1644242540.0	hvy1dje	t3_smo3gl	t3_smo3gl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smo3gl/looking_for_a_us_website_that_ships_apple/hvy1dje/
33r2gly3	It appears the cheapest place to purchase apple products is the USA. Double check by Browsing Apple store pricing in KSA, UAE, UK, HK & Singapore.   Best bet is to purchase and ship to a local address, then have them ship it to you. Apple won’t let you purchase from KSA without a local ship to address, so you’ll need a trusted friend to help you. This might be cheaper even with the extra shipping charge to KSA, but you’ll not have a local KSA warranty.   US have excellent 2nd hand deals that might make it worth your while, but a local address might be also needed. Pros and cons for either option. Good luck.	1644242942.0	hvy2898	t3_smo3gl	t3_smo3gl	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smo3gl/looking_for_a_us_website_that_ships_apple/hvy2898/

dy2yzpuj	first: there is income tax here and its dependence fee, its drains account of many expat familes. it contributes to 30 to 20% of there income drain.    second: do u dare state that my brothers that come here are mere idiots? that are less qualified then there western counterparts? to some degree yes,  a lot are but a majority have the same fucking jobs as white and still get paid less with the same skill set.   ur points are correct but its doesn't answer the fact that a person holding a western degree is still paid less compare to a white in the same job.	1644243857.0	hvy47lj	t3_sm2j1q	t1_hvxxiqj	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sm2j1q/i_am_moving_to_ksa/hvy47lj/

Second, qualification is not intelligence, it’s piece of paper that help HR categorize you better, I have seen stupid saudi doctors train in US, and extremely Saudi smart doctors train in unwanted area like hail, yet, the one who train in US is most likely have better job skills to address different job problems that local saudi trained locally most likely may have but on less probability. That why a hospital like KFSRC, would employ the rather, they can’t assess skills, but they can assess paper.

2t3m7o8h	Offcourse I will suggest you first go to a therapist. But the best advice I can give you for now is to stop overthinking, avoid going too deep into thinking about the future, your life, studies etc, just tell yourself repeatedly to live in the present. Whenever you notice your mind wandering off snap yourself back to the present and focus on the present.   Worrying about anything isn't going to change it, worrying literally doesn't accomplish anything, so just live the days as they come and busy yourself, try out new things and see what interests you.	1644262013.0	hvzdl6h	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzdl6h/
57wfbfih	Hi. It’s great you’re aware that your thoughts are concerning. It’s definitely a tough situation to be in. But I’ll tell you you’ll turn into a very strong lady.   Thoughts of harming yourself should not be ignored. If you can’t get to mental health clinics then use online resources (https://www.moh.gov.sa/Ministry/Information-and-services/Pages/psychiatry.aspx). You can chat in Sehaty or call 937. If you’re confident in English you can use some other online services like BetterHelp or other ones.   You need a support system. Don’t shy from asking for help and support. If your school has a good advisor system reach out to it. Family of course is the first line but if you couldn’t get them to help you that’s okay.   Take your first step to getting help (you already did, but go on) and you’ll be thankful. You’re ABSOLUTELY not alone.	1644262406.0	hvzeler	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzeler/

izcgi3j1	Your parents being separated will definitely have had impacted you and will still have a impact on you. It's difficult.  It comes in a hadith from the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in sunnan Abi Dawood: أبغض الحلال إلى الله الطلاق (the most hated thing with Allaah from the things that are permissible is divorce)  I know someone who was homeschooled and he was very socially awkward initially but the more he started interacting with people I noticed he gained loads of confidence, much more than me! So don't worry too much about being socially awkward around others, try as best as possible to put yourself in social situations and at first it will tough and you'll feel anxious, uncomfortable, not knowing how to act or what to say but eventually you'll gain confidence and those feelings will go.   Unfortunately when you've asked for advice people haven't listened to you. They had good intentions in directing you towards praying and reading Qur'an. I think it would be good if someone listened to you and how you feel, even if they didn't offer advice sometimes someone listening helps alot.  I know you asked for non religious advice but don't forget that Allaah wants ease for you and doesn't want hardship   أبشري	1644263616.0	hvzhple	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzhple/
3ai9x429	Hi there. I am no expert, heck not even read any meaningful report on mental health. But I would like to try to give you some comfort. Today, mental has been proven to be medical issue. There is no harm or shame in owning it up. There are good doctors who can diagnose the issue and assist you. If you haven't spoken to your mother then please do open up to her about the situation you are going through.   Unfortunately, in Asia mental health is taken as person going mad which is totally not true. If your relatives brush it aside then you on your own try to seek medical help. Am sure there will be some good clinics around your place.   You do have the courage to make friends. Your post here is a testament to that. Who says you are poor linguistic? Read your own post. It is excellent, very well worded and concise.  Maybe you can start writing some good stories with the language command that is displayed in the post.   Maybe you haven't found the right people with whom you can gel up. You can make some good friends on social media without knowing each other personally.  Long back people used to have pen pals without ever meeting each other.   Go for the hobby that you like and try to excel at it. Do things that interest you. Forget about what's going to happen next minute, next month, next year. Whatever Allah wills will happen no matter what. So why worry about it today. Face every day as it comes. Try not to think what will happen tomorrow. The vicious cycle you are going through needs to be broken and replaced with constructive one.   Reading Quran is good. I do it daily after Fajar salah. I do my best daily. No one knows who is going to heaven and who to hell. Then why do you think you are going to hell? It's not in your command or control so try to make peace with the fact.   Today everyone is anxious and on edge. You are not alone. This horrible environment we are in globally has put all of us in some kind of strain.   Suicidal thoughts will be there but you need to be strong. Owning up to the mental health issue shows you have the trait.  Take small steps at a time. Things will fall in place. And over time you will be a different person mentally. Set some positive targets and promise yourself that you will do your best to achieve it.   Find a Reddit sub that deals with mental health and participate in it. Feel free to vent your frustrations and thoughts here. We will be listening and doing our best to support and comfort you.   May Allah bless you with good health and peace, Ameen.	1644263820.0	hvzi8mi	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzi8mi/

However, you should call them and make a claim that the internet wasn’t working for 3 days, they are obligated to remove 3 days from your bill (i.e. your bill is 300 and they had a problem for 5 days, you should only pay 250 then)	1644264076.0	hvziwjt	t3_smutb4	t3_smutb4	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smutb4/stc_customer_service_sucksinternet_not_fix_unitl/hvziwjt/
9qu8hjcv	Hi OP, I wish there was something that can instantly ease your thoughts and feelings. I don’t have a lot to share but back when my social anxiety was really bad I soothed myself by playing games and shifting my focus from the overthinking in my head to the game I played.   I chose a very chill idle game, it wasn’t challenging nor difficult it was just… walking around building cute shit and talking to cute animals. Usually playing it would prevent me from passing out after a social interaction.   I don’t know how I got over it, eventually I was able to talk to people without rehearsing it a million times in my head, but what helped for sure is knowing how my body reacts before an attack so I could mentally self-sooth before it escalates.   There are a lot of things going on in your life, so many stressors at the same time. It’s okay if you feel like a mess, the situation IS messy and most of it is out of your control. But what you can do is to only focus on the things you CAN do. Don’t be too hard on yourself too, you have a lot on your plate. Find a healthy escape, it’ll help clear out your thoughts and makes it less noisy in your head.	1644264433.0	hvzjtfx	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzjtfx/

Before I didn’t  prayer with proper care or think of reading Quran but now that I pray almost 4 times a day and read Quran once a day, my life became much simpler and easier. Trust me, one way of enlighten and getting rid of hard days could only be lifted once you take Deen seriously.

4db4mch7	Hey there. I’ve seen a couple of comments so I don’t become repetitive in my advice.  First of all I pray that you get through this and never go back to this mental state. But prayer isn’t enough, something needs to be done to help you.   Idk how traditional your family is, but from my impression of brushing off your problems they kind of are. I would recommend sitting down with you better parent (the one you see as relatively more open minded) and talk about how you are feeling, and to demand medical attention. If they say “oh no you don’t need that, just pray and read Quran” or something to that extent, try to convince them that it isn’t enough. If they still don’t budge contact 911 and ask for help (not sure how much this would help tbh but Ig it’s worth a shot).   About making friends. Well in today’s age you don’t need to go out to meet new people, tons of communities are out here on Reddit and other forums. Not sure what your interests are (movies, books, manga/anime…etc).    And if you are down for it, you can try playing video games if you don’t.   And if you want someone kinda close to your age(I am 19), feel free to send me a DM. Couple of my friends have went though very tough stressful times, and being a very unhealthy state, and I would like to think I did something. To help them.   But you HAVE to know, we Redditors here in this sub will help you as best we can.   I’ve also had a very low point in my life(depression, contemplaiting allah’s existence). it isn’t as bad as yours but I found a way to survive   الله يصبرك و يعينك و يطلع من الكرب هذا.	1644268457.0	hvzua1v	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzua1v/

4kdlunom	Hey little one, I hope this finds you in good health. The first thing I'll say is, I'm sorry about your parents, but there is always a reason. I'm not Saudi, so I can't speak to the culture, but there was a huge stigma attached where I'm from. Like you, I was raised by my mother with my brother. It wasn't easy, and there were many trials - from familial stigma to societal stigma.                            I'm not going to pretend to be able to diagnose - I'm not a medical professional. What I can offer you is this: support. You said social situations make you nervous, if you want, we can run through different situations, eg: how to order food at a restaurant, how to return an item, how to call if you need to order something, etc. I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, but it will hopefully help. I have a friend who has extreme social anxiety and I've helped her for the past 5 years to overcome her anxiety and self doubts. It's not something I've done on my own, she's getting professional help as well. Just as an aside, "poor linguistic skills"? Are you serious? You articulated your feelings and thoughts incredibly well. Especially when it's such a delicate subject - talking about it isn't easy, however, it's the first step to overcoming this! Well done, for what it's worth, I'm proud of you.                             I know right now it seems as if friends and social circles are the most important thing, but don't put pressure on yourself to turn into someone you aren't comfortable with. Do you have any family members you can interact with? Female cousins who you can talk to and start finding out about stuff they talk about, stuff that they're interested in, and if it interests you, find out more about it. Don't give up on hobbies, there are many out there and you can always try something new! Also, if you're interested, you can always volunteer at an animal shelter - hell, it's something I'm considering. It helps me do something good, meet new people, interact with new people, and try to follow my own advice: be the change you wish to see in this world.                                  As far as the suicidal thoughts go, I'm once again not a qualified professional. Getting past this state is not easy, I've been in that position before. Granted it isn't the same as you, but I've been in this position. In my experience, the first thing to do is to make a schedule and do you best to stick to it. Once you start building a routine, it will help you to focus. If you falter, don't fault yourself. It happens little one, it's alright.                               I know about the religious response, and I've been there. I know you might not think it's helping, but I promise you, it helps. It's not something that you can see, and I myself had doubts. But I pushed them aside. I'm now in a much better position than I could ever imagine, and you know what? When things started working out, I kept to it more than ever. I never knew how things worked out, but they did. I know you asked for non-religious advice and that's why I put this at the end.                                    Stay strong little one. I'm glad you're here with us today, and I'll be glad you're here us tomorrow and every day after that.                                      One more thing: focus on your studies - make education your priority, it's the one thing my mother prioritized when we were growing up - it's one thing that no one can take away from you.	1644269638.0	hvzxd5o	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hvzxd5o/

4n5hh2z5	Well I kind of now what you're going through I'm diagnosed with social anxiety and depression and for years I thought I will not come out of the hole I'm In I'm not out completely but I'm close I think   About your family most people in Saudi Arabia are ignorant about mental health and won't understand what you are feeling and how to help but if they want to help teach them how to , and about being told to pray I know it's may not seem like the answer and it's not medicall but it could really help if you pray and read the Quran it will reduce your anxiety and stress and it's backed by studies and research    And about your Social Anxiety I'm not a doctor or an expert but I want help you with what I got, going to psychiatrist might help having some anti-anxiety meds might help too but it won't help on it's own you have to try try talking in front of the mirror to build up confidence because if you feel confident that will crush the anxiety and most importantly don't give in to the fear and anxiety it will consume you believe me I've been there it will take over and it won't let go until you fight it, so about school I used to throw up just with the thought of going to it but it's only bad at the beginning then If you get used to it it won't be so bad you can reduce your anxiety by going to the supermarket the pharmacy or anywhere you can do quick shopping I know everything is online now but you have to go to start getting used to it first few times just walk in buy what you want and then leave but later just greet them by hi or whatever you like just take it one step at a time you know! baby steps you won't see change at first but after some time you will have to step back and see the bigger picture and it will be easier from then, I literally can speak about this for hours but I won't take more of your time if you want to talk about anything vent or anything I'm here  respond to my comment or private message me whatever you're comfortable with just remember baby steps and it won't be easy but it can be done	1644271585.0	hw02aso	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw02aso/

85zj9ftc	Honestly, I would describe my experience with labyh as terrible. I tried to book an appointment for a long time, but I couldn't BC they had some technical issues with payment :).  I was in a very very bad state for weeks trying to book an appointment every day, but sadly,  I couldn’t, and by the time that they solved the problem I'd gotten worse. But the worst part is not the fact that I had to wait for weeks in a bad mental state, but rather the fact that my waiting and hopes were for nothing BC the therapist told me "اتمنى تتخطين" but in other words.	1644273989.0	hw088dw	t3_smy2r5	t1_hvzwpo0	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw088dw/
3vfyzi8t	Assuming you’re Saudi, I studied software engineering in King Saud University (graduated this year), and honesty it’s competitive as there is a demand on cs majors right now, but it’s not impossible (like medicine where competition is literally just crazy). That’s in KSU but in other universities it’s less competitive I guess as the students average is lower. One important note, in most universities you don’t directly get into studying the major, you get accepted first into a preparatory program for a year or a semester (depends on uni) then you get majored based on your GPA. For example in KSU I first got accepted to science track (for people who want to major in science and stem) to study general courses (stats/math..etc) then based on my GPA I got accepted into software engineering major. If you need further info DM me, but mind you I really have no idea of any system of another university other than KSU.. good luck!	1644274431.0	hw09bii	t3_smxchs	t3_smxchs	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smxchs/university/hw09bii/

Meet with your family/friends and listen to their problems and find solutions for them.

sa6nz	The responses to this post are awesome.  I just want to add that you are human and it is totally normal to have ups and downs.  You've shown great self awareness just by expressing yourself via this post.  I personally believe that is a good step towards relief.  Here is a non religious suggestion, exercise!  (Not a suggestion to solve your problems, but a suggestion that could bring you some temporary physical relief)  Even if it is for a short burst of 15 minutes.  Get the heart rate up.  Make some muscles sore.  The hope here is that you get the natural endorphins to release from the brain.  For me, exercise has given a good "break" from my troubles.  You get to focus on your breathing and ensuring you are following the appropriate technique.  The added benefit comes from that high you experience from the endorphin release (totally natural!!!!, not suggesting that drugs are the answer).  You might even find yourself enjoying a nap afterwards and waking up feeling refreshed.  I'm not qualified to give any advice about mental health.  I just want to re-emphasize that you are not alone and that the feelings you describe are more common than people would like to admit.  May Allah SWT reward you with good.  Please keep pushing forward, one day at a time.	1644280867.0	hw0oclg	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw0oclg/
2r4t7gsh	You should not wait any longer without getting help  I got through a lot of similar issues that you had due to things that I can’t control not long ago.  I was always depressed, sleep deprived and socially isolated.   I was scared of the stigma of going to a psychiatrist and tried my best to find another way to deal with it.  I pushed my self so much that it started to impact my physical health.  Then one day I had enough, I said screw everyone and went to a psychiatrist. Believe me when I tell you that it was the best decision I made and I think my self every day for that.  I was given medications which controlled both my depression, anxiety and insomnia. They take up to 3 weeks to start working, but when they do, they are a game changer.  And the “social stigma” that I was worried about? No one even cared! I was afraid of nothing due to my anxiety apparently.  I suggest that you start to discuss this with your mother if you feel comfortable, if not, go there on your own. You are the only one who can feel how hard it is to carry that burden.

ml74dqj	Hi,i’m sorry that you feel that way, it really does suck a lot.   i wouldn’t call myself a professional, but from what i’ve read about not able to focus, check if you have adhd, it might be causes of not able to do certain tasks, I only knew about it like this year as i’m 1st year uni right now, it is not something you can easily be aware of as it is really subtle.  As for social engagement, i’ll be honest, I’m kind of an introvert myself but suuper extrovert online, so i didn’t have made a super long lasting friendships, the longest one so far is 4 years. so I kind of understand what you’re going through , for example first year high school was hell for me since i felt that i was in an alien place cuz i moved out from my old place to a whole new one. But over time i got rare people who knew more and more about me and eventually they introduced me to others  I didn’t have a suicidal contemplation per se, but i have such a low point like at the start of last year that i’ve quit my new year’s resolutions and just think it’s the end point for me and no more future, but I managed to go thru that at least!  Unfortunately i don’t have advices when it comes to this , but if you need somebody to talk with, I’m like terminally online so feel free to send a DM to me!	1644297753.0	hw1ozgp	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw1ozgp/

9ylk4pzb	Hello there, from your description of your present state of mind I think from my own experience in the same situations as yours you are probably having anxiety/ depression or under spell of black magic.Or it can be a combination of both...what I mean is that if you are affected by black magic over a long period anxiety/ depression may result.Because most of the symptoms of black magic are similar to anxiety/depression. It's best to get help for your black magic spell then followed with professional help from a psychiatrist.Or you can concurrently get help from both sides.Before seeing a psychiatrist you may need to see a GP and he may refer you to a mental specialist... I hope you would get well soon,InshaAllah....	1644299131.0	hw1rd9a	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw1rd9a/

j63q6x92	 A Saudi artist says he created this montage as an homage to King Faisal and a beloved “Star Wars” character. The setting is the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco in 1945. The artist’s work somehow ended up in a high school social studies textbook. [Here!](https://imgur.com/a/CVuPKGq)  The artwork featured in a section about the United Nations in a high school social studies textbook in Saudi Arabia.  The initial inspiration, Shaweesh said, was a photograph of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat standing beside Mickey Mouse during a visit to Disneyland.  "Someone should have checked the image before printing," he added.

I really do appreciate every single advice and help that was given out to me, I will try my best to get better and follow your advices/suggestions. Every single comment was very well thought out and helpful, I want to thank you all personally but I am afraid of giving repetitive replies and seeming non-genuine (I am not the best with replying) so I am sorry. I just want say to everyone that reached out to me privately or replied to my post that you saved my life at least for another day, I’m very grateful. I honestly wasn’t expecting such a supportive community, but can say that I am very pleasantly surprised.   I am now encouraged to get better and seek out and demand professional help.  Lastly, if anyone is going through a similar situation and wants someone to relate to and talk to please don’t hesitate to DM me.  I hope that everyone who is having a hard time gets their deserved relief.

6ae5e1ey	Dear justto,  I’ve been suffering my whole life of instability. I’m 32 years old and I’ve been literally struggling with every aspect of my life. Can’t say there weren’t moments of joys, but they’re short and always feel bad during them like if I don’t deserve them. I’ve been through all thoughts suicidal and beyond.  Let substitute this for you: For myself I feel that there’s a big gap inside me, I’ve always felt less and always preoccupied with the void of nothing. Since I was aging, I sometimes blamed people and communities. For such that, I was sometimes very strictly religious and other phases of my life I transitioned to be an atheist. All that was a part of trying to fit into something but it never worked.   Lately, I started when ever I feel weird or not well inside I figured out why not trying to analyze why I’m feeling that and try to connect it with every aspect of my life? It did actually kinda worked. All I needed was to express myself and to say what’s been laying in my chest for decades. I’ve been victimized A lot and I figured out that most of these psychological problems started from early childhood and the bigger part of the problem are indeed the parents.  I took a paper and started to write down everything without feeling ashamed. Till the point that I finally can tell why I feel less of myself. Why I’m always thinking like a crazy. I needed to be with myself alone for couple of weeks in order to be clear minded.  I’ve also took this assessment from MOH which indicates that I’m very depressed VERY.  https://www.moh.gov.sa/HealthAwareness/MedicalTools/Pages/depressiontest.aspx  I would advise you to visit a specialist but before you do you need to understand your problem and to be honest with yourself. That’s half the cure.  Finally I really feel you and I wish you well and happiness.	1644311430.0	hw28jfw	t3_smy2r5	t3_smy2r5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw28jfw/

ikh3qny0	 I really feel you and relate to to you. I am sorry that you feel that way and I am very glad that you have taken the first step to face your feelings and get better.  The feelings of emptiness and sadness since childhood, you wouldn’t know how to deal with such emotions especially as a young child. Being in a non-supportive environment and no one to lean on on top of that makes the situation worse. Because these feelings are not dealt with and are always suppressed, they just keep growing and growing. The hole just grows bigger.  It starts feeling comfortable, familiar and becomes harder to face. After a long time you get emotional in a way that is the deepest sadness, nothing is sadder than being piled up in sadness and nothing else. You’re very inspiring and strong, thank you for sharing your experience and advice with me. I truly wish you all the best.	1644314022.0	hw2blho	t3_smy2r5	t1_hw28jfw	/r/saudiarabia/comments/smy2r5/mental_healthlife_advice_seeking_i_am_lost/hw2blho/

a9w3zb7s	As a finance student I can tell you that when something is shariah compliant it is halal. The difficulty is finding whether or not it actually is shariah compliant or just simply is covered as bullshit. Look into Murabaha and Diminishing Musharaka. Equity investing is always halal, (not derivatives, you can dyor on that) and debt can be halal IF it’s done in a shariah compliant method which structures it in a halal way. Of course dyor.

haakkk0n	Yeah, I usually speak English but with my parents it's in Arabic. I find myself mispronouncing words sometimes cause my online friends are all English speakers so it's hard for me personally to shift back and forth. Even my dad calls me out on it numerous times and regrets putting me in a fully English school. For a time I didn't speak with my friends for a while, and I found my Arabic improving by talking with my cousins and other family. I can still hold a conversation fairly well but again, the problem of mispronunciation and forgetting vocabulary is there even though most of what I want to say is in the back of my mind. Plus, everything that I consume online is in English cause let's be honest here, it's more varied and better. And that certainly doesn't help. I'm still in University, but I can imagine once I get a job I'll be forced to improve it. My advice is don't stress, it will come to you eventually. I'm personally not helping my situation but you're at least doing something, which is good.	1644335734.0	hw3fbu2	t3_skkahs	t3_skkahs	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skkahs/any_saudis_who_struggle_speaking_arabic/hw3fbu2/

I was waiting for the elevator and it opened, I saw 5 English women that were taller than me (5'10 or 5'11) in bikinis and skirts. I was so fucking embarrassed but I thought in my head it'd be more embarrassing if I don't go in. I kept staring at my phone the entire time...that was the longest elevator ride of my life.	1644336389.0	hw3h20b	t3_sjwarq	t3_sjwarq	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sjwarq/is_it_disrespectful_to_enter_a_elevator_full_of/hw3h20b/

3yemok5	No not really, I know you want to make a conspiracy from a simple cultural aspect. Even though i lean towards modernism, but I want to see a modern society that still maintain it's culture aspects.   It's a simple cultural dress, and it's great to see people maintain it even if they dont want too, like attending a marriage or funeral, it wont really harm you to wear it, but it will help all of us maintain an identity, and not go with westernization "herd".   Check out what Jordanian used to wear in the best, and now their formal dress because suits, the same goes for many many other cultures.   And to answer the question in your title, no, I don't see saudis collectively moving on from the thoub in the future, I believe we will embrace it more because the newer generations are all about cultural identity.	1644340192.0	hw3rcjf	t3_snnxme	t3_snnxme	/r/saudiarabia/comments/snnxme/do_you_see_saudi_collectively_moving_on_from_the/hw3rcjf/

I just asked my sister (she’s a doctor with MOH), she said it’s not identified as a disability by the ministry of health, but also not denied. So your best option is to get diagnosed and let your doctor write an official letter if your case is considered a disability.

If you have uni offer letter or an id card with valid dates, that should work.  Companies usually don't trouble their employees when their dependents turn 18.

A lot of them are bad, and money hungry people and you should do your best and stay away from them.  Why they're insisting on transfer? Transfer is compulsory for a dependent if they're 25 and above. Are they trying not to pay the iqama expenses for you? If that's the case, stay on your dad's iqama and have your dad pay the expenses.

7k4t7uu9	Quick background: I have Crohns myself since I was 14.. was only diagnosed at 18. Took out appendix when I was 17 and surgery at 20. Started humira last year ( I’m 30)  I don’t see how Crohns is a disability especially if you’re in remission.   The reason I’m posting this because it seemed odd that you were recently diagnosed and have already started biological treatment.  I recommend you get a second opinion.

Some women split the food for her family and for the guests, while others prefer to give the food to the guests and eat what's left of it when they finish to not waste it.

Yes I understand the tradition of taking care of the guest well so eating leftovers makes sense - do the women gather in the same way in a different room or they eat later ?	1644457827.0	hwb5f85	t3_soteeg	t1_hwb1qb1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soteeg/serious_question_how_do_women_eat_during_a/hwb5f85/

ih8dpb8j	Depends on the type of gathering itself. If its family and or relatives some will buy their lamb/meat and give it to a restaurant specializing in cooking big kind of “occasions” food. And when it gets delivered it gets divided between the men and women section.   There would be plenty of food left so mostly it gets stored and each person would get their share of it afterwards, the left overs of this kind of food would always be huge, mostly untouched food and we dont waste food. So we give it away.    However if its a smaller and its just the guy inviting his male friends or its a men only occasion it can be 1 of 2 things  1. same as in the first part explained, and the host would give his female family members their share of the food too.   2. the women would be cooking the feast.	1644458759.0	hwb7m60	t3_soteeg	t3_soteeg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soteeg/serious_question_how_do_women_eat_during_a/hwb7m60/
7y4inxka	They do gather by inviting guests to their houses, but obviously in a different room. There's two guest rooms, one that is for men and one that is accessible for women. Nothing much is different in general.  What I mean by outside the house as in their camps (tents/private resorts etc). So no, not quite close to their homes, and the places usually rented. Women also can do the same in this case too.	1644458860.0	hwb7utx	t3_soteeg	t1_hwb5f85	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soteeg/serious_question_how_do_women_eat_during_a/hwb7utx/

boz55b4a	Actually there is no one answer  but in the cases were there are mens/womans  either we're eat together as a family on the same table or ( on the floor) and this is the usual thing for everyday family lunch.  (some families are huge 10+ members so we can consider this as gathering :D  or there are guests involve mens that are foreign ( as muslims foreign mens - foreign for the woman :: not her husband /father/brother/uncle, grandfather .. etc) will be not on the same room/table with the womans  &#x200B;  that why in this case we seperate the gathering into two sections one for mens and other for womans  about who cook, there is no rule but usually if the food is made on the house usually womans (the mother/ the wife , daughters will help in cooking, sons will go and bring ingredients if needed)    and from outside/restaurant usually the husband or the father will pay sons will go and bring the food :D while the father stay with guests   ,there is no rule here it is just a tradition (regarding who cook or who buy)	1644471083.0	hwbybil	t3_soteeg	t3_soteeg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soteeg/serious_question_how_do_women_eat_during_a/hwbybil/

3yemok5	True. As someone from jeddah, we have lots of historical places, i would too many.  What's unfortunate is that these are the places you still see neighbors connecting with eachothers, children play in the streets with no fear over them, old people gathering after each prayer. Now that they dispersed them, so many old people will be extremely lonely with no friends around to visit.   Also you have the cheap and wholesale markets. Old balad, hindawya, rocket market, souq aljanwobia, the haraj, blue building, and so many other markets that sell affordable stuff that you will most likely find other shops selling the same stuff for triple the price.   This renovation wasn't planned with people and their situations and financial status. They didnt prepare anything for others to move too or migrate too. I hope this fires back in their face, honestly, and help them see the struggle they put others in.	1644471518.0	hwbz4h5	t3_soy74k	t3_soy74k	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soy74k/disappearing_jeddah_i_can_understand_the_need_to/hwbz4h5/

So guests who are male you will see often in the published videos while the women gathering in the next room you won’t see because of society norms. Women usually share their vids through private Snapchat/WhatsApp stories cause they supposed to cover up in presence of women.	1644479404.0	hwcb86y	t3_soteeg	t3_soteeg	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soteeg/serious_question_how_do_women_eat_during_a/hwcb86y/

4kdlunom	Looking for a car as well, I'm only using ksamotory, yallamotor and expatriates. I can do some research and check for reviews, my general advice is if it's too good to be true, it isn't legit. Be careful on expatriates as well - you'll see reapply good deals, but the advertisers are in Dubai or Abu Dhabi (might not be an issue for you though).                              Advice I've received from many Saudis and long-term expats: 1) stay away from Chinese-made vehicles and brands - they breakdown easily and it takes a while to get parts for them.                          2) if you're going german, be prepared to wait for parts and pay an exorbitant price                            3) if you go with Toyota, hyundai or Lexus, you stand a better chance of getting a good service package and second hand parts are easier to come by                           4) if you're keen on a particular vehicle, make sure to take an independent mechanic and inspect the vehicle.                                5) advice from an American on American cars: don't buy them, they're crap.                              Again, these are advices given to me, and something I'm keen to follow - I don't want a headache after 3 weeks, and I doubt you will either.                           As far as financing goes, I was told to take a personal loan from the bank and pay for the car upfront - this means you don't have to pay an initial deposit or a balloon payment at the end. You just pay a fixed amount until you pay back your loan. It's the route I intend on going as well. If you have a budget and a general sense of vehicle, let me know, if I come across anything I'll link you.	1644481649.0	hwce833	t3_sp13ns	t3_sp13ns	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sp13ns/are_the_second_hand_car_dealers_legit/hwce833/

4rhwgh	In addition to the countless unhoused people that can’t find homes, what will be the economic benefit? Some landlords are refusing to rent out to people who came from places like Ghulail. The people that live in these poor places can’t afford to pay rental rates of places like Salama, etc. The compensation the property owners are supposed to get for their buildings will not get them much in the more expensive areas of the city.    The city haven’t really outlined a plan of what’s going to happen. Are they going to rebuild all those areas and then sell off individual units? How much will those units cost? The government will end up spending billions and won’t recoup that investment. The city already has thousands of unsold units and thousands of empty rental apartments from the lack of expat families due to the expat tax and Saudi families that left Jeddah for jobs in Riyadh. Those apartments are not going to be filled by the people of Ghulail and Hindaweya as the people of Ghulail and Hindaweya can’t afford rent in the other parts of town.	1644491463.0	hwcqgxi	t3_soy74k	t3_soy74k	/r/saudiarabia/comments/soy74k/disappearing_jeddah_i_can_understand_the_need_to/hwcqgxi/

17ifmv	> American cars: don’t buy them, they’re crap.  As someone who has driven a lot of high end ford and dodge products I respectfully disagree a bit. There is a reason they have a huge following here. Most of the tips you've given seems very generalized but it is understandable.  A relative of our family has a F150 that literally is unkillable with how much it is abused. Another friend of mine has a 10 year old charger with no additional cost except regular maintenance. That seems crap?  On second thoughts, I do believe they can be very hit/miss on quality control. So, I can see why they shouldn't be recommended as used first cars but that doesn't mean they are plain bad.   On a different note, you can try Haraj. It's difficult if you don't know Arabic but asking someone to help will be very beneficial. Haraj has lots of deals both from dealers and users.  Also regarding bringing a mechanic, bring someone who actually knows about the car and has experience not some guy who slaps the car with his toothbrush.	1644498323.0	hwd17te	t3_sp13ns	t1_hwce833	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sp13ns/are_the_second_hand_car_dealers_legit/hwd17te/

4kdlunom	Thanks for the advice! Personally, I've always wanted a Mustang 5.0 (the previous gen) and a dodge challenger R/T. If I could get my hands on one in a decent condition I'd probably be doing a road trip every weekend. As for pickups, I'd love to have the new Hilux, F-150 or GMC Sierra, but due to the laws I can't :(                             With regards to Haraj, each time I've tried contacting a seller, they either ghosted me, or ended the conversation once they found out I'm an expat. I've got a few friends who are willing to help me with talking to them, but I don't want to be deceitful and have them think it's for someone else. And I definitely agree on the mechanic part - someone whose job is to do bodywork or paint will not know much about the internals or specifics of the vehicle.

7bxunjqd	Mine upsets everyone's stomach. We are next door to a pool and the minute you turn the tap on all you smell is chlorine. Plus I'm not English so despite years being here my stomach is accustomed to Africa...we boil our water before drinking it.   Same with folks in Morocco they drink the tap water but visitors get sick if they drink it sometimes.  Our guts are used to certian levels etc.  I never ever experienced tap water till I was 16 and it was weird	1644511326.0	hwdwq9a	t3_sp4hx9	t1_hwdui98	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sp4hx9/gotta_love_living_where_you_can_just_hydrate_out/hwdwq9a/

These false information hurts the cause of the people that feel betrayed by amanat jeddah!   My house is being demolished after Eid they said! How did I know ? Twitter! I dare you to proof to me that’s they warned us years ago as you say! We got the news maybe 2 months or so and not by an official but by asking ppl!  Even though jameah demolishing plans might start after EID. our house is said 50% might be demolished they aren’t sure yet. Whenever they come to spray the neighborhood they will reassess and I guess they will give us a five days to move out.
