3kktj0kv	How common is it for people to refer to others by just patronymic? I've heard sometimes that people will do this if they're really, really close (for example, I remember reading about instances where Lenin was just called "Iliych" to demonstrate being close with the Soviet people), but I'm not sure how regular that is, or if it was just something that was common during the time period.	1641534828.0	hrlotj8	t3_rx6hf2	t1_hrhou1d	/r/russian/comments/rx6hf2/did_i_do_it_wrong_or_is_it_an_error/hrlotj8/
3kktj0kv	I'm learning Russian with the primary goal to read literature and historical sources, and learning to speak it is just as important, even if you're not going to be speaking with people very often. For one, it reinforces grammar and vocabulary in your brain, and two, becoming accustomed to how people speak and speaking it yourself can give you a better sense of the language, which carries over into reading. Russian poetry and literature is great, but there often is a speech element, even with literature. Take, for instance, Gogol and Zoshchenko's *skaz* writing, which intentionally imitates natural speech. And hearing Pushkin recited is a completely different experience than just reading it in your head. Learning the language in all of its aspects- speaking, listening, reading, and writing- allows you to appreciate and understand each aspect more, so even if you're learning primarily for reading like I am, I would still highly recommend learning to speak anyway.	1641535126.0	hrlpc7e	t3_rxdht3	t3_rxdht3	/r/russian/comments/rxdht3/i_need_some_resources_to_read_and_understand/hrlpc7e/

h3qjoj2	Patronymic only is very informal, about the same as using short first name only. It's more popular in certain demographics like older generations and blue collar workers.  I am not sure how true it is, but I have a feeling that when you start as formal/respectful with name and patronymic, e.g. –ü—ë—Ç—Ä –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á, then switch to more informal, going to just patronymic –ò–≤–∞–Ω—ã—á is easier in your head than to short name, –ü–µ—Ç—è.	1641536887.0	hrlsaw9	t3_rx6hf2	t1_hrlotj8	/r/russian/comments/rx6hf2/did_i_do_it_wrong_or_is_it_an_error/hrlsaw9/

I treated you without respect, just like you. We both think we are right and the other side is incorrect, and in my opinion, saying that a phrase is never used only because of "—Ç—ã" isn't just being incorrect, but straight up bullshit.	1641539394.0	hrlw9qw	t3_rx6f45	t1_hrjzzpu	/r/russian/comments/rx6f45/can_someone_tell_me_what_my_mistake_is/hrlw9qw/

It's possible, with some imagination.  > So according to the inscription this could be a bookplate made by Pavlov on behalf of Radimov as his gift to Zhuchkov?  I don't think it's a bookplate. The function of a bookplate is to remind someone who borrows your books (or their  that they should return it. So it normally contains the name of the owner with the words ‚Äúfrom among the books of ‚Äî‚Äù, or something to that effect.  Most probably, Radimov had this impression, or maybe several impressions of the print, given to him by Pavlov. (I guess, it's a natural thing to give a portrait to the person depicted on it.)

cj2bk	I don't really see people saying "polite" anything in online games. That would be weird and more often than not interpreted as sarcasm and trashtalk. You can make people really mad even by using words like "–∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ" or "–¥–æ —Å–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è".  If the game was good, we normally use some sort of a slang appropriate to the situation. It is highly situational and I doubt you would be able to use it correctly anyway.

I don't code for work (yet) actually. I'm just a hobbyist (though if this project is successful, then I'll certainly put it in my portfolio.) There are two reasons I chose Clojure:  1. On a more abstract level, the language "gets out of the way" and lets me focus on the problem and rather than the syntax or low-level minutiae. This is a pretty common sentiment among Clojure developers, and also quite relevant for me as a self-taught developer. (I would never be able to write a program in C, for example.) It's powerful and also very expressive, in that you can perform complex manipulations of data in just a few lines of code that are much more human-readable than most programming languages.   To cite examples from this task, `group-by` and `frequencies` are core library functions in Clojure. In Python, I think the equivalent is `itertools.group()` and for counting occurrences, you have to use `collections.Counter()` and it's not very obvious at all how it works (I only learned about it last month during Advent of Code 2021).  Also, REPL-driven development means that I can interact with data and test small parts of my program live in a terminal without repeatedly compiling it or running entire scripts.   2. More concretely, **ClojureScript.** I'd been doing stuff in Clojure on and off for quite a while, but never deployed a real app or released anything out "into the wild." I once used Python for the backend of a web app several years ago (when I only knew Python), which was fine, but dealing with the constantly-changing and overpopulated JavaScript ecosystem for frontend development was not fun.   I had heard that ClojureScript makes it possible to do full-stack development in (basically) the same single language. That is, CLJS transpiles to JS, so you can make stuff happen in the browser without writing a line of JS (a language that annoys me a lot). The development experience of Clojure/ClojureScript, once you get past the initial hurdle of setting everything up, is really smooth.  More specific to this particular post, the noun case thing is kind of a side task that came up as I was preparing the data. Perhaps it would have been faster for me to a write a script in Python to parse the XML files (and I actually did write one very quickly the other day to parse an OpenCorpora text file for noun gender information), but then the parsed data would still remain external to my program and I'd still have to import it. Using Clojure to parse the XML means that I can keep on parsing the data in different ways and the output is readily usable and already in the data structures that I need.  Hope that answers your question!	1641560946.0	hrmqy7m	t3_rxtjiv	t1_hrmhv77	/r/russian/comments/rxtjiv/oc_frequencies_of_noun_cases_in_opencorpora_data/hrmqy7m/

440msf8k	So far I‚Äôve had very little success finding anything that made me confident in my pronunciation, unfortunately. I tried a few apps but I really don‚Äôt believe it made me better. If anyone has had a different experience I would like to be proven wrong, but I believe the best way is still in-person conversation. I teach English while living in Russia and both I and my students feel that online is acceptable if you have really good sound quality‚Äîotherwise even that can sometimes be difficult for pronunciation, depending on the word(s) and context and all that. Best of luck, I wish I could give you better news!	1641565694.0	hrn15od	t3_ry740p	t3_ry740p	/r/russian/comments/ry740p/are_there_any_russian_learning_apps_that_give_me/hrn15od/

hnkamh90	It's pretty good for the first time, although you do have some mistakes!  &#x200B;  First, sometimes half of a letter disappears when you connect two letters. For example, in "–ö–∞—Ç—é—à–∞" your "—à" merged into "–∞". In the word "–≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞", "–ª" merged into "–∞". Try to write the letter completely and then connect it to another.  &#x200B;  You seem to confuse "–∏" with "–π". These are different letters and you can't put that little mark above every "–∏".  &#x200B;  Sometimes your "–æ" looks like "–∞" when it's at the end of a word. For example, the last two "–ü—Ä–æ" look like "–ü—Ä–∞", whereas the first looks correct.  &#x200B;  You'll get even better pretty soon if you practice regularly!	1641570778.0	hrne6ql	t3_rya82p	t3_rya82p	/r/russian/comments/rya82p/hello_first_try_to_write_cyrillic_i_want_your/hrne6ql/

avgpx	Unreadable for mysterious reasons (you were supposed to had a teacher who would smack you the moment you tried writing like this).  –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥ - –± looks like a capital one.  –ª - you joint the preceding letter to it incorrectly.  Everywhere.  –í—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞ - a slightly wrong —ã, a tilde over –∏ (everywhere), wrong joining in –∏–ª, a too long tail in –∞.  Why tails in all final –æ's?  The tail is for joining with the next letter.  If it's the last letter, there is no tail.  –æ—Ä–ª–∞ - nobody will recognize this.  —Ä needs a stoke to the bottom.  Wrong joining in —Ä–ª.  –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ - what's up with k?  It's simple letter without all these loops.  Speaking of loops.  There is no visible loop in –æ.  There is some thickening of the stroke in the upper left corner because you draw a double line there, but it's not a small circle inside a big circle.	1641571999.0	hrnhjqd	t3_rya82p	t3_rya82p	/r/russian/comments/rya82p/hello_first_try_to_write_cyrillic_i_want_your/hrnhjqd/

gwxm3	The simplest method, obvious but frequently overlooked, is to listen to a native recording of a sentence, then record yourself speaking the sane sentence, then compare your recording with the original. Of course, this method will only work if you can hear Russian properly. For most English natives, Russian is not too difficult to hear properly nor are individual Russian sounds difficult to produce, so this method alone will give an adequate pronunciation to most native English learners. If not, then you will need a native teacher to help fix your inability to hear your own mistakes in pronouncing Russian.	1641579326.0	hro22my	t3_ry740p	t3_ry740p	/r/russian/comments/ry740p/are_there_any_russian_learning_apps_that_give_me/hro22my/

hnkamh90	I used Google Translate. If you activate keyboard input there, you'll be able to input Georgian letters. Mostly, they are aligned in a QWERTY setup, so you can input most of the letters correctly without even knowing the Georgian script. However, there are some letters like ch, sh, dzh, ts, etc. that you cannot input that easily, and you have to know the alphabet to be able to distinguish them from other letters.	1641581736.0	hro8s9m	t3_ry7kx0	t1_hro5xim	/r/russian/comments/ry7kx0/please_can_anyone_translate_this_in_english_what/hro8s9m/

17m1w20t	FWIW, I've seen a video of a woman who learned Russian and recommended the "method". It does make sense.  On the other hand, as one above comment said, stresses from Pushkin's time aren't 100% like today's. Though I'd estimate number of the differences is not that significant.  Truth be told, I don't think many people would read that much poetry to learn the correct accentuation spontaneously from it. E.g. I got accustomed to older prescribed accentuation in my native language only by reading a 19th century translation of Homer, so like 30k lines of poetry. God knows how much Pushkin you'd have to read to "develop an ear" for it.  I guess poetry is a great method if you enjoy it. And if you're at the level where you're still not sure how to stress "–ù–∞—à–∞ –¢–∞–Ω—è –≥—Ä–æ–º–∫–æ –ø–ª–∞—á–µ—Ç", your overall knowledge might be limited enough to prevent much enjoyment. But it's up to you to try and find out. Either way, there should be enough simpler prose texts out there with marked accents, so if you can't follow poetry (which almost by definition uses more difficult language than prose, vocabulary- and syntax-wise) you still can practice accents. Besides, audio books and films and songs are also a good way to expose yourself to accents.  If you do want to try poetry, start with Pushkin and Lermontov and maybe some newer poets, and see how it suits you. I recommend leaving "silver age" (—Å–µ—Ä–µ–±—è–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ–∫) poets for later, they're very difficult IMO.  As for your description of the trochees, usually it's not that simple. The metrical feet do not have to correspond to words, or even to the natural stress entirely. An example from Pushkin:  >–ú–Ω–µ –º–∏–ª –∏ –≤–∏–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ –Ω–∞ –ª–æ–∑–∞—Ö  This is iambic tetrameter (—á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä—ë—Ö—Å—Ç–æ–ø–Ω—ã–π —è–º–±, 4x combination of unstressed-stressed; in this case the verse is hypercatalectic, i.e. it has an additional unstressed syllable at the end). The natural stresses go:  >–ú–Ω–µ **–º–∏–ª** –∏ –≤–∏–Ω–æ**–≥—Ä–∞–¥** –Ω–∞ **–ª–æ**–∑–∞—Ö  but the meter goes:  >–ú–Ω–µ **–º–∏–ª** –∏ **–≤–∏**–Ω–æ**–≥—Ä–∞–¥** –Ω–∞ **–ª–æ**–∑–∞—Ö  So, one word carries two metrical stresses, but only one grammatical. There are different explanations for why that works, why it still sounds like a regular verse, I'm not sure which is currently taken as the best, but either way I hope it illustrates how metrical regularity behaves. Consequently, you cannot discern exactly which syllable in "vinograd" is to be stressed if you've only read the verse, it might be either the first or the last one - you still need to know how the word is pronounced by itself. You won't ruin the rhythm of the poem if you stress the first syllable, but you still won't learn the correct one.	1641581990.0	hro9hg4	t3_ry99kr	t3_ry99kr	/r/russian/comments/ry99kr/do_you_think_that_poetry_is_an_easy_hack_for/hro9hg4/

5a7q1i63	OK, my friends, let's talk about –•–£–ô, AKA "3-letter word" in Russian. Yes, it's a rude word for "penis" but it doesn't have a direct translation to English because English has no word for it. Sure, you can bring up DICK (Richard), COCK (Rooster), PRICK (asshole), and so on. But those are synonyms, right? Those words originally meant something else while –•–£–ô is always –•–£–ô. Just like "cunt" (–ü–ò–ó–î–ê) is, first of all, a rude word for "vagina".  So the English language has a word for –ü–ò–ó–î–ê (cunt) but no word for –•–£–ô	1641583959.0	hroeucc	t3_rxwj4y	t3_rxwj4y	/r/russian/comments/rxwj4y/two_american_ladies_at_my_place_of_work_expressed/hroeucc/

17m1w20t	>And –ï is the unstressed version of –Å.  That might be a misleading way to put it, since it sounds as if you're defining E rather than –Å. It would rather be: when –Å loses its stress, it becomes E (e.g.: nom. sg. *—ë–∂* - gen. sg. *–µ–∂–∞ÃÅ* - nom. pl. *–µ–∂–∏ÃÅ*). E is not unstressed in itself, it is regularly stressed without being turned into –Å.

zv2tv	Thanks for the detailed reply!  >To cite examples from this task, group-by and frequencies are core library functions in Clojure  Often I see quite the opposite in students with a programming background. For them it's more intuitive to write a complicated loop that does everything than to decompose the problem into common operations like group-by. The "let's program our way out of it" approach can work, but results are hard to maintain. You may have an advantage.  I wouldn't want to work on data in C either... Ipython is a "prettified" for interactivity Python shell (I think this is what REPL means?) but to me it does not feel like the best development environment. Have you tried any "notebook" interfaces (they look a bit like Maple or Mathematica, with both code and results on one page). Jupyter is huge in Python, you can try it easily in Google Colab. There is a project for a clojure kernel for jupyter, but it looks not quite done: [https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter). And finding the problem across languages *when* something breaks does not sound fun.  >core library functions in Clojure. In Python, I think the equivalent is itertools.group() and for counting occurrences, you have to use collections.Counter()  Yeah, sounds like Clojure works quite well for this. In Python I would just use Pandas, which has df.groupby('foo').size(). Pandas does a lot, but it's definitely not a core library. Some operations have to be more syntactically awkward than they probably are in Clojure where it's closer to the heart of the language.	1641587750.0	hrop16r	t3_rxtjiv	t1_hrmqy7m	/r/russian/comments/rxtjiv/oc_frequencies_of_noun_cases_in_opencorpora_data/hrop16r/

t564j	You can look into buying a first class ticket as it sometimes comes with a huge amount of check luggage/shipping. There are also air freight shipping services. It's not cheap but should get your stuff there in a timely manner. I've heard freight shipping via sea now is prohibitively expensive and slow due to Covid. Other option is plain old parcel mail but I've heard those treat your stuff the worst (boxes are basically tossed around with no care at all), so you get what you pay for.	1641595469.0	hrp9ees	t3_ryiqlr	t3_ryiqlr	/r/russian/comments/ryiqlr/moving_to_russia/hrp9ees/

dz5s4744	Simply put the difference between the two is that —Ç—ã is informal and used with someone younger or that you know. –í—ã is formal so you'd use it with older people or people that you don't know.   As someone else said, it can also be used ironically. I've noticed that Russians will use –≤—ã to someone they know on purpose if they're pissed at them. It's kind of like using someone's full name in English (Jeffrey instead of Jeff) when you're peeved at them. Spouses will do it to show the other person that they're not super happy at them or to a kid who maybe thinks he's older than he is.	1641601731.0	hrpou8t	t3_rydtp4	t3_rydtp4	/r/russian/comments/rydtp4/should_i_use_—Ç—ã_or_–≤—ã_in_this_situation/hrpou8t/

f6ppkqrj	Listening practice would be the best to learn stress. Reading at the same time as listening practice (like an audiobook and written book at the same time) would help more. I think listening and reading poetry simultaneously, if you can get hold of an audiobook of the poems, would be highly valuable. Especially if you 1. understand poetry (if you aren't versed in it, it's not always easy to understand), and 2. the poetry rhymes (rhyming words and alliteration are easier to remember). Though, as others have pointed out, be careful of poems, like rap, which intentially change the sound slightly, as an artistic technique to fit in the poem.	1641602395.0	hrpqeq8	t3_ry99kr	t3_ry99kr	/r/russian/comments/ry99kr/do_you_think_that_poetry_is_an_easy_hack_for/hrpqeq8/

17m1w20t	I think I get what you mean, but I don't believe it'll work out that way. Assuming that in poetry words can attain a secondary stress for rhythmic purposes, you still won't use it when talking in ordinary prose - –≤–ò–Ω–æ–≥—Ä'–∞–¥ will end up as –≤–ò–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, which IMO doesn't sound very close to correct pronunciation. Better than –≤–∏–Ω–û–≥—Ä–∞–¥, sure, but still too far if you're aiming at correct pronunciation. Funnily enough, just today I heard one very similar mistake - a three-syllable word (in my native Croatian) that I'd stress on the last got stressed on the first, and it definitely rang odd.  So, you still have to use the dictionary diligently, no way around it. :D	1641604095.0	hrpudwy	t3_ry99kr	t1_hronwlx	/r/russian/comments/ry99kr/do_you_think_that_poetry_is_an_easy_hack_for/hrpudwy/

i2v8d	Yes, you can say both phrases without any problem. Russian doesn't have any specific word order, just sense of the sentense have to be correct.  In this exact case, you actually don't care where –æ—á–µ–Ω—å is applied. Both "(Smth) is flowing a lot" and "a lot of water flows" mean the same thing. "–û—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" just emphasises a process in whole.  Yes, some forms can be more "popular" just because. Like in your second case most people would still say "–û–Ω –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥", but your sentense is still perfectly valid. However you can skip "–¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥" at all, and now "–æ–Ω –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" and "–æ–Ω  –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" would divide 50/50. Cause nobody cares, sense is the same.	1641605055.0	hrpwmov	t3_ryn3on	t3_ryn3on	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrpwmov/

jya24	Your constructed phrase is perfectly correct. But I would rather classify *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* as ‚Äúfuzzy cardinal‚Äù, because its corresponding interrogative pronoun is *—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ*, and syntactically it behaves very similar to real cardinals (like, e. g., *–ø—è—Ç—å*). So, in the construction *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥*, it's not *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* which modifies *–¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥*, but vice versa. You can compare it to English *a lot of money*, where *of money* is a complement of the quasi-noun *lot*. But in any case, the two words (with their other dependents) form a cohesive syntactic unit.	1641605715.0	hrpy5rm	t3_ryn3on	t3_ryn3on	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrpy5rm/

That is correct, but this sentence allows practically any word order imaginable, especially in speech (some options might carry a slightly different meaning).  The most standard "literary" version would be: "–û–Ω –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥", because it follows Subject-Verb-Object order and the determines are placed before the words they describe. Conversationally, "–û–Ω –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å" or even "–û—á–µ–Ω—å –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ–Ω –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" are quite fine.  Regarding your question about what modifies what in "–û—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ—á–µ—Ç –≤–æ–¥—ã", I find it a bit difficult to correctly analyze this sentence, because it has a very rare combination of adverb + noun. But if my analysis is correct "–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" (semantically a numeral, but morphologically a noun) forms a noun phrase with "–≤–æ–¥—ã" and is modified by an adverb "–æ—á–µ–Ω—å". So the Noun Phrase "–æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–¥—ã" serves as a subject of the verb "—Ç–µ—á—ë—Ç".  (Alternatively, it's a sentence with a Genetive subject *–≤–æ–¥—ã* and *–æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* it's an adverbial phrase modifying the verb).  However, in "–û–Ω –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥" *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* is either a noun in Accusative case that forms a noun phrase (*–æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥*) or a adverb that modifies the verb *–∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç* and *–¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥* is a Genetive object. On the other hand, now that I think of it, the latter is less likely, because *–∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å* takes an Accusative object.  Sorry for such a long reply, I hope someone corrects me, if I'm wrong.	1641606066.0	hrpyz78	t3_ryn3on	t3_ryn3on	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrpyz78/

diarn8kr	To start, I'd recommend investing some serious time into studying the alphabet. Not just the letters, but the sounds they make and how they combine into words. As a native speaker of English, you can *build* on the phonemes you learned as a child, but simply *using* them to try pronouncing Russian words would be a mistake, and could even turn into a habit that is rather difficult to unlearn further down the road. For that, I'd recommend searching for a channel on YouTube (not necessarily mine üòâ) where you can listen to a native speaker and then imitate the way they pronounce simple words.

jya24	Because, after all, it's not a *real* noun (much less so than Engl. *lot*). It has acquired some noun-like traits by virtue of occurring in constructions where it functions as a count word. But it can also occur in contexts where it's a bona fide adverb, modifying verbs (e. g., *–æ–Ω–∞ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç*) and comparatives (*–æ–Ω –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ –º–µ–Ω—è*). Generally, a word which doesn't inflect according to a specific pattern‚Äîthat is, any word which is not a noun, verb, adjective or pronoun‚Äîcan only be classified as this or that part of speech based on syntactic contexts in which it can occur. Words like *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* are essentially transcategorial.	1641609470.0	hrq6qch	t3_ryn3on	t1_hrpzp9b	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrq6qch/

1m7nxb5	Been studying Russian and a few other languages over the past years. If there's one tip I could bring to the table, it would be to take note of the words (primarily verbs and some nouns) that you use in English a lot, even make a list of the top 20 verbs and 20 nouns, then become familiar with those verbs/nouns in Russian. Although Russian gets tricky with verbs in terms of aspect (imperfect/perfect), I think it's a good start!  Russian is tough because grammar is hugely important. So knowing a few key nouns in their nominative form could help (google translate single words or go to a dictionary for this)then once you dive into the grammar, you'll learn declensions.	1641623755.0	hrqygk7	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrqygk7/

3g18bif8	Well, they've already said about the wrong word "—Ç—ã". Now about the word order in this phrase.  When anybody say "—è —Ç–µ–±—è –ª—é–±–ª—é" it is exactly - and consistently - who loves whom. Not that someone who else, someone whom else, and what kind of relationship they have - namely me, specifically you, and only then the main thing about love. This phrase is about the relationship of these two people, and only then about what this relationship is.  And this is a standard phrase between lovely people.  When someone says "—è –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ç–µ–±—è", he is talking about his feelings, first of all. In this phrase he says that he loves, and whom he loves - in this sequence. Therefore, this phrase is characteristic of expression: for the first declaration of love, for a quarrel, for protection in front of others ("—è –ª—é–±–ª—é –µ—ë" (I love her)), and so on. This phrase is about the feelings of one person, not about the relationship between two.	1641624041.0	hrqywac	t3_rygnab	t3_rygnab	/r/russian/comments/rygnab/difference_between_—è_—Ç–µ–±—è_–ª—é–±–ª—é_and_—è_–ª—é–±–ª—é_—Ç—ã/hrqywac/

dnq43	The letters –ï, –Å, –Æ, –Ø pronounced as YE, YO, YU, YA when they don't follow a consonant character, and as E, O, U, A with palatalization of the previous sound when they follow a consonant characters.  The letter –¨ is taught to be a silent one (it only causes palatalization of the previous consonant), but actually is pronounced before –ò and –û as –ô: "—á—å–∏" ('whose') is pronounced as if spelled "—á–π–∏", "–∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω—å–æ–Ω" as if it's spelled "–∫–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω—å–π–æ–Ω".   Everything else can be pronounced pretty straightforward.  Unstressed –û are pronounced as –ê, but you can't tell which letter is stressed, so it won't help you. Also unstressed –ï and –Ø tend to be pronounced as –ò.  Word-final consonants are pronounced as unvoiced even if they are spelled as voiced (like in German).  Important exceptions are the grammatical endings -–û–ì–û/-–ï–ì–û which are pronounced with /v/ sound while are spelled as if they are pronounced with /g/ sound.  Some –ß are pronounced as 'ch' instead of 'sh'. The most important of these is the word "—á—Ç–æ" ('what').	1641629330.0	hrr6bsu	t3_ryumct	t3_ryumct	/r/russian/comments/ryumct/what_are_some_basic_pronunciation_patterns_i/hrr6bsu/

434wy2qh	Russian has a way of phrasing things quite a bit differently than English. It may help you to translate in two ways: the literal translation and the more natural translation. For example, "She is five years old" translates to –ï–π –ø—è—Ç—å –ª–µ—Ç, but the literal translation is "To her are five of years." Or to say "He is a mechanic," it's just –û–Ω - –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫.  Don't worry, in a little while it will start to seem much more natural. It's a different system and things don't always translate 1:1. I daresay things don't *often* translate 1:1.	1641629745.0	hrr6vju	t3_rynwmk	t1_hrr0dqe	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrr6vju/
pofti	There is Eugene Onegin opera with exact this phrase repeated several times. It was normal to use –í—ã (–í–∞—Å) in high society even for close relates up to wife/husband/children/parents...   Please note that in written form –í is capitalised for single form, but for plural form we use –≤—ã (–≤–∞—Å). Also it is common to use name+fathers name (–∏–º—è+–æ—Ç—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ) if you use –í—ã.   For example: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á, –ø—Ä–æ—à—É [–í–∞—Å –∏–¥—Ç–∏] –∫ —Å—Ç–æ–ª—É! [–ú—ã] –¢–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –í–∞—Å –∂–¥—ë–º.   But now there is a rule of tumb (kind of tradition), you start using —Ç—ã after you have a brotherhood drink, or now just drink alchogol or are close enough yougsters to not case, or work in international company that declared such informal policy.	1641631165.0	hrr8q8l	t3_rygnab	t1_hrpi57y	/r/russian/comments/rygnab/difference_between_—è_—Ç–µ–±—è_–ª—é–±–ª—é_and_—è_–ª—é–±–ª—é_—Ç—ã/hrr8q8l/

5h2wo	Oh oops I meant –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏. Yea it's true that a word can become incomprehensible if it is pronounced horribly, but you can talk around the word and add more context if you just know more words. Studying as many words as possible while speaking with natives is the most important thing you can do as a beginner. The more you speak, the more stuff you just pick up. Phrases, grammar, pronunciation, and more just become internalized. For me, perfectly understandable pronunciation is something that is easily acquired by just speaking as much as possible. Spending time specifically on pronunciation is just not efficient. Especially since, in my experience, drilling good pronunciation and correct grammar actually becomes counterproductive for students because they just become more hesitant to speak.	1641632801.0	hrratsb	t3_rv4iwm	t1_hrfv0nx	/r/russian/comments/rv4iwm/is_proper_word_stress_crucial_for_a_total_beginner/hrratsb/

89lzwm6d	I started off with Dualingo daily and I did an audio course called Pimsluer at the same time.

89lzwm6d	I agree with you some people say Dualingo isn't good I disagree ,I found it very helpful like you said.   You can click on the discussion part of each question , and people will discuss the grammar rules it's very helpful indeed. It's how I came to understand the grammar alongside watching YouTube videos. I think it's a lot easier to pick up the grammar concepts as you go , rather than studying complex grammar tables etc.	1641634958.0	hrrdk7a	t3_rynwmk	t1_hrqpbcq	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrdk7a/

47cd9b9k	I'm a work-in-process, but for me what has helped the most is hiring tutors via Skype/Zoom on italki.com -- like $10-15/hr. I started with two hours a week, moved to 4 hours a week, and I'm about to increase to 8 hours a week as my poor little brain develops linguistic endurance.  I should note that I used free language partners for a while, mostly in-person, but I found that our meetings weren't consistent enough to make much progress. Having regular meetings has been key.  I've also switched any TV serials that I watch over to Russian language -- English subtitles for the first watch-thru, Russian subtitles for subsequent viewings. LingQ.com is a good way to read Russian books on a smartphone -- just tap words you don't know for a definition. And I use Quizlet to drill vocabulary, but my brain doesn't retain much from drills. Reading and speaking seem more productive. And once in a while I dork around with Memrise and Duolingo. Can't say I learn much from them, but hey maybe.  Apps are better than nothing, but real-life practice has by far been the most helpful for me. The good news is that you don't need to live in Russia for this "immersion" -- you can do it all remotely with online teachers.	1641635733.0	hrreipa	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrreipa/

fn7k4	Duolingo was really only useful for learning to type for me.  Get the Windows 10 mnemonic Russian keyboard--you can basically type a lot of the same letters and the extra letters (Russian has more, 33 or something like that) are typed with combinations.  Anyways, learn the alphabet, do some of your basic intro lessons to learn how to greet people, thanks, you're welcome, etc.  Then you get on HelloTalk and you go into the search and look for Russian speakers.  You can start 25 new conversations per day.  Do that--people will drop out for long periods of time (I've done it myself).  Once you start seeing the standard greetings and figures of speech often enough you can start copy pasting the beginning stuff.  Find the people that want to talk on audio/video calls (lots seemed to want to use WhatsApp).  There are seriously so many Russian speakers on HelloTalk that want to practice their English.  That ought to get you started.  The most important thing is to find the things you are interested in and do/watch/etc. in the target language.  Don't feel like you have to plug along with lessons or w/e if you find them boring.  Don't get attached to specific apps or w/e because if you stay in that ecosystem you're probably not going to take whatever skills you build outside of it.  Lastly, recognize the fear to make a mistake or to be misunderstood.  It's going to happen no matter hard you try because you just don't know what you're doing yet.  If you can recognize that and put it aside, you'll make a lot more satisfying progress.	1641637384.0	hrrglh5	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrglh5/

fgdyz	I liked Babbel more than duolingo. They both have nonsense phrases to a degree, but I can see the ones in babbel actually being used.  I think they may have updated the lessons some, so not sure if it's still the better one between the two.  A lot of people recommend just building up a vocabulary without worrying about grammar, but I'm the kind of person that likes learning some of the grammar to better understand the language.  1000% learn the alphabet first. Some of the sounds are completely alien to a mouth used to English, especially the types of combinations that exist. Once you know the alphabet well you'll be able to read even if you don't know what it means.  Install/enable a Russian keyboard.  Repeat everything.  Use a vocabulary/flashcard type of program like Clozemaster.  Try to find Russian versions of English media you like.	1641638112.0	hrrhhzs	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrhhzs/

Also League's owned by Tencent so you could count it as Chinese if you wanted, there's a massive audience for it in Asia, and there's development and other teams internationally even if the headquarters may be in America.

8rn093bg	Thank you for the motivation, I dont think that it is correct to use your language level as progress but I just started out learning passively almost a year ago, exactly 330 days according to Duolingo and I have managed to go up to A2 maybe already B1 because it's been a while since I've made the test, I was suprised to see it since I was waiting to see an A1 so that's something, also, when I first started out I focused myself on the reading and pronounciation part of Russian and believe, comming from knowing both English and Spanish was a VERY big boost since both languages are pretty similar to Russian, Russian has lots of words that come from English and the pronounciation is pretty similar to Spanish, it took me only 3 months to be able to read fluently, obviously a bit more time to pronounce it but the progress I've made is seriously great, if somebody is feeling down or something, try going back to it and doing something different because changing things up from time to time will keep you engaged, try learning some songs too, –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ by  –ì–ª—é–∫–æ–∑–∞ & –£—à–ª–∞ –∫ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç—É by –ú–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–æ—á–∫–∞ were my starting songs and I'd recomend learning those first!

434wy2qh	Pefective verbs (–≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª—ã —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞) are used to describe completed or not-yet-started actions. Something that has a definite beginning and end. So they can only be used in past in future tense.  Imperfective verbs (–≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª—ã –Ω–µ—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞) are used to describe an ongoing state or process. They are used for things that are happening right now, or for things that were in the process of happening at some point in the past.  Let's use —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å/–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å for an example. (To read)  –Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. I'm reading a book. (currently in the process of reading)  –Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª/—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–Ω–∏–ª –º–Ω–µ –º–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥.

(and finished reading it)  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. I will read the book.  Verb aspect, or –≤–∏–¥, is one of the hardest things to nail in the Russian language. But it's the reason that Russian doesn't need like 147 tenses like English has, so that's a plus. :)	1641972249.0	hsblilh	t3_s1s2hg	t3_s1s2hg	/r/russian/comments/s1s2hg/what_is_this_column_trying_to_show_me/hsblilh/

at3t8vmv	These are synonyms. But it seems to me that "–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" is a more formal word and means the termination at the moment of a conversation: –ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏ –≥—Ä–æ–º–∫–æ —á–∞–≤–∫–∞—Ç—å! / Stop chewing loudly! (right now). The connotation is very strict.   And "–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å" is more informal and means long-term termination: –ü–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å –ø–∏—Ç—å –ø–∏–≤–æ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å, —ç—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ / Stop drinking beer every day, this is harmful (and it takes time).   On the other hand, these words are absolutely interchangeable in the phrase: "–ü–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏ —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –∂–µ!"   There is one grammatical difference: the verb "–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" can be used with a reflexive postfix -—Å—è. You could say "–î–æ–∂–¥—å –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª—Å—è" = "–î–æ–∂–¥—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–ª –∏–¥—Ç–∏".  Another example: "–°–ø–æ—Ä –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª—Å—è / The dispute ended".	1641980232.0	hsbvt09	t3_s1zzvm	t3_s1zzvm	/r/russian/comments/s1zzvm/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å_vs_–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å/hsbvt09/
jya24	They are synonyms, but *–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å* is more formal in style: *–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å* is rather uncommon in legal and technical prose. Grammatically, both verbs can take infinitive complements (*–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å* and *–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å*), but only *–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å* can take direct objects (*–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É*).	1641980480.0	hsbw3tn	t3_s1zzvm	t3_s1zzvm	/r/russian/comments/s1zzvm/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å_vs_–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å/hsbw3tn/

Derivatives of "–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" sound like a direct order, whereas "–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å" is closer to a request.	1641983599.0	hsbzugp	t3_s1zzvm	t3_s1zzvm	/r/russian/comments/s1zzvm/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å_vs_–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å/hsbzugp/

d8ox1pq8	Youtube has tons of great stuff and also, 50 Languages has free MP3's that you can download or listen to on the internet to build your listening skills. They have two packs, one that says the sentence in your native language (if your native language is one of the available 50 languages and you choose it) and then it says the sentence in your target language with two different speakers, one man, one woman.  The second pack is only sentences in your target language, but still with two speakers. I think two speakers might only be for gendered languages but I'm not really sure. I thought it was cool that it was available in so many languages and non English speakers can use it in their native language. It's definitely not a program that will take you to fluency but it's a good start in listening training. Next Level Russian is a good free intermediate level podcast. UCLA has a free Russian business podcast.  I like listening resources.  Oh also, I use a browser extension called Gloss that translates some words I'm reading on the page into Russian to build vocabulary. It's like Toucan but Toucan isn't available in Russian.	1641986543.0	hsc3msm	t3_s1r955	t3_s1r955	/r/russian/comments/s1r955/free_ways_to_learn_russian/hsc3msm/
bci24ojc	**[Double negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negative)**     >A double negative is a construction occurring when two forms of grammatical negation are used in the same sentence. Multiple negation is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a clause. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have negative concord or emphatic negation.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1641986567.0	hsc3nxp	t3_s23t1t	t1_hsc3mf9	/r/russian/comments/s23t1t/–≤–∏—á–µ—Ä–∞_—è_–Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ_–Ω–µ_–∑–Ω–∞–ª/hsc3nxp/

cj2bk	English language is lacking here. It is impossible to say that you have learned what "nothing" truly is in English. Because if you say that you know "nothing", you are just saying that you don't know anything.  In Russian, you are given the precise information. Either you do not know or do know nothing. And if you do, then you really do know what is "nothing". Same with the other verbs, in Russian you can choose if you are creating/painting/seeing the nothing or not doing it.  –Ø –≤–∏–∂—É –Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ. vs –Ø –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ –≤–∏–∂—É. - two different things, that require further elaboration if you want to express them in English.	1641987142.0	hsc4fp6	t3_s23t1t	t3_s23t1t	/r/russian/comments/s23t1t/–≤–∏—á–µ—Ä–∞_—è_–Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ_–Ω–µ_–∑–Ω–∞–ª/hsc4fp6/

Then start reading simple texts, something simple modern and generally popular (not kids books). After you become somewhat comfortable start watching movies and tv shows (again something simple). Listening is a different skill which you haven't trained until this point, so expect to not understand anything, use russian subtitles if needed (never subtitles in your language).  I would NOT recommend songs as a source of immersion, just remember how unnatural and sometimes unintelligible songs in your language, same with russian.	1641994364.0	hscgehy	t3_s235st	t3_s235st	/r/russian/comments/s235st/what_is_the_best_way_to_immerse_self_in_language/hscgehy/

On the opposite side, taking it too academically and doing tiresome grammar drills all the time and making cumbersome vocabulary lists.   &#x200B;  For learning methods, I suggest you read refold, I don't follow or agree with everything they say, but there is some solid information there. Other than that every individual is different and learns in different ways. Here is what worked for me for another language:  Step 1. Learn the basics of grammar. *Without* being able to use them actively or remember them all the time. Learn grammar to be able to say what is going on in the sentence, and maybe identify why the words are used in that way/form.  Step 2. Memorize the most common 1,000 words. Anki works great in that step.   Step 3. Watch/listen/read to see how words sound like, phonetics, intonations etc.  Step 4. Review grammar and memorize another 2,000 words.   Step 5. Massive amounts of watching and reading  Step 6. Trying to output. Writing short texts, trying to speak etc. Identify the weak points and concentrate on filling the knowledge gaps.   &#x200B;  This is just a general picture of what worked for me, maybe something completely different works for you, you need to see for yourself what is the most effective way for you. Also keep in mind that it will take a lot, a lot of time to become proficient.	1642001210.0	hscvymq	t3_s1yh7l	t3_s1yh7l	/r/russian/comments/s1yh7l/i_know_this_is_a_question_asked_multiple_times/hscvymq/

4oxt1n3z	Verb pairs are verbs of the same definition because in English we make no distinction in the verb itself if something is a regular occurrence or a singular time. For example: in English we would say something like ‚ÄúHe walked home from work‚Äù and say it the same way whether he did that often or this one time - in Russian they use two different verbs to make a distinction. My personal favorite is you can accidentally imply you are a stalker in Russian by using the wrong version of the verb ‚Äúto see/watch‚Äù if you use the wrong form in the sentence ‚ÄúI watched him walk home from work‚Äù you are saying you watch him walk home from work often, like very often.	1642001985.0	hscxwn4	t3_s1s2hg	t3_s1s2hg	/r/russian/comments/s1s2hg/what_is_this_column_trying_to_show_me/hscxwn4/

434wy2qh	I think it's a question of literal vs. more natural translations. "–ê" literally means "and/but," so you wrote the literal translation. But the English sentence "This is Mom but not Dad" would only sound natural in some sort of metaphysical context. So for a more natural translation, you'd just leave out "–∞/but." :)  –≠—Ç–æ –≤–µ–ª–æ—Å–∏–ø–µ–¥, –∞ –Ω–µ –º–æ—Ç–æ—Ü–∏–∫–ª.

I know this as I have colleagues with non-Russian vaccines and they are currently restricted to supermarkets, chemists and other ‚Äúessential‚Äù shops. No museums, no theatres etc.  They are optimistic this will finally cause the authorities to recognise non-Russian vaccines, but I am not so optimistic.

bgzo7k2t	Hello! I'm learning Russian, and something that is helping me is a book called "The New Penguin". Bought it on Amazon, and it is really good for beginners.   You can also watch some videos, since the book isn't that helpful at the listening/speaking parts. The channel that I recommend to you is "Be Fluent in Russian". You can also train on Duolingo or other apps.   Good luck, and have fun!	1642007040.0	hsdb5d3	t3_s2aht0	t3_s2aht0	/r/russian/comments/s2aht0/hi_im_15_years_old_im_a_american_girl_i_love_to/hsdb5d3/

bsoa3gqf	Not really, it definitely is "–∞" You use "–∞" when you are saying things that are opposite to each other or something like that. For example:  "–≠—Ç–æ —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥ –∞ –Ω–µ –¥–∂–µ–º"  - This is chocolate and not jam.  "–û–Ω –±—ã–ª –≤ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–µ, –∞ —è –±—ã–ª –≤ –º—É–∑–µ–µ."  - He was at the university, and I was at the museum."  Did you get what I mean?

9sjolt3b	English doesn‚Äôt have aspect. English has tenses. Don‚Äôt confuse aspect for tense in Russian as someone suggested in the comments. It will set you up for failure.

d8ox1pq8	I think if you have reasonable expectations, immersion from the beginning is fine. Of course, if you don't understand anything then what you are doing is useless so there is no point in doing a lot of immersion especially native immersion in the very beginning (but I think in small quantities it's good to get used to the sounds of the language). I watched Better Than Us on Netflix very early on in my language learning and I had fun picking out the few words I knew and reading the names of the actors on the screen, and I just enjoyed the story. Immersion means different things to different people as well, some mean it to mean native material/people and others use it to mean learning in context (ie reading). I have personally found mixing up study materials with native material gets me the best results, but I stop doing anything I don't understand and save it for later. This can include study materials too if they are too advanced for my level.	1642011853.0	hsdo5jh	t3_s235st	t3_s235st	/r/russian/comments/s235st/what_is_the_best_way_to_immerse_self_in_language/hsdo5jh/

gwxm3	You'd actually be better off using DLI  methods of 60 years ago than many so-called innovations like Duolingo. Real innovations since 1960:  1) Apps like Anki are much more efficient and less weight to carry than paper vocabulary cards.  2) Ebook reader with integrated dictionary more efficient and less weight to carry than paper book and dictionary.  3) Speaking of dictionaries, unless you put a really low value on your time (under $1/hour), consider buying add-on dictionaries (Universal and Ermolovich en-ru, Explanatory BTS ru-ru for ABBYY app, latter needed to show stress for all forms). So much more efficient than online dictionaries, to speak nothing of paper dictionaries.. Universal en-en also good, if you don't already have a good English dictionary integrated into your browser and ereader.  4) Audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube offer far more native recorded speech than was available in the past, all of which can be accessed at any time, unlike vinyl records, cassettes, CDs.  5) Skype, Zoom, etc allow easy conversations with natives living far away.  Otherwise, secret (already known in 1960) is as follows:  1) Get your pronunciation okay upfront, instead of developing bad habits that have to be unlearned and relearned later.  2) 80% of time, after basics, should be: listen to recording, read transcript and look up unknown words in dictionary, listen again, repeat for next recording.   3) Results = hours * effectiveness/hour. Difference in effectiveness between good and perfect is small, and hours required is enormous even of using perfect method. This argues for focusing primarily on sustainability (after taking points 1 and 2 above into account) rather than perfect effectiveness. Find a method that is reasonably effective and that you enjoy, then grind away.	1642025584.0	hseovli	t3_s2bdw4	t3_s2bdw4	/r/russian/comments/s2bdw4/learning_russian_the_best_possible_way/hseovli/

a0qlz566	Perfect reply.   I would add:   The difference between a reasonably effective method and a terrible one is great (meaning that with a terrible method you'll make close to zero progress even after years). But it doesn't look like this applies to OP.  One technical innovation that has helped me increase my efficiency drastically is using an addon for my web browser that lets me right click on a word to give me a translation (would give you the name but it's in German; but I know there are others like it out there). Makes looking up words pretty much effortless.  Yes, the number of hours you need to put in IS enormous BUT if you spend that time engaging with interesting content you won't really notice it. So I wouldn't let that deter you.

4nyx8zzd	Uh, sorry, I don't have a full answer, but something I can tell you is that "–∞" often does not mean "and", while "–∏" is pretty much always translated into English as "and" (maybe there are some rare exceptions though).  So, "–∏" is the preposition used when listing things (as well as English "and"), for example: "–ù–∞—Å—Ç—è **–∏** –ò–≤–∞–Ω –∏–¥—É—Ç –¥–æ–º–æ–π" - "Nastia **and** Ivan are going home"; "–û–Ω –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç —Ñ—É—Ç–±–æ–ª **–∏** –≤–æ–ª–µ–π–±–æ–ª" - "He plays football **and** volleyball"; so pretty much an analogue of "and" (note that "–∞" cannot be used here)  "–ê" has many uses, many of which I don't know how to describe, but at least one I know how to. It can be used for comparing two things in a way to emphasize their difference (an English analogue here would be "but" or just nothing). "–û–Ω–∞*(she)* –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç*(plays)* –Ω–∞*(on)* –±–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ö*(drums)*, **–∞** –Ω–µ*(not)* –Ω–∞*(on)* –≥–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–µ*(guitar)*" - "She plays drums, **~~and~~** not guitar" - I have marked "and" with a strikethrough because it's normally omitted (not sure if it's even allowed there); "–û–Ω –ª—é–±–∏—Ç –û–∫—Å–∞–Ω—É, **–∞** –Ω–µ –°–≤–µ—Ç–ª–∞–Ω—É" - "He loves Oksana, **~~and~~** not Svetlana"; "–û–Ω–∏*(they)* —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏*(did)* —ç—Ç–æ*(it)* –Ω–µ*(not)* —Å–æ*(because of)* –∑–ª–æ—Å—Ç–∏*(anger)*, **–∞***(but)* –∏–∑-–∑–∞*(because of)* –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞*(hunger)*" - "They did it not because of anger, **but** because of hunger".  Lastly, I will give you some examples where "–∞" actually translates into English as "and", though I can't really explain them: "**–ê***(and)* –∫—É–¥–∞*(where to)* —Ç—ã*(you)* –¥—É–º–∞–ª*(thought)* –æ–Ω*(he)* –ø–æ—à—ë–ª*(went)*?" - "**And** where did you think he went?"; "**–ê***(and)* –∑–∞—á–µ–º*(for what)* –Ω–∞–º*(to us/for us)* —ç—Ç–æ*(this)*? - "And why do we need it?"; "**–ê***(and)* –µ—Å–ª–∏*(if)* —è*(I)* –∏–º*(to them)* –≤—Å—ë*(everything)* —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∂—É*(will tell)*?" - "**And** what if I tell them everything?"  P.S. sorry for those stupid-ass instance sentences, I'm so sleepy.

4ra1e0ku	Ukraine is an excellent place to learn Russian immersively.  In Kiev you will hear 90% of people on the street speaking Russian. Strange thing is that despite Russian being the colloquial language, all signs are in Ukrainian, but it is similar enough to Russian that it should not be too confusing for you.  You may hear ‚Äúsurzhyk‚Äù which is Ukrainian mixed with Russian, but in Kiev and large cities people speak pure Russian. You will encounter surzhyk in more rural areas. In Kiev people will pronounce –≥ as a soft ‚Äúh‚Äù, which is dialectically similar to southwestern Russian and Belarusian Russian.   Odessa has a very unique dialect and accent in Russian, so be ware of that, but it is more ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù there than even Kiev.  Also, regarding Lviv: no, you will not be beaten by anybody for speaking Russian. Especially since you are a beginner, your accent will be obvious, so nobody will take offence. Maybe, you can learn basic Ukrainian pleasantries like ‚Äúdyakuyu‚Äù for people to like you more in the west. Note that there exists the remote possibility of encountering an aggressive drunk, but that exists in both the west and the east. Just avoid politics!	1642043269.0	hsftclw	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsftclw/

4ra1e0ku	What are you talking about man, you cannot compare Russian/Ukraine dichotomy with Portugal/Spain. In Ukraine, aside from Galicia and Bukovyna, signs are in Ukrainian, but EVERYBODY speaks Russian as their FIRST AND PRIMARY LANGUAGE. It is not as if they will have to accommodate him by speaking to him in Russian ‚Äî- they will automatically address him in Russian before he talks!!! In Portugal, people speak Portuguese, in Spain, people speak Spanish; in Russia and (almost all of) Ukraine, people speak RUSSIAN.

gwxm3	Ukraine is fine for learning Russian, but try to pick a predominantly Russian speaking city: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro are the big ones. Kyiv is inside the Ukrainian area, so people in small towns and villages near Kyiv speak mixed Ukrainian-Russian, as do recent immigrants from those towns/villages. But since Kyiv is the capital, it is full of highly educated people who are fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian and often English as well. In particular, if you want a native Russian speaker tutor, university educated residents of Kyiv are indeed native speakers of Russian. At worst, they might occasionally use a Ukrainian word instead of standard Russian (–±—É—Ä–∞–∫ instead of —Å–≤—ë–∫–ª–∞, for example).   Note that 100% of Ukrainians everywhere in Ukraine understand Russian perfectly, and always will, because of the influence of YouTube now and television in the past. However, they may not speak Russian fluently due to lack of practice, especially in the Ukrainian areas of the west and north.   Spoken business/technical language in Kyiv is Russian and they speak it perfectly. However, most street signs, packaging and all official documents are Ukrainian. Ukrainian and Russian get more and more similar when the document is full of legal, business, medical, scientific and other technical jargon, so learning to read  business or technical Ukrainian is not that difficult if you are C1 reading in Russian.   A polite way to deal with the language issue anywhere in Ukraine is ask "–í—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π?" (Russian pronunciation of –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ). If yes, proceed in English. If no or a hesitant yes, proceed in Russian. In other words, if someone in Ukraine really hates Russian, you are giving them the option to speak English. If they can't speak English, then they can't complain about being forced to speak Russian.   I did most of my Russian learning in Kyiv, and have been spending 3 months each year there since 2015, plus 16 months straight during the Great Covid Plague of 2020-2021. I don't speak any Ukrainian myself, but I understand enough that if someone (such as young women secretaries in offices) speaks a simple sentence to me in Ukrainian, I can understand and reply in Russian without asking them to translate to Russian. My experience is that learning to listen to Ukrainian at A2 level, and read business/technical documents at C1 level is not difficult if your Russian is B2 listening/C1 reading, and the Ukrainian does not interfere with Russian of it is input only. I would recommend against learning to speak both Ukrainian and Russian until you have mastered one of these languages (presumably Russian, given which reddit we are in), because they conflict so much. In particular, they use different stress for identical words (–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ, for example).	1642045927.0	hsfz308	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsfz308/

opdzd	It can depend on context, but often –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å ‚Äì the perfective of –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å ‚Äì comes close, since realizing can be like the moment when you understand something. Or perhaps –≤—Å–ø–æ–º–Ω–∏—Ç—å for the moment when you remember something. Or –æ—Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç—å, as Whammytap suggests.  When I have a question like this I often check for examples in the [Russian National Corpus](https://ruscorpora.ru/new/search-main.html).  Typing –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å (or whatever word you like) in the –õ–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ-–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫ box gives loads of examples in context, like this one:   –Ø —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á—Ç–æ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∞ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é —á–∞—Å—Ç—å. - I just realized that I haven't watched the second part.   ...as well as other examples that I wouldn't necessarily translate as 'realize,' but it's a good way to get a feel for what contexts a verb is used in.	1642049775.0	hsg6sb3	t3_s2p9yd	t3_s2p9yd	/r/russian/comments/s2p9yd/making_a_list_of_top_verbs_to_study/hsg6sb3/

b64fe	I feel like people's explanations of why this is wrong could be better.  –ê in this sense is contraposition. It means that "this is mom" and *by virtue of being mom*, it can't be Dad.   "But" is used to exclude a possible property or state that could exist by the preceding clause. Dad is not a subset of things Mom could be, so saying "this is mom, but not Dad" is at best tautological, but mostly just confusing: of course it's not Dad, you just said it was Mom and Dad-ness can never be a property of Mom. Why are insinuating that "This is Mom, and also Dad" could ever be a possibility?  Compare these two sentences:  - "I am going to the mall, not the grocery store" - "I am going to the mall, but not to buy anything"  The former clarifies that you are going to the mall, expelling any notion that you might've gone to the grocery store instead: it's not possible to do both at the same time. The latter clarifies that while you are going to the mall, you're not going to do something that is possible to do at the mall: buy things.  If Duolingo offered "and" instead of "but", then there'd be a case to be made that they were wrong. These sentences are equivalent (the latter is not idiomatic in most English dialects though):  - This is mom, not dad. - This is mom, and not dad.  But in this case, "but" is clearly incorrect.	1642055404.0	hsggfwj	t3_s28pef	t3_s28pef	/r/russian/comments/s28pef/error_on_my_behalf_or_duolingos_wouldnt_a_but_fit/hsggfwj/

irfa7	Most of Ukraine thinks in Russian, but they are definitely in a phase of trying to switch most things: TV, street signs and the like into Ukrainian. So I‚Äôd say Ukraine is a poor choice if you want full immersion. In addition to Russian, you‚Äôll have Ukrainian words here and there and both will inevitably slip into your vocabulary. And you‚Äôll have less access to purely Russian media, as some are literally banned there. So, the people will speak Russian, but also speak a lot of Ukrainian‚Ä¶ I think this akin to going to the US to learn English and then living in Chinatown where most people speak Chinese AND English.	1642058426.0	hsgkt5a	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsgkt5a/

xt3cp	The meaning is the same in this case since the word "–æ—Å—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" is used in somewhat different meanings. In "–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –æ—Å—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" it refers to the process of cooling, in "–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –Ω–µ –æ—Å—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" to the end result of getting sufficiently cool. So "process takes long" and "process doesn't finish for a long time" mean the same if you only care about the end result. In fact if you cared about the process (e.g. heat exchange from the cooling kettle is used for a practical purpose) the meaning would end up somewhat different.	1642059626.0	hsgmfuq	t3_s2tclq	t3_s2tclq	/r/russian/comments/s2tclq/title/hsgmfuq/

b1y15iy	>Native speakers, please correct me if wrong   Unfortunately, this is one of the thing that we mostly use intuitively. I think you have it right, but hopefully there is a way to clarify the difference between "–Ω–æ" and "–∞" a bit more formally.  The best description I found is [here](https://rus.stackexchange.com/questions/423679/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7-%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85).  The main meaning of "–∞" seems to be comparison, juxtaposition, highlighting contrast features: "–Ø –±—É–¥—É –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –∫–ª—é—á –Ω–∞ –∫—É—Ö–Ω–µ, –∞ —Ç—ã –ø–æ–∏—â–∏, –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞, –≤ —Å–ø–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ" means: "I will look for the key in the kitchen, please look for it in the bedroom \[at the same time to best use our time\]". Our activities are not mutually exclusive or logically contradicting at all, we can indeed look for the lost item together in the kitchen, if we want. But I specifically suggest we split our efforts and search in two places, and use "–∞" for that.   "–Ø –±—É–¥—É –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –∫–ª—é—á –Ω–∞ –∫—É—Ö–Ω–µ, **–∏ —Ç—ã** –ø–æ–∏—â–∏, –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞, –≤ —Å–ø–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ" also sounds good and grammatically correct.  But here I probably focus on the fact that you should look for the key too, not just sit on a couch while I am looking for the lost item. :)   The main meaning of "–Ω–æ" is contradiction, exactly as in English "but": "–Ø —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—é—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É, –Ω–æ –µ—ë —Å—ä–µ–ª–∞ —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞" / "I did my homework, but the dog ate it".

3bmg1sm8	It says "No one was even thinking of delaying it".  In terms of structure, it almost literally says "But delaying it wasn't even in anyone's thoughts", however:  * The word order is reordered to respect the natural topic & comment structure.  * The pronoun is "–Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ" ("no one") rather than "–∫—Ç–æ-–ª–∏–±–æ" (anyone), because the pronounse need to be in negative agreement with the verb.  * The preposition "—É" + genitive is used to convey the possession ("anyone's" ~ "no one's"), and negative pronouns act funny when they see a preposition: you say "–Ω–∏ —É –∫–æ–≥–æ", and not ~~"—É –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ"~~.  * The particle "–∏" is used for emphasis like "even" in my English interpretation above.	1642065786.0	hsgu6rv	t3_s2uent	t3_s2uent	/r/russian/comments/s2uent/–Ω–æ_–Ω–∏_—É_–∫–æ–≥–æ_–∏_–≤_–º—ã—Å–ª—è—Ö_–Ω–µ_–±—ã–ª–æ_—Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å_–æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å/hsgu6rv/

ctgr4	For the past few years, the government of Ukraine has been rolling out a series of measures aimed at derussifying the country. For example, new street signs are written either only in Ukrainian or in Ukrainian and English, not Russian. When I first started learning Russian, a few years ago now, wandering around the city and reading signs was very instructive. Now that is impossible.  Another example: This past summer, I visited the Bulgakov House Museum in Kyiv. When I bought my ticket, the babushka at the front desk assured me that the tour would be in Russian, however, when the tour began, another one of the guests demanded that the guide  speak only in Ukrainian 'for political reasons'. The museum ended up refunding my ticket.	1642082261.0	hshixr7	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hshixr7/

Zajushka/zajushen'ka (little bunny), kotyonok (little kitten) are also very popular.	1642084199.0	hshn5xj	t3_s2xq4g	t3_s2xq4g	/r/russian/comments/s2xq4g/terms_of_endearment_especially_for_daughters/hshn5xj/

hp3hg	Hi! Have you thought about finding a job over there for a year or two and then applying for a masters program? You could teach English (assuming you are a native speaker) for a while and get better at the language and then apply to a program while you‚Äôre already there. It could be a stepping stone between self taught to academic Russian.	1642169741.0	hsmpcb2	t3_r6wvyg	t3_r6wvyg	/r/russian/comments/r6wvyg/masters_programs_in_russiaukraine/hsmpcb2/

d8ox1pq8	It's at least somewhat stigmatized. I watch the Russian youtuber NFRZ and he very ruefully referred to some famous Russian person who can't roll their r's as having a "speech impediment." It made me feel very self conscious lol. Although I have noticed that a lot of people don't roll their r's so I never know if I'm supposed to be rolling them for any particular word. It's seems no one rolls them for every word.  Anyways, I have practiced it a lot and I would occasionally try but since not everyone does it, it seems really extra.	1642170749.0	hsmroj3	t3_s312mw	t3_s312mw	/r/russian/comments/s312mw/native_speakers_with_the_european_throat_disease/hsmroj3/

3uywgx6a	Oh, you are right. I was just opposing OP and gone little bit too far.  I love winter. -5 to -10 C and snow - it's wonderful. I prefer skiing or unicycling, or just walking. Here in Moscow there are a lot of parks and "forestparks" (out term). In most parks there are trails to walk or cycle and XC ski trails. Apline ski (is it correct term?) places are rather far, in our part of a city there is only one place. You should go deep to suburban to find other places.   City services take away all the snow and it is ok in most streets. They scatter "a salt" to the roads and there is no ice and safe to drive.  Also we used to have weekend travel to some frozen lakes and snowy forests nearby.  Summer is not hot, only couple of week with 30C. Mostly 20C.  One thing bothers me: you can not stay at beach and swim too long, it's steel rather cold for it. Though this summer I spent 1,5 hours in water while crossing Volga in swim event. It was comfortable.  What about your words about premium places. On guy in far north (Ukhta, Komi) told me that the air in north is worse. I don't recall either less pressure or less oxygen, so they have mandatory vacation in south "to breath" as he said.	1642173085.0	hsmxdru	t3_s37a4z	t1_hsmunb4	/r/russian/comments/s37a4z/interesting_russian_words/hsmxdru/

Very often also, final y has the same sound at the end of nouns in final y in accents pronouncing it differently from i in plural ies : levy, levies.

5li67xhe	Thank you everyone for the reply. I appreciate all the different opinions. My plan is to visit Ukraine for 1.5 month. 1 week in Kyiv and the rest in Odesa.  Speaking with a friend in Odesa, majority speak Russian and most businesses have Russian inside (I.e. menus).  Right now Ukraine is the best option for me to immerse in the language.  I am also looking forward to immerse in the Ukraine culture and language.  Also, I wish all the trouble between Russia and Ukraine will stop. And that Ukrainians who are Russian speakers can have their language and culture recognised at the same level as Ukrainian.  Many countries have accepted the colonial past as a fact and have accepted the many generations of these colonial settlers as part of their country. Both culturally and their language. You can not judge the people today based on what their grand parents or great grandparents did. If we judge everyone today based on what the previous generations have done, then we will all go to hell. We simply need to accept the fact.	1642177890.0	hsn9nen	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsn9nen/

In Russian culture, ‚Äúthief‚Äù (–≤–æ—Ä) is usually in this context not referring to somebody who just steals something.. it refers more to a lifelong criminal in organised crime, with tattoos. A good English movie to watch about this is ‚ÄúEastern Promises‚Äù  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_in_law  There is an entire thieves jargon (—Ñ–µ–Ω—è; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenya) and genre of music of the thieves (–±–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ø–µ—Å–Ω—è; –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä: https://youtu.be/bkduTt68JAc)  –ê.–£.–ï!	1642179746.0	hsnehti	t3_s3ojvz	t3_s3ojvz	/r/russian/comments/s3ojvz/what_does_this_say_in_english/hsnehti/

i6ifs44a	Well, you will still spend lots of time learning how to speak and understand Russian like you do in your motherland. It makes more sense when you have some skills in it, let's say A2-B1 in all the 4 types of skills and then you will still learn Russian with a textbook, but in this case the environment will help you and you will have all chances to improve your speaking and listening. Nevertheless, Russians aren't reluctant when it comes to language exchange online, unlike Germans and Koreans.  Regarding your questions  There are 4 types of skills - reading, writing, listening, speaking. Focus on all of them. Yes, you mustn't disregard Grammar as it's the only way to learn this language even if you are a Slav yourself. And don't rely much on your mother tongue. It will only help you in the very beginning.	1642181550.0	hsnj9jy	t3_s3l0zi	t3_s3l0zi	/r/russian/comments/s3l0zi/tips_for_learning_to_speak_russian_like_native/hsnj9jy/

jdz7n	Probably because it doesn't have any punctuation and there's a mistake - it should be –±—É–¥—å –Ω–∞—á–µ–∫—É instead of –±—É–¥—å –Ω–∞ —á–µ–∫—É. This is a fixed expression that means "be wary", and –±—É–¥—å is –±—ã—Ç—å in the imperative. If we punctuate it properly, it would look like this: –ë—É–¥—å –Ω–∞—á–µ–∫—É: –≤ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –¥–Ω–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Å–ª—É—à–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç —Å—Ç–µ–Ω—ã. –ù–µ–¥–∞–ª–µ–∫–æ –æ—Ç –±–æ–ª—Ç–æ–≤–Ω–∏ –∏ —Å–ø–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏ –¥–æ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—ã.

jya24	All the perfective verbs in your examples describe actions which happen instantaneously and produce some significant change of state. You go to the kitchen, you take the cutlets/chops, and one they've been taken, the state of affairs has changed‚Äîyou can't take them again. Likewise, buying a dog, once accomplished, results in a significant change: the dog becomes your property. Likewise, selling one friend only happens once and results in your losing your friend.  By contrast, the verb in your last example describes eating, which you do repeatedly or habitually, so that the scene before and the scene after have no substantial differences.	1642185841.0	hsnugya	t3_s3y5pk	t3_s3y5pk	/r/russian/comments/s3y5pk/confusion_wih_the_perfective_aspect/hsnugya/

But there are numerous context based exceptions, where an imperfective verb means an action in general, whereas a perfective version - a certain action related to the current activity.

lop34	The problem is, palatalized consonants are often perceived as having a short "y" after them. Even the IPA for them has a superscript /j/. In reality there's three options: a distinct "ye" like in "–µ–¥–∞, a "hard e" like in "–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–µ—Ä", and the "soft e" like in –ª–µ—Ç–æ. The latter is somewhere in between e and ye, that' s why even natives argue here about whether or not it should be explained as "ye".  So how do palatalized consonants sound? English doesn't distinguish them, but consider the m in "meet" vs "mob ". I could write the former as "myeet" and that would be the same thing that you're suggesting for "–ª–µ—Ç–æ". But the sound of m is different! The vowel just incorporates that fleeting /j/, same as the Russian e does.	1642421645.0	ht13bjd	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht0h7qg	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht13bjd/

As english speakers, you and I comprehend it differently. It is indeed a ‚Äúye‚Äù sound, it‚Äôs just that the ‚Äúy‚Äù is super slight, it kinda just shadows on the beginning of the word. Otherwise it would just be –ª—ç—Ç–æ.  You‚Äôll notice that even in words that end in ¬´–∏¬ª, it is not a hard ‚Äúee‚Äù, it‚Äôs still almost like a super super slight ‚Äúya‚Äù.

psc30	The e in –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ is a hard ‚Äúyih‚Äù, like a ‚Äúy‚Äù followed by the i in ‚Äúhit‚Äù.  The e in –ª–µ—Ç–æ is like the e in ‚ÄúEdward‚Äù, but with a soft ‚Äúy‚Äù before it.  Are you familiar with palatization?  What‚Äôs really happening is that the consonant before the E is palatized, meaning the middle portion of your tongue is touching the roof of your mouth when you say it. So technically that ‚Äúy‚Äù sound is just a result of your tongue not having left the roof of your mouth yet before you say the ‚Äúe‚Äù. With that in mind, that ‚Äúy‚Äù sound is technically affiliated with the consonant, not the ‚Äúe‚Äù, which is why a Russian would tell you there is no ‚Äúy‚Äù, to them it‚Äôs just how the consonant is being pronounced.	1642437690.0	ht208vn	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht1wsxl	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht208vn/

It doesn't show stress (and neither does the linked Forvo for many declined/conjugated forms), doesnt show irregular irregular conjugations, doesn't give usage examples, doesn't actually explain words.

I think ABBYY app with add-on Explanatory BTS ru-ru (Kuznetsov) and Ermolovich ru-en are a much better combination, especially because it integrates so well with browsers and ereaders.	1642442810.0	ht2dpo8	t3_s647g8	t3_s647g8	/r/russian/comments/s647g8/this_is_a_good_russian_dictionary/ht2dpo8/

jdz7n	It was created by Russians for Russians as a Ru-En-Ru dictionary (eventually other languages were added) so why would it have conjugations or stress marks? It doesn't have explanations because it's not an explanatory dictionary (but you can add quick links to wikitionary), but its collection of usage examples is probably unrivaled since reverso has lots of mistakes and mistranslations. Have you ever looked at the phrases section? In terms of the sheer number of definitions it's probably the biggest dictionary out there.	1642444896.0	ht2j92n	t3_s647g8	t1_ht2dpo8	/r/russian/comments/s647g8/this_is_a_good_russian_dictionary/ht2j92n/

2crcoz1k	–º–æ–π/–º–æ—è/–º–æ—ë = 'my'. They are different because they are used with different genders: –º–æ–π with masculine, –º–æ—è with feminine, and –º–æ—ë with neutral gender.   For example, –¥—Ä—É–≥(a friend) is a masculine noun, so if you want to say 'my friend', you should say '–º–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥'.   –ü–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ (a girlfriend) is feminine, then, my girlfriend = –º–æ—è –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞.  –•–æ–±–±–∏(a hobby) is neutral, then, my hobby = –º–æ—ë —Ö–æ–±–±–∏.  *You can guess gender by the last letter(s) of the noun. Nouns, ended by –∞/—è/—Å—Ç—å are normally feminine. Of course, if they don't mean obviously masculine things, for example, father(–ø–∞–ø–∞), uncle(–¥—è–¥—è). Such nouns are obviously masculine gender.  Words, ended by o/e are neutral.  Words ended by hard consonants(for example, –º/–Ω/–≥/–∫/–¥/—Ç/—Ä...) are normally masculine.  It is great simplificantion, of course. Sometimes it can give you false results, but it will work correct in the most cases.	1642445339.0	ht2kfk1	t3_s5m469	t3_s5m469	/r/russian/comments/s5m469/hi_i_am_currently_learning_russian_on_duolingo/ht2kfk1/

jya24	The case of the cardinal is determined by the external grammatical context, i. e. the slot that it fills in a framing construction. If the cardinal + noun construction is the subject of a clause, or the predicative in an existential clause, the cardinal is in the nominative:  * *–î–≤–µ —Å–æ–±–∞—á—å–∏—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—É—Ä—ã —Å—Ç–æ—è–ª–∏ –≤–æ –¥–≤–æ—Ä–µ.* * *–û–¥–Ω–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—É—Ä–∞ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∞–ª–∏–ª–∞—Å—å.* * *–í –ª–µ—Å—É –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–µ–º—å –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥.*  If the construction is the direct object, the cardinal is in the accusative:  * *–Ø –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª –≤ –ª–µ—Å—É —Å–µ–º—å –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥ –∏ –æ–¥–Ω—É –ª–∏—Å—å—é –Ω–æ—Ä—É.*  If the construction is the genitive complement of another noun, the cardinal is in the genitive:  * *–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∫–∏ —Å–µ–º–∏ –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥* (‚Äúremains of ‚Ä¶‚Äù)  If it occurs in a prepositional phrase, the case is determined by the preposition:  * *—Å —Å–µ–º—å—é –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏–º–∏ –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥–∞–º–∏* * *–∫ —Å–µ–º–∏ –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏–º –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥–∞–º* * *–∏–∑ —Å–µ–º–∏ –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥*  Generally, if you want to know what case the cardinal is in, replace the construction with a bare noun and look what case it is in. The cardinal shall have the same case:  * *–±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥–∏*^(nom) *—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç –ø—É—Å—Ç—ã–µ* ~ {*—Å–µ–º—å*^(nom) *–±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥*} *—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç –ø—É—Å—Ç—ã–µ* * *—è –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥—É*^(acc) ~ *—è –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª* {*—Å–µ–º—å*^(acc) *–±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥*} * ‚Ä¶  In your grammar book, the cardinal + noun constructions presumably stand on their own, outside of any clauses or other framing constructions, so there's no context to speak of. So you can safely assume that it's the default case, i. e. nominative.	1642447081.0	ht2p16x	t3_s5p77i	t1_ht2e3eq	/r/russian/comments/s5p77i/can_someone_check_if_everything_is_ok_with_this/ht2p16x/

Saying –ª–µ—Ç–æ has a 'y' before the 'e' sounds implies a separate 'y' sound, which it isn't ‚Äì as you point out, it's a feature of the palatalized consonant.

It may be helpful for the OP to hear examples of a native speaker pronouncing words that highlight this contrast, in [this video](https://youtu.be/JdoCUN6QSb4); and at 1:29, there are images of waveforms that show the 'y' \[j\] as a separate sound in –ª—å—ë—Ç as opposed to –ª—ë–¥.	1642448345.0	ht2sf6m	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht208vn	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht2sf6m/

60nkf	I just remembered another misadventure from my time studying abroad.  My (American) friend and I wanted some pizza but it was snowing so we decided to order delivery to our dorm. We called the restaurant, struggled our way through ordering, they told us it would be 45 minutes, and we waited.  And waited. And waited. After about an hour and a half, my phone rang and it was the driver saying he was in the building. We told him we'd go down to the lobby but he wasn't there. We tried to give him directions (poorly) He kept calling back and he was getting angrier and angrier but we just could not understand each other.  We went outside looking for him and we finally saw him in front of the wrong building down the street.  We waved him down and he drove up with our pizzas. He was visibly annoyed with us.  Then he saw that my friend was wearing a shirt that said "–Ø –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è" and he busted out laughing hysterically. He was like "Russian but not good at Russian language??" We had a nice laugh with him and gave him a massive tip. Every time we got pizza from them after that he'd be like "My Russian girls!

168j6g	Although there is a very short '–π' produced between palatalized consonants and vowels, the quality of the consonant is more important. For example those 4 syllables are pronounced differently: –ª–∞-–ª—è-–ª—ä—è-–ª—å—è. Russians can hear and recognize this difference. If you focus on the short '–π', it will be hard to distinguish –ª—è-–ª—å—è. If you can hum or hiss the hard consonant for several seconds, you can do it to the palatalized version as well (—Ä-—Ä—å may be the exception). Try it with —Å-—Å—å, –≤-–≤—å, –ª-–ª—å, —Ö-—Ö—å. You can also do it with –º-–º—å-–Ω-–Ω—å, but you'll just be humming in 4 different tones.  If you keep humming '–ª—å' and finish with '–∞' without a pause, you'll end up pronouncing '–ª—è'. Additional short '–π', if any, will be produced naturally.	1642451376.0	ht30a4d	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht208vn	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht30a4d/

1fvilplw	Actually that's an interesting point. Indeed, the default pronunciation of –∏ is like the vowel in "eel", rather than the starting sound in "yield". That said, the original commenter is actually correct on point 3 for –∏:  [–ë—É–∫–≤–∞ –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —å –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–µ—Ç –∑](https://phoneticonline.ru/pravila.html)[–≤—É–∫ \[–π'–∏\]. –†—É—á—å–∏ ‚Üí \[—Ä—É—á'–π'–∏\].](https://phoneticonline.ru/pravila.html)  I'm not so sure about point 2 though. To my ears rendering of –º–æ–∏ as \[–º–∞–π–∏\] or \[–º–∞–∏\] both sound correct, so it might be the case \[–π–∏\] and \[–∏\] after vowels are [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone).	1642456179.0	ht3cowp	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht2y5hk	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht3cowp/

bybipzc7	I have tried many apps so far and Speakly is frankly the best one in my opinion. I work as a ux designer so I really appreciate the ux and ui. I also really like that the app introduces new concepts very gradually. I think the vocabulary is chosen very carefully so that learners (especially beginners) are first presented with the most essential words and phrases.   In my opinion it‚Äôs way batter than Lingvist for example because there is no risk that the app will start showing you more advanced words when you are not ready to learn them yet.

psc30	They are trying to learn pronunciation. They‚Äôre not looking at it from a linguistic perspective, it‚Äôs simply about what they‚Äôre hearing. The reason why something is pronounced a specific way is a whole other demon. The comment was telling them ‚Äúthere is no ‚Äòy‚Äô sound‚Äù, ‚Äú–ø–æ–ª—ë—Ç is just palot‚Äù, which is gonna be super conflicting for them, because there is a distinct Y, wherever it comes from.   My goal was to at least address the sound they were talking about, and then give them some context as to where it comes from, but outright denying that the Y exists is not, in my opinion, an effective way of communicating what‚Äôs happening in the word.	1642459567.0	ht3l6yy	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht2sf6m	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht3l6yy/

There are countless more verbs ending with –µ—Ç—å in second declension like –≥–ª—è–¥–µ—Ç—å which are not listed here because they are stressed in conjugation. But learners of the language don't actually know where to put a stress, they don't have intuition for it like natives.	1642459737.0	ht3lmby	t3_s65br2	t1_ht1jk2o	/r/russian/comments/s65br2/how_to_tell_which_russian_verbs_get_which/ht3lmby/

i647a	Your tip is great for a beginner, but your comment made me curious. I'm a native speaker of both languages and I'm sitting here paying attention to how I'm moving my tongue. I'm not making a yo sound in –ª—ë–¥, but I am in –ª—å—ë—Ç. When I make the yo in –ª—å—ë—Ç, my tongue makes explicit contact with my palette further back than the location of the l. In –ª—ë–¥, I make a papatalized l, which is closer to the roof of the mouth than a regular l. Then I move my tongue into position for the o. I believe what you are hearing is the tongue moving into position from soft l to o creating a brief y, not an explicit y sound that would require readjustment of the tongue. That's why it sounds so brief, and why you don't hear it after hard consonants which aren't close to the roof of the mouth.  In summary, I think it's technically not a y sound - it's the soft l sound that "spills over" into the vowel.	1642465123.0	ht3yd8l	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht1u7dg	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht3yd8l/

s1vmz	Hey, so I mean absolutely no hate whatsoever but almost every part of your last sentence is wrong.  - –∏—Å–∫–∞–ª—å is not a word. "–Ø –±—ã –∏—Å–∫–∞–ª" sounds like "I would be searching" but it would be better to say "–Ø –∏—â—É" - "I'm looking for", or maybe "–Ø —Ö–æ—á—É –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏" - "I want to find", or even "–Ø —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –±—ã –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏" - "I would like to find" if you love the particle –±—ã. - Channel is –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª - The latter clause can get complicated. You could try "–≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º" - "in which", or simply "–≥–¥–µ" - "where". Then, either "—è –º–æ–≥—É" - "I can", or "–º–Ω–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ" - literally "it's allowed for me" but it's just another way of saying "I can".  Don't get discouraged from trying, and you definitely don't deserve hate for it! But it's possible that you could use more lessons before you're ready to speak with natives and they just don't have the patience to correct you.	1642466382.0	ht41avw	t3_s6ece6	t3_s6ece6	/r/russian/comments/s6ece6/a_forum_for_learners/ht41avw/

7pascwg1	I've listened to 3 or 4 interviews for about a minute each and couldn't pick anything too different from modern Russian.  The interviewer speaks with some sort of Old Moscow pronunciation, but contemporary Soviet media persons sound the same. Old Moscow accent in interviewees is very weak or absent at all.  (Goldenweiser has soft –¶ in front of –ò: —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é–¶–¨–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π, –Ω–∞–¶–¨–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ, –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞–¶–¨–∏–∏; Naumov has said —Ä–∏—à–∫–Ω—É–ª instead of —Ä–∏—Å–∫–Ω—É–ª, but I suspect it's just a slip of a tongue; someone else has said something like –Ω–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞–º–∏, but I think he uses plural in a mocking manner, which is common in Russian).

bybipzc7	I have tried many apps so far and Speakly is frankly the best one in my opinion. I work as a ux designer so I really appreciate the ux and ui. I also really like that the app introduces new concepts very gradually. I think the vocabulary is chosen very carefully so that learners (especially beginners) are first presented with the most essential words and phrases.   In my opinion it‚Äôs way batter than Lingvist for example because there is no risk that the app will start showing you more advanced words when you are not ready to learn them yet.

7pascwg1	Based on my school memories:  A sentence that has any other words besides subject and predicate is "—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ".  A sentence that has both subject and predicate is "–ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–µ" (not sure how this concept applies to impersonal sentences, I guess they would be "full" as well).  I don't remember anything about "–æ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è/–æ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—è—é—â–∏–µ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã" from school, but yandexing shows that those are sentences that have forms of address, introductory words and parallel constructions/coordinated member (here's [a table](https://fsd.multiurok.ru/html/2020/04/13/s_5e93933e99d10/1415627_1.jpeg)). I guess the difference between "—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ" and "–æ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ" is that the former only has descriptors of subject and predicate, while the latter can have coordinated members.	1642514117.0	ht6csxb	t3_s6xov4	t3_s6xov4	/r/russian/comments/s6xov4/little_help_with_syntax_problem/ht6csxb/

Lessons of foreign language are oblgatory but education level is usually rather low.

aef0b6v5	Foreign languages are compulsory in school curriculum, I believe 90% is English, no less, there are some schools focused on other languages like French, Spanish or Chinese but they are rare.  The level though are very low practically in every ordinary school - big classes, low motivation, unrealistic programmes whe  kids are supposed to cover more than they're really able to within these hours.   But there are a lot of language schools as extra curriculum, great amount of kids (at least in big cities) attend either these groups (5-10 people most often), or study individually. Many study with private teachers. These kids get good results.	1642531820.0	ht7mc0f	t3_s73d92	t3_s73d92	/r/russian/comments/s73d92/how_common_is_it_for_russians_to_learnspeak/ht7mc0f/

As to forgetting it all - use it or lose it. I forgot most of chemistry even though I majored in biology and had lots of chemistry courses in the university and advanced chemistry classes in school.

cywnw	Historic sound changes. /g/ underwent lenition (a process in which a consonant becomes ‚Äúweaker‚Äù) in some East Slavic dialects. The value of –ì in modern Belarusian is […£], and Ukrainian has something like [ ï ~ …¶], depending on the environment and who you ask. In the genitive case endings, these weaker consonants evidently got dropped between vowels entirely before being separated again by the insertion of [v] in Russian.  As is so often the case in languages whose spellings don‚Äôt seem to match their pronunciations, nobody bothered to change the spelling when all this was going on, so these genitive case endings in Russian still have a trace of the historic pronunciation in them. In that regard, the answer to this question is the same as the answer to ‚ÄúWhy does *knife* have a silent K at the beginning and a silent E at the end?‚Äù Once upon a time, we pronounced them!	1642571364.0	hta8jjy	t3_s5jgau	t1_hsz4eax	/r/russian/comments/s5jgau/how_to_pronounce_–Ω–µ–≥–æ/hta8jjy/

xcxic	As someone who JUST learned it at the start of this year (for this sub's handwriting contest), I recommend to do it early on. My teacher told me I would never have a need or use for Russian cursive being based in the US. But then she started assigning reading assignments that would have italics (that default to Russian cursive) or have instructions entirely in cursive. It was extremely frustrating because I didn't know any of it!   It took me about a week to learn it and it didn't take time away from learning Russian. If anything, it re-ignited my passion to learn!	1642577781.0	htaic8v	t3_s6v99y	t3_s6v99y	/r/russian/comments/s6v99y/would_it_be_better_if_i_learned_russian_cursive/htaic8v/

I find watching films and listening to music is a great way to pick up correct grammatical phrases and refresh your knowledge. There are a lot of Russian films and various tv series‚Äô on YouTube.

89lzwm6d	It took me around a year to hold basic conversations , although I think I held myself back by spending too much time studying grammar.   Once I changed my approach and started listening and repeating , doing audio courses my ability to speak went up a lot. Two years in now I can hold conversations to a basic level , day to day stuff. Now my aim is to acquire vocabulary , this is very slow going. I think consistency is key when learning anything especially languages.  I think it's very possible to get to a good level in three years with the right approach.	1642589561.0	htaxi2m	t3_s7cjiy	t3_s7cjiy	/r/russian/comments/s7cjiy/how_long_would_it_take_to_go_from_no_russian_to/htaxi2m/

You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you! You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good blitz player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "w"esley "s"o is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Firouzja ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my chess carrier, I am Officially inviting you to OTB blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all! I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2016 and 2017 Blitz World championships, and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, Tigran Petrosyan is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off...

4m93q407	Not an expert per se, but as far as I know its a bit like prepositions in English. You could create a rule but it will have a ton of exceptions to each case.  The basic rule i was taught for these when I first started learning was –≤ is to be used for enclosed spaces, and –Ω–∞ for wide, open spaces.  –Ø –≤ —à–∫–æ–ª–µ; —è –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏.  Everything else should probably be picked up by immersion. For example, is —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ (where you work) a wide open space or an enclosed area? Depends where you work, but the correct way is —è –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ.	1642592091.0	htb0ztc	t3_s7nzzx	t3_s7nzzx	/r/russian/comments/s7nzzx/i_still_dont_understand_the_difference_of_usage/htb0ztc/

3llpe	It depends on so much factors that it's impossible to answer: your age, your natural proficiency in acquiring languages, which material you have access to, how much time you can afford to spend on it...  The [US Foreign Service Institute](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) considers Russian a Category III language, meaning they estimate it takes 44 weeks to reach full working proficiency, which is of course quite a bit more than just being able to hold a conversation. But this is for studying the language *full-time*, they mention 1100 class hours, i.e. 25 hours a week, which is in itself already very hard for a casual leaner who has other responsibilities like study/work, but students are also expected to work on the language outside of class.  That being said, if you work consistently at least an hour every day, 6 months is very reasonable for having simple conversations.	1642606306.0	htbti1m	t3_s7cjiy	t3_s7cjiy	/r/russian/comments/s7cjiy/how_long_would_it_take_to_go_from_no_russian_to/htbti1m/

yzmjx	> I think in German or English I don't really do that much with the middle of my tongue  Der Deutsche Ich-Laut ist ein palataler Konsonant (der palatale Frikativ). Die russischen Konsonanten sind palatalisiert, nicht palatal. Palatal bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge ber√ºhrt den harten Gaumen, und palatalisiert bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge n√§hert sich ihm. Aber beide klingen sehr √§hnlich.  Hast du versucht, die palatalisierten Konsonanten mit zur√ºckgerollter Zunge auszusprechen? Das ist etwas v√∂llig anderes.

5lsu0fou	I had that issue with Serbian. My solution is the same as most people have suggested. HUGE amounts of input. Use the extension "Language Reactor" on Chrome and click on the words you don't know. The extension can translate and save them for you. Review the words (however you want, I prefer to just read them from time to time), then REWATCH the videos, ideally multiple times until you understand 90-95%. You don't have to rewatch the same video multiple times in a row, you can of course watch other videos but make sure you rewatch the same videos from time to time.  Russian Progress and Russian with Max are your best friends from now on. Listen to their podcasts too, the level is usually higher.  Artyom is an accomplished language learner, he explains his method here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrulOnlisWQ  I prefer a high tech solution to using a notebook, which is why I use Language Reactor instead.

8u1a8c2o	Well, it's not really socially acceptable for us to assume anything a woman does is an attempt to flirt; in fact that can have some major repercussions, sometimes even jailtime.  It's a lot safer to just assume that women are not into you and not trying to flirt, unless they make it crystal clear that's their intentions.

I was taught that the right form is –ø–æ–µ–∑–∂–∞–π –¥–æ–º–æ–π. Maybe –µ–∑–∂–∞–π is also right.

So, if someone would offer them outside water, they would opine: "–ù–µ —Ñ–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω".

ff11u002	No its not because it's a different script it's because you haven't spent enough raw time with the language via immersion. Through reading a ton and listening a ton. Sounds like you have too much grammar study and not enough immersion study which is common in schools.  As someone who has he exact opposite problem after spending well over 1,000 hours just listening alone and who knows how much reading in russian with maybe 50 being grammar study I can't explain most grammar rules but have no problem putting them to use from pure exposure.  Start reading a couple hours a day and do vocab study through a SRS program and I will bet within 3 months your vocab will absolutely skyrocket and it will finally "stick" Reading is key for acquiring vocab and if your not doing some sort of reading everyday it's just never gonna stick.  It takes tons of repetition of words seeing then in the context of sentences for them to become ingrained in you. Exact same advice goes for listening.	1642625847.0	htd9s0x	t3_s7rv3r	t3_s7rv3r	/r/russian/comments/s7rv3r/does_anyone_else_have_good_understanding_of/htd9s0x/
a0qlz566	>Der Deutsche Ich-Laut ist ein palataler Konsonant (der palatale Frikativ). Die russischen Konsonanten sind palatalisiert, nicht palatal. Palatal bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge ber√ºhrt den harten Gaumen, und palatalisiert bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge n√§hert sich ihm.  Interessant, das wusste ich nicht. Hab mich aber auch noch nie mit der deutschen Phonetik besch√§ftigt. Nur mit der englischen in der Uni. Da gibts ja soweit ich wei√ü zumindest keine palatalen oder palatalisierten Phoneme (anders als im Russischen).   Wahrscheinlich w√ºrde es sich aber mal lohnen, mir auch die deutsche Phonetik mal anzuschauen. Je besser man die Eigenheiten der eigenen Aussprache kennt, desto besser kann man dann einen starken Akzent in anderen Sprachen vermeiden.  Retroflexe Aussprache von Konsonanten klingt sehr anstrengend :D.

The latter sounds more informal IMO. Also, the former is informal too - applied to people you call "—Ç—ã". If you want to say the same to a person you call "–≤—ã", or you say it to a group of people, you better use –µ–¥—Ç–µ/–µ–∑–∂–∞–π—Ç–µ/–ø–æ–µ–∑–∂–∞–π—Ç–µ.

yzmjx	>Danke f√ºr die Artikel, die Bilder sind tats√§chlich recht n√ºtzlich.  Kein Ding :)  >Retroflexe Aussprache von Konsonanten klingt sehr anstrengend :D.  Aa, noch etwas: In manchen Quellen (z.B. englische und spanische Wikipedias) wird der Begriff ‚Äûretroflex‚Äù √∂fter auch f√ºr Laute, die nicht wahr retroflex sind, sondern nur unpalatalisiert. Beispielsweise werden in dieser Art die russichen —à und –∂ im IPA als / Ç/ und / ê/ transkribiert. Aber diese Laute haben keine wahre Retroflexion (die Zunge wird nicht zur√ºckgerollt). Also musst du dir keine Anstrengung damit machen.  Auf der polnischen und deutschen Wikipedia werden sie, richtigerweise, als /‚Å† É‚Å†/ und ‚Äã/‚Å† í‚Å†/ (posalveolare Konsonanten) transkribiert.  Es ist verwirrend und ich bin nicht sicher warum es diesen Unterschied gibt. Die englische Wikipedia sagt, dass die postalveolaren Konsonanten im englischen, deutschen, italienischen usw. eigentlich swach palatalisiert sind, und die im russischen oder polnischen, die √ºberhaupt keine Palatalisation haben, deshalb mit den Symbolen f√ºr die retroflexen Laute transkribiert werden. Ich finde diesen Grund dumm, aber was kann ich tun?  Ich sage dies alles, damit du selbst von der Transkription nicht verwirrt wirdst.  Sprachen mit wahren retroflexen Lauten sind z.B. Schwedisch, Hindi, Tamil und Amerikanisches Englisch (amerikanisches *r*).	1642635262.0	htdy8jm	t3_s737cf	t1_htdbgob	/r/russian/comments/s737cf/i_think_i_finally_understood_what_i_was_doing/htdy8jm/

Additionally, despite there being some patterns/general rules, having to learn two forms of every very and remember which is which is a lot.

8mm42qpr	This word shares the root with the word ¬´–ª–∏—Ç—å¬ª which means to pour. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre singing and pouring the song out in the world.

So I feel like in this context ¬´–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞¬ª is the flow of the song or one specific chorus, hook of the song that is the most pleasant and memorable.  It‚Äôs totally not a name. You can make a diminutive version of any word of you want it to sound cute.	1642692669.0	htgvjbh	t3_s8kr6y	t3_s8kr6y	/r/russian/comments/s8kr6y/–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞_meaning/htgvjbh/

jya24	It's a diminutive, but not a person's nickname. Rather, it's an epithet for a song or tune which can also be called by the adjective *–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–∏—Å—Ç—ã–π*, i. e. sonorous and modulating.  Also, to believe the singer and folklore collector S. N. Starostin (see [this page](https://www.pravda.ru/culture/1623803-naigrishi/)), *–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞* in this song is likely a corruption of *–∑–∞–≤–∏–¥–æ—á–∫–∞*, which means a song from the village of Zavidovo.	1642694507.0	hth0bmy	t3_s8kr6y	t3_s8kr6y	/r/russian/comments/s8kr6y/–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞_meaning/hth0bmy/

gwxm3	People complaining about stress, aspect, cases, verbs of motion, etc are learning wrong. The hard part is vocabulary, which is much less cognate to English than that of Romance or Germanic languages. If you spend 80% of effort listening to native recordings (with transcripts so you can look up unknown words), then stress and grammar are learned automatically, like a native learns them. You also get a better pronunciation, better feel for natural expression style in Russian and of course vastly better listening ability. But you'll still have to learn vocabulary one by one, and even ordinary conversation can use a 10K non-cognate vocabulary (–º–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–∫, –≥–≤–æ–∑–¥—å, –≤–∏–Ω—Ç, –æ—Ç–≤—ë—Ä—Ç–∫–∞, –≥–∞–π–∫–∞, –∫–ª–µ—â–∏, –∏ —Ç.–¥.)	1642695128.0	hth1ygj	t3_s8cyn3	t3_s8cyn3	/r/russian/comments/s8cyn3/ask_english_native_speakers_what_are_the_most/hth1ygj/

zv2tv	Like many old short words, "—Ç–∞–∫" has a lot of close shades of meaning. Literally, "—Ç–∞–∫"="thus" is the answer to "–∫–∞–∫?"="how". But in your two examples the underlying meaning of "—Ç–∞–∫" is a little different.  [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian)  In the first, it's mentioned in the wiktionary: "—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ" = "never". You can parse it literally as "You still didn't say" = "–¢—ã —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª". "–¢–∞–∫ –∏" has a sense of continuing the same way. "–û–Ω —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª –ø–ª—ã—Ç—å –ø–æ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—é". "–¢—ã —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª –Ω–µ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –º–Ω–µ, –∫–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å" - a little clunky but grammatically it works.  In the second example, "I told Tom exactly this", "–∏" usually means that you agree with some previous statement. "–Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: –Ω–µ –µ—à—å –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã!" (I told Tom this: don't eat unfamiliar mushrooms") is one step from a dialogue like this:  >B: –¢–æ–º –≤—á–µ—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—Å—è –≥—Ä–∏–±–∞–º–∏   >   >A: –Ø –±—ã –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã –Ω–∏ –∑–∞ —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–∞–ª –µ—Å—Ç—å   >   >B: –Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: –Ω–µ –µ—à—å –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã! (what B said to Tom doesn't need to exactly coincide with what A said to B, but B still emphasizes his agreement with A's sentiment.)   >   >B: –Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª! - (also works, what exactly B said to Tom is implied. In this instance it's not very clear, maybe my example is not the best, or maybe B is not clinically precise in his everyday speech)  If it seems weird that "how/thus" means "what/this", it's not rare but not very common. "–ö–∞–∫ –æ–Ω –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª?" = "What did he do?" (in English there is "how did he behave" which has a similar weirdness of how \~ what). It *is* especially common around verbs of speech, I don't logically understand the nuances well enough to explain it. Why is it "–¢–∞–∫ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞", and not "–ß—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞" or "–≠—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞"?	1642698494.0	hthb4qp	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthb4qp/
h3qjoj2	¬´–¢–∞–∫¬ª has a meaning that quite hard to explain. It means something like "so" in the way "how the things are", or "how the things should be", or "like this", or "this way". –Ø —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî I said so. –Ø —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª —ç—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫ ‚Äî I said it this way.  ¬´–ò¬ª, when added to verbs, used for emphasis, kinda like that the action is "really" happened. –Ø –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –µ–º—É —ç—Ç–æ ‚Äî I did say to him/So I said to him.  ¬´–¢–∞–∫ –∏¬ª combines them into emphasis on the action being exact. –Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –µ–º—É –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî I said to him exactly this. Also used a lot in sarcastic tone: –¢–∞–∫ —è –µ–º—É —ç—Ç–æ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî Like I'd say to him this.  ¬´–¢–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ¬ª is a set expression that means "still didn't/haven't". Like "how the things are, did not change" –¢—ã –º–Ω–µ —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî You still haven't said to me.  P.S. we also have ¬´-—Ç–∞–∫–∏¬ª that means something like "actually", "apparently" or "finally". –û–Ω-—Ç–∞–∫–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –º–Ω–µ ‚Äî He finally said to me.	1642698511.0	hthb6f7	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthb6f7/

jya24	This *–∏* is a kind of emphatic particle, very approximately meaning ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúexactly‚Äù, ‚Äúquite‚Äù. However, your two examples are different. In *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –¢–æ–º—É –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª*, the adverb *—Ç–∞–∫* simply means ‚Äúthus‚Äù, ‚Äúso‚Äù, ‚Äúin such a way‚Äù. The particle *–∏* can be dropped, removing the emphasis: *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –¢–æ–º—É —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª* (or, with a more neutral word order: *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –¢–æ–º—É*) means ‚ÄúI said so to Tom‚Äù. With the particle, it means ‚ÄúThat's exactly what I said to Tom.‚Äù  On the other hand, *—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ* has become a set expression: *S —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ V-–ª* = ‚ÄúS never V-ed‚Äù, ‚ÄúX failed to V‚Äù. The *—Ç–∞–∫* in it has more or less lost all independent meaning, like, e. g., *-so-* in English *whatsoever*.	1642698754.0	hthbu2z	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthbu2z/

In my time, we had like 31 hours of high math alone per week, it's brain raping even for a 17 y.o. recent math-specialized high school graduate. We had a couple of 30 years old students, they dropped after the 1st year.

gwxm3	People complaining about stress, aspect, cases, verbs of motion, etc are learning wrong. The hard part is vocabulary, which is much less cognate to English than that of Romance or Germanic languages. If you spend 80% of effort listening to native recordings (with transcripts so you can look up unknown words), then stress and grammar are learned automatically, like a native learns them. You also get a better pronunciation, better feel for natural expression style in Russian and of course vastly better listening ability. But you'll still have to learn vocabulary one by one, and even ordinary conversation can use a 10K non-cognate vocabulary (–º–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–∫, –≥–≤–æ–∑–¥—å, –≤–∏–Ω—Ç, –æ—Ç–≤—ë—Ä—Ç–∫–∞, –≥–∞–π–∫–∞, –∫–ª–µ—â–∏, –∏ —Ç.–¥.)	1642695128.0	hth1ygj	t3_s8cyn3	t3_s8cyn3	/r/russian/comments/s8cyn3/ask_english_native_speakers_what_are_the_most/hth1ygj/

zv2tv	Like many old short words, "—Ç–∞–∫" has a lot of close shades of meaning. Literally, "—Ç–∞–∫"="thus" is the answer to "–∫–∞–∫?"="how". But in your two examples the underlying meaning of "—Ç–∞–∫" is a little different.  [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian)  In the first, it's mentioned in the wiktionary: "—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ" = "never". You can parse it literally as "You still didn't say" = "–¢—ã —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª". "–¢–∞–∫ –∏" has a sense of continuing the same way. "–û–Ω —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª –ø–ª—ã—Ç—å –ø–æ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—é". "–¢—ã —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª –Ω–µ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –º–Ω–µ, –∫–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å" - a little clunky but grammatically it works.  In the second example, "I told Tom exactly this", "–∏" usually means that you agree with some previous statement. "–Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: –Ω–µ –µ—à—å –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã!" (I told Tom this: don't eat unfamiliar mushrooms") is one step from a dialogue like this:  >B: –¢–æ–º –≤—á–µ—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—Å—è –≥—Ä–∏–±–∞–º–∏   >   >A: –Ø –±—ã –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã –Ω–∏ –∑–∞ —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–∞–ª –µ—Å—Ç—å   >   >B: –Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: –Ω–µ –µ—à—å –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã! (what B said to Tom doesn't need to exactly coincide with what A said to B, but B still emphasizes his agreement with A's sentiment.)   >   >B: –Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª! - (also works, what exactly B said to Tom is implied. In this instance it's not very clear, maybe my example is not the best, or maybe B is not clinically precise in his everyday speech)  If it seems weird that "how/thus" means "what/this", it's not rare but not very common. "–ö–∞–∫ –æ–Ω –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª?" = "What did he do?" (in English there is "how did he behave" which has a similar weirdness of how \~ what). It *is* especially common around verbs of speech, I don't logically understand the nuances well enough to explain it. Why is it "–¢–∞–∫ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞", and not "–ß—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞" or "–≠—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞"?	1642698494.0	hthb4qp	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthb4qp/
h3qjoj2	¬´–¢–∞–∫¬ª has a meaning that quite hard to explain.

jya24	This *–∏* is a kind of emphatic particle, very approximately meaning ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúexactly‚Äù, ‚Äúquite‚Äù. However, your two examples are different. In *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –¢–æ–º—É –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª*, the adverb *—Ç–∞–∫* simply means ‚Äúthus‚Äù, ‚Äúso‚Äù, ‚Äúin such a way‚Äù. The particle *–∏* can be dropped, removing the emphasis: *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –¢–æ–º—É —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª* (or, with a more neutral word order: *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –¢–æ–º—É*) means ‚ÄúI said so to Tom‚Äù. With the particle, it means ‚ÄúThat's exactly what I said to Tom.‚Äù  On the other hand, *—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ* has become a set expression: *S —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ V-–ª* = ‚ÄúS never V-ed‚Äù, ‚ÄúX failed to V‚Äù. The *—Ç–∞–∫* in it has more or less lost all independent meaning, like, e. g., *-so-* in English *whatsoever*.	1642698754.0	hthbu2z	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthbu2z/

7w2wxh	I'm afraid the major difficulty would be not Russian, but the math courses. CS programs in Russia are supposed to be really hard math-wise, not something a 30 years old brain can accommodate.  In my time, we had like 31 hours of high math alone per week, it's brain raping even for a 17 y.o. recent math-specialized high school graduate. We had a couple of 30 years old students, they dropped after the 1st year. Those who we 20-25 generally struggled, but some of them graduated.	1642700807.0	hthhkzz	t3_s89j5m	t3_s89j5m	/r/russian/comments/s89j5m/studying_comp_sci_in_saint_petersburg/hthhkzz/

w188y	>Even letter like a are written completely different to in Latin  Could you elaborate, please? I've only seen the letter "a" (lowercalse) to be written the exact same way: you write "o" and then add a line on the right.  If I were you, I'd stick with writing cursive, at least for some time to get used to the shapes of the letters.

7bwehon1	From you saying its weird and nothing like Latin I think you're focusing too much on your prior knowledge of the latin script.  Its meant to be different because its not the Latin script. Its Cyrillic, its written in the way Cyrillic is meant to be written. The only reason there are 'common' letters between Latin and Cyrillic is because they both come from the same ancestor. Im sure ancient greeks would argue the way we write the letters from their alphabet is weird and nothing like theirs too tbf  You can adjust and have your own way of writing by all means as long as you can read it yourself. But its worth taking time to study cursive a little, not only does it help writing fast but in some text fonts theres a semi cursive semi print style so knowing the cursive helps with that at least. E.g —Ç will be written as m etc.	1642703866.0	hthpzol	t3_s8n4vl	t1_hthhws4	/r/russian/comments/s8n4vl/should_i_write_in_print_or_cursive_cursive_is/hthpzol/

Beware of books that force you to learn whole phrases without understanding what its words mean separately and why they have their exact endings. Linguistics manuals aren't good either. It should have exercises with keys too. You will need a help of a native speaker from the beginning, because books don't talk and Russian pronunciation will seem ridiculously hard unless you can speak Polish.   Forget about unadapted movies and books , you have to dive deep into Grammar and linguistic stuff. Learning apps should be an addition to your learning plan, but not its core.	1642705750.0	hthv5nm	t3_s8e8wi	t3_s8e8wi	/r/russian/comments/s8e8wi/recommendations_for_beginners/hthv5nm/

It‚Äôs not meant to be temporal, but to emphasize how little significance the action has.   It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI only just‚Äù in English. Excessive, but not grammatically wrong.   I personally find the temporal modifier stuck between two verbs more offensive.	1642720833.0	htiw5of	t3_s8ljtx	t1_hthctrw	/r/russian/comments/s8ljtx/what_do_you_feel_reading_this/htiw5of/

fsjl9	I had no prior background in learning foreign languages and started Russian 2 years ago at the age of 26. Literally everything is/was difficult. The pronunciation is hard, the cases are hard, the amount of information which gets packed into verbs is hard and just generally the fact that ideas are expressed very differently compared to English makes it so that it is difficult to get accustomed to the language.    I would say that the only 2 easy parts I can think of are:    1. the writing system (cyrllic is easy to learn and there aren't too many surprises in how words are pronounced based on how they are spelled).   2. Russian people don't speak too quickly. Obviously this varies by person, and I've seen some people speak the language very fast, but compared to Spanish, Japanese and even some English speakers, it seems to me like Russians on the whole aren't motor mouths.	1642721369.0	htixgf4	t3_s8cyn3	t3_s8cyn3	/r/russian/comments/s8cyn3/ask_english_native_speakers_what_are_the_most/htixgf4/

6wul2	There's no direct equivalent. You can say —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ç, I guess - that's an older type of degree that was generally 5 to 6 years, and the only degree you got unless you wanted to go into academia. Eventually it got split into bachelors and masters to better align with the rest of the world.	1643144306.0	hu7c35w	t3_scnbo3	t3_scnbo3	/r/russian/comments/scnbo3/how_do_you_say_honours_degree_in_russian/hu7c35w/

9u6cinkc	well, I don't know, to be honest.    We have –í—ã—Å—à–µ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏e - you get your –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º –æ –≤—ã—Å—à–µ–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ after 4 or 5 years of university   then you can go for –º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ - it's an additional a year or two and you're right, according to Wikipedia it's the equivalent of masters degree.   and after this you can go for –∞—Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—É—Ä–∞ - and become a "candidate of sciences" or "–∫–∞–Ω–¥–∏–¥–∞—Ç –Ω–∞—É–∫" I believe it's the equivalent of PhD.   PS. Google says that honors degree is –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º —Å –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏–µ–º,  which basically means the same –≤—ã—Å—à–µ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ but all the subjects were passed with the best marks, 9 and 10.	1643144347.0	hu7c7ad	t3_scnbo3	t3_scnbo3	/r/russian/comments/scnbo3/how_do_you_say_honours_degree_in_russian/hu7c7ad/
9pbfx36r	In Russia, we only have "—Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ç" ("specialist" degrees; usually 5 years of studies, roughly equal to bachelors and masters combined),,–±–∞–∫–∞–ª–∞–≤—Ä–∏–∞—Ç (bachelors), –º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ (masters), –∞—Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—É—Ä–∞ (\~PhD postgraduate studies), –¥–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—É—Ä–∞ (higher doctoral studies), + a few other degrees for medical doctors).  So, there is no exact equivalent. However, it's possible to say "–¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º —Å –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏–µ–º" \~ diploma "with distinction"/"with honours". So, "–¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º –±–∞–∫–∞–ª–∞–≤—Ä–∞ —Å –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏–µ–º" would mean, literally, "bachelor's diploma with honours". Not sure if it really conveys the meaning but it sounds OK.  "–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–≤—É–∑–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ" is worse because it sounds very formal, and, I think, it usually covers PhD and further studies.	1643144504.0	hu7cmgq	t3_scnbo3	t3_scnbo3	/r/russian/comments/scnbo3/how_do_you_say_honours_degree_in_russian/hu7cmgq/

12ux2q	There is remember, remind, recollect, recall, think of, even bethink, but the art is in knowing how this maps to the list you just wrote yourself, because the mapping isn't one to one. To make this clear, I completely agree with you, though. Unless it's reminding somebody else, in which case "remember" would sound dialectal or uneducated, English has mostly "remember", and "recall" is simply used as a variant in register, trying (in vain) to sound sophisticated.	1643153564.0	hu7zpbx	t3_sb6xve	t1_htzfq9u	/r/russian/comments/sb6xve/helpp_whats_the_difference_between_–≤—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ç—å_and/hu7zpbx/

2tlfl64j	Start with the basic basic elements. A lot of which can be learned with Babbel/Duolingo  After you've got the Alphabet down, start listening to audio and practicing your pronunciation this will help you better get an ear for listening to other speakers.  From there it is a combination of exposure to different media and vocabulary.  ###Do not  Try to learn all of the grammar first. Basic grammar is acceptable to understand the concepts. But if you try to learn the grammar by textbook means you will be sorely disappointed.   If you need help finding music/movies/YouTube channels ask around!	1643169230.0	hu90mb1	t3_scpnuj	t3_scpnuj	/r/russian/comments/scpnuj/i_would_like_to_begin_learning_russian_does/hu90mb1/

ixioah8v	Navalny insulted Uzbekistan, indirectly calling its population ignorant and illiterate.   In a program broadcast on the Dozhd TV channel, Navalny said that "naturally, no one in Uzbekistan knows what Pushkin is." Neither who is, but WHAT is, as an object, not a person.With this phrase, the oppositionist once again showed that he has little idea what he is talking about. So, he is an Uzbek himself. In Russia, Navalny is considered a traitor who sells his homeland. Only very small and stupid schoolchildren take seriously this illiterate monkey sitting on a leash of Western special services. He constantly says all sorts of stupid things and becomes a meme.	1643176457.0	hu9ej84	t3_sc7qx6	t3_sc7qx6	/r/russian/comments/sc7qx6/i_saw_this_gif_online_what_does_it_mean_translate/hu9ej84/

434wy2qh	The very best thing to do would be to take a class, either IRL or online, even if it's just Skyping with a tutor once a week. Feedback is so important and structure is good, especially in the early stages of learning.  The free podcast "Russian Made Easy" is a great primer for grammar, IMO. Russian nouns change their endings (declension) in a myriad of ways, and there are a lot of rules to learn. This podcast helps prepare your brain for the concept by explaining how it works in terms of pattern recognition, matching and rhyming. It was an invaluable foundation for me.  Both grammar and immersion are important, and there are tons of resources for free in the Interwebs. Be sure to check this sub's Wiki for a comprehensive list. Some of my favorites: Youtube channels "Russian with Max," "Be Fluent in Russian," "Real Russian Club." Podcasts "Comprehensible Russian," "Russian with Daria," "Speaking Russian."

8vhhkjxb	The difference, in addition to shorted forms, is that ¬´–±¬ª is more colloquial and typical for fast speech. The comparison between ‚ÄúI have-I‚Äôve‚Äù and ‚Äú–±—ã-–±‚Äù is the best illustrational example.	1643194807.0	hua31y9	t3_sd2t4u	t1_hua1nek	/r/russian/comments/sd2t4u/when_do_you_use_–µ—Å–ª–∏_–±_and_when_–µ—Å–ª–∏_–±—ã_and_what/hua31y9/

jya24	I doubt the ante-vocalic position is of any importance. At least in written language, *–±—ã* before vowels is totally normal. A rough calculation with the NCRL (main corpus) shows that *–±—ã* is about 12 times more frequent than *–±* before vowels, and about 13 times more frequent before consonants. That's essentially no difference. In spoken language, a quick-and-dirty experiment is difficult to make, because the boundary between what can be transcribed as *–±—ã* and as *–±* is rather fuzzy.	1643195343.0	hua3rc7	t3_sd2t4u	t1_hua1n5c	/r/russian/comments/sd2t4u/when_do_you_use_–µ—Å–ª–∏_–±_and_when_–µ—Å–ª–∏_–±—ã_and_what/hua3rc7/

2crcoz1k	ok, –∑–∞–¥–∏—Ä–∞ doesn't suppose specific gender, it can be feminine or musculine.  you can say –∫—Ä–∏–≤–æ–µ –∫–æ—Å–æ–µ –¥–æ–º–∏—à–∫–æ too.  –ø–æ–¥–º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—å–µ is not so common word. Ok, we can add new rule for words, ended by e. If this word used for human, it is musculine.   I've simplificate it. Of course you can find some words that dont fit that scheme. But it works much more often than doesn't work. It's not an article from comprehensive grammar book.	1643206603.0	huanr3s	t3_sd3j5h	t1_huam8l4	/r/russian/comments/sd3j5h/russian_genders/huanr3s/

Or open the Russian wiki link I posted above.  Find I —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ (first declension): it contains nouns ending with –∞/—è, both masculine and feminine, and the wiki has examples of both. II —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ: nouns ending with o/e/—å/zero ending, of masculine or middle gender. Again examples are there.  III —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ: nouns ending with —å of feminine gender only. The point is in Russian language noun endings don't allow identifying genders reliably.	1643207598.0	huaq1xl	t3_sd3j5h	t1_huanr3s	/r/russian/comments/sd3j5h/russian_genders/huaq1xl/

434wy2qh	Well, of course you'll need to know a handful of words before you start with the grammar. :) Russian grammar has six cases, or six ways in which each word can decline. It's generally recommended to learn one case at a time. It's a lot to take in--depending on how much you study and how quickly you take to it, it can take months or years to get a firm grasp on them.  I did see a B&B video where he says you don't need grammar, but I might point out that directly afterward, he rattles off a bunch of grammatical terms and does the declension of a few words as an example. I get his point--your grammar doesn't have to be perfect. ...And don't worry, it won't be, even when you're trying really hard! XD  Grammar is actually your friend. If nouns, adjectives, and verbs are your boards, nails, and glue, then grammar is your toolbox full of hammers and saws. You can try to drive a nail into the board with your hands or forehead, but in the long run it's much easier to learn to use what's in the toolbox. :D	1643216745.0	hube8at	t3_scpnuj	t1_hu9tv7e	/r/russian/comments/scpnuj/i_would_like_to_begin_learning_russian_does/hube8at/

And pretty often it's a matter of what flows better, like if there are lots of consonants that are hard to pronounce you intuitively use –±—ã to add some vowel etc.  By the way, –±—ã/–± is not the only one like this, there is also –∂–µ/–∂ and –ª–∏/–ª—å and probably something else but I can't remind right not.

dtqny3rg	Yes, nobody uses –∏–º–µ—Ç—å in the sense of possession in ordinary speech except in some fixed "abstract" phrases such as –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –≤ –≤–∏–¥—É = to have in mind and –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ = to have the right.  –ò–º–µ—Ç—å is just not an everyday kind of possession.   This question of course has been asked before, including on this subreddit:  https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/3ezefs/when_to_use_%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C_and_when_to_use_%D1%83_%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81_%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C/  https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/jkahn4/why_%D1%83_%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_instead_of_%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C/	1643234359.0	hucrvf5	t3_sdhfhw	t3_sdhfhw	/r/russian/comments/sdhfhw/question/hucrvf5/
12ux2q	(non-native here)  –ò–º–µ—Ç—å is used for abstract things, eg have in mind = –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –≤ –≤–∏–¥—É, while —É –º–µ–Ω—è is more universal and is used for plain 'have'. –£ –º–µ–Ω—è vs —É –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å is the next difference. Simple, concrete "I have" is —É –º–µ–Ω—è most of the time.	1643234434.0	hucs2lq	t3_sdhfhw	t3_sdhfhw	/r/russian/comments/sdhfhw/question/hucs2lq/

7pascwg1	I've posted [this](https://rjano.ruslang.ru/ru/archive/2017-1/86-115) here before, but as a native speaker I've found this article very enlightening, though sometimes the author goes too deep to find a distinction, where I see none.  Anyways, the most important point I got out of it, is that *—É –º–µ–Ω—è* without *–µ—Å—Ç—å* signifies immediate possession, i.e. 'I've got or control the thing right now', while *–µ—Å—Ç—å* adds a nuance of ownership.	1643235157.0	huctzjq	t3_sdhfhw	t1_hucs2lq	/r/russian/comments/sdhfhw/question/huctzjq/
9u6cinkc	I would say that it's better to use the latter one.    Check this out: "–£ –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞" sounds  okay, but "–Ø –∏–º–µ—é —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä—É" sounds really weird and could be interpreted as "I'm having a sister" like with a sexual connotation.   So, basically, it's really safer to use "—É –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å" since it can't be misunderstood in most cases.	1643235205.0	hucu45r	t3_sdhfhw	t3_sdhfhw	/r/russian/comments/sdhfhw/question/hucu45r/
2oxktk9f	First, it depends on the region. In Moscow, for example, the prices range from 1500 all the way up to 4000.  Second, it depends on the teacher's qualifications. For example, a teacher who has passed, say, CAE, will be at least 20% more expensive than those who are not. In a regular city (not Moscow or Saint-P) a price of 1000-1500 is more than okay.	1643235252.0	hucu8pn	t3_sddrrb	t1_huc0yd5	/r/russian/comments/sddrrb/whats_the_reasonable_price_for_an_online_60minute/hucu8pn/
8vhhkjxb	Bruh.   bruh the first.) The Great. ‚ÄòAn occasionally true story‚Äô. Satire on cultural, social, political and any other background of Catherine‚Äôs times, or better to say the times of Catherine the Great but turned upside down, no joke, everything is shifted for the comical effect.  Blasphemies in Orthodox Russia. Again. Blasphemies in the Orthodox Russian Empire. Blasphemies in the very first series! and you thought it was real! Now you can easily say such things (with certain precautions), but back in the times of Catherine you would get beheaded or something far worse than that (Orthodoxy is a part of our culture, even after passing through atheistic Soviet times. You can be atheist in Russia, but you can‚Äôt erase Orthodoxy from our country, from our people, it is like in our blood).  African and Middle East actors as Russians (it can be Netflix, it can be a part of the satire, God only knows).   Just tell me how could you think it was real? Everybody swearing, fucking and killing people. I know some people think that Russians are crazy‚Ä¶ yes, we drink balalaikas with our vodkas and play bears while squating on our heads‚Ä¶ but do you all really think it was that bad? do you really think it is that bad now? You made my day. You should definitely visit Russia someday. Better Summer/Winter. You‚Äòll be surprised.   bruh the second.) Mostly, we don‚Äôt use Netflix and any other streaming services. We are the land of pirates. In Russia you can type ‚Äò–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è 1 —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å 1080‚Äô (lit. The Great 1st season watch 1080) in google and you‚Äôll be blessed with this beautiful comedy any time which is magnificent with Russian dubbing (–ê—Ä—á–∏ —É –Ω–∏—Ö - –ü–∏—Å—å–∫–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å, –∫–æ–Ω–≥–µ–Ω–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ! –ø—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–æ–∫—É–ø–∏—Ç–µ, –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞, —Ä–æ—è–ª—å!). My gf offered me to watch it in the end of 2021, and we did the first season and started the second one. We enjoyed it (but postponed). Yes, we can watch legally almost anything here with exceptions for recordings of fair elections, interviews with people who tell us about e.g. weed experience (im longing for a good joint, my man, sometimes that‚Äôs so sad I don‚Äôt live in e.g. Canada), songs with LGBT context and some pretty radical and discrediting creations of people opposed to our government (recreation, political stuff and etc). Why can‚Äôt we watch these particular things? The answer to this is somewhere within our baldy shorty and his government.   bruh the third.) my father (52) bought Netflix subscription. He has been casually watching some series in English. He watches US series. I don‚Äôt remember for sure, what he‚Äôs watching (I‚Äôm a busy student; I‚Äôm not really interested; I prefer movies to series with exceptions for fucking anime, something funny like The Great, something like David fucking Lynch; I‚Äôm more into art and farce), but I bet it‚Äôs something witty-witty, stupidly-funny-but-with-soul-like-Lilyhammer (I haven‚Äôt watched it, just fragments), witty-manly or witty-romantic-and-sad-like-the-old-Blade-Runner-or-something-like-Lost-in-translation, cause he‚Äôs a poser, my old fella.	1643235506.0	hucux43	t3_sdam1h	t3_sdam1h	/r/russian/comments/sdam1h/do_many_netflix_subscribers_in_russia_use_vpns_to/hucux43/

You can find it in VK or maybe some mirror channel, which may exist but I am not sure if it does.  The channel consists of cat pics with phrases written in Lobster font in the lower part. It may sound like I am trolling, but I am not, I believe this is an extremely prolific example of Russian meme culture which is 100% original and not borrowed from some other internet cultures.	1643293692.0	hufx1dy	t3_sdm0sp	t1_hufrnf5	/r/russian/comments/sdm0sp/ive_been_wondering_what_they_say_for_years/hufx1dy/

cj2bk	It stems from "–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å", which means to speak or to have a talk. The preposition "–¥–æ" implies that the talk must come to a conclusion of some sort.  The most common meaning is "to negotiate", which sounds like "–¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è". "–î–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—à—å—Å—è" is the singular future tense on this verb. I am not sure if you put the question mark there intentionally or not, but in a form of a question it usually means "are you going to make a deal?"  However, there is also another meaning. Remember how I mentioned the conclusion of a talk? Well, there is a way to threaten people with it too. "–¢—ã –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—à—å—Å—è —É –º–µ–Ω—è" can be used as a warning for someone who doesn't watch their mouth. It is basically "continue speaking and see what comes next".	1643299513.0	hugbsvo	t3_se16em	t3_se16em	/r/russian/comments/se16em/what_does_this_word_mean_–¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—à—å—Å—è_what/hugbsvo/
45hzmn1f	They are more or less interchangeable but –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ has a slight preference for people, –≤–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ has a slight preference for objects and for potential movement (degree of freedom).

9tx9t	Not a native but –¥–∞–≤–∞–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –∏–ª–∏ –¥–æ–º–æ–π both rhymes and means the same basic thing. Tho I'm not actually sure –¥–∞–≤–∞–π is actually used this way. It's casually used to replace alot of verbs but alternatively you could just say –∏–¥–∏ which is more literal for "go" but it's not like the English phrase is actually suggesting travel so I think –¥–∞–≤–∞–π is likely closer	1643300332.0	hugdzmk	t3_se0xoh	t3_se0xoh	/r/russian/comments/se0xoh/go_big_or_go_home_translated_in_russian_for_a/hugdzmk/

6n370rr2	I think you shouldn't make a list of "what to learn" in a specific order but just have fun with the language instead, especially if you gave up before.  I started russian at uni and we were mainly learning grammar, conjugation and... cases. Bad idea, I drowed in all the grammar rules and gave up as soon as I stopped the courses. I only started around 1 year ago to study by myself (so 6+ years after I left school) and I still haven't really touched the cases, except a few simple videos I watched (amazing russian on youtube)  So if you restart from beginner level, I really, I mean REALLY recommend to ignore the cases! find music you like, youtube channels, easy books, Duolinguo or any app you like but don't go hard on grammar and cases and you'll understand why later.  Now after nearly 1 year I can easily understand easy sentences, talk a bit and I started reading books (with translation) cases only start to be usefull when you want to talk and for that you first need a lot of vocabulary.     Just be consistent, do something you like and enjoy, it's a long journey but it's worth it ;)	1643303128.0	huglq3f	t3_sdw3qz	t3_sdw3qz	/r/russian/comments/sdw3qz/how_should_i_proceed/huglq3f/

For example, a question in an episode a while back was the differences of what to call shawarma in Moscow vs. Petersburg, and the reason for the difference. They have been doing a running series over the last year or so about different styles of Russian spoken in different countries (the last handful of episodes were about Russian in Japan, Spain, Ukraine, Georgia, and Australia).  https://meduza.io/podcasts/rozental-i-gildenstern	1643311602.0	huh9i4v	t3_se3kjd	t3_se3kjd	/r/russian/comments/se3kjd/russian_podcasts/huh9i4v/

j1fpbz2i	Your interpretation is wrong, it means at least as beautiful as full form. Now... I'm native but not a philologist. It seems that it means some sort of temporality, like it's beautiful currently. For example "–æ–Ω–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–∞—è" kind of implies a timeless quality, and –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–∞ is something like "being beautiful".	1643325208.0	hui9q7k	t3_sebgjw	t3_sebgjw	/r/russian/comments/sebgjw/further_understanding_the_short_adjectives/hui9q7k/

jya24	Grammatically, adjectives can be used either as modifiers (as in English *a beautiful house*; this is also called attributive usage), or as predicates (as in *the house is beautiful*). What you call ‚Äúafter the noun‚Äù is, in fact, the predicative usage with a zero copula: *–¥–æ–º {} –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤*. ‚ÄúZero‚Äù means that the copula is there conceptually, but is not expressed by a word. If you put the sentence in the past or the future tense, the copula reappears: *–¥–æ–º {–±—ã–ª / –±—É–¥–µ—Ç} –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤*.  In Russian, the role of adjective (predicative or attributive) is, strictly speaking, independent of word order. It's more common for the predicate to follow the subject; but if the predicate adjective is [topicalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment), or if the subject is the [communicative focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_%28linguistics%29), the predicate shall normally precede the subject: *–ö—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤ –≤–µ—Å—å –¥–æ–º, –∞ –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∫—Ä—ã—à–∞* = ‚ÄúIt is the whole house which is beautiful, not just the roof‚Äù. And vice versa, an attributive adjective usually appears before the noun it modifies, but can also move after it, especially in colloquial language: *–ö–∞–∫–æ–π —É —Ç–µ–±—è –¥–æ–º –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π!* = ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful house you have!‚Äù  Generally, a short form of an adjective can only be used predicatively. A full form can be used both predicatively and attributively. The choice between short and full form in predicative usage is a complicated issue: there's no single rule, it depends on the adjective. Sometimes, both forms are possible, and the difference in meaning between short and full form is negligible: *–¥–æ–º –±—ã–ª –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π* and *–¥–æ–º –±—ã–ª –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤* mean more or less the same thing, the choice between them is purely a matter of style (the short form is marginally more bookish, the full form more conversational). But sometimes, they mean different things: *—Ç—ã —Å–º–µ—à–Ω–æ–π* = ‚Äúyou're funny‚Äù, while *—Ç—ã —Å–º–µ—à–æ–Ω* = ‚Äúyou're ridiculous‚Äù. For some adjectives, only the short form or only the full form is possible: we can say *–æ–Ω —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω—ã–π* = ‚Äúhe's gifted‚Äù, but not \**–æ–Ω —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω* (in the short form, it's only used as ‚Äúhe's capable of _‚Äù and requires a complement, e. g. *–æ–Ω —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ* or *–æ–Ω —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞—Ç—å*); *–º—ã –∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã* = ‚Äúwe're acquainted‚Äù, but not \**–º—ã –∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ*.	1643329198.0	huijcvk	t3_sebgjw	t3_sebgjw	/r/russian/comments/sebgjw/further_understanding_the_short_adjectives/huijcvk/

jya24	You're welcome. Unfortunately, many things about Russian (and any other language, for that matter) are very difficult to explain in a practical way. A high-level linguistic description is often useless for a learner, and the best advice is: soak in as many examples of live usage as you can, let go of your native preconceptions, and try to develop an [intuition](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48701).	1643333514.0	huitn0e	t3_sebgjw	t1_huikhbw	/r/russian/comments/sebgjw/further_understanding_the_short_adjectives/huitn0e/

dtqny3rg	There is no way to answer the question until you explain what *you* mean by "know a language" and what your friend means by "know a language." You two might not mean the same thing.  So I don't think this is even really important. If you are at A1/A2 level, then you do not have a strong enough command of the language to get by in it, so you have a huge amount of work to do, regardless of what other people are saying.  I think your friend says you know Russian since Russians don't expect anyone who is not living in or near Russia to speak their language. They are often amazed that anyone who didn't grow up speaking Russian can say anything in Russian at all.  You could ask the same thing about whether someone is or is not fluent. My measure of this is: do you ever have to *think* about what you want to say (thinking about grammatical rules as you speak), or do suitable words come out automatically even if the accent may be heavy? If someone can speak without having to think about the process and what is said sounds basically okay, then the person is fluent. If not, then I'd say the person is not fluent. But other people may use the term "fluent" differently.	1643344445.0	huji3gz	t3_seh93w	t3_seh93w	/r/russian/comments/seh93w/do_i_know_russian/huji3gz/

5f3eyh3r	Russian Ark is incredible and very easy to follow with or without subtitles. It's a fun story through Russian history, and it was shot in a literal single-take through the Hermitage. I think it took them three attempts and they got it on the final day they were allowed to film.  So I highly recommend it, it's just great and also technically impressive.  Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears won an Oscar for Best Foreign Picture, and it's a pretty good Soviet-era film.   Morozka is a hilarious Soviet film based on old folklore. It's super campy but just watch and enjoy how utterly bizarre it is. I loved it and I'm usually a stuck up film snob lol  Another one by Tarkovsy is Andrei Rublev, it's very slow like Stalker but not as avant garde. It goes through mideaval Russia and has some amazing scenes (battles at Vladimir, naked pagans in the night, etc.) It's slow, but up there with Stalker as a masterpiece.  Some of these movies may be on youtube for free (especially Mosfilm ones, but the Criterion ones for Tarkovsy look amazing.)

cj2bk	In order to understand it better, think of "—Å—Å–∞–¥–∏—Ç—å" as an opposite of "–ø–æ—Å–∞–¥–∏—Ç—å". "–°—Å–∞–∂–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å" is imprefective form.  It describes an action of removing someone from something suitable for sitting. The most common usage is transport (–ø–æ—Å–∞–¥–∏—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—É—Å, —Å—Å–∞–¥–∏—Ç—å —Å –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—É—Å–∞), however you can apply it to other things like step ladders or tables (–ø–æ—Å–∞–¥–∏–ª –∫–æ—à–∫—É –Ω–∞ —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫, —Å—Å–∞–¥–∏–ª –∫–æ—à–∫—É —Å —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–∞).

9pbfx36r	I think it depends on the community you're talking about. For example, I'm reading a forum about transport stuff (metro, trams etc.), and people generally use "–≤—ã" there. But I'm sure that "—Ç—ã" is used if it's a forum about Dota2.  If I'm using "–≤—ã" online, and someone switched to "—Ç—ã" unexpectedly, I either switch to "—Ç—ã" because I feel it's appropriate, or continue using "–≤—ã" because I feel they want to be rude intentionally by switching to "—Ç—ã".	1643364845.0	hukd4er	t3_sen8zk	t3_sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/hukd4er/

8i22tna1	It depends on specific person and topic. There are more '–≤—ã' usage in complex or abstract topics.   Initially i use '–≤—ã' and switch to '—Ç—ã' if another person did it (talking with eldery ppl is an exeption ofc). Because for me it's uncomfortable when someone sticks with '–≤—ã' without context reason or age gap. Looks like he's trying to keep maximum distance from you (mb his attitude about you is bad). To avoid that i don't initiate '—Ç—ã' addressing.	1643367146.0	hukg50y	t3_sen8zk	t3_sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/hukg50y/

cywnw	This is what I do. There are some people who have switched to *—Ç—ã* with me sooner than I anticipated, but as long as our interactions up to that point have been pleasant and friendly, I‚Äôll go ahead and match them. Nobody has ever told me off or been taken aback for switching with them like this. I‚Äôm not sure if my own assessment in these situations (‚Äúhuh, I didn‚Äôt think this person would call me *—Ç—ã* that quickly‚Äù) is just a personal characteristic, the product of speaking another T-V language where switching is governed by different rules, or something else entirely.  ‚Ä¶The unfortunate thing is that I can‚Äôt then send people a sociolinguistic survey inviting them to share information about why they chose to switch forms at a particular moment. üòÖ I‚Äôm often curious to know what factors someone has considered before switching, and how a particular *–≤—ã > —Ç—ã* switch compares to a person‚Äôs average switch.	1643367773.0	hukgza4	t3_sen8zk	t1_hukciij	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/hukgza4/

30gn30hl	Your teacher most likely just wanted you to be on the safe side because it's not *always* about mutuality. For instance, my neighbour is a 90+ yo woman and she addresses me and my parents with —Ç—ã and in this case it's an appropriate form of endearment since she is not only much older but also has known us for a long time - in some sense, we're still kids for her. But this doesn't change anything for us and we all address her with name+patronymic and –≤—ã, maybe that is the trap your teacher wanted you to avoid.  If I were you I would probably just wait and mimic what others are using, thus trying to develop that "inherent sense". But one thing I am certain about - if someone addressed you with "—Ç—ã" already then it's totally a green light for you to use "—Ç—ã" as well. Yes, maybe this is a 90 yo woman which you would always address with "–≤—ã" in real life but it's the Internet, not real life, it's more relaxed here and we don't know each others' age anyway.	1643368605.0	huki4r9	t3_sen8zk	t3_sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/huki4r9/

b3yzu0jk	For me it is pretty simple. I tend to use "—Ç—ã", and not only in the internet but in general unless I want to put some borders. If you start communicating with anyone using "–≤—ã" it would be quite difficult to switch back, so it is quite useless for making friends. A person always using "–≤—ã" seems like the one who doesn't want any friends (and probably doesn't have any, being such a dick, lol). Although when you talk to any support, employees at stores, waiters, etc, it is more common to use "–≤—ã" since you clearly have borders in your relationships.	1643369589.0	hukjjwi	t3_sen8zk	t3_sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/hukjjwi/

b1y15iy	>If I continue to use –≤—ã, I might appear cold and formal.   I don't think "–≤—ã" makes conversation cold and formal. Example:  * I address my wife's mother using "–≤—ã" and use her full name with patronymic.  * My wife does the same when addressing my mother.  * Our mothers call both of us using "—Ç—ã" and our first names.  * Our kids address both of their grandmas with "—Ç—ã" and don't use patronymics ("–ë–∞–±—É—à–∫–∞ \[first\_name\] –ø—Ä–∏—à–ª–∞, —É—Ä–∞!").   All of these is just a tradition in our family (possibly regional). It does not say anything on the status of our relations.   In the online communication I personally prefer to use "–≤—ã" when talking to strangers by default, but adapt to the unspoken rules of each community.  What I would do if I were you:  * Are you in the Minecraft public chat full of kids? Use —Ç—ã.  * Are you in the Slack chat room with your prospective customers from Gazprom? Use –≤—ã.  * Grey area? Don't be afraid to err on a side of "–≤—ã". Feel free to switch to "—Ç—ã" if they started to use "—Ç—ã", most of the time this will be fine.	1643376782.0	hukvzvm	t3_sen8zk	t3_sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/hukvzvm/

p8ja5	Depends what your learning style is. If it is visual - read. If it is verbal/auditory - spell aloud for yourself. If it is motoric - write. I'm visual/synesthetic, for me any word is a kind of an abstract animated gif. My teacher was motoric - I saw her many times just closing her eyes and moving her hand to remind herself of the spelling of a particularly difficult or rarely used word.	1643380798.0	hul4zo5	t3_segx4k	t3_segx4k	/r/russian/comments/segx4k/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_spelling_in_russian/hul4zo5/

yi1ii	There are plenty of rules and helper methods on how to spell properly. Kids learn many of them in school. There are not too many words you actually have to memorize (–Ω–µ–ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä—è–µ–º—ã–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞, like —Å**–æ**–±–∞–∫–∞, **–∑**–¥–µ—Å—å, or exceptions from common rules like –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤**—è–Ω–Ω**—ã–π). But many of the rules require you to have good vocabulary skills and remember all these special cases.  For example:  –ª**–µ**—Å–Ω–∏–∫, –ª**–∏**—Å–∏—Ü–∞ -> –ª**–µ**—Å, –ª**–∏**—Å–∏–π  —Å–æ**–ª**–Ω—Ü–µ -> —Å–æ**–ª**–Ω–µ—á–Ω—ã–π  –∫–ª—é—á**–∏**–∫, –∑–∞–º–æ—á**–µ**–∫ -> –∫–ª—é—á**–∏**–∫–∞, –∑–∞–º–æ**—á–∫**–∞	1643381207.0	hul5yvk	t3_segx4k	t3_segx4k	/r/russian/comments/segx4k/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_spelling_in_russian/hul5yvk/

6n370rr2	I can tell you what I am using, not everyone is the same but maybe you'll like some of my resources. Also it is often said to not use too many resources at the same time but I'm part of those that need a lot of various stuff to be entertained and it's also maybe because I study 3 to 5 hours every day (I can listen to audio files while working).  So I started to buy 2 "method" books: Assimil and harrap's (I think harrap's is only french but I'm not sure and honestly, one is enough.  I use youtube channels a lot: I recommend russian from afar which is good for beginners, I didn't watch him much because it was too low level for me when I discoreved his channel x) but it is quite popular and good.   Russian with max is what I use the most and binge watch / listen at work, when I started watching I was still a beginner but I learned a lot thanks to him.   For grammar and cases: Amazin russian, I start watching now as I told you I studied for nearly a year without worrying about grammar but the videos are quite simple so you can check them out!   There are other things I watch on youtube but it's not channels to learn, it's because I also want to listen to "real russian" but beleive me even after a year, it is quite brutal as I can barely catch a few words so maybe don't bother doing that too early, unless you like to suffer like me haha   Listening to russian songs where you can hear the words clearly also helped me stay motivated and since it's a song, the words stick to your brain and when you go check their meaning, you cannot forget x)  Nest resource you can easily use on phone when you have some time: Duolinguo. I personnaly didnt use it much because it's a bit too "shcolar" but it is quite popular among leanguage learners and I think it's really good (and I should use it more haha)  Last thing but not least: if you like reading, and preferably after at least 6 months of studying you can try to find books with translation in your native language.      I think it is most of what I am using and I hope you will find something that suits you!   You can start with one or 2 resources according to the time you have, be consistent, accept there will be days it will feel like you are trying to climb a mountain too high but you will always progress no matter what!	1643381797.0	hul7ffl	t3_sdw3qz	t1_hugs5j9	/r/russian/comments/sdw3qz/how_should_i_proceed/hul7ffl/

4hxaal3t	Thanks for the advice man. I really appreciate it.   Currently Im watching videos on very basic grammar rules. Like aspects, conjugation and personal pronouns. And Im not gonna go to cases unless I feel confident. I know you said not to touch grammar but Im sorry, I cant help it :v   I gotta know what's going on or I feel uncomfortable. I cannot read smt and not know what it was and why it was(to some extent :v). So I think Ill just lightly touch grammar to get the basic and then watch the beginner playlist from BeFluent Russian and other slow Russian videos. Ill also try adding to my vocab.   But is Duolingo actually good? I feel like it doesnt explain anything and just expects you to know some things already. That's why I never really liked that app.  Anyway, wish me luck.

It‚Äôs important of course, but straight memorization is RIDICULOUSLY hard and I‚Äôve heard a lot of people recommend against it.

434wy2qh	>It's easier for me remember the rules of the 3 tenses / 6 cases than to remember EVERY ending to –∫–æ—à–∫–∞, for example. .  Yes, exactly! If you don't understand the cases, you will have to learn each noun and adjective to the power of six. This is probably a number too high to be handled by one of the scientific calculators of my youth. Do learn the cases, and here's why:  Native Russian speakers have the luxury of having grown up in a Russian-speaking environment. They don't need to learn the grammatical terms because they had parents/family who taught them how to speak. All day, every day, for over a decade. Much like we don't need to know the rules of English in order to speak it. This is true for all languages.  So it *would* be pointless for a native speaker to learn the grammatical terms of their own language, unless they wanted to teach it. But as a foreigner, you do need to learn them. I often make the analogy that in Russian, nouns and adjectives are your boards and nails, and the case system is your toolbox full of hammers and saws. Trying to speak Russian as a foreign language without learning any grammar is akin to trying to drive in a nail with your forehead.  Native speakers have a built-in toolbox, it's their birthright. Ours is an English toolbox, which doesn't help us much with Russian. So how do you build your Russian toolbox? If you can swing it financially, I would recommend hiring a tutor who can help you with cases (many of them work on Skype or similar), even if it's only an hour a week. It's because being a native speaker of a language is not a qualification to teach that language.  Once you have a good foundation in Russian grammar, *then* you can try some conversations with natives who are not teachers. If you make a mistake, they probably won't be able to tell you *why* it's wrong or *how* you messed up. But you'll be able to quickly realize what you did wrong and fix it.  P.S. - The way you were setting up your example sentence was correct, you already have a basic understanding of three cases, and that's great! :)	1643396426.0	humamxs	t3_sex4js	t3_sex4js	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/humamxs/

6mbaeome	Of course Russians know the cases, they just don‚Äôt know their names and don‚Äôt even think about situations when we use them. Because of course it‚Äôs more natural for us. But still, even we should learn them in school so I don‚Äôt really understand people who advice not to learn them.   Don‚Äôt listen to them and keep going with your plan! What you did trying to build a phrase, it‚Äôs a perfect strategy to learn them. Especially if you say it‚Äôs not difficult for you to learn the endings.  What I can advice you is to do it step by step. For example, one lesson you learn just one meaning of one case and practice just one gender.  Like today for example you want to learn –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π. You take one meaning: direct object. And one gender: feminine. And you to make as many sentences as possible to remember it.  –ø–∏—Ç—å –≤–æ–¥—É  —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É  –ª—é–±–∏—Ç—å —Å–µ–º—å—é  You should practice it till you do it automatically. I hope this advice will be useful for you üòâ	1643396683.0	humbbre	t3_sex4js	t3_sex4js	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/humbbre/
jya24	> For example, car is the direct object so the case could be '–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π' but it also belongs to his mother, so it could be —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π too?  The genitive goes where the *-'s* goes in English (possessor, not possession). So the way you'd want it, ‚Äúcar‚Äù would be in accusative, and ‚Äúmother‚Äù in genitive. However:  1. The verb *–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å* which we normally use to translate English ‚Äúdrive‚Äù, ‚Äúride‚Äù and ‚Äútake‚Äù (as in ‚Äútake a bus / train / boat‚Äù, etc.) is intransitive, and the vehicle is marked with *–Ω–∞* + prepositional. 2. For *–º–∞–º–∞* and some other words ending in *-–∞* or *-—è* (mostly, short-form personal names like *–ê–Ω—è*, *–ü–µ—Ç—è*, etc., and informal terms for one's closest relatives: *–ø–∞–ø–∞*, *–¥—è–¥—è*, *—Ç—ë—Ç—è*, *–±–∞–±—É—à–∫–∞*, *–¥–µ–¥—É—à–∫–∞*), the possession is rather indicated by transforming the noun into a possessive adjective using the suffix *-–∏–Ω-*. This adjective agrees with the noun in case, so here it should also be prepositional: *–¢–æ–º –µ–¥–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –º–∞–º–∏–Ω–æ–π –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–µ*.  > Similar to girlfriends house... should house be in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π or –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π?  How does accusative come into the picture?  The idiomatic way of saying this is using the adverb *–¥–æ–º–æ–π* (which is like *home* in Engl. *go home*) and using *–∫* + dative to specify whose home it is.  So, the whole is *–¢–æ–º –µ–¥–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –º–∞–º–∏–Ω–æ–π –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–µ –¥–æ–º–æ–π –∫ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–∂–∫–µ*.	1643396749.0	humbi42	t3_sexjjs	t3_sexjjs	/r/russian/comments/sexjjs/russian_cases_priority/humbi42/

Just don‚Äôt forget to practice it time to time (listening to music or watching something in Russian will be already enough to maintain the same level you have now).   This confusion of languages can happen if: 1) you start to learn two new languages at the same time  2) if they are very similar. It happened to me when I started learning Spanish (knowing French at an upper intermediate level). So I almost completely replaced French with Spanish in my head. But again, it happened only because I completely stopped practicing French for 3 years. It was my biggest mistake hahaha.

xcxic	A lot of natives don't know what cases are because they never had to learn them. It comes naturally to them. I definitely agree you need to learn them, though. My biggest tip would be to not focus too much on them - it gets discouraging and overwhelming very quickly.   I used to do exactly what you're doing and got fed up because things weren't clicking and I just couldn't figure it out. Now I'm studying at a more relaxed pace and taking on the cases slowly so that I can get to know them at a higher level before I move on. So far, I only know nominative, prepositional, and accusative, and get by fine in conversation. I just get corrected a lot, but that's okay with me because I learn from it.   Most Russians WILL understand you if you talk to them in "caveman" Russian or if your cases aren't perfect. You'll make a ton of mistakes, but you will also learn a lot from those mistakes.	1643398588.0	humgei6	t3_sex4js	t3_sex4js	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/humgei6/

1numjifl	The autotranslate has broken, trying to deal with a hardcore grammarly improper nsfw teenager slang, maybe hardened with voice recognition errors. So you have to use a double reverse Promt translate skill from '90-'00s when games were auto-translated to Russian, and you had to translate it from Runglish back to English and then to proper Russian to comprehend what game is saying to you (like famous "–û—Ö–ª–∞–¥–∏—Ç–µ —Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω—å–µ" > "Chill the fuck out" > "–û—Å—Ç—ã–Ω—å, –±–ª—è")  In this case, I can only suggest the following for decryption: * translation that almost fully reverses in Google Translate, but it seems not the case: I've fucked. cousins had left to hamsters balsak. I was shared in his cage By poll are. Can't fuck.  * "–±–∞–ª—å–∑–∞–∫" is almost certainly "ballsack" as pointed before in thread; * "—Ö–æ–º—è–∫" might also have some sexual connotation, check Urban dictionary; * "–ü–æ –æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∞–º –µ—Å—Ç—å" I suggest is twisted "Bipolar" ("By poll are"). Maybe by cage, it is meant rib cage?  Another ill-minded view: guy had fucked, cousins had left milfs (women of Balsak age) to homepages (home'—è–∫–∏).	1643401070.0	hummxeq	t3_sepudh	t3_sepudh	/r/russian/comments/sepudh/any_russian_speakers_here_what_the_hell_is_this/hummxeq/

40wd1	People often misunderstand the purpose of cursive writing. It was invented to write **faster**, however strange it might sound to an untrained person. Russian cursive is basically a series of loops with variations, because that's the fastest way, and that's why when you are (properly) taught to write so much attention is paid to the direction in which each element is written.  The writing in your example looks beautiful, but it's not terribly efficient. And it's not a cursive at all. That's the writing used in the old days to write the diplomas, because it had to be perfectly legible, and nobody had access to a typewriter, so this was the next best thing.	1643408556.0	hun66ee	t3_sexeec	t3_sexeec	/r/russian/comments/sexeec/what_do_you_think_about_this_kind_of_handwriting/hun66ee/

dtqny3rg	Just to avoid confusion, you are saying competent Russian *learners* know all the cases.  When I first read your reply I had to reread it because I thought you were saying all competent Russian speakers know the cases, which of course is false since native speakers generally don't know anything about cases after leaving school, as it's not important for them to be able to communicate in their daily lives.	1643409687.0	hun8yg0	t3_sex4js	t1_hump3ty	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/hun8yg0/

dtqny3rg	>  the thought of speaking without knowing the rules means I'll make hundreds of mistakes  You speak English without knowing the rules.  Nobody has to be taught the grammar of their native language in order to use it, but for adults learning a language (outside of immersion contexts) the situation is different.   Generally do not take any advice from native speakers about how to learn their language if they have no training in helping people learn it as a foreign language. Native speakers are taught their language in school in a way that does not work for foreigners, because native speakers can rely in part of something just sounding right.  For example, people learning Russian as a foreign language (and especially who do not know another Slavic language) have to memorize which case goes with which preposition: –¥–æ takes genitive, –Ω–∞–¥ takes instrumental, –∫ takes dative, –≤ takes prepositional (until later you learn that in some situations –≤ could instead take accusative), etc.  Native speakers don't memorize cases for prepositions that way: if a child misspeaks in school, a teacher will correct the child by saying it's "–¥–æ –∫–æ–≥–æ/—á–µ–≥–æ" or "–Ω–∞–¥ –∫–µ–º/—á–µ–º" and the student is expected to realize how the declined form or –∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ transfers to every noun.  Native speakers who have no experience teaching Russian have no idea that non-native speakers memorize the case for each preposition and could think "well, just say what sounds right." If it were that easy!	1643410419.0	hunargj	t3_sex4js	t1_hum9pno	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/hunargj/

7pascwg1	In English there's no distinction in the form of adjective, whether it is used as a descriptor or a predicate:  (1) I saw a hungry woman. - descriptor  (2) The woman I saw was hungry. - predicative  "Hungry" is the same even though it fulfills two different roles.  Russian usually uses full adjectives (ending in *-–π/-–µ/-—è*) as descriptors and short adjectives (ending in *-/-–∞/-–æ*) as predicates:  (3) –Ø –≤–∏–¥–µ–ª –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω—É—é –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—É - descriptor  (4) –ñ–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é —è –≤–∏–¥–µ–ª, –±—ã–ª –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–∞. - predicative  Short adjectives decline for gender and number in agreement with the subject of the sentence, that's why their endings will change depending on the gender of the person behind a particular pronoun:  (5) –¢—ã –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–∞? - addressing a female  (6) –¢—ã –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–Ω? - addressing a male  (7) –¢—ã –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ? - addressing... smth neuter, I guess?  (8) –í—ã –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω—ã? - addressing multiple people  You use copula verb *–±—ã—Ç—å* to conjugate them for tense. Past tense of *–±—ã—Ç—å* agrees with the gender of the subject:  (9) –û–Ω –±—ã–ª –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–Ω. - He was hungry.  (10) –û–Ω–∞ (–µ—Å—Ç—å) –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–∞. - She is hungry (*–µ—Å—Ç—å* is usually dropped).  (11) –ú—ã –±—É–¥–µ–º –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω—ã. - We will be hungry  Since short adjectives only fulfill one role in the sentence they are always in Nominative and don't decline for case as full adjectives do.  Also, sometimes full adjectives can also be used as predicates:  (12) –¢—ã –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è?	1643792987.0	hv96ux9	t3_sibh07	t3_sibh07	/r/russian/comments/sibh07/—è_–æ—á–µ–Ω—å_–≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–∞_confused_about_this_sentence/hv96ux9/

9pbfx36r	Prepositional. It's not used this way in modern language. Here's a [review](https://iling.spb.ru/nord/materia/rusconstr2009/muravenko.pdf) of such cases, the most recent case with the verb "—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—è—Ç—å" mentioned by the author dates back to 1946. When I studied at school \~ 20 years ago, this construction with "—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—è—Ç—å" was not even mentioned in the textbook. However, "—Å–∫—É—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ+pronoun in prepositional" was still mentioned as an exception (example: "—Å–∫—É—á–∞—é –ø–æ –≤–∞—Å"). But it sounds archaic now, and newer dictionaries list "—Å–∫—É—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ"+prepositional [as an obsolete form](http://new.gramota.ru/spravka/buro/search-answer?s=298024). Instead, the dative case is used nowadays.	1643796178.0	hv9av48	t3_sikrrd	t3_sikrrd	/r/russian/comments/sikrrd/whats_the_name_of_the_case/hv9av48/
lop34	It's sometimes used in regular speech: for example, "(–Ω–∞–º) –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–π—Ç–∏" = "we can't pass here" (note that even the pronoun can be dropped - which shows that this is just an extension of Passive, not a separate construction). Or "–∑–¥–µ—Å—å –Ω–µ–≥–¥–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è" (there's nowhere to park here) - come to think of it, traffic situations seem to love Passive.  However I believe it's far more widespread in poetry. I guess the reason is that this construction sounds more final and fatalistic than a simple assumption "–º—ã –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–π–¥—ë–º": like there's an irresistible outside force that prevents the action.

s4t6q	The best way that I learned is by thinking if the adjective describing the subject is a descriptive adjective or if its a definite adjective.   If its descriptive, then its like a permanent adjective about the subject - like saying –≠—Ç–æ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –¥–æ–º, describing the physical nature or non-changeable traits.   When it's a definitive adjective, its describing the subject over a temporary description. –Ø –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–Ω/–Ω–∞ is correct because hunger is a temporary feeling or emotion.

a0qlz566	What kind of content do you listen to? And how much is "plenty"? Do you listen daily? It would really help to know what kind of routine you have to know what could be the reason for your lack of progress. Are you sure you're not making any progress at all? Because if you listen daily for, let's say, an hour, I can't really imagine a scenario in which you wouldn't make progress.  How familiar are you with the grammar and the sound system? Those could also be responsible for your issues.  It does take a lot of time to get good at listening comprehension, so the best advice would be to up your hours. If you can't manage to do more active listening, you could try adding more semi-active listening, i.e. while doing chores, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, etc.. I bet there's at least an hour every day where you could fit in some semi-active listening. If you do that daily for months, there's no way you won't improve.  If you're really dedicated, you could think about [carrying a cheap mp3 player and earbuds around with you at all times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UqaJ8gmTGg). Keep it running and whenever you have minute, put the earbuds in. So you see, if you really want to make the most of the months you have left, there are relatively simple, relatively low-effort ways to drastically improve.  It's good news that you have a few months left. You can improve a lot in that time!  Good luck mate :)	1643804310.0	hv9mddg	t3_sifzyo	t3_sifzyo	/r/russian/comments/sifzyo/i_dont_know_what_to_do/hv9mddg/
jya24	The same reason that in English you would say *Hello my friends!* rather than *Hello to my friends!* The *hello* or *–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç* in this construction is not a noun but rather an interjection. The *my friends / –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è* used with it is not an object complement but an address, and it can (or should) be in the vocative case in languages that have a vocative. In fact, colloquial Russian has vocative (only for informal names and kinship terms ending in *-–∞ / -—è*, formed by dropping the final vowel), and it can be used for addresses: *–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, –¢–∞–Ω—å* = ‚ÄúHello Tanya‚Äù; *–ü–∞–ø, –ø–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏ —Ç—É–¥–∞!* = ‚ÄúDad, look there!‚Äù  Also note: in standard Russian, address words should be put in commas: *–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è*. In colloquial writing, it has recently become a trend to omit the commas (emulating English usage), but strictly speaking, it's an error.	1643804483.0	hv9mnum	t3_simp49	t3_simp49	/r/russian/comments/simp49/why_is_this_–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç_–¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è_and_not_–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç_–¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º/hv9mnum/

cywnw	>lit. but fractured family (instr) not break me (acc)  Don't forget that adjectives have a lot of identical feminine declensions. It's harder to tell that this one isn't instrumental because an English word has been inserted into the sentence, but this construction is always dative + infinitive. An object isn't required (cf. *–ù–∞–º –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–π—Ç–∏* from /u/Sithoid).  The construction tends to present situations as simple facts of life, rather than as effects with associated causes.

340jf	I'll simplify:  - –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ç–∞—Ä–µ–ª–∫–∞ => there is a plate on the table - —É —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ç–∞—Ä–µ–ª–∫–∞ => the table has a plate  The first Russian sentence denotes existence whereas the second one denotes possession. The verb –µ—Å—Ç—å only denotes possession when the object (—Å—Ç–æ–ª in this case) is in the genitive and with the —É preposition. Otherwise, it signifies mere existence or presence.  The second Russian sentence is extremely weird and unusual. Normally tables do not possess tableware. The corresponding English sentence is more normal, and can serve as a translation of both Russian sentences, although a less literal one.   I guess the point of this exercise is to teach you the difference between the two usages of –µ—Å—Ç—å. One is *normally* translated as "there is, exists" and the other one "has, possesses".	1643812265.0	hva2i9v	t3_sifyzj	t3_sifyzj	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hva2i9v/

83ucatzz	"This table already has a plate" means that you're expecting one plate to exist for one table. You personally might use it more loosely than that but that's what it means. The original Russian doesn't imply that at all. It doesn't preclude it, but it doesn't imply it and so your translation would be misleading.	1643816535.0	hvad7of	t3_sifyzj	t3_sifyzj	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hvad7of/

83ucatzz	This phrasing can refer to inanimate objects as "having" things it's really just paired with.   As in if you're putting bows on teddy bears and someone tries to put another bow on you can say "This bear already has a bow" as a way of saying there's already a bow on it.  The thing is though that it's a 1:1 relationship. The original Russian in this case doesn't imply you're only putting a single plate on each table so using this construction adds information that's not in the original sentence.	1643816815.0	hvadydx	t3_sifyzj	t1_hv91h9y	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hvadydx/

d8ox1pq8	This is why it's better to just learn through immersion and not overthink anything. Languages are not logical to each other and often not to themselves and questioning why something is done, is a waste of your time. What is the subject, indirect object, etc is simply not the same across languages. Sometimes what is the subject in English is the indirect object in Russian.  Languages aren't science or math, they're more like music.	1643823858.0	hvax8k1	t3_simp49	t3_simp49	/r/russian/comments/simp49/why_is_this_–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç_–¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è_and_not_–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç_–¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º/hvax8k1/

ghqlydv	1. "Thanks"  2. [I wish you] "nice/pleasant dreams" [while sleeping] -- a standard polite phrase like "sweet dreams". Also in Russian "—Å–Ω—ã" and "–º–µ—á—Ç—ã" are different things. "–°–Ω—ã" are images you see while sleeping. "–ú–µ—á—Ç—ã" are things you wish to become reality. Here it's about sleeping. Nothing suggestive yet.   3. ("and not only dreams") --- I think together with the previous sentence it sounds kinda dumb. It suggests you can do something pleasant while sleeping besides seeing dreams.

b0oa8	It's informal shorthand for having "something in/on it." Other example: does the bed have sheets (on it)? Does the car have gas (in it's fuel tank)? Does the shirt have buttons (on it)?   It might stand out because it asks about a singular plate - usually in that context you'd be asking if the table has plates, like if you were about to serve dinner.	1643836598.0	hvbvirv	t3_sifyzj	t1_hv91h9y	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hvbvirv/

jya24	The letter *-—ë-* is often written as *-–µ-* (not only in this word).

n755g	This used to trip me up too. A sentence like "Russia has 20 million rabbits", although perfectly fine in English, doesn't work with the Russian construction for "having" things.

Basically, "have" has a wider (or at least, different) range of use in English.	1643836986.0	hvbwmgb	t3_sifyzj	t3_sifyzj	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hvbwmgb/

f43tzvk	Looks good, although I‚Äôd be wary in the sense that I‚Äôve paused to read, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre learning the grammar behind the phrases.   Like you can‚Äôt use ‚Äú–Ω–µ—Å—Ç–∏‚Äù for carry as a plug and play sort of thing. It will change depending on who is saying what or to whom.   If i were you I‚Äôd write down the infinitives for each verb you come across so you know where it comes from, or better yet mark the verbs used in their cases.   I‚Äôve studied a few languages, and my unsolicited two cents is that you‚Äôre way better off ‚Äúslower‚Äù, making sure you‚Äôre building your knowledge off the right way. Otherwise you‚Äôll have bad habits of saying words instinctively in the wrong grammar tense or form because you spent a year or two learning a word without the why kind of thing.   There‚Äôs a book called ‚ÄúRussian in exercises‚Äù that‚Äôs pretty good and would be a good supplement (or necessary imo) for podcasts. Or rather the podcast should supplement something like a textbook.    TL;DR It‚Äôs easy to trick yourself with learning, and learning the right way is so much easier in the long run. Slower in the beginning,  it when you really understand how the language works and not just words or phrases, you‚Äôll learn much more exponentially faster.	1643838584.0	hvc12k0	t3_siy5mk	t3_siy5mk	/r/russian/comments/siy5mk/anyone_else_use_russianpod_101_to_learn_ive_been/hvc12k0/

jya24	Thanks to /u/allenrabinovich; I have little to add to his reply, except that such impersonal greetings are common with plural dative nouns as well (indicating classes of people to whom the greeting applies).

3mmwfahk	Russian adjectives are gendered: would you want these to be feminine or masculine? "Angelic" is "–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π" (masculine) or "–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è" (feminine), and "heavenly" is "–Ω–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω—ã–π" (masculine) or "–Ω–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è" (feminine).  A further important caveat is that if you want to describe a human as angelic, you wouldn't typically use this adjective, but rather "–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª–æ–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–π"/"–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª–æ–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω–∞—è" ("angel-like"). "–ê–Ω–≥–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π" is more akin go "of an angel", like "–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–µ –ª–∏—Ü–æ" -- "angelic face".  And "–Ω–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω—ã–π" is used in a wider sense than "heavenly", also encompassing all that relates to the sky (so, "–Ω–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω—ã–π —Ü–≤–µ—Ç" - "sky color").  As my standard caveat, I strongly recommend against getting a tattoo in a language you don't speak fluently. It's merely cautionary advice, and I am not judging you in any way: it's just very difficult to grasp the full cultural context and there are almost always unintentional and often unwanted connotations involved.	1643858394.0	hvddpj8	t3_sj7dri	t3_sj7dri	/r/russian/comments/sj7dri/translation_for_a_tattoo/hvddpj8/

Krovostok will tell you the criminal based stories on behalf of a lyrical hero in their songs  And of course as a representative of siberian punk genre I would advise you to listen to Egor Letov songs, they are absolutely magnificent.	1643864089.0	hvdpvu5	t3_siwlg5	t3_siwlg5	/r/russian/comments/siwlg5/need_some_sick_russian_music/hvdpvu5/

634opeto	It is adjectival nominal. If you are asking if someone is happy as in accepting of the situation, rather than in general with his life, you want accusative.   Asking if someone is happy in the context you used it in English is actually pretty rude. Translation puts things into perspective. American culture allows (and possibly all English-language cultures allow) people to get away with a fair amount of rudeness covered up as jokes, and it is widely socially accepted.	1643864648.0	hvdqz29	t3_sifyzj	t1_hvdge9n	/r/russian/comments/sifyzj/is_this_wrong/hvdqz29/
opdzd	A couple very good options are not too far from Chicago:  The [summer Russian program](https://languageworkshop.indiana.edu/languages/immersion/russian/index.html) at Indiana University (Bloomington) is very well established. Here's the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKUQlMhOC0E&t=20s) for the program.  The [Center for Language Studies](https://www.beloit.edu/summer-programs/center-for-language-studies/summer-language-program/) at Beloit College (in Wisconsin) has intensive Russian, June 18 ‚Äì August 5.

sf8e2	For vocabulary (which might be most of what you want in a language) I can recommend: * setting you phone/laptop's language to Russian (yes, hardcore stuff, but you will learn that vocabulary like crazy) * playing games (definitely not all games will work for you, and the ones that do work might have the side effect of getting you addicted, so try this with caution) * twitter/google translate combo (on the phone). Works great for me!

31cqu5j1	They do take a bit of time to learn. In my beginner Russian class it seemed like we spent a good deal of the first semester just learning case rules. But once you've learned them, they do start to seem more natural over time, and especially if you read and speak a lot  you'll develop a better sense of the grammar. I feel like it gets to a point where you no longer have to remember specific rules every time you speak and you can just choose the correct case most of the time based on intuition.	1644057633.0	hvonk7f	t3_sl0ptr	t3_sl0ptr	/r/russian/comments/sl0ptr/how_to_not_be_overwhelmed_by_the_all_the_cases/hvonk7f/

Otherwise they couldn't use it officially.

jdswj1f	The shapes of the letters are distorted by fluent writing - but these distortions are predictable and the letters remain legible, if they are written in a standard way: starting from a certain point, moving the pen in the right direction, using correct connections. The handwritten letters are traces of movements.  When you know what movement is needed to write –∂, then it is easy to recognize it, even when its shape is somewhat distorted. That's why I'd recommend to those who want to read russian cursive to use –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏ to learn the standard hand movements. Training yourself to write letters with seemingly correct shapes by moving your hand in non-standart ways will not give the ability to read others' fluent cursive.	1644061912.0	hvosxgu	t3_sl3l4b	t3_sl3l4b	/r/russian/comments/sl3l4b/whats_the_first_word_on_this_sign_looks_like_just/hvosxgu/

There are, in fact, multiple songs out there where a female singer does just that (‚Äú–†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π‚Äù by Loboda, ‚Äú–ú–æ–π —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫‚Äù by Larisa Gordiera, for instance).  More generally, the direct use of the word is primarily reserved for family members or intimate relationships. You might say ‚Äú–∫–∞–∫ —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π‚Äù (‚Äúlike my kin‚Äù) about a close friend, but you wouldn‚Äôt describe them as such directly.  Why can‚Äôt she have him saved under his name? This is the most normal thing to do. A short or diminutive form of the name would suggest a friendship (e.g. ‚Äú–°–∞–Ω—è‚Äù or ‚Äú–°–∞—à–∞‚Äù instead of ‚Äú–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä‚Äù).	1644069447.0	hvp4ukg	t3_sl70yl	t3_sl70yl	/r/russian/comments/sl70yl/meaning_of_p–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π/hvp4ukg/

j3x4c1x4	Sorry if I'm being not very clear. What I'm trying to say is that it can mean both. It can mean friendship, but very deep life-long friendship, that replaces family to you. And it can mean partner, but in a very committed relationship, with deep bonds, like probably marriage. I assume what you are asking is if it's sexual. No, it's not. In both meanings it has this platonic undertone, it's definitely not about attraction, more like another level of relationship, deep bonding over years of overcoming something together.  But let's imagine I find a contact named —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π/–∞—è in my boyfriends phone and he is saying that they are only friend than I'm going to suspect something.

w8s1n	Honestly, if you‚Äôre very much a beginner, forget about grammar (mostly). Focus on vocabulary! Most Russian educators say that if you spend all your time learning grammar and no vocabulary you won‚Äôt be able to communicate as well as if you did it the other way around. Granted, a lot of mistakes will be made with cases, gender, conjugation etc but people will still understand what you say.   I‚Äôve been focusing on vocabulary, speaking/listening, and maybe 20% grammar, and while my grammar sucks and I sound like a child speaking Russian, I can still communicate. I met some native Russian speakers last week at a bar and they were delighted to see someone speak their language.. Russian natives know it‚Äôs a hard language, especially for English speakers and will understand if you make mistakes with grammar, but will still understand what you‚Äôre trying to communicate... But if you don‚Äôt have the vocabulary, they will have no idea what you‚Äôre saying.	1644074189.0	hvpev3n	t3_skuq4k	t3_skuq4k	/r/russian/comments/skuq4k/best_approach_to_russian_grammer/hvpev3n/

When you write sentences, write the words that take x case in their respective colors so you can start to see patterns.

I think it's a lot easier to understand this way , there are some great people on YouTube that explain the grammar rules. If you start going down the grammar rabbit hole , grammar tables , charts etc. you'll waste a lot of unnecessary time.

c3tpewcl	There‚Äôs a few things to unpack here.  I found Russian much easier to learn initially than other languages as a Dyslexic as I find the words more distinguishable from one another compared to French or Spanish. The fact that it is 95% phonetic (almost 100% at a beginner level) will help.  Saying that, if you struggle with languages Russian may not be the best to learn depending on your native language: Check out the USA‚Äôs state department table on languages, they need to train staff in foreign languages for certain foreign roles and so have spent a lot of time examining how many hours it takes to learn a language. Even without Dyslexia it‚Äôs a very time consuming language to learn and despite enjoying it in hindsight it would have been more productive/useful to learn another language. Getting fluent is all about immersion and it‚Äôs hard to immerse yourself in Russian, and I live in Central Europe in a country with a high % of Russian speaker and with a Russian girlfriend.   Also, Dyslexia by its definition covers a number of different learning difficulties and is personal to the individual, advice or techniques for one person generally does not apply to all‚Ä¶ People try to sell books to desperate parents by claiming there is specific solutions they can apply to all Dyslexics. It‚Äôs marketing. If you have been diagnosed by an Educational Psychologist or Psychiatrist they will be able to tailor learning approaches specific to you and the same goes for languages. You can speak to specialists in language learning that may be able to give you better advice.	1644077517.0	hvpmpcn	t3_sl5xa5	t3_sl5xa5	/r/russian/comments/sl5xa5/dyslexic_and_learning_russian/hvpmpcn/

jdrce4em	On the one hand, yes, you can use this interpretation.   But you said she's a girl and "for me is important that is clear that he is just his very close friend, but not boyfriend or "crush" then it's not so appropriate. Why?   Because the guy recorded on the girl's phone as –†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π is closer to the object of love than to a friend.   It's just that when a girl uses –†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π to refer to a guy, it's a closer relationship, even closer than best friends. If I hear a girl call a guy –†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π, then I'm more likely to think that they love each other than just close friends.   In principle, the comments below have already said this.

qm0rhl0	it is really may be read as '–ø–µ–µ–º—Å–∫–∞—è', but there is no such a word, and a native's brain instantly drops out all non-existent variants and matches to the most natural '–∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è'. Even if the first word was written with mistakes or without half of the character like –∂–µ–Ω. , the second word would help us what the first word was, because –¥—É—à–µ–≤–∞—è can n be either –∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è or –º—É–∂—Å–∫–∞—è. Not many choices, huh?  Besides, that distorted and sloppy cursive –∂ is not rare. I think it  belongs a senior.   I have the same problem in hearing English. My brain provides me with a few possible words that much sound, and it takes some time to recognize the right word from the context.	1644083346.0	hvq1klx	t3_sl3l4b	t1_hvolmwt	/r/russian/comments/sl3l4b/whats_the_first_word_on_this_sign_looks_like_just/hvq1klx/

jdrce4em	About your origin. People will look at you out of curiosity, just like African children react to a white person they see for the first time in their lives.   Do not be surprised if you hear the N-word. This word is not given the same meaning as in Europe and America, it's just that we call black people that way.

wfsm7	This winter was (still is) rather snowy compared to recent years, and right now for instance we have a healthy snow cover in Moscow that isn't going anywhere cause it's -8 outside. As far as trying to describe it to somebody who'd never seen it before, I'm honestly at a loss. In any city it's mostly.. unremarkable? A nuisance to traffic and walking.     That said, depending on when you visit you are much more likely to run into brown wet slush than into any real snow cover in European Russia. That covers months from late November to early-mid March.	1644089315.0	hvqdjgs	t3_slcsqy	t1_hvq6iry	/r/russian/comments/slcsqy/australian_planning_on_visiting_russia/hvqdjgs/

Some people say –ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å instead of –∫–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å, and that considered to be ungrammatical.	1644149814.0	hvsxsr6	t3_slury7	t3_slury7	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/hvsxsr6/

7pascwg1	The very condition for preserving the unpredictable variation between perfective and imperfective forms is frequency of use, so any native is unlikely to ignore or be unaware of an aspectual counterpart.  However, it's a very common feature (mostly dialectal I assume) to use *–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å* instead of *–∫–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å* as an Imperfective counterpart to *–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å*. It's considered a mistake in the eyes of the literary norm, but many people use it nevertheless.	1644150217.0	hvsyd51	t3_slury7	t3_slury7	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/hvsyd51/

d0hgxc3d	I was actually thinking about that (the article thing), I'm a native French speaker and indeed the situation never arises where I don't know what to use.  However I assumed there would be a difference because in my brain the gender of a noun is completely part of the noun itself, so to speak, alongside with its pronunciation, spelling and meaning. It's a whole and it wouldn't make sense to break it apart and learn them independently. Every noun has a gender, without exception (ok, there always are exceptions, but they are mostly irrelevant for this conversation). Similarly I always know how to conjugate any verb in any tense in common use, no matter how irregular or obscure.  I assumed that the situation could be different for Russian verbs mainly because there's not always a clean pair for every verb. Some verbs are perfective or imperfective only, some can be both at the same time (–∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å), some verbs map to several counterparts, often with different meanings (–µ—Å—Ç—å -> –ø–æ–µ—Å—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ —Å—ä–µ—Å—Ç—å, —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å -> –ø–æ—Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ —Å—á–µ—Å—Ç—å etc...) and of course some pairs are highly unpredictable (–∫–ª–∞—Ç—Å—å -> –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ —Å–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å).  As such it's hard for me to really imagine what it's like for a native speaker to deal with these aspects, how it's all mapped in the brain. I don't really have anything like that in any language I speak fluently.	1644150636.0	hvsyz1j	t3_slury7	t1_hvsxhg0	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/hvsyz1j/
d0hgxc3d	That's a great point, I suppose that statistically the more obscure the verb, the more regular its formation otherwise it would've been regularized naturally.	1644150904.0	hvszdb6	t3_slury7	t1_hvsyd51	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/hvszdb6/
jdswj1f	Ah, yes, '–∏–º—è' is a bad role model, so to speak, because it declines in an unusual way.

d0hgxc3d	Precisely, but that's why I expected that it didn't match my personal relationship to articles in French, where grammatical gender is deeply intertwined with the noun itself. I expected a looser connection between perfective and imperfective forms.  I apologize if I sound like I insist that I know better than the natives, it's really not the case.

I use yandex to verify my translation when learning and very often it gives me excellent translation (sometimes better than the ones I come up with, which is seriously impressive for a software) but often it will also give me broken sentences or sentences that fails to convey the integrality of the sentence  I wanted to translate.  It is important to note though, that I mainly use it to translate from Russian to my native language, and it is very possible, since it is a Russian software that it performs way better when translating to Russia.

87xgyk7q	I think what you should do is research about Russian sentence structure and then translate the English words separately. Also, "But I can't use "House" or "He/she" in day to day interactions." I disagree, you need a good vocabulary to communicate in a foreign language. You can look for tourist translation books that have the translations of phrases of different situations.	1644152728.0	hvt28to	t3_slvl6k	t3_slvl6k	/r/russian/comments/slvl6k/how_do_you_build_sentences_in_russian/hvt28to/
jdz7n	There's no software that won't make mistakes, especially if you feed it unconventional sentences. That's why translating is still done by people.  You need to have "building blocks" to build something, that means knowing phrases, snippets and patterns. Russian constructs sentences quite differently, even if it generally follows the same structure of subject-verb-object like English. The most obvious example is "—É –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å" vs "I have" and "–º–Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è" vs "I like".  To build that mental database of patterns, you either find a course/textbook/website that teaches you phrases, not just words, or use a flashcard desk with phrases, or take them from native materials if you can use them.  If some phrase is idiomatic or is a fixed expression, try looking it up in https://www.multitran.com/ If your search results return individual words, scroll down to phrases - you can often find something there.	1644153393.0	hvt3dfq	t3_slvl6k	t3_slvl6k	/r/russian/comments/slvl6k/how_do_you_build_sentences_in_russian/hvt3dfq/

jya24	Actually, any Russian verb is either perfective or imperfective (aside from a relatively small number of so-called biaspectual verbs, which can work both ways, e. g. *–∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å*). A perfective-imperfective pair is more like a pair of gendered nouns, e. g. *actor ~ actress, lord ~ lady*, or Russian *—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∫ ~ —É—á–µ–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, –¥—Ä—É–≥ ~ –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞*, or French *√©tudiant ~ √©tudiante, citoyen ~ citoyenne, ours ~ ourse*, etc. Their meanings are obviously tightly connected, but each of them is better described as an independent noun, rather than the two being forms of one word. By contrast, adjectives of different genders, e. g. Rus. *–±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π ~ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è* or Fr. *vert ~ verte* are better described as forms rather than independent words. This is quite evident in dictionaries, which usually have one entry for an adjective but two separate entries for gender-paired nouns. Russian verbs which form aspectual pairs, even though their meanings are intimately connected, are also (sort of) independent lexical items, and dictionaries normally have separate entries for them.	1644153942.0	hvt4c8z	t3_slury7	t1_hvsyz1j	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/hvt4c8z/

6dl73gxc	Late to this, but if you have access to YouTube, I actually had the same question and found this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsIC6AgDsbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsIC6AgDsbs)  It's an extremely comprehensive walk-through on the different ways to say "I learn / I'm learning / I'm studying", and also explains how to use –£—á–∏—Ç—å vs –£—á–∏—Ç—å—Å—è. I actually didn't know anything about reflexive verbs before this video so it was super educational there too.  The main takeaways for me were:  \- Are you learning a THING? –£—á–∏—Ç—å + noun (e.g. "I am learning Russian")  \- Are you learning TO DO a thing? –£—á–∏—Ç—å—Å—è + verb (e.g. "I am learning to sing". Literally it means "I am teaching myself to sing")  \- If you follow –£—á–∏—Ç—å + infinitive verb, people are going to think you mean teaching because –£—á–∏—Ç—å  also means to teach :)  \- Are you learning a thing in-depth? E.g. what you're studying in university? Use –ò–∑—É—á–∞—Ç—å.

jya24	The rule is as follows: *-–µ-* itself is always pronounced as /e/¬π. If it follows a consonant-letter, that letter is pronounced soft (i. e. palatalized), except in some loanwords. But if *-–µ-* doesn't follow a consonant-letter, i. e., if it follows a vowel-letter, a mute letter (*-—å-* or *-—ä-*), or is at the beginning of a word, then the semi-vowel /j/ is inserted before it.   The same rule applies for *-—é-*, *-—è-* and *-—ë-*.  In *–∫–æ—Ä–æ–±–µ–π–Ω–∏–∫–∏*, *-–µ-* follows *-–±-*, which is a consonant-letter. So *-–±-* is pronounced as a soft /b ≤/ (rather than hard /b/). But in *–µ–π*, *-–µ-* is the first letter, so a /j/ sound is inserted before it. The same when *-–µ-* follows a vowel-letter: in *–º–æ–µ–π*, /j/ is inserted between the vowels, and in *–æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç*, it's inserted after the consonant /b/ (because *-—ä-* is mute).  ----  ¬π Note that /e/ is a full-bodied [[eÃû](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_front_unrounded_vowel)] only in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, it is reduced to something like [[…™](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel)].	1644157026.0	hvta6rd	t3_slwddf	t3_slwddf	/r/russian/comments/slwddf/pronunciation_of_–µ–π/hvta6rd/

xt3cp	The traditional West European name Isabella is normally translated into Russian as "–ò–∑–∞–±–µ–ª–ª–∞" and Isabela as –ò–∑–∞–±–µ–ª–∞ (similarly Elizabeth and related names will be –ï–ª–∏–∑–∞–≤–µ—Ç–∞, not –ï–ª–∏–∑–∞–±–µ—Ç–∞). This is not uncommon for old foreign names which Russian language already had to deal with back when the rules of transliteration were different (particularly names belonging to monarchs and other famous people). I would guess that this name arrived to Philippines during Spanish period, which would mean it's the same name Russians are used to spell with a "–∑". That said, when it comes to adapting one's name across cultures, it's still a personal choice, but "–∏—Å–∞–±–µ–ª–∞" does not sound quite natural in Russian.(at least that's the case if Isabela is your first name. If it's your last name and –õ—É–∏–∑–∞ is first then it would be expected to just normally transliterate the last name).	1644158149.0	hvtci76	t3_slnico	t1_hvt7lg4	/r/russian/comments/slnico/could_anyone_correct_my_worksheet_please_thank_you/hvtci76/

91g6d5sz	there are no vertical lines, except for dividing syllables in manuals.  cursive is rarely used, so the letters are not connected.  to write in cursive, you use a sort of a knot, connecting the lower parts of the letters.   It's totally skippable, unless you want to study calligraphy.  those two are complete equivalent of "russian" and "russian language", so usage depends on the context.	1644164836.0	hvtrxgi	t3_slzgz7	t3_slzgz7	/r/russian/comments/slzgz7/which_letters_should_i_combine_in_handwriting_and/hvtrxgi/
434wy2qh	Seems like an awful lot of work to avoid learning grammar. And from the fact that you're not satisfied with the results, it looks like it's not working very well. Google/Yandex translate can be excellent supplementary learning tools, but you have to understand the way the language works in order to use them without making big, frequent mistakes. For example, these programs don't know, and don't ask, the genders of the people being talked to/about or your gender. These make a big difference in how the sentence is constructed.  If you're just looking to memorize some survival phrases like "Where is the toilet" and "How much does it cost?" then I would recommend something like [this](https://youtu.be/w4WphuQFt9A). But if you want to have the ability to construct your own sentences, you need at least some grammar. This means learning the case system and verb declension.	1644165216.0	hvtsvjy	t3_slvl6k	t3_slvl6k	/r/russian/comments/slvl6k/how_do_you_build_sentences_in_russian/hvtsvjy/
1of835zs	Not sure about the *vertical* line question but normally when writing proper cursive as taught in schools you always connect all letters in a word. In a real world handwriting though you don't have such rules so maybe you shouldn't spend too much time thinking about and learning this.  > –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π or –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫?

jya24	Well, i doubt it can really be the exact same spot, because the tongue assumes an overall different shape when you pronounce a /b ≤/ than when you pronounce, say, /g ≤/ or /z ≤/. (My knowledge of phonetics is poor, so don't trust my judgement.) Maybe you could try leaving the soft one alone for a while and instead concentrate on pronouncing hard /b/ with some velarization, in order to make the two more dissimilar.  Palatalized /b ≤/ certainly devoices at ends of words. In *–∑—ã–±—å* and *—Å—ã–ø—å*, only the first consonant is pronounced differently.	1644165725.0	hvtu557	t3_slwddf	t1_hvtlb0r	/r/russian/comments/slwddf/pronunciation_of_–µ–π/hvtu557/

b1y15iy	> ignore, forget or be unsure what the aspectual counterpart of an uncommon verb is.  Is it possible that a native speaker remembers the verb for putting solid stuff into their mouth (=to eat), but forgets corresponding pair for putting liquid stuff into their mouth?   Yeah, it is totally possible for a native to forget a word, not be aware of the word, or use it ungrammatically.

6wkry26f	Maybe, native speakers usually know the meaning of prepositions with particular groups of verbs. And, therefore, can try to devise a new word even not knowing the word (if there is a word with this meaning already). Sometimes it could be wrong, but still be understandable, and sometimes could be wrong and not understandable because this word is already used in some other meaning.  For example, with verbs of motion:  1)  "–ø—Ä–∏-" usually means that motion has ended  2) "–ø–æ-" commonly means that motion has started  3) "–Ω–∞-" commonly means "has stumbled into somebody/something during motion"-situation (it could stop the motion and could not)  with "–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å" used in literal sense: –Ø –µ—Ö–∞–ª. –û–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–µ—Ö–∞–ª–∞. –û–Ω –ø–æ–µ—Ö–∞–ª. –ú—ã –Ω–∞–µ—Ö–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –∫–∞–º–µ–Ω—å.  with "–ª–µ—Ç–µ—Ç—å" used in literal sense: –Ø –ª–µ—Ç–µ–ª. –û–Ω –ø—Ä–∏–ª–µ—Ç–µ–ª. –û–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ—Ç–µ–ª–∞. –ú—ã –Ω–∞–ª–µ—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ç—É—á—É.   with "–∏–¥—Ç–∏" used in literal sense: –Ø —à—ë–ª. –Ø –ø—Ä–∏—à—ë–ª. –Ø –ø–æ—à—ë–ª. But "–Ø –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª" usually means "I found". So, not always the same meaning and practice is very important.	1644174457.0	hvug7nj	t3_slury7	t3_slury7	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/hvug7nj/

2y5iebtw	I use Busuu (and Memrise). Busuu is phenomenal in that it incrementally teaches you vocabulary and grammar points. It also makes you do exercises that are "graded" by native or fluent speakers of the language you are trying to learn, and encourages you to give advice to those learning your native language.   Vocabulary experience has been good so far. Grammar has been very good, but since it's not easy you'll probably need supplementary things to really hammer it in. This is where I use all the recommended YouTube channels and podcasts. If you pair the app with the Anki flashcards you can double down on your vocab with a personalized deck.   To get the most out of the app I would sign up for the subscription during one of the 50% off promos they have running (which is fairly often and programmed to pop up based on your use of the app).

opdzd	You're not just imagining it. I think Spanish vowels (not an expert on Spanish here!) tend to be 'pure' ‚Äì that is, the sound doesn't change from beginning to end.   /o/ in North American and Standard British pronunciation tends to be 'impure' ‚Äì we close our lips a little toward the end, so there's almost an /u/ sound. Try saying (or listening to an American saying) "ohh... " slowly, you'll probably hear something like \[o\] with a hint of \[u\] at the end.  Russian stressed /o/ is also often 'impure,' but in a different way: speakers often round their lips more at the beginning, less at the end, giving the slight /a/ coloration you've heard. It's more noticeable at the end of a word, perhaps not so much before –º. It's a subtle point but worth listening for, as the 'o with a hint of u' can contribute to an English accent in Russian. It's perhaps the main thing that distinguishes 'vote' from –≤–æ—Ç.	1644177408.0	hvunk8c	t3_slw6uc	t3_slw6uc	/r/russian/comments/slw6uc/pronunciation_of_o/hvunk8c/

ukn7c	I know, but "normal" inflections are at least a little easier to tell apart in theory. I mean, with "–æ–∫–Ω–æ" versus "–æ–∫–æ–Ω", they're actually spelled differently, so someone who is learning Russian from textbooks will know how to decline the noun properly even if they screw up the pronunciation. But when inflections are differentiated by stress only, there's more potential for error when you're learning from textbooks and other "academic" learning materials. In my experience, textbooks don't do a very good job of explaining why stress matters. It might not be as much of an issue for someone learning through genuine immersion.	1644191535.0	hvvlndf	t3_sm67lf	t1_hvvhsmd	/r/russian/comments/sm67lf/this_wonderful_russian_language/hvvlndf/

b1y15iy	1 - what did you mean by *–∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª—å*? A military boat that is part of the Navy forces? Or a personal boat for travel? In case it is the latter, we use "—è—Ö—Ç–∞". For example, [https://rg.ru/2021/02/24/forbes-rasskazal-o-novoj-145-metrovoj-iahte-abramovicha.html](https://rg.ru/2021/02/24/forbes-rasskazal-o-novoj-145-metrovoj-iahte-abramovicha.html)   Please note that 1 and 5 have two options (with and without –µ—Å—Ç—å) with different usage and meaning.

But in some contexts failing to use or not to use "–µ—Å—Ç—å" can create comical effect:  * –£ –º–µ–Ω—è –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞ = My wife is beautiful  * –£ –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞ = One of my wives is beautiful. :)	1644169197.0	hvu2wyi	t3_slnico	t3_slnico	/r/russian/comments/slnico/could_anyone_correct_my_worksheet_please_thank_you/hvu2wyi/
f43tzvk	I agree. If you‚Äôre solely learning with a textbook and aren‚Äôt training your ears it would be really confusing to them find out about certain inflections.	1644192652.0	hvvo4ps	t3_sm67lf	t1_hvvlndf	/r/russian/comments/sm67lf/this_wonderful_russian_language/hvvo4ps/
abcdviqu	The chart seems to be also missleading, because in case of 'no house' there is some sort of a '–Ω–µ' or '–±–µ—Å' missing.

opdzd	Another option is to say –ö–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å —è –≤—ã–µ–∑–∂–∞—é....  –≤—ã- can be used not just for exiting a place (ie –≤—ã–π—Ç–∏ –∏–∑ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç—ã), but also for specifying a time of departure. That's why you can see –≤—ã–ª–µ—Ç on the departures board at airports.   When you use –ø–æ- as imperfective (–ù–°–í) with multidirectional motion verbs (—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å, –µ–∑–¥–∏—Ç—å, –ª–µ—Ç–∞—Ç—å, etc), it has the same sense of 'doing something for a while' as with other verbs: –ø–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å 'to read for a while,' –ø–æ—Å–ø–∞—Ç—å 'take a nap,' –ø–æ–¥—É–º–∞—Ç—å 'think for a moment/a little while,' ---> –ø–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–µ 'to walk around the room for a while,' –ø–æ–µ–∑–¥–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ —Å–≤–µ—Ç—É 'to travel around the world.'  For vehicles we use -–µ–∑–∂–∞—Ç—å only with directional prefixes (–ø—Ä–∏-, —É-, etc.). –ü–æ- in this sense of 'for a while' isn't directional, that's why –ø–æ–µ–∑–∂–∞—Ç—å doesn't really exist (except for the command form –ø–æ–µ–∑–∂–∞–π!, which as far as I know exists only to keep us learners from getting too confident).	1644192938.0	hvvork2	t3_smbj4h	t3_smbj4h	/r/russian/comments/smbj4h/how_to_say_every_day_i_go_for_work_at_8_with_–ø–æ/hvvork2/

abcdviqu	The good thing about russian sentences is, that words don't need to be said in a fixed order. You can say: —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è. Or –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è. Or –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è. Or —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è. Even —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞.

ln8rps	Actually, you may notice that in English the pronunciation also changes as the stress changes in the first two words: the o in CON-flict is like an "awe" kinda sound, whereas the con-FLICT o is a schwa. Same for the two kinds of presents: you have a schwa and an e like in bed, and they switch around. The main difference is that in Russian there's a rule for how to pronounce the letters based on stress, which arguably makes Russian easier than English in this respect	1644221122.0	hvx64j5	t3_sm67lf	t1_hvwo3mu	/r/russian/comments/sm67lf/this_wonderful_russian_language/hvx64j5/

For example, the word cleave can mean "to cut apart" or "to bind together". This phenomenon is called enantiosemy, enantionymy (enantio- means "opposite"), antilogy or autantonymy.

3m54hp47	okay it's a bit hard to explain, maybe someone will do it better. —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å is a single finished action, so "—è —Ö–æ—á—É —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å —Ç–µ–±—è" implies that it is important to the speaker to be able to see the other person once again, even if it's for a brief moment. "—è —Ö–æ—á—É —Ç–µ–±—è –≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å" is also a correct phrasing, but –≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å is unfinished, and it implies a longer, almost endless action. i'd say the second one is more poetic, and the first one is more common and it's what you would hear in an everyday life. we can also say "—è —Ö–æ—á—É —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å—Å—è —Å —Ç–æ–±–æ–π", which is the same as the first one	1644225276.0	hvxbdso	t3_smlkvz	t3_smlkvz	/r/russian/comments/smlkvz/–ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∏_—è_—Ö–æ—á—É_—É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å_—Ç–µ–±—è/hvxbdso/

9pbfx36r	You're right, it's "–Ø —É–µ–∑–∂–∞—é –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂".   "–Ø —É–µ–∑–∂–∞—é –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂" means that this is her definite plan for the nearest future. It's in her timetable.  Had she specified the exact time, both options would be possible: "–ó–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ —è —É–µ–∑–∂–∞—é –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂", "–ó–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ —è —É–µ–¥—É –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂". I think it depends on the context which version is better, sometimes the difference is mostly stylistic. For example, both versions are possible: "–ó–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ —è —É–µ–∑–∂–∞—é –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂, –∞ –≤ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—É –≤–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–∞—é—Å—å. –í —ç—Ç–∏ –¥–Ω–∏ —Ç—ã –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–µ—à—å –º–æ–∏ –æ–±—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ?" / "–ó–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ —è —É–µ–¥—É –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂. –í–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Å—å –≤ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—É. –ü–æ–∫–∞ –º–µ–Ω—è –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç, —Ç—ã –±—É–¥–µ—à—å –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è—Ç—å –º–æ–∏ –æ–±—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏".  If it's not a plan but just a sudden idea or a threat, "–Ø —É–µ–¥—É –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂" would be more applicable. Example: "–Ø —É–µ–¥—É –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂, –µ—Å–ª–∏ —Ç—ã –Ω–µ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—à—å—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É!" Or there's a popular song "–Ø —É–µ–¥—É –∂–∏—Ç—å –≤ –õ–æ–Ω–¥–æ–Ω" in which the singer speculates about moving to London but in the end decides to stay in Moscow.	1644229860.0	hvxh03v	t3_smmjr6	t3_smmjr6	/r/russian/comments/smmjr6/what_did_the_girl_in_the_video_say/hvxh03v/
38dxx	no. you are mixing up two different things, i think. when putting another verb after —Ö–æ—Ç–µ—Ç—å it should be infinitive. same as english. i want _to eat_, i need _to go_ etc.  whether to use an imperfective verb or not depends what you want to say and i guess you have to understand the difference between the usage of the verbs like the other guy said for —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å above.	1644229932.0	hvxh3dj	t3_smlkvz	t1_hvxc9zp	/r/russian/comments/smlkvz/–ø—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∏_—è_—Ö–æ—á—É_—É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å_—Ç–µ–±—è/hvxh3dj/

80sjmd0w	Thanks for the answer. It seems I am sometimes confused with the prefixes so I have an additional question if you don't mind. Does adding a prefix to a verb always create a completely new verb?  Or are there prefixes that just slightly differ the verb but essentially it behaves the same. I don't know if this question makes sense lol but in my head you have a verb and you can add all kinds of prefixes to slightly alter it but in it's essence it's still the same verb. But seems it's not really like that	1644231905.0	hvxjjzc	t3_smmjr6	t1_hvxh03v	/r/russian/comments/smmjr6/what_did_the_girl_in_the_video_say/hvxjjzc/

9pbfx36r	Hm, I'm not a teacher so I'm not sure how to answer your question properly. Every verb has a root with some very general meaning, and when you create a new verb by adding a prefix, this broad meaning is enriched with an additional feature, making it more specific. For example, the verb "–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å" is related to general movement with the help of something (transport, for example - but not walking), and by adding prefixes you specify the characteristics of this movement.	1644234034.0	hvxmgv7	t3_smmjr6	t1_hvxjjzc	/r/russian/comments/smmjr6/what_did_the_girl_in_the_video_say/hvxmgv7/

If it 5.83, then "–ø—è—Ç—å —Ü–µ–ª—ã—Ö 83 —Å–æ—Ç—ã—Ö", because 0.01-0.99 are hundreths, 5.834 will be "–ø—è—Ç—å —Ü–µ–ª—ã—Ö 834 —Ç—ã—Å—è—á–Ω—ã—Ö" and so on.

3mmwfahk	For practical purposes, it‚Äôs easier to think of prefixed verbs as new verbs. Adding a prefix will almost always cause grammatical changes to a verb (often making it perfective from imperfective), and can also create significant changes in meaning. Often the verbs are conceptually related, but for example, ‚Äú—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å‚Äù is ‚Äúto walk‚Äù, but ‚Äú–Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å‚Äù is ‚Äúto find‚Äù ‚Äî quite different, although originating from the same root. ‚Äú–ò—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å‚Äù is another one that doesn‚Äôt imply movement (it means ‚Äúto base on something‚Äù, like ‚Äúbased on X, we conclude Y‚Äù).  Still, when you run into an unfamiliar prefixed verb with a familiar root, you often should be able to deduce its meaning based on the directional and positional placement that prefixes add.	1644245932.0	hvy8xi0	t3_smmjr6	t1_hvxjjzc	/r/russian/comments/smmjr6/what_did_the_girl_in_the_video_say/hvy8xi0/

2zw98l4z	My Russian professor told us of students who went to Kiev/Kyiv for language stays, as it was far cheaper than Russia to attend school there. Overall, they all liked it and made enough progress to be happy about it. She told us there are many beautiful sights in town, good food, kind people and Russian is still widely spoken (and either way Ukrainian is close enough to it that people should understand you well, there's only accentuating and some words here and there that will change substantially). If you're conversational, you should not struggle at all!  As for the geopolitical situation, I doubt it will make it much harder to speak Russian for you. It's still the native/second language of many people in Ukraine after all. Of course, the current tensions will probably make the asshole behaviour of asshole people more frequent than usual, but they'll likely not be a majority - and I'd guess once people know you're a foreigner who's not Russian, through you telling them or your accent, most will be very happy to help you and make you discover their city!  Now as a word of advice: once you're settled on your choice, you should contact your local embassy/consulate. Given how hot the situation in Ukraine has been, they'll surely have the info you need and may even have an update feed to let you know if anything is happening once you're there. And, worse come to worse, they'll be able to contact you and help you better if you require evacuation for any kind of emergency.  Sorry for writing something so long. It's not my own experience so it may need other takes on it, but I hope it helps! –í—Å–µ–≥–æ –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ–≥–æ!	1644256714.0	hvyzzlx	t3_smur6a	t3_smur6a	/r/russian/comments/smur6a/has_anybody_here_studied_russian_full_time_in/hvyzzlx/

2q7choma	I have. I have considered Moscow but having been there before I'm personally not a massive fan and it's pretty expensive cost of living wise. I studied at Liden & Denz in Piter and they have a school in irkutsk - which looked incredibly interesting especially considering the location since it's so incredibly far away from where I live in Norther Europe. However, I heard from my tutor that the school in particular isn't that good. She told me it's very small and that the living arrangements there aren't great.

ksb2j	I spent 3 days there in 2018. The majority of people around me were speaking in Russian. I remember, since I was coming from Lviv, I made an effort to pepper my language with shit like "please" and "thank you" in Ukrainian for the hostel staff when I arrived and I just fully got the impression they didn't even speak Ukrainian, and they certainly spoke Russian amongst themselves.  I think it's a good shout as it is tonnes cheaper, plus it may be visa-free depending on where you're from. The only thing you'll find is that all signage will be in Ukrainian as well as things like announcements on transport. But essentially, if your Russian is alright, you will be able to competently understand a useful proportion of Ukrainian.	1644259388.0	hvz6uqr	t3_smur6a	t3_smur6a	/r/russian/comments/smur6a/has_anybody_here_studied_russian_full_time_in/hvz6uqr/

434wy2qh	>I plan on moving to Russia soon and I would like to learn Russian.  Better get right on it, then, you'll need a couple of years of intensive, dedicated study to be able to understand others and express yourself on a basic level. ;)  An approach that includes grammar study and immersion is ideal. A textbook and/or tutor will lend organization and structure to the tasks. There are a lot of tutors on Skype that aren't too expensive, usually $20 per session. Feedback is important for language acquisition, especially in the early stages when you are still learning about cases and declensions. Once you have a basic understanding of how the grammar works, self-study is more permissible.  Check out this sub's Wiki for a list of free online resources, there is a lot out there. You can learn a lot through YouTube and podcasts.	1644274240.0	hw08ulc	t3_sn2m2z	t3_sn2m2z	/r/russian/comments/sn2m2z/wanting_to_learn_russian/hw08ulc/

kn994	I live in Kyiv. It's a very bilingual city, there is absolutely no problem with speaking Russian here - especially for foreigners. The media makes a bigger deal out of the language situation than it is. If someone talks to you in Ukrainian, you can answer in Russian and that would be a totally normal conversation in Ukraine. I also found that knowing some Ukrainian has only improved my Russian, since the languages are really quite similar.   I'd also recommend you to consider Odessa (I studied Russian there) or Kharkov. Those cities are - in my opinion - just as great as Kyiv. But if cost is important to you, don't rule out the smaller east-Dneiper cities: Zaporozhia; Dnipro; Nikolaev; Kherson'; Poltava; Cherkasy... I'm sure you could find language schools in any of those cities, they're a lot quieter but they'll be a lot cheaper.	1644276817.0	hw0f043	t3_smur6a	t3_smur6a	/r/russian/comments/smur6a/has_anybody_here_studied_russian_full_time_in/hw0f043/

3m72gmdg	**–ú—É–∑–æ–Ω** is fairly modern slang for music (I remember it from the late 90s and the 00s, but can't vouch for young people today still using it). It's the more "rugged" kind of slang as opposed to the "trendy" kind, and in my experience, mostly refers to recorded music being played back (as opposed to written or performed live).  "Song" is a trickier one but I guess **—Ç—Ä–µ–∫,** from "track", is a fitting enough slangy vogue word replacing "–ø–µ—Å–Ω—è".	1644278127.0	hw0i1yy	t3_sn4phx	t3_sn4phx	/r/russian/comments/sn4phx/musicrelated_slang/hw0i1yy/

gwxm3	I answered this same question a few weeks back (https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/):  Ukraine is fine for learning Russian, but try to pick a predominantly Russian speaking city: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro are the big ones. Kyiv is inside the Ukrainian area, so people in small towns and villages near Kyiv speak mixed Ukrainian-Russian, as do recent immigrants from those towns/villages. But since Kyiv is the capital, it is full of highly educated people who are fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian and often English as well. In particular, if you want a native Russian speaker tutor, university educated residents of Kyiv are indeed native speakers of Russian. At worst, they might accidentally use a Ukrainian word instead of standard Russian (–±—É—Ä–∞–∫ instead of —Å–≤—ë–∫–ª–∞, for example).   Note that 100% of Ukrainians everywhere in Ukraine understand Russian perfectly, and always will, because of the influence of YouTube now and television in the past. However, they may not speak Russian fluently due to lack of practice, especially in the Ukrainian areas of the west and north.   Spoken business/technical language in Kyiv is Russian and they speak it perfectly. However, most street signs, packaging and all official documents are Ukrainian. Ukrainian and Russian get more and more similar when the document is full of legal, business, medical, scientific and other technical jargon, so learning to read  business or technical Ukrainian is not that difficult if you are C1 reading in Russian.   A polite way to deal with the language issue anywhere in Ukraine is ask "–í—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π?" (Russian pronunciation of –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ). If yes, proceed in English. If no or a hesitant yes, proceed in Russian. In other words, if someone in Ukraine really hates Russian, you are giving them the option to speak English. If they can't speak English, then they can't complain about being forced to speak Russian.   I did most of my Russian learning in Kyiv, and have been spending 3 months each year there since 2015, plus 16 months straight during the Great Covid Plague of 2020-2021. I don't speak any Ukrainian myself, but I understand enough that if someone (such as young women secretaries in offices) speaks a simple sentence to me in Ukrainian, I can understand and reply in Russian without asking them to translate to Russian.   My experience is that learning to listen to Ukrainian at A2 level, and read business/technical documents at C1 level is not difficult if your Russian is B2 listening/C1 reading, and Ukrainian does not interfere with Russian if it is input only. I would recommend against learning to output (speak/write) both Ukrainian and Russian until you have mastered one of these languages (presumably Russian, given which reddit we are in), because they conflict so much. In particular, they use different stress for identical words (–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ, for example).	1644282917.0	hw0sz36	t3_smur6a	t3_smur6a	/r/russian/comments/smur6a/has_anybody_here_studied_russian_full_time_in/hw0sz36/

afoy026z	I lived in Kyiv for four months during a study abroad in 2018. Studied at Novamova language school. While most people will ask why you‚Äôre not studying Ukrainian and learning Russian people in Kyiv are great. Friendly and easy to talk to. If you can live with a host family I highly recommend it. I lived a family that spoke no English in the outskirts of the city and it was a great immersive experience. Hard to communicate at times but really forced language learning. The city of Kyiv itself has so many cultural and historical places to visit across the city that you won‚Äôt run out of things.

Mind you, they don't let you inside the reactor, or even the hospital where all the firefighters clothes still are.  If your peace corps friends were all exposed it was not a typical thing because the radiation in Kyiv is no worse than any other city in the world.	1644284109.0	hw0vpc4	t3_smur6a	t1_hw02zh7	/r/russian/comments/smur6a/has_anybody_here_studied_russian_full_time_in/hw0vpc4/

12092z	I spent most of 2018 in Kyiv working at a hostel, I met a lot of locals through couchsurfing and dated a Ukrainian girl for ten months. Here's my experience:  First, before I went I asked a girl that I knew if she'd help me with Russian conversation practice. She mentioned it to her professor who told her to teach me Ukrainian and tell me it's Russian. Later I asked one of the guys working at the hostel for the same thing and when I told him about my friend's professor he admitted that his first thought was to do the same thing. There were other occasions with various people where I'd ask how to say something in Russian and they'd tell me in Ukrainian  The girl I dated and many other young people that I met (20s-30s) all feel very strongly about the Russian language. They all will deny that they speak it. If someone speaks to them in Russian they will either not answer back at all or answer back in Ukrainian. I've seen foreigners who were learning the language try to push and continue to speak Russian with several girls and more than once it turned into a violent argument.  Trying to talk to waitresses in restaurants around Maidan in Russian usually resulted in them pretending not to understand or them speaking English to me.  That being said, not everyone was like that and I did meet a handful of people willing to help me with the language (and obviously there are Ukrainians who speak Russian as a first language), and the city is amazing. I'd recommend going but it might not be the best place to learn Russian.	1644295780.0	hw1lba2	t3_smur6a	t3_smur6a	/r/russian/comments/smur6a/has_anybody_here_studied_russian_full_time_in/hw1lba2/

Unfortunately, I do not know which denomination you belong to, but as a Catholic, I would be happy to talk on various topics. By the way, I met an American woman here in the same way, with whom we are currently conducting a literary project (we are translating a Russian book into English).

Speakly, a paid app (DIFFERENT THAN SPEECHLING) is GREAT, lots of content. beelinguapp and lingq for stories. Kindle if you have it can be used. there's also okydoky from google play, might be good for a beginner. And lastly, Yask. Yask is my fave, it makes you write and record speech which is then rated by native speakers. Also dictionaries, they have a bad rep but my small collins one and a vintage oxford are very good (to me at least).

lop34	The font you've shown is a regular antiqua (a serif font). Italics in those are usually modeled after the handwritten shapes, but not connected. So just pick any antiqua that has Cyrillic & Italics (Garamond, Times New Roman, Baskerville, whatever - there are hundreds).  Moreover, even the fonts that try to emulate handwriting (comics fonts, calligraphy fonts etc) often aren't connected, because different connectors introduce a lot of variation, which computer fonts aren't good at handling.	1644315798.0	hw2dr3h	t3_snfwb1	t1_hw29fh5	/r/russian/comments/snfwb1/would_this_highlighted_font_be_illegible_if_i/hw2dr3h/

Case in point, [Michael McFaul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7013Li2sMy8) has at least the same level of Russian, probably better.	1644327730.0	hw2wicq	t3_sngc9t	t1_hw2vau5	/r/russian/comments/sngc9t/can_someone_translate_what_my_insane_russian/hw2wicq/

cwv8d	Hmm, he does seem a little out there.  Other commenters translated the text well enough and I agree it doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs native. At least his handwriting really resembles a 4-5 year-old‚Äôs.  What I find interesting though is that it‚Äôs apparently a to-do list of sorts, but the numbers look like they‚Äôve been written with a non dominant hand, each point is both crossed out AND ticked, there‚Äôs one more tick that doesn‚Äôt seem to belong anywhere, his English handwriting seems much more native than Russian and both 1 and 4 look like 2 Keep your eyes peeled for any murder or disappearance news in the area (Especially if someone called Amalia is involved). It does sound a little threatening with the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù he mentions and the invitation to Amalia‚Äôs funeral.	1644327795.0	hw2wn47	t3_sngc9t	t1_hw2vk5t	/r/russian/comments/sngc9t/can_someone_translate_what_my_insane_russian/hw2wn47/

gpi5f	Everybody here writes how it doesn't really look like this person really is Russian and maybe they're not, but this text has quite a distinctive similarity to something I've seen before ‚Äîit looks quite similar to how certain [heritage speakers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_language) of Russian write, including wrong letter shapes and some typical grammatical mistakes ‚Äî at least I've encountered several texts like this while working with the heritage russian corpora (but they were of the worse kind, there are a lot of heritage speakers who write much better).  Another possibility is that this person is quite literally insane (which does seem fairly possible judging by the content of this note) and their mental illness has affected their handwriting and language proficiency, especially if they are not using Russian too often in everyday life. A quick google showed that certain conditions like schizophrenia can indeed affect handwriting dramatically, but, unlike heritage speakers, I have no first-hand experience with this topic and know pretty much nothing, so I may be completely wrong in this assessment.	1644329538.0	hw30ck5	t3_sngc9t	t3_sngc9t	/r/russian/comments/sngc9t/can_someone_translate_what_my_insane_russian/hw30ck5/

csapp	Agreed.  It should be either:  > I *have* watched it nine times already.  or  > I watched it for the ninth time.  &nbsp;   (Putting "already" at the end would also be more of an AmE construction. BrE would more typically use *"I have already watched it..."*. Colloquial AmE is far more flexible with its use of "already" overall.)  &nbsp;   The only way the English sentence would be grammatically solid is as a response to the very specific question:   *"Would you like to watch this film for the ninth time?"*    Not the eighth or tenth time; not just "watch it again"; but very specifically "for the ninth time".  Even then, a native speaker would normally arrange the reply to that question as:   *"I already watched this film for the ninth time yesterday."*   with "yesterday" at the end as additional information not crucial to the core response.	1644338495.0	hw3mpi3	t3_snavif	t1_hw30l42	/r/russian/comments/snavif/is_the_—É–∂–µ_really_necessary_here_in_the_english/hw3mpi3/

So you would be, in a way, circling back to the roots. Slimbach's fonta are beautiful even if some of their Cyrillic shapes have raised a few eyebrows. In particular that –ª in cursive looks funny.

hx2c7	Well, I am studying on my own, using duolingo for like year and a half already. (First streak 278 days, current one 168). It is okay if you do it every day, it forces me to see Russian language every single day, which is, of course, really good. Other than that, I follow some Russian subreddits so I can read comments and stuff. I recommend r/russian, r/russia (they mostly use english, but you can find a comment in Russian from time to time), r/Pikabu and r/Popular_Science_Ru. I am kinda able to communicate with Russian teammates in CSGO as well (though its possible with like 3-4 sentences in Russian).

What I mean I guess is that even if I have to write single words like for example "France" I would do something like this:  F = –§r = —Äa = –∞n = –Ωc = —Ü (closest one I can think of)e = –µ  Which would be wrong, since I'm checking you're supposed to write it like this: –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—è and not –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–µ  So yeah, I guess what gives me the most trouble are the letters that we have in the latin alphabet that are not in the cyrillic one (like our C, or W) and also the "new" cyrillic letters to which I'm not fully familiarized yet.	1644405876.0	hw7naxl	t3_so9ngq	t1_hw7j965	/r/russian/comments/so9ngq/started_learning_russian_2_weeks_ago/hw7naxl/

2t068aaa	The Russian language is not written as phonetically as a language like Spanish so you can't really rely on witting what you hear and hope it will be okay (not to mention the fact that there isn't really a correspondence between the Cyrillic and Latin alphabet).  An an example, if you hear an unstressed sound 'i', it can be the letter "–∏", of course, but it can  also be the letter "e" or even "—è", same for the sound 'a', it can be the letter "a" but it can also be the letter "–æ", for example, you hear 'cpaciba', but the word is written "—Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ". You really need to learn the spelling of each word as you learn them if you want to be able to write. It's a long process, I started learning Russian about ten months ago and I still often hesitate when writing unstressed vowels. Written Russian is much more consistent than a language like French, but you can't just write it phonetically and hope it will be 100% okay :)	1644417959.0	hw8a7it	t3_so9ngq	t3_so9ngq	/r/russian/comments/so9ngq/started_learning_russian_2_weeks_ago/hw8a7it/

Something about total silence as well. He already put up 5 000 of these signs, but only one person came forward. He's very shocked that people are so frightened of the unknown and so lazy, that they're only willing to work in fixed structures (and not in this weird-ass project, I guess?). Hourly pay will depend on the quality of the translation.

a04ajhi5	I basically write all of my letters a "printed" way, including "—Ä". There are some exceptions though, for example my "–î" looks like english "D" (cause it's faster to write), and I write "—Ç" as "m" (as the op also did)  Mine are generally rounder than the printed ones though, for example my "–∏" looks like "u", and my "–ø" looks like "n", so like, a little bit softer and less edgy  But even though people think writing in printed letters are childish and too slow, I 100% disagree with that. It looks nice, it's (a lot) clearer to read, and I'm still finishing first when teacher dictates a sentence. So with practice, I feel like writing this way can be even faster, as it happened in my case.  –û–¥–Ω–∞–∂–¥—ã –º–∏—Ä –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∂–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∏—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –±—É–∫–≤ –∏ –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–π–º—É—Ç –Ω–∞—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –≤—Å—ë —ç—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è! √íw√ì	1644418111.0	hw8akgx	t3_slnico	t1_hw7qzf3	/r/russian/comments/slnico/could_anyone_correct_my_worksheet_please_thank_you/hw8akgx/

9pbfx36r	Interestingly, the Palmer Raids took place in 1919-20, and the patent is from 1980s. Do you know how old was he when he got arrested? And what was the name of his father? Because the author of the patent is Konstantin Nikolaevich Marmysh, meaning that his father was Nikolay. Also, if you search with Yandex for "–ú–∞—Ä–º—ã—à –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á" , there are some traces of leaked databases that point to Konstantin Nikolaevich Marmysh, born 1925, who lived in Minsk. The latter seems a more fitting candidate for authoring a patent in the 1980s, than the one who got arrested in 1919-20.	1644429231.0	hw93tn1	t3_so68e0	t1_hw8e5l8	/r/russian/comments/so68e0/can_anyone_read_this_or_describe_what_its_for/hw93tn1/

The one related to who would‚Äôve been my great-grandpa was born around the 1880s, arrested January 1920, and looks like he died in a German POW camp in 1944 perhaps. I‚Äôm not familiar with the language so I can‚Äôt tell how popular the last name Marmysh/Marmish is. I‚Äôve been trying to track 4 brothers who all came to America around the same time and 3 were arrested in the Palmer Raids. Looks like this doesn‚Äôt pertain to them though. We were debating if we think the brothers were involved in unionization efforts and that‚Äôs why they were targeted or if there was something deeper.

9pbfx36r	It has to do with Kadyrov himself. There's an ongoing story of Kadyrov's battle against his opponents and against the human rights defenders. It's a complicated story. One of the aspects is that there are communities and channels on social media that are anti-Kadyrov (and quite supportive of the separatist movement of the 90s). They consider each other enemies. Real enemies. Kadyrov and his subordinates are known to have zero respect to Russian laws when it comes to certain aspects of life which they consider involving their dignity. So it's not a big secret that they do practice torture. Back in 2015 or so, one of the admins of such a community was identified as the son of the judge of the Chechnya Supreme Court, Yangulbaev. What happened after that is not 100% clear, the latter says they were tortured; Kadyrov says he was only reprimanded etc.; anyway, the judge got dismissed and left Chechnya after that. Fast forward to our days, there is a Telegram channel 1ADAT of the same type. And not only it's super critical of Kadyrov, but also, they say, people related to it uncovered some (or at least one) of the former Kadyrov's law enforcers and attacked them in Turkey. Then it's discovered the mentioned Yangulbaev Jr is the key person behind this channel. And, at the same time he works with the Committee Against Torture, which is an important human rights organization, openly hated by Kadyrov. So, this January, policemen from Chechnya arrived to Nizhny Novgorod, where the Yangulbaevs lived, and wanted to bring them to Chechnya. They didn't dare to arrest the judge (because at that time he still enjoyed his lifetime immunity as a federal judge), but they did take his wife, a diabetic whose health condition leaves much to be desired, drive her to Chechnya and arrest her. After a scandal broke out, Kadyrov and many of his subordinates declared that they will "tear Yangulbaevs' heads off" anywhere in the world, basically declaring a blood feud. They even summoned a rally in Checnhya where Yangulbaevs' portraits were burnt.	1644431008.0	hw98oz4	t3_sojsrg	t3_sojsrg	/r/russian/comments/sojsrg/can_someone_fill_me_in_on_why_i_see_kadyrov_so/hw98oz4/

9pbfx36r	It's not a very common last name, but there are some people named Marmysh, mostly living in Belarus. I guess it's safe to say that this name is actually more Belarusian. The Russian version of the same name is Marmyshev.  I've even found a relatively [recent comment](https://www.radzima.net/ru/miejsce/moskale.html#comm33388) on a Belarusian-Lithuanian genealogical website, about the village of Moskali (Mostovsky district, Gomel Oblast - quite close to the Polish border). It goes like this: "Hello, my name is Marmysh Nikolay Nikolaevich, my father is from this village, he's Marmysh Nikolay Nikolaevich as well, and the great-grandfather was probably Marmysh Nikolay Konstantinovich, by the way, according to my father, the great-great-grandfather was a priest, but there is no church in the village, Marmysh Konstantin, don't know his patronymic. \[...\] There are lots of graves with the kast name Marmysh in the local cemetery"  [Here's a report](https://belaruspartisan.by/life/327942/) from that dying village, in case you're interested.	1644431804.0	hw9aveo	t3_so68e0	t1_hw97q47	/r/russian/comments/so68e0/can_anyone_read_this_or_describe_what_its_for/hw9aveo/

11hbw3	Thank you! Yes, I know my great-grandma was from Grodno. My great grandpa listed Vilna which is in Lithuania as his birth place and the night they were arrested the article I found said a charter was found in the Lithuanian Society Hall in their town showing their participation in some kind of organized group. (My family thought maybe an effort to unionize.)   Thank you so much for these links! I‚Äôm excited to read about the town and see what the history might be. There was no written record from my family who immigrated telling their side of the story, but I can tell that where they settled had at least some kind of bustling community of Eastern European immigrants all from around the Grodno area who lived within streets of each other. I‚Äôve been trying to connect the dots ever since.	1644433420.0	hw9f7wo	t3_so68e0	t1_hw9aveo	/r/russian/comments/so68e0/can_anyone_read_this_or_describe_what_its_for/hw9f7wo/

3mnks	I am surprised and dejected that people fear everything new and are lazy. I've posted 5,000 ads in Strausborg for a translator and only one person showed up. Despite the fact that more than 10% of families in Strausborg are in dire need of money and live from paycheck to paycheck (among the Russian speaking inhabitants who live in straussborg that need money, there is much more). I thought that students would be more active, seeing as 25% of students also need money. But I was mistaken. Everyone is only willing to work as a subordinate in predefined structures. (If more more active migrants are afraid and don't take up anything new, what about the ordinary people who grew up and live in poor countries that never leave their poor countries for rich ones?) For two years I have been trying to estabilsh a company around researching human psychology. I suggest doing interesting work \*together - total silence. I don't know French and for that reason I invite the Russian-speaking inhabitants of Strausborg develop the architype for the ideal man and woman - the same silence. Truly, the Russian speakers of Strausborg are far from the ideal. As I have previously written, I do not know French and therefore have not found anyone to work with on translation and so I will continue to seek out a Russian-French translator. Payment by the hour will depend on the quality of the translation. I will not include my phone number as it is constantly turned off.

9pbfx36r	Unfortunately, I don't know. My assumption is that the person who acquired it in 1923 wanted to record some facts about the icon that boosted its sacrality: that it was "attached" (or maybe rather "affixed") to an important icon of Our Lady of Tikhvin when the latter was [releasing oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myroblyte_saint) (which is regarded as a wonder and an important sign from God); that it was part of some major events such as the celebrations in memory of Hermogenes (who had been canonized not so long before, in 1913), etc.  Art experts specializing in Russian icons could tell you more. Alas, I'm not one of them. But I suppose that this icon might be quite valuable, particularly because of these inscriptions.	1644445138.0	hwaau89	t3_snvsf4	t1_hwa51s3	/r/russian/comments/snvsf4/1914_russian_icon/hwaau89/

3m54hp47	I don't think there's an equivalent to righty tighty, however there are lots of other mnemonic phrases. Here are some off the top of my head:  1) The most popular one is "–∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –∂–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç –∑–Ω–∞—Ç—å, –≥–¥–µ —Å–∏–¥–∏—Ç —Ñ–∞–∑–∞–Ω" - children use it to memorize the colors of the rainbow by the first letters of each word (–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã–π, –æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∂–µ–≤—ã–π, –∂—ë–ª—Ç—ã–π, –∑–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã–π, —Å–∏–Ω–∏–π, —Ñ–∏–æ–ª–µ—Ç–æ–≤—ã–π). (the phrase itself roughly translates to "each hunter wants to know where the pheasant hides) 2) "–ü–∏—Ñ–∞–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—ã —à—Ç–∞–Ω—ã –≤–æ –≤—Å–µ —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã —Ä–∞–≤–Ω—ã" ("Pythagoras' pants' sides are all equal") - to remember the Pythagorean theorem. 3) "–ù–∞–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å –æ–¥–µ–∂–¥—É, –æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥—É" ("to put clothes on, to dress up Nadezhda") - that one is to remember the difference between –Ω–∞–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å and –æ–¥–µ–≤–∞—Ç—å. 4) A rhyme to remember the exceptions from the 2nd conjugation - "–ì–Ω–∞—Ç—å, –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—Ç—å, –¥—ã—à–∞—Ç—å –∏ —Å–ª—ã—à–∞—Ç—å, —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å, –≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å, –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å, –∏ –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏—Ç—å, –∏ –≤–µ—Ä—Ç–µ—Ç—å, –∏ –æ–±–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å, –∏ —Ç–µ—Ä–ø–µ—Ç—å".

8z5e6t0h	Oh wow!! Ok. May I have more background on the tsarist and what they represented? Were they God centered or wealth and power centered in their rule?  With respect to your question allenrabinovich, I do not have a clearer image which is really unfortunate. However, WhatsApp provided this image when I searched for the True Cross of Christ. The tag was Russian in origin. I do not have more information than that.   I am getting the feeling however that God doesn't want me pursuing this as it has been so difficult to find our information about it. Please don't worry about it. I'm going to delete it. I greatly appreciate all of your help and generous support in even considering my request.  I am still interested in who the tsarist were though, so any enlightenment in that direction would be greatly appreciated!  God bless your group and thank you!

3mmwfahk	[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom\_of\_Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire)  Russia was ruled by tsars (monarchs) from 1547 until 1917, and became an empire in 1721 (and technically the tsars became emperors, but were still referred to by both titles). The two articles above are a good historical introduction to the two periods and should provide you with appropriate context on the foundation of tsar's power.  The seal looks somewhat like red wax seals you can find on souvenirs sold by various online shops, purporting to be relics of the true cross of Christ, but a) they are most likely forgeries, and b) nothing about them is connected to Russia. I strongly suspect this seal or the symbol on it has no special religious significance.	1644457650.0	hwb4zqy	t3_sos1vi	t1_hwb36y7	/r/russian/comments/sos1vi/russian_red_wax_seal/hwb4zqy/

3mmwfahk	One of the few hard rules of word order in Russian is that prepositions always precede the words they modify (hence their name, really ;)). Furthermore, the only thing that can appear between a preposition and the word it modifies are other modifiers (so for verbs it‚Äôs adverbs, for nouns it‚Äôs adjectives). Thus, for example: ‚Äú–∏–¥—É –ø–æ –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–µ‚Äù is fine, ‚Äú–∏–¥—É –ø–æ –ø—É—Å—Ç–æ–π, –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–µ‚Äù is also fine, but ‚Äú–ø–æ –∏–¥—É –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–µ‚Äù is incorrect, and so is ‚Äú–∏–¥—É –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–µ –ø–æ‚Äù. In your case, something like ‚Äú–Ω–µ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –∑–Ω–∞—é‚Äù is fine; ‚Äú–Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é‚Äù is fine, but ‚Äú–∑–Ω–∞—é –Ω–µ‚Äù can only appears in longer phrases where ‚Äú–Ω–µ‚Äù modifies something else, like ‚Äú–∑–Ω–∞—é –Ω–µ –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—é, –∞ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫—É‚Äù.	1644464943.0	hwblx20	t3_soprdk	t3_soprdk	/r/russian/comments/soprdk/is_–∑–Ω–∞—é_–Ω–µ_grammatically_correct/hwblx20/

bqvy1spw	I think I already had my comment answered, but the purpose of the fictional organization is that it is a subordinate to the USSR, in charge of the balkan region (think of Eastern Bloc but for the region around yugoslavia), in which the organization has "peacekeeping" activities, thus, Proxy (A "buffer" organization run by the USSR and controls these fictitious states in the balkans) Security Council, or office, indicating that it is indeed an organization. If you need some keywords: Peacekeeping, Third-party (which is why I called it an "intermediate", or "intervention"), Security, Office, Council, Commission, etc., Balkan region. I hope this helps. Normally I would translate it into serbian because I actually am serbian but I needed this one to be russian for the sake of consistency.	1644473749.0	hwc2wqg	t3_snr8k2	t1_hw4c6rh	/r/russian/comments/snr8k2/need_some_abbreviation_help_not_a_native_speaker/hwc2wqg/

3voewa0k	Saying that a word doesn't exist is somewhat counterintuitive. Like this one: it is a word, it has meaning, and anyone fluent in Russian understands what it means. So it does exist, but it shouldn't be used for some reason (let philologists explain why, but it sounds weird)    On the lighter note, some adults tell their kids 'there's no such word' when the little ones start saying profanities. So this little Johnny gets puzzled and says: 'how come, I have an asshole, but no word to name it?

3mmwfahk	Sorry, your post somehow fell through the cracks.  Are you envisioning the poem as a message from the bride to the groom, or from the groom to the bride, or just as a general lyrical message about love and commitment? There are many options, but to avoid being schlocky or overwrought, your best bet would be either a selection from the Silver Age or from among the 1960s lyrical poets.

9pbfx36r	Here are my thoughts.  First of all, a proxy might be translated as "—É–ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–º–æ—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ª–∏—Ü–æ" or "–¥–æ–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ª–∏—Ü–æ" (an authorized person) when it comes to people, or maybe in some contexts "–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫" (an intermediary). When it comes to "proxy wars", there is no standard or precise translation into Russian. Some translate it as "–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞", "–æ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞" or "–≤–æ–π–Ω–∞ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤" (intermediary war / war through intermediaries), some as "–º–∞—Ä–∏–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞" (puppet war) etc. It's hard to come up with a literate translation into Russian, and hard to imagine this word to come up as part of an official name of an organization.  Secondly, a ministry is part of the government and its powers do not stretch to other sovereign (albeit, only nominally sovereign) countries, and cannot (nominally) influence its politics. I suppose that a more realistic option is a special body that is *not* part of the Soviet government but an inter-government body, de facto controlled by the USSR.  For example, something like:  –ú–µ–∂–≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏—è –ø–æ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞ (–ú–ö–í–ë–†) = Inter-State Commission on Reconstruction of the Balkan Region (MKVBR).  –ü–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –º–∏—Ä–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–∏–ª –≤ –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–µ (–ü–ö–ú–ú–ë–†) = Permanent Command of the International Peacekeeping Forces in the Balkan Region (PKMMBR).  –í—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∫—Ä–∏–∑–∏—Å–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏—è –ø–æ –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º—É —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω—É (–í–ö–ö–ë–†) = Temporary Crisis Commission for the Balkan Region (VKKBR)	1644482257.0	hwcezb2	t3_snr8k2	t1_hwc2wqg	/r/russian/comments/snr8k2/need_some_abbreviation_help_not_a_native_speaker/hwcezb2/

As a perfectionist, I wanna know all. For example, I feel comfortable in English because I know almost every slangs and swearings. But at least I'm happy about I'm gonna learn some slangs from your channel as well.     And yes, weather should be nice, better wait for it, I'm at Petersburg right now, and after I made the comment above, I went out and now I'm returning home.

15lyrv	I'm not going to tell you to avoid Duolingo but Duolingo shouldn't be your main time investment. You're not speaking the language nearly enough through Duolingo.  I also can't recommend Rosetta Stone. It's a huge waste of money in my opinion. It won't get you started, it'll teach you useless verbs and nouns in what seems like a random order.  If you want to speed up your Russian by paying a little bit of money I can highly recommend Pimsleur. It's a paid subscription app that'll get you speaking immediately and even after a few lessons you know basic sentences. It'll teach you the important stuff first and you'll feel fluent way quicker than the other apps.  I'm not affiliated with Pimsleur, I'm just a big fan. I wasted a lot of time and money on the other apps before really picking up the language using Pimsleur.  The reason I like it is that I commute a lot by car as my job so the 30 minute spoken lessons are perfect for me. It won't teach you to read as well as other approaches, but it'll get you speaking. As for reading you can supplement with Duolingo or buy a book aimed at Russian novices and just spell your way through it.  That being said Russian Made Easy is a perfect starting point, and he has a beginner course for free.	1644505322.0	hwdgprq	t3_sp02i4	t3_sp02i4	/r/russian/comments/sp02i4/im_about_to_start_learning_russian_any_tips/hwdgprq/
