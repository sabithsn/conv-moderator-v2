ky6kn	There's no incentive for the Republicans or Democrats to change how elections work unless there's a threat of vote splitting. If either of the two major parties becomes seriously afraid of vote splitting, then that major party becomes motivated to push for proportional vote allocation (as opposed to first past the post) and/or ranked choice voting. They won't change a system that put them in power unless it's the only way to defeat something that threatens their power going forward.   And I'm not endorsing any particular third party, but I do believe people voting for Third Parties can make a difference in significant enough numbers. Or, at least, their odds of making any sort of impact on policy aren't much worse than the rest of ours. As is, many politicians can do almost anything short of openly cooperating with their opponents (and sometimes even that) without risking their office; they don't really need to listen to voters at all.	1642719395.0	htisndz	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hti7vqc	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htisndz/

They knew once the US soldiers left and were not "occupying" the South any longer they could dictate how blacks were treated.  So they had a pact each man was to be responsible for keeping two black men from voting. There were states in the South were blacks outnumbered whites and if they voted it would not be good for them.

6hkff	This is interesting for sure, but this is about his actions in 1984. Is there anything more recent to suggest that his *current* net worth is understated.  Again, if I was citing celebritynetworth.com I’d have a lot of suspicion that the numbers wouldn’t be accurate lol. But I would expect better from Forbes and assume that they are more on the ball in reporting his net worth, particularly considering his notoriety and whatnot	1642723483.0	htj2k6r	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htixgz5	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htj2k6r/

Yes its bad how he said it but its totally understandable why he did it and it doesn't make him racist. He is racist, don't get me wrong but what if someone insists on a distinction then this shit happens. Then don't insist on the distinction African americans and call yourself  Americans.

Your phrase has only turned off moderates and given Republicans yet another talking point about how Democrats are not the party for law and order, something that incredibly relevant now as crime is spiking.

Every single time Congress has been a fucking disappointment — untold missed opportunities that have damned us for years at this point because clueless olds can’t be bothered to do the most basic research to ask informed questions to steer the direction of technology in this country and abroad.   One of the major shortcomings we have in this country is that Americans and their data are relentlessly exploited by these firms, meanwhile most other countries bar these practices. Why can’t our politicians ensure Americans have control of their own data? Unbelievable.  At a certain point, one has to question whether or not this is all for show, and these people are just heavily in the pocket of the tech firms that they’re questioning.	1642706555.0	hthxar0	t3_s8oqux	t3_s8oqux	/r/politics/comments/s8oqux/the_senate_will_get_its_best_shot_at_regulating/hthxar0/

If you are being prosecuted for a crime by the state, it's a criminal trial.        impeachment is a political process, not a criminal trial.    You can be impeached for nearly anything, some of which aren't crimes. Things such as:   >   - improperly exceeding or abusing the powers of the office;   - behavior incompatible with the function and purpose of the office; and - misusing the office for an improper purpose or for personal gain.

After 3 days of literal hell, my roommate called his sister who is a doctor and they got a nurse to come to my home and treat me with monoclonal antibodies, the next day, EVERY symptom reduced drastically.

dvjcr9pt	Well part of it is the shell game that 'the economy' overall doesn't necessarily mean much to any given individual's personal finances or sense of financial security. Given that there is a widening gap between rich and poor, even people who are well off can still feel an existential pressure or anxiety that their financial future is not secure or otherwise that they're not 'getting ahead' or whatever. (sometimes, irrationally as it may seem, even *more so* in that 'have something to lose' sense)   It's relatively easy to manipulate people's financial anxieties. Lest we forget that a major chunk of Trump's 'economically anxious' base are people who are comfortably middle class but nonetheless become convinced that they are on the knife's edge of losing everything (because of assorted 'theys').   Meanwhile, the sorts of stuff that people *do* feel and pay attention to are gas prices, cost of groceries, costs of eating out etc. so even if 'the economy' at large is doing well by all the metrics Republicans claim are important, if the littler daily life expenses *feel* this way or that way, well people just go with that, or are at least easily convinced to. Like you can have someone who can fully afford to pay $100 to fill up their truck or whatever and they're still able to save and they still have discretionary spending and they're 'fine' but because $100 > the $65 they paid when they first got it, they plant their heels that everything is falling apart and they're falling behind and everything is bad etc.   It's pretty dumb but it it's hard to escape, too.   I think it is fair to assess that there are deep structural issues with who the economy works for and who benefits the most when the numbers look good and who hurts the most when the numbers look bad. This creates, or at least motivates, a lot of justifiable resentment and anger and makes people particularly vulnerable to hearing whatever explanations will tell them it's not their fault or that they'd be getting ahead if not for those dirty thems over there or whatever.   But yeah, all that aside, Republicans still never engage with the discussion in good faith, nor do they have any practical solutions or answers, and their track record is shit.	1643313581.0	huhewka	t3_sdysvf	t1_hufs3pc	/r/politics/comments/sdysvf/us_economy_grew_57_percent_in_2021_fastest/huhewka/

wbfpo	I think the general idea is that its ok lean away from strictly merit based decision for now at least until the imbalance is remedied. Once we have some equal representation and oppression by race is put in its place then we can go back to strictly merit based decisions.  sometimes too its not just about who got the highest grade in the class, its who got a grade that may not be as high but took more perserverance and struggle to achieve. if I am given all the opportunities in the world to succeed, it can still be impressive to get the A+, but it can be even more impressive if I was given all the opportunities to fail and still got the A-.	1643314044.0	huhg62a	t3_se42a4	t1_huh9o6f	/r/politics/comments/se42a4/the_right_is_losing_its_mind_at_the_idea_of_a/huhg62a/
