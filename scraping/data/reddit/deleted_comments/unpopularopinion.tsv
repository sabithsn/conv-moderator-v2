3hr58rn	Sister in law has small mental issues. She will yell and act like an asshole because something triggers her from her past. It doesn't even have to be anything specific. She can just be sitting there staring at a wall and bam, tantrum fest. She is aware of this. She is capable of working and taking care of herself. Without those triggers she will seem she was normal.   I get that she has that issue but she refuses to get any help. She has meds she refuses to take, she doesn't want to seek proffesional help either. Yet, when she throws tantrums where she destroys stuff, calls you names, and screams her heart out, she has said we know how she is and should just ignore her and deal with it.   I could care less for any of her issues because she refuses to seek any help for them. If she at least did, I would understand and tolerate the tantrums.	1640870181.0	hqjjlcn	t3_rrtlon	t3_rrtlon	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rrtlon/mentally_or_physically_handicapped_people_can_be/hqjjlcn/

Luckily I didn't actually break my ankle, it was sprained but I thought it broke because it hurt like crazy. My group was almost at the peak of a small mountain hike when it happened. I wanted to head back down and seek medical help. The "optimist" of the group was adamant that we continue up because the peak was only about another hour away.

47yw12co	I have read nearly all the responses. Thank you all for sharing your opinions. Now I have a better idea where people are coming from when they are bashing boomers. However I still think that greed and resisting to change, especially when you are old, cannot be attributed to a generation. Without regulations, capitalism is set-up to reward the greedy. The regulations on greed maybe removed in their era, but if you believe in Marx that removal is bound to happen because some players (people who accumulate the wealth) in the game are stronger than the others and they tilt the rules for their favor. It is a cycle, when natural adversity is fought off then comes the human  greed! I also understand the frustration around the “slow” societal change especially when the resistance comes from the older legislators. For that it is still the system to blame, voice of the change is muffled in the theater of two-party “democracy”. It is stupid to bundle all colors of political spectrum into two. Just unite against the rigged system and ignore the current actors, as long as we keep the system as is, the gen abcdxyz will be the next greedy actors in the game and the cycle will continue.	1640880181.0	hqk4y4h	t3_rrcwvr	t3_rrcwvr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rrcwvr/boomers_are_not_the_enemy/hqk4y4h/

wdpw3	I did this for a while. I found the brand and cut of my absolute favorite jeans and bought three pairs. Then I found plain black, long-sleeve t-shirts. Again, favorite brand and fit. I bought like five of those. Same situation on the socks and underwear. Splurged a little and got nicer stuff.  I really liked it. Getting ready was super fast and easy and I think the effect at work was positive. I'm not sure how to explain it... I think it upped the already existing view that my work was consistent and good quality.  I did it for about two years and bought a few replacement shirts along the way (that's the *real* lesson — when clothes are worn, let them go. There's nothing more pathetic than someone 40+ wearing rags) but ultimately some new styles caught my eye and I moved on from it.	1640881790.0	hqk8yj2	t3_rrzdfq	t3_rrzdfq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rrzdfq/wearing_the_same_set_of_outfits_for_the_rest_of/hqk8yj2/

9a0oqfpi	For decades people from small towns have flocked to big cities. They drove up the cost of living and forced the children who grew up there to move to the outskirts. People flock to the city to fulfill a fantasy life and then look down their nose at others who grew up there. The wealthy pay for their children to live in coveted neighborhoods. They purchase affordable housing for their kids. This is only part of some of the reasons people from major cities leave for smaller towns because they can no longer afford the place they grew up.   I’m sorry your way of life is changing but, this has been long overdue.

5nk2jtnq	I'm a blues guy. I see where you're coming from. But it does sound like you're talking about one type of blues -- listen to the early stuff at the intersection of folk like Elizabeth Cotten, Mississippi John Hurt, Junior Kimbrough.   I think the philosophy behind the twelve bar blues thing you're describing is, "let's boil the harmony down to the simplest possible framework that supports the lead instrument." That's really the point -- the focus isn't on the progression, but on the expression of the lead guitar or vocal. If you say the solo is always the same, well, that's the fault of the guitarist. Derek Trucks was a good recommendation: https://youtu.be/X1n6PgSC6IQ	1640887200.0	hqkn774	t3_rljwub	t3_rljwub	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rljwub/blues_music_is_boring_and_unoriginal/hqkn774/

2j3pnyao	It's our evolutionary response. We are hard-wired to encourage reproduction, so it may not be personal.  Having said that, there is some weigh to the argument that being childless might add to loneliness. Children give you the excuse to meet other parents, teachers, birthdays, doctors (vaccinations, checkups), ... basically force you to interact with more people.  Then one day, they will have partners, bigger family,  and their own kids.  Life can get lonely without kids as you get old. People with kids tend to invite parents who have kids.  I say this as someone who doesn't have kids, but I do think about these things.	1640901048.0	hqlmvt2	t3_rsceyc	t3_rsceyc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsceyc/saying_you_want_to_remain_child_free_should_be/hqlmvt2/

As for the reasons for not having kids, some may have unprocessed childhood trauma or may not have lived in healthy family relationships so unconsciously they fear & don't want their kids to go through the same.  There may be financial reasons, career, etc. Others feel they need to have kids despite the trauma so they can give the life to their kids which they never had.

At older age, people tend to become alienated and friends get busy with their own lives; having kids / grand kids may be your only source of human connection. If people have strong networking which would last them into senior years or they have a personality where being alone is actually a positive, they may be ok without kids.

b36t4yrq	Telling women that they don't need to be flawless in order to be attractive isn't bringing women down.   Wait, hang on... Oh God, you're a femitard. Yeah there's no point in trying to reason with feminists.   See, here's the difference: men feel ugly because most women won't find them attractive. Women feel ugly because the top 10% of men don't find them attractive.   Just, stop listening to Anita Sarkeesian and all the other ugly feminists who are making money off you by pretending to be oppressed, and live your life.   You wanna be attractive? Put on some yoga pants or a good pair of jeans and I guarantee you someone will find you attractive. It may not be a guy in the top 10% of men, but plenty of guys will.	1640911720.0	hqmcyw9	t3_rsfye4	t1_hqmaelm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsfye4/9_times_out_of_10_being_ugly_is_a_choice/hqmcyw9/

It's kind of how we have hyper inflation currently. Spending more money than the government has and printing to make up the difference.  You should really start thinking of inflation as a hidden tax anytime you come up with an idea for free anything. Ultimately it isn't free.  Do you like the idea of your savings having 10% or even 15% less purchasing power next year? Keep writing blank government checks for programs and we'll get to that point.

em3kx	Better be beat by a parent who is present and cares than the abuse that goes in the western world foster homes, which includes sexual abuse. They are always ready to call cps because some parent beat a child within reason. Then this kid is bounced from foster home to foster home being abused at every point, when they turn 18 they are thrown to the streets where they turn to drugs and prostitution and crime. It doesn’t make sense. Whenever someone says on here that they grew up in foster care, it’s alway am so sorry you had to go through that.  If someone says they that a neighbor is struggling with feeding or raising their kids or someone saw them yelling at the kids, the advice is call CPS, of which they will be sorry about anyone growing in foster care later	1640915334.0	hqml426	t3_rsbtx4	t1_hqmejod	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsbtx4/teenagers_are_unruly_because_parents_deliberately/hqml426/

10snjk	I'm not disputing the claim but not all companies are going to compress identically. Or even try to compress the files. Some companies intentionally utilize file size bloat to monopolize drives.  If you only have space for 4 games on your console, you're going to play more of those four games; full stop. The more you play a single game, the more storefronts within the game can be pushed on you.   Instead of bouncing between 15 games and being more inclined to remove some to add others, you're opened up to more advertisements for further transactions among the only 4 that might fit on your drive.   "I haven't played Shooter Man 9000 in a while, but I'll probably come back to it and I won't want to install 200 flapperjabs of data again, so I'm definitely not removing THAT one."

7rl19	Don’t be too hard on yourself. I disagree.  I think hard disk space is a silly thing to worry about, and they should instead focus on AI and gameplay. Having dabbled with 3D art, I would run the other way if a job was specifying that assets (meshes, textures, normal maps, etc.) had to be even more compressed than they already are.  Also, real-time rendering is pretty impressive as is, but it really depends on the genre and setting.  Having the level of detail you see in current Gen fighters in open-world games would be fucking rad. Also, higher poly counts on foliage and environmental assets.  We’ll get there inevitably, but it’s going to take advances in game engines and hardware together.	1640926419.0	hqn8el2	t3_rsfgtv	t1_hqm372q	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsfgtv/graphics_in_video_games_are_good_enough_we_need/hqn8el2/

Same with boxers, I found a pair I really liked so bought a bunch of them.   --   It makes getting dressed super simple, I could do it in the dark.

I'm no longer cutting edge, but 3950x, 2x SLI 2080 TIs, 32gb ram, decent mobo, etc ran around 3.5k at the time without counting the monitor/case/etc. Most recent games at 4k max settings will regularly dip to 40fps, even just looking around without a bunch of particles.

Maybe it is true and you have to do a bunch of fine tuning or something, but I bought basically the best rig of the last generation and can't get near those fps people claim, even with ~15% overclocking etc.	1640930800.0	hqng7rb	t3_rsfgtv	t1_hqnd37x	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsfgtv/graphics_in_video_games_are_good_enough_we_need/hqng7rb/

8eh03	Yeah I don't disagree on SLI being a waste nowadays, I won't be getting multiple cards in the future. I still have trouble getting constant 60+ fps at 4k with max normal settings with ray tracing turned off in most newer games, and even some older ones like Control and Kingdom Come Deliverance. I overclocked both cpu and gpu ~15% and still regularly dip into the 40s for maybe 25% of the game time. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or have something mis-configured, but in my experience if you need the frame rate, just go with 1440p and you're guaranteed that sweet constant 120+fps no problems on max.	1640931555.0	hqnhgnc	t3_rsfgtv	t1_hqngos9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsfgtv/graphics_in_video_games_are_good_enough_we_need/hqnhgnc/

ld53i	Being conventionally popular or mainstream isn't indicative of talent, only popularity which nowadays encompasses more of celebrity status and lifestyle than pure musical output and that's probably your point of contention. You can find some of the most talented musicians of all time (in my opinion) on Youtube nowadays and they're technically as popular as bands had been back in the 80's (reaching a certain number of millions of subscribers/views roughly being parallel to albums sold, this is hard because the industry is so different with the internet).  The argument "What's popular doesn't appeal to me" is always present for someone, somewhere. Back in the 80's, my mom was listening to Elvis and didn't like Led Zeppelin. The cultural zeitgeist is the cultural zeitgeist, we may not always agree with it being so but if the majority does and we're in the minority, we're not in the position to decide that. It's democratic, people want *simple* music. There's a reason the most popular movies or most popular forms of any art aren't the most technically impressive or deep -- the simplicity appeals to the largest number of people.	1640935077.0	hqnmt5o	t3_rsnryj	t1_hqnmaek	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsnryj/most_toplevel_music_stars_of_today_are_just/hqnmt5o/

ld53i	Well the technology has changed. People don't really play instruments any more, it's more to do with performances/show. Artists that seem low-effort can also be far more like audio engineers who focus on production, tone, and performance rather than physical prowess -- they capture feeling and invoke it, especially live. Many people also paint with a computer mouse instead of a paintbrush nowadays, I don't think it's inherently lazy though it does still suck to hear Kanye West called the same thing as Jimi Hendrix as if they're remotely close when they couldn't be more different in approach and method.  I could easily say "It's all been downhill since Liszt and Paganini tbh" but the reality is that more people are capable of playing Liszt and Paganini today than ever before. So the talent and capacity is out there, it's just not what casual music listeners like my 10-year-old niece, middle age sister and 55 year-old mom are all likely to enjoy. They don't care how fast of staccato that Jascha Heifetz could do with a violin bow, they don't understand why I was obsessed with Jimi Hendrix as a teen or why I listen to Erik Mongrain and Thomas Leeb who just play percussive acoustic guitar with no singing or lyrics, etc.  One thing though: performances nowadays are wild. That's what casual people really want/like it seems. I've been to a couple mainstream "popular" concerts in the last few years of very popular people and while I'm not into the music and I can't say it was the same as seeing TOOL live, the performances are *leagues above* what they used to be.	1640936622.0	hqnoyke	t3_rsnryj	t1_hqnnfn4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsnryj/most_toplevel_music_stars_of_today_are_just/hqnoyke/

Trying to stay on the same wavelength with other people was exhausting though, so I had to put up shields and learn to feel for myself.     I do occassionally reflect the energy you give me though and a lot of the time it's the bad stuff.

Sure the government and laws have flaws, like literally every other government out there.  ---  I'll assume all these downvotes are either people who've never been here (proving my point) or my fellow Americans who love me so much (also proving my point).	1640936973.0	hqnpfya	t3_rsol5j	t3_rsol5j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsol5j/united_state_is_one_big_scam/hqnpfya/
ld53i	> Seems like it is most expensive existence ever  If that were true it wouldn't be sustainable for 330 million people. The economy not being collapsed is itself evidence that the system; no matter how unfair it seems in some parts; does work *to some extent*. The cost of living can be high but generally wages do reflect this to balance it out, it's just that particular industries that don't have unions or have been taken advantage of by lobbying (being kept at minimum wage for the past two decades and etc) are objectively disadvantaged and exploited, yeah.	1640937443.0	hqnq2zl	t3_rsol5j	t1_hqnpmo1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsol5j/united_state_is_one_big_scam/hqnq2zl/

ld53i	Well I think it's tied to having voiced dialogue lines, honestly. If you had to supply the same number of options as New Vegas or FO3 and account for all the skill check optionals, the amount of dialogue from the protagonist would be 3 - 4x the amount it ended up being. So it seemed like a clear design choice from the very beginning but I disliked that I was taken out of a world where I could be anything and put into a world where I'm either the good guy, the reluctant good guy, or the sarcastic good guy.  I'm not saying I always want to play as a sociopath but that is one of the core draws that made me fall in love with Bethesoft/Bethesda games. The fact I could as a kid be an outlaw in Morrowind then pass the controller to my cousin and watch him play as a Clark Kent cosplayer, or that in The Pitt DLC you could hit a 10-dialogue chain of really dark humor explaining to someone that you found their loved one (who was dead on arrival) in agonizing pain and you wanted to save them the misery so you shot them, but that didn't do it, so you had to try and use a big rock, but that didn't do it, so you had to try and ____, etc. I wouldn't have fallen in love with the games if not for that core part.  I have no issue with voiced characters as long as the story itself doesn't suffer from it, which it probably always will unless you make the explicit decision to focus on keeping that same incredibly satisfying dialogue from previous entries.  For the record, I loved FO4 despite all the controversy. I literally took a week off work on release, I loved the crafting and weapon mods (though unarmed was absurdly overlooked compared to all previous games and it's always my favorite), the power armor overhaul, the environment and settlements, etc. I loved most of it but I strongly disliked the dialogue revamp.	1640939509.0	hqnst9b	t3_rsp333	t1_hqns3m4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsp333/i_liked_the_voiced_protagonist_in_fo4/hqnst9b/

What you fail to realize is that a person born into abject poverty will be comfortable with that, its all they know. Theyre used to having wet socks and eating cereal all day everyday. It is you who is used to something else so you cannot imagine how you could live that way anf youre projecting that. Additionally, I know for a fact people who have chosen to be homeless. Because they were friends with other homeless people who lived in tents and they used to go drinking down there with them all the time and eventually moved down there and live as a homeless person now too. You need to understand that is all a lot of these people are capable of, and that makes them happy. All they want to do is drink with their friends down by the park and live life that way. There are enough rescources to get out of homelessness should somebody choose that path, for the most part, they like it there drinking with their friends and thats the culture they fit in to.	1641120056.0	hqx6uzi	t3_ru3m50	t3_ru3m50	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ru3m50/no_one_wants_to_be_homeless_the_idea_that/hqx6uzi/

The world is full of children and I'm sure many of them are lovely, but I don't want to raise those children. I want to raise mine. The pregnancy part is also important, for some reason. I wouldn't want to do surrogacy even if the kid was genetically mine.   Personally I find it odd that anyone has to explain or justify this. It's like being told 'you like men, so why would you not marry that guy standing at the corner?' I've never heard anti-bio kids sentiment in the real world, only on reddit.

4zm84n2o	The cost of college is insane.  Of course, progressives have played a huge role in that--every college employs several to several dozen DEI officers and staff at high cost who do nothing but perpetuate ineffective programs.  Colleges don't like to disclose their administrative costs, so they bury them, but some of the major universities have spent over $100m on a single program.  It's safe to say students and taxpayers are spending billions on ideological signaling crap that does nothing to further education.  You want campus diversity?  Cut all these DEI staff and programs and pass the savings on to students.  Finding every sensible way to make college less expensive is the best way to make school an option for minority students.  Of course, the same woke progressives who want their debt canceled don't want to hear this--more than a few of them are actually going to school specifically to get DEI jobs and add to the same administrative bloat that helped saddle them with excessive debt in the first place.	1641120990.0	hqx7zj2	t3_rtrwx2	t3_rtrwx2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rtrwx2/high_college_debt_is_your_fault/hqx7zj2/

One may argue that a child may be beaten and no matter how many screams to stop, they have no power to decline.  One may argue that a child may be starved to death, simply because they cannot consent to eat.

Maybe it's just maintaining so much of that style rendered in just clean, flawless CG that looks weird to me.	1641121478.0	hqx8kof	t3_rtsrqa	t1_hqw1r2e	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rtsrqa/i_cant_stand_disneys_most_recent_3d_art_style/hqx8kof/

16huav	I think they're relying on the Disney formula a bit too much as well in their stories.  All these stories hit the beats fairly well, so I don't think I can consider any of them a bad movie by any means, but I really wish they'd take risks once in a while. Most kids are more than capable of understanding more complex, varied stories.

We love each other to bits but it has been a huge challenge when their first ever kiss wasn't what they expected from movies, where it's portrayed as an instant love orgasm and some sort of unique feeling. Ummm it's just skin on skin with a bit of saliva and movement, what did you expect??? It's the feeling of closeness that makes it special but you need to make that in your head: no one has magic lips to blow your mind if you can't blow you own fucking mind.

1lhep764	I will never get the need for the use of pronouns.   There are times where they are acceptable: Like when you become friends with someone, or just know that you will be talking for a long time/more than once, then they are ok, if the person really feels the need for them.  But almost every other time they are not needed and only get in the way of the conversation. I don't know if I am just unlucky with these things, but this happened to me in multiple occasions. It happens either when you just want to ask someone a quick question either online or irl, and instead of people just answering your question they either try to "correct" you or outright get mad because you didn't call them the right way.  It may be because I am from a really slavic (if you have no idea what that means, basically think almost russian) family and formal speach wasn't heard in my home, but either way I will never get the need for pronouns. "It is just so people would feel more pleasent when being talked to", ok and? I would probably also feel more pleasent if everybody called me sir or something. I just feel like people or too soft these days, especially people my age and younger (I am 19 (and please, none of those "You are just pretending to be mature" comments. I really am not, I still laugh at the dumbest stuff. But since the first time that I heard of them, "new" pronouns were always the dumbest possible thing that I have ever seen)).  If I want to ask for something and I have never met you, I will use the pronouns that fit you the most based on your appearence. If you look like a guy I will use he/him, if you look like a girl I will use she/her. If I really can't tell I will use they/them. But never in my life will I use some shit like ze/zer or anything else that special people come up with to make themselves feel better by being "unique". "What if your friend would like to be called xe/xer?" I am sorry, but I really can't imagine myself being friends with a person who won't speak to me unless I use some dumb made up words to address them.	1641130747.0	hqxl4s7	t3_rr0obg	t3_rr0obg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rr0obg/lgbtq_mega_thread/hqxl4s7/

i9ont	Well, you like the flavor of fish so I guess I can understand what you are saying. I realize that old fish can smell and taste terrible. I'm not denying that. However, what I'm saying is that what you perceive as a mild fish flavor in fresh fish, to me that flavor is amplified to the point of tasting like the fish that you describe as fishy or bad.   We all have unique taste buds and some flavors can be very offputting for a subset of people. To me, that flavor is fish and seafood and any bitter leafy greens.	1641134559.0	hqxs06n	t3_rua8x2	t1_hqxr4da	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rua8x2/saying_that_fresh_fish_isnt_fishy_is_fucking/hqxs06n/

Taking out the dramatic proportions of the example I am about to give, it is like "having a child and losing them." Yeah, you can have another child later, but that's not a replacement for your first!  In the case of food, you can find several other incredibly delicious things in the world, but none of them are a substitute for that other thing you loved.

cpwq12x6	Yes I agree, if you've had an account long enough, eventually you're likely to have said something in your past that doesn't exactly reflect the best on you. It's also likely that over time you drop little tidbits of info that creeps could use to call you out or worse, even ID you if you aren't careful.   I've had a few accounts, some with a ton of post history and karma, that I've deleted because it just felt like the history became more of a liability than I wanted. Especially if you're using your account as a tool in some kind of project, you don't want that tied to a crazy controversial conversation you had a couple years back.   I have a tiny YouTube channel for example that I started pushing on an old account and then realized, supposing the channel were to take off, that my name and face would now be connected to this reddit account where I have expressed all kinds of personal opinions/details/crude humor. I also post a lot on a sub that is related to my professional life, so that is an issue if someone is able to identify you with malicious intent.	1641141023.0	hqy6e54	t3_rubnrp	t3_rubnrp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rubnrp/reddit_needs_to_allow_users_to_make_their_history/hqy6e54/

I lead a rather private life, and don't want to offer hundreds of strangers a glimpse of it. I have no interest in the gaze or admiration of others on the internet.

264y0ytn	I've been struggling lately because I don't know how to actually find new music. I will say "music sucks now", but what I really mean is that I don't like the pop music that I hear every time I turn on the radio.  Every now and then, I'll hear something I like from a video game, TV show, or movie. Other than that, I'm a slave to the YouTube / Spotify algorithms which mostly just show me covers of songs I've already heard.  So yeah, I think today's music is bad and I listen to the same old stuff on repeat, but it's because I have no clue how to find new music that I like and the algorithms only show me things that I've listened to before.	1642545527.0	ht8nd38	t3_s73jmz	t3_s73jmz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht8nd38/

I don’t think I’d ever live in a tiny home though…they’re too small and I’d don’t think I’d ever be able to fit all my stuff in one. But anyways, aren’t tiny homes smaller than trailer home?

I doubt you've listened as much as they haven't.   When I say uninformed, you weren't there. You did not experience it (originally).

fv9hmia0	I can see where you’re coming from, but as an introvert, I have a couple of thoughts to share   introvert is simply a term referring to where someone lies on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. it more has to do with how someone gets their social energy. there’s no value or moral judgment attached to either inherently. it just simply *is*.   personally, I’m happy to be an introvert. I can be plenty social (for my own standards) and just happen to need that recharge time after being social around lots of people. I can be around lots of people if I’m just running errands in a city environment, even around lots of people. but if i need to socialize for an extended period, i will prob need that recharge c:	1642549452.0	ht8x48z	t3_s7007i	t3_s7007i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7007i/pointing_out_that_someone_is_introverted_is/ht8x48z/

Doesn’t mean every single song is bad, but they reuse the same backing track and most of these people are not musicians and merely just a performer. That is primarily what makes up the music industry right now. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but personally I do not enjoy any of it. Sometimes I even like the singer and see a lot of potential in them if they were to switch genres.

The words they stand for become more of a subtitle, and their acronym becomes more like a name of a company.  And often, it's more about the reverse. They just need a name for their organization, and fit the words to make it an acronym, as they don't want their title to seem completely meaningless. Similar to how a company may be given a name, and an acronym is added on just to make it seem neat.	1642550877.0	ht90iw9	t3_s60yca	t1_ht77bee	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s60yca/acronyms_shouldnt_exclude_small_words_like_of_and/ht90iw9/

But a businessman can do something great for society by providing services to you though, and their managers make sure that the operation continues to run smoothly to service the population and give consumers what they want.

5j1i2	I guess this was considered too political even though it was just about the naming of a potential war and not about the war instelf  "A war between Russia and NATO is not automatically World War 3"   I don't think it's going to happen in the first place, but if it does I'm gonna be fucking livid if we call it World War 3.  Just because it's a large scale war does not make it a World War. It could even have more causalities than World War 1 and 2 combined and it still wouldn't be a World War. If it's contained in Russia or near Russia and there's only 1 (albeit very large) front against 1 country and its satellites it's not a World War, it's just a very large war. Call it the Russo-American war/Ukrainian-Russo war/NATO Intervention in Ukraine, whatever, but not WW3. Just because a bunch of countries across the world are teaming up on one country in one front doesn't mean it's a "world war" otherwise the Korean War would have been "World War 3" among a few other instances of large coalitions teaming up with each other against 1 country.  Of course if China or some other major power joins on Russia's side and invaded Taiwan or something THEN it would be World War 3 and that would be totally fair, but if it's just Russia on one side in one major front, then it's simply not WW3."	1642555396.0	ht9az7v	t3_s1yw9p	t3_s1yw9p	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s1yw9p/politics_mega_thread/ht9az7v/

Softball is dope as there’s lots of down time between, anyone can really play, and lots of team spots so opportunities to meet new people. Want something more one on one? Take boxing or martial art, or yoga. They even have quidditch, in a lot of big cities.   Hate sports like art? Join an art class. Painting, sketching, photography, poetry whatever. You’ll have assignments most force team work or recommend it. Or a music class learn a new instrument.   Hate art and sports? Join a club. Book club, or TV clubs are available a lot. Most are offered at libraries. Or advertised there. You could go see guest speakers at events, or read a book together. Watch a show together or join something more niche like anime, comics, or art films.   There’s board game or card game events at different hobby shops. All kinds of options.   Hate all of that? Then check out local spaces for other things that may be interesting and posted at coffee shops or libraries. Check online at Craigslist or Facebook in your area. Or join a Reddit Meetup.   It’s tricky with the pandemic but there’s online courses and classes as well. Chess clubs or gaming clubs. Learn a new language.   The issue is that all these things take motivation and time. Online has made it easy to communicate instantly with anyone about anything no matter how intimate in a moment. But to build that with people in person you need to put in the time.	1642569159.0	hta4mhn	t3_s7bf6j	t1_ht91hke	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7bf6j/adulthood_is_so_incredibly_lonely/hta4mhn/

Next, you will need to work on accepting the realities of adulthood and being on your own--work, bills, responsibilities, carving out leisure time and seeking out friendships.

9zzga	I don’t think this is ALL on the artist. I get your point. But as everyone else has noted, the way we consume music has changed in a pretty fundamental way and so have the settings. Festivals and live show experiences are just aren’t what the “art” is all about anymore. You’re right a lot of modern artists don’t translate well  to stage…but they do to tik tok and reddit and tiny desk and a host of other mediums. Often that cliche “rockstar” persona may not have been the goal. They didn’t imagine themselves getting past the computer screen because they are just focused on making the music. However it happens. The result IMO is a better end product and variety that collectively beats the hell out of a lot of “career” musicians discographies. It makes me a little sad that live performances are a bit less grand and lineups are more watered down - but there are still enough who do prioritize the stage to keep me going and honestly what has a more consistent/more valuable role in my life, the Spotify and YouTube music that gets me through the day or the bi weekly concert with an exuberant front man and sidekick shredder I’ve seen a million times?

72vakbny	honestly i didn't even read all of this but i came here to say this is judgmental because some people suffer from mental disorders that make them paranoid. whether they are aware of it or not. even simply having anxiety can lead to paranoid thoughts like these. they are not "crazy" they are mentally ill and that is 100% okay. we need to start normalizing getting help for people who think like this instead of shaming them.	1642584825.0	htarfl8	t3_s7m6xw	t3_s7m6xw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7m6xw/its_very_unlikely_that_anyone_is_actually/htarfl8/
72vakbny	you're taking everything i said and turning it around.   he's saying "these crazy people" that's so fucking rude and it's not okay for people to be referring to other people like this! where is the empathy? no one is crazy that word is derogatory. people can be mentally ill. and as a psychologist YOU of all people should know that. the post was written to be offensive and that's why i had a problem.  when i say it's okay to be mentally ill, i mean it's a valid reason to have paranoid thoughts, im not saying that it's "okay to be untreated". you're choosing to take what i say and turn it around, and as a psychologist you know EXACTLY what you're doing.   you want to be the old school "oh stop with your sensitive bullshit" person and cool go ahead. but what im not going to stand for is the constant belittling that people with mental illness go through.   these people aren't CHOOSING to think self centered, they can't necessarily help it.  as a psychologist, why don't you do better? because you sound like every other shit head in the world when you clearly have the schooling and training to be better than that. you're horse shit.	1642585783.0	htasm9i	t3_s7m6xw	t1_htas3y4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7m6xw/its_very_unlikely_that_anyone_is_actually/htasm9i/

My wife’s dad and my dad have the same friends from college, we didn’t even know it till we got engaged.

Sometimes I spend half the day procrastinating then do a bit of extra work in off-hours to make up for it. Stressful deadlines can still pop up, but overall it feels fairly chill.

i36a887b	The fact that you don’t give a damn about “fancy presentation” and can find a mom and pop place with good food has literally 0 bearing on why other people go to Michelin restaurants.  Do you think people go to Michelin star restaurants because they are value hunting and don’t care “about fancy presentation?”  They go there because they want the experience. This includes fancy presentation. It often includes a renowned chef.  Also, are you familiar with the term “standards”?  I don’t mean having standards that are higher or lower. I mean in terms of having certain restraint and guidelines a restaurant needs to abide by.  Michelin rating imposes a set of standards that restaurants either adhere to or do not. People who put merit into that rigorous set of standards, go to Michelin reactants.  I live in NYC. We have many Michelin and non Michelin restaurants.  I went to a Michelin restaurant with my family after I graduated law school.  I went to hill country bbq for brisket and a beer with my gf when we wanted a casual date.  Not an unpopular opinion. Just a subjective take on something don’t value, and then somehow construe as a scam.

The second store, fuck those toilets. I'd be sitting down and barely move and those things would flush like 30 times during my 5 minute shit.   Unfortunately though they're probably going to become the norm for public restrooms. Too many people either don't flush their business, or don't wash their hands. Having everything automatic, sinks and air dryers too, just helps keep things a little less nasty from the animals out there.	1642536013.0	ht7xot7	t3_s6xsl7	t3_s6xsl7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s6xsl7/automatic_flushing_toilets_are_the_scourge_of_the/ht7xot7/
7wqcz44m	It absolutely is a value judgment because there’s literally nothing written anywhere that defines what a true fan is or how a true fan behaves. This type of language is objectively meaningless and is only ever used to promote one’s personal views on the matter.	1642536660.0	ht7ze6h	t3_s73jmz	t1_ht7mhr6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht7ze6h/
7wqcz44m	What exactly do you mean by “bad”? What makes a piece of music objectively bad or good?	1642536816.0	ht7ztc4	t3_s73jmz	t1_ht7g6wj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht7ztc4/
i36a887b	Honestly, explaining to me how I can categorize different levels of music fans is pretty gatekeepery.  Also, why are you so invested in this?   You are just not understanding what I am saying and you’re getting weirdly defensive.  If you prefer certain specific types of music, then you are a fan, maybe even a true fan, of those specific types of music.  But the concept of music is a broad one. A basic estimate is that 41 broad genres of music exist with approximately 338 sub genres.  Liking 3 out of 41 means you are not a true fan of the broad notion known as music.   My music teacher in high school was a true music fan. They were interested and wanted to learn about ALL 41 genres.  Again - if you prefer certain types of music only. Then you are probably a true fan, or a serious fan, of a die hard fan, of THOSE genres. Like I am a true fan of rap music.   You understand that rap music is a smaller subset right?   It would be idiotic for someone to say, “I am a true music fan. I only listen to reggae.” That makes you a true fan of a specific subgenre. Not of music, broadly, as it has been described to encompass 41 genres.   The way you take me describing the specificity of someone’s frame of knowledge as some sort of value judgment or personal challenges says a lot about you as a person.  Show me where I said I am better than other people because I am a true music fan. Quote me. You can’t because I didn’t. You have inferred that incorrectly. And I have explained the fact that you’re incorrect. Rather than just saying “oh I thought you meant it this way.” You laboriously continue to argue with me that I meant something that I didn’t mean. Why?	1642536828.0	ht7zuli	t3_s73jmz	t1_ht7y6l1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht7zuli/
i36a887b	Then quote me. I’m waiting.  How is it that you know so much about the meaning of the words I used in a comment? More than I do?   It’s actually ironic because you are attacking the words I used “true fan” and saying that the way I meant them is that I am better than everyone who isn’t a true fan and that I explicitly meant it that way and as a judgment.  Then you follow up by saying that this type of language is objectively meaningless.  So which is it? Did I mean something specific that only you are sure of and that no matter how much I say in contrary, you are right and I am wrong and it meant that specific thing you say. Or is the term “objectively meaningless.”  You and your other sweaty friends keep making all these accusations yet downvote and slink away when I ask you to quote me.  So quote me. Where did I use the language to promote my own personal views.  I have rephrased it and re explained ad nauseum That I meant “true” as in the opposite of “casual.”  I used it to define a degree of intensity with which an individual cares about music.   You are telling me I actually didn’t mean that.  So quote me or pipe the fuck down.	1642537073.0	ht80iqi	t3_s73jmz	t1_ht7ze6h	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht80iqi/
i36a887b	Like even if I misused the adjective “true” in the sense I used it.  I have explained what I meant three times.  Meanwhile a kid is telling me I am like constructing a world where there is a hierarchy and I have created a specific rubric placing me at the top of the hierarchy and everyone else is beneath me.  Like homie, put the phone down and go get a massage.	1642537423.0	ht81hiw	t3_s73jmz	t1_ht811v0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht81hiw/
i36a887b	I’m not gatekeeping.  I have explained it 6 times. I used the word true as an antonym for casual.  Not true, like you must do these specific things I say or else you aren’t a real fan.  True as in, extreme, actual, significant.   Like I said above: it is idiotic for a person to say “I am a true music fan. I only listen to reggae.” It would make more sense to say, “I am a true music fan. I listen to all 41 genres of music and attempt to learn more about all of the sub genres.” That is not a value judgment. That is a description of someone’s degree of knowledge and level of interest.  What I find to be very gatekeepery and honestly super weird. Is how I made a comment off handed while I was literally taking a shit at work. Told in response I am gatekeeping or creating a hierarchy where I hVe situated myself at the top and all else beneath me (lol). Then I have gone on to explain and clarify and provide answer, all while continuously being told that I meant something different than I meant.   A lot of you weirdos need to put your phones down. People should be able to use casual language in a message forum without you taking it as a personal challenge to your egos or manhood or level of knowledge.  Many people enjoy and know much more than I about music. At the same time, I listen to broad swaths of music.  It doesn’t make them better than me. And it doesn’t make me better than those who listen to less than me.  If you are quick to infer someone thinks they are better than you based on a word or casual language I think it says a lot more about you and your mental state.	1642537810.0	ht82jyr	t3_s73jmz	t1_ht7s74u	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht82jyr/

aaqpyyp	I used to subscribe to Rolling Stone back in the late 90s, early 2000s.      I was always infuriated by their "Top 100 Rock albums" or "Top 200 albums" lists because they were just packed full of bands from the 60s and 70s with a small representation of 80s albums and like 3 albums from the 90s.     It was absolutely clear that the editors supervising the list were the boomers who clearly didn't pay much attention to all the rock and roll that happened after the "golden age" of the 60s and 70s. It was doubly funny because of how many albums they chose for the top 100 that were derivatives or poor imitations of other albums on that same list. Rather than listen to new stuff and acknowledge the innovation, they deliberately chose copycat records from their favorite decade of music.	1642538978.0	ht85rb2	t3_s73jmz	t3_s73jmz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/ht85rb2/

7wqcz44m	"How is it that you know so much about the meaning of the words I used in a comment? More than I do?"  That's a pretty typical and intellectually dishonest response. We all use language and we're all very familiar with how it's commonly used. If you want to start deviating from those norms and start using language or terminology in a way that's not the widely understood definitions, not only should you define exactly how you're using these terms, but you should also be justifying that definition and explaining why these words are appropriate to use in place of more appropriate ones.  The view that a "true" music fan is one that listens to all sorts of music from all genres and time periods is purely your own personal view, as is the view that a "casual" music fan is one who doesn't do these things. If you want to argue that point, please show me some objective source of information that suggests that these are the lines along which this distinction ought to be made. Also "casual" is not the opposite of "true".  Something more along the lines of "false" or "inauthentic" would be the opposite of "true" depending on the context. You don't personally get to decide what words mean when they have established definitions. By using the term "true music fan" it's safe to infer that you are either saying "real music fan" (as in they actually exist) or "authentic music fan", which would basically make those opposite "casual" music fans either "not real music fans" or "inauthentic music fans".  Also, you keep trying to make this an objective thing by suggesting that you're only attempting to "define a degree of intensity with which an individual cares about music", but who says that the "degree of intensity with which an individual cares" is measured by the amount of genres or music periods that you are personally interested in or enjoy listening to? If you had to listen to and enjoy literally every single type of music out there, there would likely be no "true music fans" out there, which would completely invalidate the term as it would apply to nobody. Do you happen to know a whole lot of people who listen to Gregorian Chants right along with their Sea Shanties, Gangster Rap, Death Metal, Polka, Dubstep, Reggae and Chinese Folk Music? Who are these "true music fans" out there? Please enlighten us because it sounds like you're describing literally nobody that exists in this world.  It's literally a value judgment in that you've defined a value by which someone will be measured (the amount of musical genres and time periods they enjoy) and are judging that with associated labels. How the hell is that NOT a value judgment? Similarly, it's not objective because there's no objective standard that suggests that the authenticity of one's musical fandom (as implied by your use of the term "true") is measured by one's enjoyment of multiple musical genres.  &#x200B;  "still waiting on the quote sweat nerd. Or did you decide to downvote and slink off as well"  I didn't downvote you at all so you can go ahead and thank someone else for that.

1ilhckan	No food is inherently unhealthy. Pasta, potatoes, and to a lesser extent rice are all starchy. Potatoes have a glycemic index [similar to soda](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/carbs-potatoes-blood-sugar). Brown or wild rice is pretty decent, but it is also more expensive than white rice and takes longer to cook. Chicken is lean protein, but it's not trivial to make tasty chicken.  Time needs to be included when you are talking about the cost of food. A poor person is going to have less time than a well to do person. Can you really blame someone for wanting a quick easy dinner after they've spent 10 hours or more with work and kids and life?	1642557248.0	ht9f7t1	t3_s7dfpj	t3_s7dfpj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7dfpj/eating_healthy_doesnt_have_to_be_expensive_people/ht9f7t1/

1ilhckan	I cook for my family most nights. I have never finished dinner in 15 minutes. That doesn't even include the time it takes to go shopping and do the dishes. There might be a handful of dishes out there that are cheap, fast, healthy, and tasty but usually you'll have to pick just a few of those traits. And you have to count all of the cost. Leafy greens are usually pretty cheap and can be tasty if done right, but they also don't keep long. Including leafy greens means extra trips to the grocery store. Same with fresh fruits, poultry, and fish. There are canned and frozen alternatives, but they have extra sugar in the case of canned fruit or lose flavor from being frozen.	1642557789.0	ht9ggf2	t3_s7dfpj	t1_ht9dac3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7dfpj/eating_healthy_doesnt_have_to_be_expensive_people/ht9ggf2/

1pbc0ikp	Man, when I was little those cigarette packs used to scare the ever loving fuck out of me. Went to a kind of shady school where parents dropped empty packs around the school carpark for all the kids to see. It messed with my head a lot as a 5 year old. Definitely convinced me not to smoke at the time.   I’m 17 now and have had health class after health class about the dangers of smoking. I’ve smoked before and I will again but I am cautious about addiction and I do it rarely.  I refuse to vape. You don’t know what chemicals are in there and it doesn’t look cool, you look like a total loser if you vape and you’re my age. There’s not enough research to show what the costs of vaping on your health are. I won’t do it.  I have never ever had a health class about vapes.   I don’t think scare tactics work, they’re just bad. It’s always down to the individual and their social pressure. Kids don’t give two fucks about what the government wants them to do? Education is a different story. But in the long run I’m going to do what I’m doing to do based on what I think is cool or fun or worth it or based on what my friends think is cool or fun or worth it. Whether the cigarette pack has a picture of some dudes collapsed blackened lung or not.	1642570941.0	hta7tbp	t3_s7dr20	t3_s7dr20	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7dr20/we_should_let_tobacco_companies_advertise_all/hta7tbp/
9tu1rpyo	It is very difficult to meet new folks and develop any sort of meaningful friendship.  People become very set in their routines along the way, and are very sure of what they do and don't have any interest in.  The other side of this is being an adult without offspring.  Parents will soft-exclude you from their lives without intending to, simply because you have even less in common with them now, and they have even less time at their disposal.  (this does certainly work both ways as well).  The older you get, the worse this all gets as well.	1642571149.0	hta86dq	t3_s7bf6j	t3_s7bf6j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7bf6j/adulthood_is_so_incredibly_lonely/hta86dq/

6mlr0rb2	I don’t date white women anymore.  I’ve recently told my family and friends that I don’t date white women any longer. It wasn’t to be “edgy”, but I’ve found that white women are not traditional in the sense of the types of relationship that I’m looking for.  When I mention this, white people wrongfully assume that it means I’m looking for “servants”. That’s not true and it’s also a racist idea to assume that only whites women are “liberated” enough to be anything other than servants. This proves the racism in the white group.  Truth be told, I’m looking for a relationship of comradery  and mutual and equal friendship and teamwork, but the white women of today are highly focused on concepts and problems relating to the 1700’s, 1800’s and early 1900’s that I cannot relate to.  Women of other ethnicities are more evolutionarily equipped to raise a family, and more decisive when it comes to communication.  I believe that POC women are a superior group to date from, than white women.	1642576833.0	htah00n	t3_s7j4u1	t3_s7j4u1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4u1/menswomens_issues_mega_thread/htah00n/

If I’m not working I’m with my wife and kids. I have a few hours a night to myself so I play pc or watch tv. The thought of actually going out or making plans with friends feels like a chore because I’m constantly exhausted with very little sleep. Constant stress of money and bills.   Last time I actually went out with friends was maybe 7 years ago.   Spending time with my wife and kids is about as sociable as I am now. Im not sure if this is the norm for people that are married with kids  The most exciting thing for me is to be able to sit down for half an hour and do nothing.	1642589743.0	htaxr4o	t3_s7bf6j	t3_s7bf6j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7bf6j/adulthood_is_so_incredibly_lonely/htaxr4o/

You'd think it's a good thing that everybody n their mama can come up with an album, but it's actually doing the opposite.   This happened in '97, when everybody and their mama was rapping n shit. They killed hip hop...  and before that during the disco era ('76), and before that when old r&b (late 60s) became mainstream and before that before the British invasion and before that during the big band swing era and before that when classical became mainstream leading jazz/jass becoming a thing.. Just a string bad music after bad music  Sadly this time around, I really don't see what this mish mash of frustration is going to breed given we have turned to got talent shit but no follow through.  There's just no joy in digging the crates anymore!	1642591084.0	htazkgp	t3_s73jmz	t3_s73jmz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s73jmz/i_respect_a_persons_musical_opinion_less_when/htazkgp/

5an8itnm	I'm not invalidating anyone's struggles. I was actually trying to do the opposite. I am "those people" so I know all about it. I know that most of the people I know who struggle with these issues wouldn't randomly talk about it to people they aren't close to. But some people would and that's why I used the word "usually".    There are a lot of people on social media who are just attention seeking. Not all of them obviously but enough.  IMO taking responsibility would be telling those things to an actual professional, taking their advice and trying to change your own behavior and patterns. Not relying on other random people to recognize your patterns and reach out and do something for you.	1642592391.0	htb1fh4	t3_s7jn4n	t1_htaw96h	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7jn4n/mental_health_issues_have_been_so_romanticized/htb1fh4/

6wj2d660	Hunting is a sport. It does take physical capabilities and is a developed skill. Hunters are not sociopaths. That does not mean that hunting cannot be fun, or that people can't have a sense of accomplishment about it, or that it can't be a social activity. Human beings are biologically animals like any other. Is a lion a sociopath? Or a cougar? Do you really think that the industrial raising of animals for slaughter is less "sociopathic" than hunting? Farm factory raised animals don't even have a fighting chance. And don't say that camo etc isn't a fair fight, there are examples all over nature of animals developing camo and techniques to better hide and stalk their prey. Stop this concept that humans are somehow separate from the rest of the animal kingdom, we are not.   Hunting is more natural than commercialized meat production, and the animal at least has a chance to run away. Deer are cute, so is a cow but they can both be food. Personally I think a cow is cuter than a deer. It is hard to shoot a deer, some hunters can go a whole season without successfully taking a deer. You definitely need a strength and fortitude to kill and dress and butcher an animal. I couldn't do it myself, and I don't know how people do it in slaughterhouses either, but I'm glad there are people who can, and if they enjoy it or take pride in it then good on them!	1642598297.0	htbbd4u	t3_s7pndi	t3_s7pndi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7pndi/hunting_isnt_a_sport_and_most_hunters_are_just/htbbd4u/

dzaqb1yt	I'll bring up another point I brought up in another thread. Hunting for so long probably has long-term psychological influence on the brain which could lead to traits of sociopathy, or rather the idea that they may see animals as lesser beings, and the lack of empathy related to that.   In other words to see an animal getting shot, blood pouring from its body, then to go forth and skin the animal, chop it up, etc... must cause some sort of mental rewiring in the brain.	1642598659.0	htbc2n4	t3_s7pndi	t3_s7pndi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7pndi/hunting_isnt_a_sport_and_most_hunters_are_just/htbc2n4/

dzaqb1yt	Yes, but it's more of an idea in someone's mind to believe that another life is less valuable than their own, because we can profit off of them in some way or because we like the way their meat tastes.   Sounds like most sociopaths and psychopaths in society. The way they can value other human beings less because they can personally gain from it. Serial killers comes to mind, they kill others because they can, and because they want to. They find value or enjoyment in it in some way. It doesn't make it right.   Animals are living beings afterall.

Not in the governments eyes, but in yours.

eqij6rvj	It's a good decision, at least until the notch can be removed entirely.   I have a hole-punch display because it was the only thing available at the price range I was looking at, but I don't get why they're more popular. I've always preferred notches on both Android and IOS phones. As you say, the extra space isn't missed because that space generally goes to the time and status anyway.  It looks weird and less aesthetic to have a random black circle instead, and limits the quality and size of the speaker.  However, ideally the notch and hole punch displays will both go away eventually.	1642605514.0	htbrjtf	t3_s7q97g	t3_s7q97g	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7q97g/the_notch_in_apple_iphone_x_is_a_great_design/htbrjtf/

h92ajovk	Reminds me of my cousin. While dating she complained to everyone about how her boyfriend ignored her and put her down. Told us well, if we have a baby maybe he'll get better. He refused to buy a crib or anything else, or even put the shit together when others bought it for them. I had to go over there and do all that for him.   Baby comes along and then we start hearing about how he's neglecting both of them now, not even buying milk or diapers. Well, if we get married maybe he'll get better. Surprise, a huge chunk of her conversation topics still revolve around complaining about him.

i36a887b	Honestly never seen anyone encourage people to be child free. Do you have any specific examples that aren’t just “social media”  I find it a bit ironic that you call social media brainwashing yet post on social media.  I don’t see anyone encouraging people to not have kids. I see people encouraging others to think through having kids rather than just popping kids out you don’t intend to fully nurture and care for.  Also, we live in a time of rising costs and lowered wages.   I think encouraging people to have children because of some faux morality or faux religiosity is the real “brainwashing” that shouldn’t be encouraged.  Both my parents died. I was fortunate enough to having a caring extended family that cared for me and my siblings.  Do you know how hard things still have been? Even with that suppport system.   Bringing children into the world you are not prepared to fully support and take care of is the real issue and it why the earth is a huge shithole.  I don’t find your opinion unpopular. I find it untrue. As in, not based in reality.	1642610518.0	htc4bi8	t3_s7tjxz	t1_htc0dxw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7tjxz/being_childfree_shouldnt_be_encouraged/htc4bi8/

Also, you can get married with no wedding.  2) you don't have to be married to wear a ring  3) at least where I live: you can file taxes as if you're married if you have lived together for 5 years. You dont need to be married for joint accounts, also some married people have separate accounts.  You are right however that divorce does have different financial implications than simply breaking up.  4) you acknowledged the counter. No arguments with anything you said in point 4  5) I don't disagree per se, but I think thats more subjective and differs from relationship to relationship.  6) I dont know enough about this to argue either way  7) similar to point 5 I feel this is subjective and differs from relationship to relationship. However, I strongly disagree that blood or laws is what makes a family strong. Not to sound corny, but in my opinion what makes you family is the bonds you build between you, not the blood that runs inside you.  Personally, I agree with the sentiment that being married can be important. It's big weddings I disagree with. I'm personally of the opinion that if you want to have a big wedding, then renew your vows for an anniversary or something. Save that money to get a place, don't take a loan to have a big wedding. The amount of people who have giant weddings when they themselves are not financial stable is just astonishing to me.	1642611457.0	htc6tkm	t3_s7obyj	t1_htbpe55	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7obyj/getting_married_doesnt_change_anything_about_your/htc6tkm/

People often will assume you are not "checking the life milestones", some treat you like a teenager even next to someone who's been married and dramatically divorced. My life has been called "safe".

I can get better insurance with my many health issues, we want to sorta keep money things separate anyway, I won't take his last name, etc. Neither one of us really WANTS to get married at this point, but would if it would benefit us. I have the paperwork for the power of attorney stuff so that there is less legal issue if one of us dies too.   In our case, being married is just not a big deal.

6wj2d660	I almost guarantee you that wild animals enjoy the hunt and the kill, for food or otherwise. There are several other areas of the animal kingdom that engage in "surplus killing" or also kill for reasons other than food. Hell, even my domesticated, well fed chungus of a cat has no problem killing a mouse and deliberately put it on display without eating it, and has clearly expressed pride in doing so. Do some searching, I'm sure you will find much scholarly research and nature articles on the topic of predatory surplus killing.  Can't say I ever heard of ASPCA being anti-hunter. However PETA and the like are counter culture activists, and while they have a right to say what they want and protest just like anyone else, PETA and its supporters are a drastically small minority. PETA wants humanity to act completely against millions of years of biology and evolution, to no longer be predators. It's not going to happen.  Why not cats and dogs? Because we have a culture based on generations of people keeping them for entertainment and companionship, and some dogs are still used for work, and Asian culture is different. Why don't we make it normal? Who are you to dictate that? Who is PETA? There is no all powerful cultural dictator that will make it normal, the herd decides!  Native Americans use to eat horse, and pony was considered a delicacy if I'm not mistaken, but outside of early settlers who adapted to native culture it eventually fell out of favor, settlers brought their culture with them, used horses more for work, and later on for entertainment and companionship as well. I eat buffalo and really like it, not many other people I know do, but at least there is enough of an interest that I can occasionally find it in the grocery store or on the menu of a restaurant. There are people out there who eat squirrel, and it used to be more common, but mostly fallen away except for some very culturally tight rural pockets of America who hold very close to their particular lifestyle, and it will remain that way as most are considered social outcasts when compared to the rest of the herd.	1642628251.0	htdgg4d	t3_s7pndi	t1_htbj9nh	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7pndi/hunting_isnt_a_sport_and_most_hunters_are_just/htdgg4d/

iag3bvjr	>Marriage is a legal relationship.  And what if I don't give a shit about what the law thinks? It doesn't affect me one way or the other. This was about the way families think about each other.   Legally, yes, we would not be family. And yet my parents have metaphorically adopted me and my siblings' friends who have had tough lives at home. We consider them family. So why not the person I am in a relationship with?   My sister and her fiance aren't married, they are engaged. No date set or anything. So therefore he should still fall into the same category as my boyfriend, right? The law doesn't give a shit if you buy someone a ring.   I have friends now who I consider family. Same with my sister. Same with many people in my family.   Maybe I am too used to stronger family bonds than most. Just this year my mom's mom went with me to my dad's grandma's birthday across the state. Her only tie to anyone at that party was me. Everyone else was from my dad's side and the rest of my immediate family did not attend. And yet, she was treated like family by everyone there because she is family.  Or how one of my grandpas is my dad's ex-stepdad. He still gets invited to everything family related yet he and my dad's mom are divorced (and actually hate each other.) By your reasoning he shouldn't have anything to do with any of us anymore. Yet he does. Curious. It's as if family isn't just a legal contract in the eyes of anyone but the law.  >They will only care whether you were married, and if not, no survivor benefits for you.  Or we put each other in our wills? Problem solved.  My life isn't about legal contracts with other people. If he were to die I wouldn't want anything of his. My name would still be on the lease and I'd just have to pay his portion of rent. Who cares? The thing that would really matter is the emotional toll it would take.   Your personal relationships must suck ass if you can only see the gain you can receive through using others in legal contracts.	1642628719.0	htdhqt2	t3_s7obyj	t1_htda956	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7obyj/getting_married_doesnt_change_anything_about_your/htdhqt2/

iag3bvjr	The best argument I can find is that my parents knew my boyfriend when he was a dumb college kid. Added with the fact that I would share grievances with my sister and she would tell them. After she got her boyfriend he did literally the same disgusting behavior I was subject to (in college) and she confided in me but the key difference being I didn't tell my parents. She just wanted to vent and I let her.   That and my dad telling me about his "sad backstory." Her fiance didn't come from the best background. My bf also grew up in not the best situation and, fun fact, he used to have an older sister that he no longer has. Wonder what could have happened there. Maybe something to give him a "sad backstory"? But he doesn't share that stuff with my family. I didn't learn about a lot of it until four or five years in to the relationship. But because he doesn't tell people crappy things that have happened in his life I guess he doesn't get to be included like he would otherwise. ...or if he proposed.	1642629196.0	htdj1oy	t3_s7obyj	t1_htdbgjz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7obyj/getting_married_doesnt_change_anything_about_your/htdj1oy/

Why do people constantly have to push that extra toe into the door and get away with what they can instead of just being a good person who does what they’re supposed to do?

iag3bvjr	What does it matter who would get a pension if neither person has one?   Again, why is money such a big factor to you regarding relationships?  He'd get my savings account where all of my money I've put away for a down payment on a house is, as he is a beneficiary. I'm assuming his dad is beneficiary on all of his accounts which is fine.  Money isn't that big of an issue for plenty of people. If we needed the tax breaks or something than we would most likely be married.  Literally the only thing between the two of us that would be an issue if I died would be my dog and cat and what would happen to them. At best I could see him keeping one but the other he would probably re-home but without the use of a shelter. Knowing him, he'd probably try to keep both for as long as he could and end up rehoming one to one of his family members.  As I already said, if he died I'd be fine with the exception of emotionally.	1642630360.0	htdm5c9	t3_s7obyj	t1_htdknv1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7obyj/getting_married_doesnt_change_anything_about_your/htdm5c9/

6wj2d660	The fact that you started your post saying it's useless to respond...yet you respond...shows you are at least arguing in bad faith, or possibly some cognitive dissonance? Regardless it is obvious you just want to make assumptions about everything to confirm your own position, no matter how incorrect your assumptions may be.  It is not conjecture. Here: (yes not a scholarly article, (but it does make references to documented incidents and some studies - this is about the most effort I am willing to put in for someone with such a closed mind.)   [https://www.ranker.com/list/animals-that-hunt-for-sport/laura-allan](https://www.ranker.com/list/animals-that-hunt-for-sport/laura-allan)  We are wild animals. There is this crazy idea that because we have such higher level thinking, societal structures, religious beliefs (whatever they may be), and that we heavily modify our environment that we are somehow separate from the animal kingdom and nature as a whole. We are not. Even if you believe in God, Zeus, Ra, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, Cthulu, whatever you are still part of the animal kingdom. Humans only differentiate between wild and domesticated animals based on whether or not we have bred and trained a subsection of other animals to our needs, liking and will.   Most people are unwilling to admit that we look at the rest of the animal kingdom that way but not ourselves. We evolved, experienced natural selection, selectively bred ourselves, choose mates, defend territory, live, develop and die no different than the rest of creation. If a human kills another human with a bomb, and another human is killed by a shark, is one not killed by an animal but the other is? Is the human who did the killing somehow not natural? Just because humans use advanced tools, and the shark uses its teeth?  Ask yourself this: are uncontacted human tribes domesticated, or are they wild? If they are domesticated, who domesticated them? Who selectively bred them? Who taught them how to behave? To speak? If they are wild, why don't they only kill for food?  Don't talk to me about religion. I am not talking at all about religion, except to mention that having religious beliefs is something that does make us strikingly different from other animals, but different is not the same as separate.

For me, working from home kicked ass for about 4 months, then it started to grate on me.  I actually ended up going back to the office early voluntarily while the rest of the dev team was still at home (hell one guy still hasn't come back.  I kind of doubt he is ever going to lol.) just to stave off the cabin fever.  However, I still find myself waking up several mornings going "Why do I have to get dressed and drive to another building to do a job I can just as easily do in my underwear on the couch?"  Personally, my ideal situation is to have the option to work from home or the office day to day, but not be forced to do either, which is kind of unofficially where things stand right now and I hope they stay that way.	1642634345.0	htdw0wu	t3_s7zuzg	t3_s7zuzg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7zuzg/working_from_home_sucks_big_dirty_balls/htdw0wu/

lugav	>definitely unpopular  I don't know. The amount of ~~childfree~~ childless people I've seen coming out of the wood work to shit on kids when some pro-natalist post popped up, calling them "crotch demons", etc. is probably one of the most appalling things I've seen in my life.  I get the sentiment of not wanting to have kids, cost, climate fervor, not being raised with the expectation, etc etc, but it's the bitter nihilism and contempt for kids inherently from the name 'childfree' (implying it's something to be 'free' from like a disease) makes me think this sentiment of some kid dying is not all the unpopular.	1642641380.0	htec2e0	t3_s8549i	t1_hte5exi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8549i/sometimes_a_kid_dying_is_good_news_for_everyone/htec2e0/

And then I would probably only fish.  Don't think hunters don't have empathy. Your caricature of drunk rednecks gallivanting through the woods taking out poor defenseless Bambi is absurd. Not to say it doesn't happen, but of course you will use the rare worst of anything as an example to hold up when you want to oppose something. If people who do this kind of thing are caught, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  That does not equate to hunters or enjoying hunting as being as sociopath. You are prejudiced, judgmental, and have a real problem with cognitive dissonance. From a liberal? Color me shocked, such tolerance you are teaching me, oh educated one!

lugav	Are you supposed to be able to buy things with NFTs? *(Literally, I'm not sure. I heard about them years ago and ignored them through all the hype).*  Some Beanie Babies were selling on Ebay a few months ago for as much as $5k-$20k (actual sale prices, not listing prices). There was little value to them, maybe $1-$100. Funny thing was at the same time, on the low end these same Beanie Babies that were selling for $3000k+ were also selling for $1 to $5. All of this hype was driven by a few articles from semi-reputable publishers that said some of these Beanie Babies were worth $50k-$350k depending on the model *(but they weren't actually rare)*. This SAME type of article wasn't written a few years before also and it drove a similar hype to ebay around beanie babies.  Point is, bubbles everywhere. Beanies were always sold as a kind of investment in the 90's. This has also hit trading cards in recent years, like Pokemon. But with that there's a company that grades them. It's kind of opaque on the level of quality.	1642644581.0	htej7t3	t3_s7xrkk	t1_htedni8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7xrkk/cryptocurrency_as_it_is_now_is_the_equivalent_to/htej7t3/

6zrthj7o	Even if there was nobody around, and you successfully jaywalked free of issue, you'd be unconsciously emboldening yourself to take more aggressive risks in jaywalking in the future (I got away with it this time -- let's try it again!), eventually leading up to you getting hit, which can injure the person hitting you too.	1642650578.0	htewp9g	t3_s891pa	t1_hteuy7i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s891pa/there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_victimless_crime/htewp9g/

6zrthj7o	Thank you. I'm not saying that actual stores can be victims -- but stores serve and contain people, and if you steal from the store, the *owners* of the store -- who need to make certain levels of profit --  are going to have to find ways to compensate for the loss, and that most commonly comes in the form of wage cuts and price hikes, and *that* is when someone else gets victimized.	1642650830.0	htex91a	t3_s891pa	t1_htex3e9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s891pa/there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_victimless_crime/htex91a/

6zrthj7o	You would be 100% correct but remember in my original post I said *"no matter how indirect"* would means, in effect, that even if your immediate crime did not create a victim that day, if it helps lead to another incident in which there is a victim (an incident that would not have happened if you hadn't committed your earlier crime\[s\]) then that would count.  &#x200B;  Good example:  you jaywalk, someone else sees it, they think "oh, I guess jaywalking is OK" and then when this person jaywalks himself/herself the next day, they then get run over by a minivan and that minivan swerves into oncoming traffic and gets atomized. As you can see, none of that would've happened if the original offender had not jaywalked and spread this ill behavior to someone else, socially.	1642651061.0	htexqzq	t3_s891pa	t1_htex2of	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s891pa/there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_victimless_crime/htexqzq/

I’ve had a smartphone since I was in middle school and I used it for both communication with friends and helping my parents out. If it wasn’t for me having a smartphone, I wouldn’t have been able to pay the bills or find directions to unfamiliar places.

i36a887b	Ah, so the biased underbelly is exposed after only minimal prodding.  So this is your soap box to advocate against big pharma. I got it. That’s all I need to know.  Here’s an example asshole: my dad was a doctor, had access to top medicine, got cancer, and only lasted 11 months.  This was in 2001.  By 2009 my mom got cancer was given a few months to live, but survived 9.5 years.  She was not a doctor. My dad was. He had better access to medication, or as you call it, chemical dependency from drug daddy. They were divorced and she had no medical connections like him.   You consider the fact that within only 8 years technological advancement was able to prolong the life of one of my parents by 9 years out of their diagnosis, compared to only 5 months for the other parent, a backwards step?   That parent wouldn’t have seen me finish high school. Instead they saw me graduate college and get into law school.   Strange and off base take on technological advancement.   The real irony here is that if you get sick or one of your family member, you will run to the drug daddy with open arms. All while using technology (reddit) to voice your off based and uninformed opinion to large swaths of people who would never have listened to or heard you before…. Come to think of it, maybe some technology does represent a de evolution in society…	1642705671.0	hthuy4s	t3_s8nxpu	t1_hthtis2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8nxpu/its_too_easy_to_survive_in_our_society/hthuy4s/

But there could be some sort of transparent filter over top of the post with a button that says this post may contain misinformation, or something along those lines. That way the ads are not tainted, and the person is not censored.    There’s probably a better solution, but this seems reasonable to me.	1642705787.0	hthv993	t3_s8q81v	t1_hthuk1f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8q81v/sjws_are_toxic_hypocrites_that_harm_their_own/hthv993/

35ru1206	Do you believe someone who said, "do your own research" would accept the answer if someone said they have? There is nothing wrong with the literal meaning but the actual meaning is something quite different. Technically correct, actually wrong is where I'd file this.  GenX here, I was taught information is only as good as it's source. I don't take medical advice from my auto mechanic or car advice from my doctor seriously, especially if the advice direct conflicts with actual experts. Another red flag for me is someone with a monetary gain for giving specific advice, quite difficult in the world today.

3h68548j	You know what is unintellectual? Conflating vaping with smoking. Do you simply have some personal bias against nicotine? Tobacco? Being a child of the anti-smoking campaign era myself, the obvious aesthetic cons that put non-smokers off were odor, rapid aging, yellow teeth, dry, rotten breath and the promise of cancer. Looking at a smoker was enough trigger visions of being held captive to second hand smoke. Vaping addressed and corrected all the detractors, reducing a stinky, ugly habit to nothing except nicotine in a non toxic carrier.   The delivery system is so fundamentally different, your prejudice is asinine, like most prejudices. Really, at the end of the day, you just don’t like the way a person *looks* performing the act, without understanding much about the qualitative differences, or knowing the person’s character. It’s a dim, silly, and immature perspective to maintain. The ignorance behind your judgment is the very definition of *unintellectual.* And the hypocrisy of supporting “smoking blunts….now and then….” is mind-breakingly staggering, since smoke from cannabis does contain carcinogens, leads to dry mouth, and has a distinct odor, despite being dramatically less carcinogenic (and the compounds themselves are anti-carcinogenic).   Also, intellectuals practice proper capitalization and punctuation, so you are not only “one of those people”, you also happen to fall into the other camp you don’t believe applies to you.	1642719420.0	htispka	t3_rq66ch	t3_rq66ch	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rq66ch/not_to_be_one_of_those_but_vaping_is_literally_so/htispka/

Why in the world would you allow someone to invest time in you when you know good and well you’re just gonna cancel plans. Like, just say no. It’s exhausting trying to be someone’s friend when they seemingly don’t even put in any effort.  I can have empathy for your social battery running out or you having social anxiety or whatever the fuck. But you also need to have empathy for the people around you when you always cancel on them and seemingly make zero effort to be around them.

51n80	It's a depressant. Both alcohol and benzos hook into the GABA receptor which is tied directly to your central nervous system. So when you take either one it depresses your central nervous system. The CNS counteracts this because it doesn't like being depressed. Stop drinking alcohol or taking benzos and now you have an imbalance and increased risk of seizure.	1642734884.0	htjszvm	t3_s8xmi1	t1_htjpsaf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8xmi1/alcohol_should_be_illegal_its_only_legal_because/htjszvm/

2l3dtt0	One of my close relatives had been dealing with alcoholism for a long time, since his teen years in the 60 even I think. It really broke out in 2004 when I was born and I never really got to have a connection with him because of it (because ofc my parents didn’t want me to see him).  The thing that made him realize that it had gone to far was when he forced his wife to go out for a drive and they crashed into a ditch. They didn’t get hurt but when they called the police he was ofc drunk so he lost his license and had to pay a large fee.   Later when he was going through rehab he almost died due to diabetic shock. He was always used to drink after a meal and keep drinking.  He was hospitalized and we thought we would lose him.  Im glad we didn’t. Today he is happy and sober.  He has a sense of humor about it because he jokingly says that is new addiction is collections vinyls. I like that he can talk about his problems in that sense and know he was in the wrong. Other relatives ofc don’t like it as much haha.  I appreciate him a lot and he is a role model now. He showed me even if you are in the deepest hole you can be in you can recover.  He is 2 years sober now since September 2019.

rh1ap	Making something illegal does not help when you are not attacking the root cause.  You need to fix peoples psyche before removing their hard drugs, and if you don't have programs helping them, and instead block them from society, you have a much bigger problem at your hands.  Prohibition of drugs is bad because it opens a unregulated black market, where the products don't have standards, and puts money in the pockets of criminal organizations. leading to vulnerable people being taken advantage of, either through recruitment and promise of quick money, or giving highly addictive substances and activities directly to someone that does not have the ability to take care of themselves.  If you want to solve the issue, spend time building a system that helps the ones in need.	1642753250.0	htkpf1u	t3_s8xmi1	t3_s8xmi1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8xmi1/alcohol_should_be_illegal_its_only_legal_because/htkpf1u/

3jgcleyg	I just say this because of people like you that get upset about it and say I'm wrong. Like, I know it doesn't matter, and I honestly don't care. I just think it's funny.  Fact of the matter is, iPhones are Apple products, and Android is literally everything else, since Windows phones no longer exist. *Everything else*. That includes all the shit box phones that are definitely wayyyy below the quality of Apple, which is why people make this assumption. The average iPhone is better than the average android phone.  The same can be said about computers. Sure, expensive gaming laptops will outperform Mac any day if the week, but some cheap $100 chrome book won't be able to do Jack shit compared to a Mac. So, yeah, the best android is better than an iPhone (based on who you ask and why), but the worst android is way worse than the worst iPhone.  I personally use iPhones because they are more secure and I like the operating system design more.

boqspo7v	You have another comment that says “But is history written by the victors? Take for instance the Confederacy. They lost and they've been romanticed to hell and back. The thing about the Internet is that you can only censor so much.”  Which is almost going against this comment? Because even with the internet people still romanticized the wrong thing. Anti-Vaxx, Nazis, Confederacy, etc…  History is written by the victors, it’s the same reason we’ve brushed over slavery for so long. The north won, and “freed the slaves” ok, but black people were/are still treated poorly, and it’s only being addressed because we *do* have a decentralized place where people can find the *actual* facts.	1642762939.0	htl1q3e	t3_s97kdn	t1_htl0kz2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s97kdn/nazis_are_bad_because_they_lost/htl1q3e/

2r2bcp4d	Yep, it's taught very badly. I was perceived as good at math because I have a good memory. I learned most things by heart and just wrote them down as an abstract thing I need to do, like learning foreign words in a foreign alphabet without ever having a translation. You learn to recognize things and even put them together in formerly seen structures, but they mean nothing to you.  I only understood a lot of practical applications in real life later  (for example that you use percentages to compare things that  are otherwise hard to compare.) I always thought I was pretty stupid because of this, but maybe this time it's not me haha.  Before someone asks: I failed text tasks to a level that made the one teacher who cared believe I had dyslexia. I didn't, and he just shrugged it off as me not caring about the tasks, since I managed strong 80% without them.	1642763340.0	htl293f	t3_s8jylf	t3_s8jylf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8jylf/math_isnt_that_hard_the_teachers_are_the_problem/htl293f/

5edevhn2	Some time ago while I was off in college, my small Pomeranian and mother was attacked by a giant pit/mastiff who had broken his leash link and charged them. It ended up grabbing my dog and ragdolling him before the owner and some bystanders finally managed to get the dog to release the bite.   Thankfully my dog is super fluffy and only sustained a cut around his nose, some minor bruising, but nothing long term. His neck where he was thrashed around was fine bc of the excess fluff lol   Anyways, we got the other persons insurance/contact info and could’ve sued the absolute hell out of them. As a result, we opted not too bc our dog wasn’t fatally injured + it meant their dog would be put down. We were reimbursed thru vet bills and more in the end, but I ultimately knew I would feel guilty forever if i had chosen put down their dog. I’m not sure how I would’ve felt if my dog was majorly injured though.   Tldr: my fluffy dog was attacked by a huge dog while I was away. Fluffy dog was saved by excess fluff so I opted not to sue and have attack dog put down since fluffy dog was largely unscathed. Couldn’t deal with guilt of killing another dog	1642764452.0	htl3r5p	t3_s8zeqo	t3_s8zeqo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8zeqo/9_times_out_of_10_i_will_purchase_a_dog_from_a/htl3r5p/

I'd also fully support pirating a movie if its not on any streaming services and is been out of print on physical mediums.	1641135551.0	hqxu0d5	t3_ru8qam	t1_hqxglih	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ru8qam/emulation_of_retro_games_is_not_only_morally/hqxu0d5/

I work a strange schedule because our offices are in different time zones but it's mostly an excuse so I can be off of work when my kids get home from school.

I just couldn't imagine being that 1 kid without a phone and everyone else had one and you were just missing out on all this stuff and you couldn't be a part of the group collective because you didn't have a phone and you weren't accessing the same information and the same content that they were.  It's not giving your kid a phone until 18 is basically isolating them at this point because there's just all this stuff that everyone else is experiencing and bonding over but they can't  As an adult we know that that's silly and those people aren't gonna care later in life and all that and blah blah. But when you're that age it's a big deal. I think a kid should get a cellphone when they go into high school so like 14.	1642642995.0	htefmuf	t3_s86njq	t3_s86njq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s86njq/kids_do_not_need_smart_phones_until_they_are_18/htefmuf/

8fem47x1	I agree with you in theory, and I think for many many *happy and healthy* couples you are correct. For me, marriage made me a lot more confident in my relationship. Before meeting my husband I dated 2.5 abusive men, one of whom is currently being prosecuted for r@peing, drugging, and physically abusing more than 12 women myself included and the half of the 2.5 I think was/is abusive but my gauge is so far off it’s honestly hard to tell. I think he would count to a normal person. But, marriage calmed me down a lot. I love my husband dearly but while we were dating and even engaged I kept waiting for the shoe to drop. I kept waiting for him to either figure out he had made a mistake with me or to end up like my awful exes. But after our wedding I realized he really was in it for the long haul, the man I fell in love with is the man I married and he isnt changing.	1642649117.0	hteti0g	t3_s7obyj	t3_s7obyj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7obyj/getting_married_doesnt_change_anything_about_your/hteti0g/

Go ahead, flag me for calling that child a piece of shit- that's what he is and always will be with an attitude like that. It's interesting how insecure  narcissists fool everyone, even the moderators with their twisted way of showing reality. Go flag the guy who called a woman a whore.

192olr6c	You’re very much mistaken, sir.  They have no authority over you, unless you have given them reasonable articulable suspicion of committing a crime.  Every interaction that is not a detainment is called a consensual interaction, meaning you or they can terminate at any time.  Cops are trained to frame consensual interactions as if it were detainment to get cooperation.  That is why every lawyer will say to ask “am I detained?”.   ￼ if you’re not detained you don’t have to say anything and they have no lawful authority over you.	1642700762.0	hthhgh5	t3_s8jjpf	t1_hth57ck	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8jjpf/refusing_to_cooperate_with_a_cop_is_just_plain/hthhgh5/

192olr6c	What you were advocating for is proving yourself innocent when asked.  You would rather prove yourself innocent to save yourself some time, but that doesn’t change the fact that you’re advocating for that.  The law also states that if it’s not a detainment, you can walk away whenever. So it doesn’t actually save you time, it just makes you not have to assert yourself, which is scary to a cop, and they count on that.	1642701512.0	hthjjf5	t3_s8jjpf	t1_hthjenv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8jjpf/refusing_to_cooperate_with_a_cop_is_just_plain/hthjjf5/

192olr6c	Yeah, but that's the meat, I think. How long do people capitulate out of convenience to save time, and that right goes away by default, and not IDing is legitimately seen as suspicious?    There are those first amendment auditors who go around filming in public spaces that always have the police called on them.  That is still a right we have, to record in public, that is seen as suspicious enough now to have police threaten and in some cases, arrest.  (Granted, most of them are also assholes to the cops (which I don't condone), but still acting lawfully).

dvlxzaap	Thank you friend, it was easier than I thought. Mainly because I got sober almost a year prior to my last parole violation. And when I knew I was done, it came rather easy because I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. And I had 3 strikes already, and didn’t want to do the rest of my life in custody.

8pvdfev8	Picky eaters mostly don’t bother me, but there’s a certain type that does: the grown adults that eat junk food diets because they’re “picky.” I can’t stand when people call my meal gross but they literally eat chicken nuggets and hot dogs when God knows what’s in them, and chips with artificial flavoring. I get not wanting to eat raw vegetables all the time and preferring them cooked. But it’s the people who say they hate vegetables and eat only processed foods that bother me.	1642727246.0	htjbepz	t3_s8glvp	t3_s8glvp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8glvp/picky_eaters_are_fine_and_dont_deserve_the_hate/htjbepz/
dvlxzaap	Yeah I agree with that 100%, but it’s usually just easier to cooperate without giving too much information. And stay well within your rights. Me and my wife got pulled over in Nevada on a trip, and the cop ran my name, and of course the red flags came up on his computer. But when he first pulled us over, I told him that I’ve never had a traffic ticket. He was a very nervous guy, and pulled us out of the car. He asked my wife if she felt threatened by me in anyway? And then asked where we were going? He then pulled me to the back of the car, and asked me the same thing. And then said, I thought you never been arrested before? I told him that is not what I said, and went on to tell him that I know his computer is showing that I beat up a cop and injured him very bad.But that’s not who I am anymore. And also explained where we were going. His whole attitude changed with my honesty and he apologized to us both and told us to please slow down we were doing 90 in a 70. It ended up being a peaceful situation that could’ve escalated to a very different outcome. But I just kept my cool and a level head and stayed straight with him. We shook hands and headed out. So it really ends up on the situation about how we react. I keep posted on my bathroom mirror; “Life is a choice, so choose wisely.” I realize that I have a choice, I can react or just be a calm person and handle the situation as best as I can. And in most cases the problem resolves itself. I hope you have a great night, and better year ahead friend.	1642727362.0	htjbobm	t3_s8jjpf	t1_htj96ip	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8jjpf/refusing_to_cooperate_with_a_cop_is_just_plain/htjbobm/

dvlxzaap	Yeah it’s just so much easier to get it over with as fast as possible. I think those who run their mouths, are just prolonging a situation that could’ve ended a lot quicker. I was just explaining to another person on here about my last time I got pulled over. The cop was a nervous guy, and especially when he pulled my name up onto his computer. The red flags told him I have a assaultive behavior against them and they ended in very serious situations. My last charge was A&B with great bodily against a cop. I broke the dudes leg in the county jail. And it doesn’t really help my cause that I’m 6’4 and 280 lbs.! But the speeding turned into a handshake and sent us on our way. So I am right there with you friend, and it’s just quicker and easier to be cooperative and not lose your cool. I hope you have a great day and better year ahead friend. And stay out of the line of fire.	1642728118.0	htjdf5s	t3_s8jjpf	t1_htjbwx4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8jjpf/refusing_to_cooperate_with_a_cop_is_just_plain/htjdf5s/
dvlxzaap	Well you are also entitled to share your thoughts and opinions about yourself and what you experienced. I’m in now way trying to discredit you or anyone. But have found it very beneficial for me to just cooperate, remain positive and calm. And if you’ve got as much as experience with the system as well, maybe you can offer a different perspective? To each his own, and I’ve just learned to share my experience with others. I’m not being a judge, jury and executioner of others in any way. I’m a firm believer that; “Life is a choice so choose wisely.” The thought of spending the life sentence after my last case, and getting sober a year prior of my last violation. Has made me change my whole attitude in dealing with others.Have a good night.	1642730731.0	htjjfrc	t3_s8jjpf	t1_htji29e	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8jjpf/refusing_to_cooperate_with_a_cop_is_just_plain/htjjfrc/

zvxrn1v	Tbf, I'm in the same boat as you, but less direct about it.   I live in Russia and it's quite OK to drink since 15-16, which I did. I saw alcohol abuse by my father and gave it up entirely in 2019. I didn't hate alcohol, I just decided not to drink it, until June of last year when my father passed away because of this. I became against alcohol, not to the point of cutting connections, but skipping social interactions cause they had alcohol.  It's not about making alcohol illegal, it's about making it not normal. Since it's a thin line to cross for most of the people between addiction and social drinking, it all comes from the culture and upbringing. People just can't live without it, because it's strange for boys not to crack a cold one on a Friday night and I fucking hate it, because it also ruins experience for non drinking members. So be the one who will bring the change. When I stopped, bunch of my friends were supportive and it's now OK not to drink in my circle because you don't want to. Sometimes lack of desire for alcohol comes in months for my friends, just because they saw that it's OK.	1642747475.0	htkh9nw	t3_s8xmi1	t3_s8xmi1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s8xmi1/alcohol_should_be_illegal_its_only_legal_because/htkh9nw/

17402uxj	All phonetic writing systems are derived from a single innovation (in ancient Phonecia) so all alphabets are a form of cultural appropriation from them, and they got the idea by modifying this already modified version of Egyptian hieroglyphics.  Also, soap, mathematics, paper, cars, plumbing, electronics, etc.   This might seem like an unpopular opinion, but is just that the people who complain about cultural appropriation are really loud and privileged (at top universities) and no one cares about what they think enough to argue with them. Better to just let them play at sPeAKINg TrUtH tO pOwEr as they slowly get fat and turn into their parents.  Edit: actually I think the Korean alphabet is an exception, in that it didn't organically evolve out of a previous writing system.

c0fojq05	This is a classic example of an argument that sounds reasonable because it strings together a few seemingly related concepts and reaches a conclusion that is extremely popular and morally righteous and makes people feel good for supporting. But on a quick examination your argument actually makes no sense.   Parents have a legal obligation to feed their kids regardless of whether they’re in school or not, and sending a kid to school doesn’t somehow make it harder to feed your kid (it actually makes it much easier because parents have a lot more time to work). There’s *no* causal connection between sending a kid to school and feeding the kid. Child labor is illegal, after all. Your argument makes about as much sense as saying if my kid is going to school then the school has to pay for the additional housing costs I incurred by having a kid.   Also re: schools getting paid twice for food … I know nothing about that and I’m not an accountant but something tells me that is clickbait misinformation style nonsense.

I don't think I'm dramatic about it... you probably like cats more than dogs and so take it more personally when people mention their cat allergies.

flajjc9n	OK, as someone who recently got a cat for the first time I absolutely have to agree I have started to notice that my friends with cats have some of the most foul smelling homes.  It also has occurred to me, that not everybody cleans their cat’s litter box immediately after they shit. So I really think this contributes to it. I personally throw out my cat’s poop immediately after he goes to the bathroom, it’s also the first thing I check when I come home so I really think that helps with the smell.   But I know people who only clean the litter box once a day, so their cat’s shit is just festering all day.

4o7c4xck	So here's the thing that is maybe a hot take... the mods, like any and all mods, are the owners of r/antiwork. They do own it. Mods set rules and decide what subreddits look like. It's not really democratic.  Afaik the mods created the sub as a leftist and marxist sub around the idea of antiwork, or the abolition of work itself. The mod in the interview that said laziness is a virtue... that's what the sub was founded on and that's what the sub is about.  Since the sub got more popular it attracted new members and most of the posts were about work reform like getting more money and raises, better hours, respect at work, dealing with bad employers, etc. But in the end this is work reform, not work abolition.  These kinds of disagreements have popped up in the past between the mods and the users of the sub, where they've made some posts explicitly describing the sub as radical, marxist, etc.  What we're seeing here is basically the user base outgrowing the orginially created sub by the mods. This is like if I made a subreddit that talks about how much I hate cooking and cooking should never happen unless you want to, and then people started talking about how they want to cook under better circumstsnces, you can see how there's going to be a divergence of opinions.  All that being said this is a good thing for people upset about r/antiwork mods. They own a subreddit but they don't own a movement, they don't own an idea. If you disagree with them and this sub, join a different one or make your own! Obviously there is an adjustment period for splintering and yes a replacement won't be the same size as other larger ones necessarily at first, but given the situation, this was honestly bound to happen sooner or later.	1643314575.0	huhhl98	t3_sdjbyz	t3_sdjbyz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sdjbyz/rantiwork_interview_megathread/huhhl98/

yyp94	Living with your parents can mean a lot of things. The adult child cannot act like a child. They have to act like an adult who is making every effort to successfully launch an independent life. Sponging off your parents and making them feel like it's 'their job' to financially take care of you forever is irresponsible and unfair.   Don't forget, many parents as they age are also facing increasing stressors. Aging, health issues, job loss, mental health struggles, marital struggles etc. Parents are not immune simply because they are parents. You may not be their only child and they may not be able to take care of everybody.  They may also be responsible for taking care of their own aging parents. Being an adult child in 2022 may not be easy but it's also not easy for aging parents. Perhaps what should be normalized are multi-generational households where each family member contributes.	1643325375.0	huia53h	t3_se21nj	t3_se21nj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se21nj/living_with_your_parents_until_youre_ready_to_buy/huia53h/

12g7gr	Most people can communicate with others just fine as needed, the OP was talking about public speaking. There are few that are good at it and like it, most people aren’t good at it and don’t want to and won’t need to do it. That is why I brought up drawing well, of course not everyone can or will need to.  I feel it’s an attempt of extroverts to try and “fix” introverted people by pretending that public speaking is a necessary skill.  With many practical skills becoming less common, and the ability to listen and empathize are on the decline, I don’t see the need to make something like public speaking required. I think the ability to walk on your hands should be a higher priority.	1643326146.0	huic1c9	t3_sdld5i	t1_hueio71	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sdld5i/schools_should_not_make_public_speech_class_a/huic1c9/

en6h82xj	Because so many    pet store pups come from puppy mills, they are not the result of careful    breeding and they are usually not well cared for before coming to the    store. Some common illnesses and conditions are neurological problems, eye problems, hip dysplasia, blood disorders and Canine Parvovirus.     Dogs are a long-term commitment  and a huge responsibility. They depend on you for everything and can be expensive, high-maintenance, messy, and loud. They're not toys you can put away when you're done playing with them. ... If you feel you are ready to make a dog your number one pal, then adopt—don't buy.     Adopting a shelter animal not only gives your pet a second chance in a happy home, but can also save it from being euthanized in an overcrowded shelter.    By taking home your new pet, you also make room at the shelter for another animal with nowhere else to go.     Breeding “purebred” dogs—dogs with certain genetic traits or appearances—can cause inherited health conditions  that can be painful and deadly. ... An [article in Time magazine](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,163404,00.html) estimates that as many as one in four purebred dogs is afflicted with a serious genetic problem.     https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/top-reasons-adopt-pet	1643327166.0	huiei9z	t3_se94je	t1_huichft	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se94je/blending_together_2_dog_breed_names_to_make_one/huiei9z/

7mkliygy	Definitely unpopular judging by the comments but I must say I 100% agree. I think they should give you plenty of incentive to take it but at the end of the day it should be optional. As someone who successfully went out of their way to avoid classes like that I can tell you from personal experience I definitely don’t regret it. It definitely didn’t have any major affect on me and my ability to communicate with people long term. I think most people are disagreeing because it must feel like some kind of right of passage for them and they want to believe all that stress they went through wasn’t all completely pointless and was for a good reason. If people are forced to do something then they’ll want others to be forced to do it.

3capsjlt	I breast fed both my children to 2.5. (They are a 2-and-a-half-year-age gap, so I have continuously breastfed for 5 years).   I’m glad I did it, both for their health but also mine (lowering risk of breast cancer). Beyond the health benefits, it also apparently helps jaw structure, and might very well be a reason so many people have terrible teeth nowadays? (because they didn’t breastfeed for long).  But when my kids were around the age of 18 months, I started to hide it around friends (if they came to visit, I would go into the bedroom, even though I always nurse with a cover anyway). I have had family members ask when I was going to stop when baby was only 3-6 months old!  Many people think it’s disgusting right out the gate, but I just say screw ‘em. You can’t control how people think. I did what was best for me and my kids and I’m proud of that.   Where I’m from, I believe it’s over 80% of women typically only breastfeed for 3 months (or less)…  I think western cultures are super weird about this.	1643335610.0	huiyj5s	t3_se5gj6	t1_huh5ocj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se5gj6/breastfeeding_past_2_years_old_is_perfectly/huiyj5s/
1hppipah	Being exposed to ultraviolet light often is the fastest way to age your skin. It doesn't matter what skin care products you wear to try to have smoother skin- if you are out in the sun often and don't wear a lot of sunscreen, the damage is done. You may not see it now but when you are older, you will see all the wrinkles. Imagine the redditor who stays in his basement all the time and has poor hygiene. His skin will eventually look more youthful and healthy than yours at an older age and it doesn't matter what kind of anti aging cream you use.	1643335764.0	huiyw21	t3_sec793	t3_sec793	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sec793/tanning_is_stupid_and_vein/huiyw21/

It’s hard to see that giving an older brother oral sex is wrong, because he wasn’t an adult, so there is always a part of me that feels like maybe it should be fine with me because “exploration”.  it’s a mind fuck for sure. I don’t necessarily know if the kids doing it did understand. But that doesn’t mitigate the mental and emotional harm it had on me.

9y52r86y	Socialists don't seem to support free speech.   I've come to this conclusion after being banned from the r/socialism subreddit after posting one single comment.   My comment wasn't even anything negative about socialism.    This is what I wrote:   "There should be a flat tax (a tax fee). Whether you make 30K a year or 3M a year is irrelevant. We should all be tasked with paying the same tax fee.   The way taxes are set up now encourages theft, corruption, etc. Tax dollars are being wasted because there are too many tax dollars.   I’m self employed. I pay my taxes. In no way am I rich. I don’t earn a lot, but I also don’t believe other people should be penalized for earning more.   If we correct the tax situation in this country, things could possibly level out. For example, if we all paid 1K in federal taxes per person, that’s like $330B. $330B is a lot of money for one year.     Taxing people at different rates encourages bad behavior across all income classes."	1643351022.0	huju0lb	t3_scyxgb	t3_scyxgb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scyxgb/politics_mega_thread/huju0lb/
2nusfgqj	They’re not reducing people down to stds, they’re showing anonymous pictures with no relation to the person. If anything, using first hand testimonies would do exactly that. It’s also like instead of showing pictures of smokers lungs they show kids someone telling the story of them speaking through a box. It’s just unnecessary, both get the point across effectively. Not only that but the patients probably give consent.   Also why is a picture of someone’s diseased junk inherently more embarrassing than pictures of other organs?   And also I don’t ever recall being shown some disgusting std pictures in class.	1643351286.0	hujufys	t3_sejzg2	t3_sejzg2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sejzg2/a_lot_of_sex_ed_is_morally_disgusting_regarding/hujufys/

6249zcvu	I pray and believe in Him. I choose to be open to His Word, and have interpreted His hand in my life.  I could be wrong, and I'm just a lucky guy. So I cant say any religion is 'unworthy.' I think most religions have a lot in common, and all religions have something to be learned from.  What sets Christianity apart from the other religions I've looked into? I'll just point out one thing and you make of it what you will. No other religion has laws/commandments/teachings condemning- worshipping other gods.   Every one has doubts in what they believe. I personally try to look at both sides of the coin so I can better understand the overall weight of a topic. But someone who wont admit they too have/had doubts, isn't a reliable guide. I truly started my journey when I started playing the "What would my Creator, not be?" Very useful thought exercise if you can get some peace and quiet, and you may find you'll come up with questions and answers you never considered.   If you're comfortable with it, I have a suggestion. Go into your room and sit down somewhere comfortable. Now, open your mind to the idea that there is a being Who created everything, and He can hear your mind. Ask Him, beg Him for guidance and wisdom to find the answers you are looking for. Ask Him to open your eyes to His will.   I rarely pray anymore, AvgProdigy53 but before I go to bed I will mention you. I truly hope you find peace and happiness, I only hope this comment/book was an appropriate response to your questions.

It can be very strong in some peoples houses but when it comes down to it, cats don’t compare to the smell that dogs produce, probably because they obsessively clean themselves. Dog owner’s houses are smellier 90% of the time because people don’t like to wash them and they’re just physically larger. It’s not scent free but also just isn’t that bad compared to some other animal smells, especially hedgehog/Guinea pig enclosures.	1643357355.0	huk3hbz	t3_se6t3l	t3_se6t3l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se6t3l/cat_peoples_houses_almost_always_smell_terrible/huk3hbz/

i36a887b	I actually agree with OP tbh.  I’d rather any article, even a facially bias one, then an unsourced screenshot of a tweet.  Literally anyone can write anything and tweet it and then screenshot and crop the tweet so you can’t even see the source (often how they are presented).  Even a bias article, I can see the source, I can read the details within, and I can critique it.   It’s hard not to dismiss twitter screenshots out of hand.  That being said, linking to a tweet that posts an article (kind of unnecessary because of the extra step but ok) is valid.	1643372347.0	huknr0t	t3_seoha0	t1_hukk65r	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/seoha0/if_you_post_a_source_thats_a_link_to_a_tweet_and/huknr0t/

I grew up in a rural area and it was fun to be able to run around in the fields and play sports in my own backyard. I would’ve felt suffocated being trapped in an urban area around a bunch of buildings and other people. I live in a suburb now and I still find myself driving an hour just to get some fresh air because I find suburbia to be a bit too dense at times.

That's patently ridiculous so I informed him that even if all the oil was gone we would still have natural gas.  Even if that was all gone we would have nuclear.  Even if there was no power source that could sustain us, then the city would be a hell of a lot more dangerous than the countryside.  Then you talk about going to California.  What's up with California?  Out of oil?  All the rural people packed it in and fled the countryside?  They pledged not to use natural Gas?  I doubt that since they're fracking for it in LA rn.

If I forgot anything, it was a 5 minute walk away.  It was nice too, because I didn't have to plan 7 days in advance. I could grab what I was in the mood for that day, and eat it later that night.   Now I'm back in the burbs and my closest grocery store is only accessible by car, despite being less than a mile away. It is such a burden to go there, because of the traffic/lights. If I forget anything, it really just dampens my mood for the night. Gotta get back in the car, spend 7 minutes driving a mile, walk across a parking lot with cars speeding in and out of it, and then do it in reverse after I get my thing.  If you haven't experienced the other side of things (living in a densely populated area with walkable access to amenities), I'd highly suggest it.	1643386646.0	hulk5eo	t3_ser87k	t1_hulfbjn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ser87k/suburban_sprawl_makes_the_us_a_terrible_place_to/hulk5eo/

is1a8	 It is a realistic number for people with expensive car payments.   If you choose a more financially responsible route, it is unrealistic.  My current vehicle was 1 year old when I bought it, with less than 10k miles,  paid it off in 3 years, and now I only have to pay for insurance and gas.    For our 2-car household we pay about $200/mo for full coverage insurance combined.  I don't have to drive a lot so I may spend $60 or less on gas per month.  So for just me, it's less than $200/mo for my car probably.

However older American cities, mostly in the Northeast quarter of the country don't really have the same problem. They are far more traditional in design and have more natural growth.   The European countries you're referring to are also probably much more densely populated than much of the US, which is far larger than Western Europe.

None of the houses in my neighborhood look the same, we have so many trees that it almost feels like living in a forest, and there's a ton of wildlife here. I see deer in the woods out back at least once a week.	1643392223.0	hulzb5n	t3_ser87k	t3_ser87k	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ser87k/suburban_sprawl_makes_the_us_a_terrible_place_to/hulzb5n/

gz51l6d5	To be honest, in my case they did put so much effort before they used screaming and hitting. I was being negatively affected from friends and from bad environment in general, i was very insistent and entitled, they couldn't reasonate with me because I wouldn't listen. It took me screaming and hitting to understand my parent's frustration and how much I was hurting them. It made me more calmer and understanding.

Mostly, people judge parents without knowing the background. In my experience, at least many parents I've seen didn't get to that point without trying to communicate with their children first.

5vii0jys	i live a 3-minute walk from a grocery store (it's literally 1 block away from me), and a 7-minute walk from two other grocery stores. between me and the grocery store are banks, barbers, bakeries, hardware store, etc.  you don't buy a whole carload of groceries at once. I buy a backpack full plus up to 1-2 shopping bags full of groceries at a time. You can actually fit a TON of groceries into a well-packed bag. As a single person, 1 backpack + 2 full shopping bags can easily last me 1.5-2 weeks, and i rarely buy that much. Usually just 1 backpack full plus a bit of produce in the bag. depending on the family size it could be 2-3 days worth. or you can take your whole family and everybody carries some stuff, or you trade off the semi-daily grocery shopping with your spouse, etc. since it's so nearby, you can pop out to restock at any time  But I prefer to shop every few days instead of a week at a time. If you need to get a lot all at once you can get one of those folding/rolling grocery carts you see in cities. it's nice because this way i keep fresher vegetables on hand. and it counts as a brief walk instead of sitting in a car.  its just a different routine. i used to live in a place where i had to drive just 5 minutes to get groceries, in my opinion that setup was less convenient and less enjoyable than walking. it just always seemed like a bigger production to get in the car, drive, and park even if its just 5 minutes.	1643400008.0	humk5gz	t3_ser87k	t1_hum6kb9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ser87k/suburban_sprawl_makes_the_us_a_terrible_place_to/humk5gz/
