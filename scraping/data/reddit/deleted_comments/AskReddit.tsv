rgixe	Food and toilet paper and cleaning supplies shortages can happen. You will wait for an hour in the sun outside Costco before it opens if you have to. We will wait online to get into Whole Foods if you have to. Stores can limit how much of something you can buy, like toilet paper or tuna or rice.   People will not follow pandemic rules unless you enforce them. People make decisions not in their best interest, get sick, and make those same bad decisions again. No matter how serious something is, some people won't take it seriously enough at their own detriment.  During a pandemic, established restaurants will close and new restaurants will open.... Much quicker than you expect. Outdoor season, and especially heated outdoor scene seating if it's cold, we'll determine whether a lot of people eat a particular restaurants.   Whole industries of staff will make decisions based on their health and safety in relation to how much they're getting paid.... Which will change whether whole industries can stop themselves.... Including restaurants closing or even closing for a day or certain days a week because they just don't have the staffing. Remote work and zoom meetings have become standard. People have been quitting jobs that require them to go into work even part of the time.  People will have to teach their own kids at home.	1640870973.0	hqjkzba	t3_rs0iag	t3_rs0iag	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs0iag/what_has_the_world_not_learned_from_the_covid19/hqjkzba/

8j5rz	It's easy to make assumptions about strangers on the internet. I take charge of my own health AND I work in public health, dabbling quite a bit in health systems and policy. It will never be as simple as comparing global health systems, duh, and I'm not about to write a peer reviewed 30 page paper on it here, but there is absolutely a lot to be learned and applied, even if application is basically impossible here.   Of course I think dentists should be fairly compensated and I never suggested anything less. Obviously you're more familiar with the ins and outs of dental overhead, my own experience is from private practice/hospital/health systems so I compared apples to oranges.   Perhaps you're an honest dentist, but I have many dentist friends/family members and something like 30% of them get incentives to use certain brands and meds.	1640875015.0	hqjt13y	t3_rretoj	t1_hqjpntt	/r/AskReddit/comments/rretoj/whats_criminally_overpriced_to_you/hqjt13y/

9lb7j	The first friction  upon entering   is like the chills you get when a massage hits the right spot.  Warm at first then temperature balances out  If youre uncircumcised and start off  entering with the glans covered, it rolls back and that has a kind feeling again like a nassage but lightly with a riller or something  Then it gets really wet and your balls get really wet and then it just gets slippy and you dont feel much  Then depending on your movement angle and speed you can get pangs of sharp chills with some hug type chills  Your mind and body have to be in tune so you dont give in too easily or so that you dont lose your erection   Plus its a lot of work physically plus theres like a mental hotness to seeing your partber naked that gets you and your heart pumping  If this combination of chills feels too good you get goosebumps all over your body and your pelvic floor muscle contracts and chills come with every contraction   You get relaxed and kinda lazy feeling  Thus all happens pretty fast  If  you keep going after coming you get the same type of tickle you would get if someone else ran their nail down the bottoms of your feet so you dont want to keep going    I did the best i could.	1640878690.0	hqk1big	t3_rrxf60	t3_rrxf60	/r/AskReddit/comments/rrxf60/what_does_sex_feel_like_from_a_guys_perspective/hqk1big/

I worked in orthopedic manufacturing and the amount we paid to get body parts to our cadaver lab was huge, and since the distributors were getting the bodies for free they must be making boatloads of money. AFAIK a lot of bodies came from people who died in jail with no known next of kin or living will, that could've been hearsay though.   TL;DR if the distributor is getting money from selling my body parts to medical companies, they can pass some of that onto me while I'm still alive for agreeing to let them use it...	1640880734.0	hqk6b9r	t3_rretoj	t1_hqin2py	/r/AskReddit/comments/rretoj/whats_criminally_overpriced_to_you/hqk6b9r/

eek7s8zp	2019    I was a junior who made shitty choices in friends and boyfriend that I wish I didn’t hold onto so much. My boyfriend I was dating since 2017 and after the shit I went through with his mental abuse the year before, I should have just left him my junior year instead of staying with him for almost two more whole years. And my friends were really fake but I didn’t know it at the time and kinda dropped some of my other friends because I was busy hanging out with my new ones so often. And when the closest one tried telling my boyfriend I was cheating with my coworker all because I introduced them and she fell for him while he hardly wanted anything to do with her, I should have stayed as far away from her as possible. But we still had the same friend group and I could have just been the bigger person and found new people to associate with however of course in high school, doing so was seen as being a coward when you decide to try and avoid a group of people after some drama. If I stayed away from her and the few others, I never would have gone back to being friends with them senior year which was one of my worst mistakes because I lost someone who I was super close to because she told him I cheated when we dated for a bit. When really I was just trying to see if she was still fake after a few red flags and when I hardly even started to hint at her about the whole story I made up, she went to him and I didn’t get the chance to tell him my plan before she did.	1640888166.0	hqkprd2	t3_rs7wwo	t3_rs7wwo	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs7wwo/if_you_could_go_back_and_relive_one_particular/hqkprd2/

wtdos	Sorry in advance for the text wall.  The Battle Off Samar in WWII, where a small American escort carrier task force (6 escort carriers (CVE), 3 destroyers (DD), and 4 destroyer escorts (DE)) known as Taffy 3 managed to hold out against one of the largest Japanese surface fleets assembled during the war (4 battleships (BB), 6 heavy cruisers (CA), 2 light cruisers (CL), and 11 destroyers) in some of the most brutal and chaotic fighting since the Guadalcanal campaign. After 2.5 hours of fighting, the Japanese force retreated with the loss of 3 CAs, 1 CL, 2 DDs, and most of the surviving ships damaged, while the American force lost just 1 CVL, 2 DDs, and 1 DE. The reasons for this could be their own separate post, I don't have space for them here. Just know that it's complicated.  ---  Some brief ship statistics first, for those unfamiliar. 'Cause this shit is bananas.  John C. Butler-class DE: 1,773 tons, two 5" guns, three 21" torpedo tubes, 24 knots, unarmored.  Fletcher-class DD: 2,500 tons, five 5" guns, ten 21" torpedo tubes, 36.5 knots, unarmored.  Casablanca-class CVE: 11,000 tons, one 5" gun, 27 aircraft, 19 knots, unarmored.  Kagerō/Yūgumo-class DD: 2,500 tons, six 5" guns, eight 24" torpedo tubes (+1 reload), 35.5 knots, unarmored.  Mogami-class CA: 13,660 tons, ten 8" guns, eight 5" guns, twelve 24" torpedo tubes (+1 reload), 35 knots, 3.9" belt armor.  Tone-class CA: 15,443 tons, eight 8" guns, eight 5" guns, twelve 24" torpedo tubes, 35 knots, 5.7" belt armor.  Kongō-class BB: 37,187 tons, eight 14" guns, sixteen 6" guns, twelve 5" guns, 30 knots, 8" belt armor.  Yamato-class BB: 73,000 tons, nine 18" guns, twelve 6" guns, twelve 5" guns, 27 knots, 16" belt armor.  ---  -[*USS Johnston (DD-557)*](https://i.imgur.com/cxFB7OO.jpg): At the beginning of the battle and without waiting for orders, *Johnston* turned around and charged the entire Japanese force by herself at flank speed. Selecting CA [*Kumano*](https://i.imgur.com/ob6BYQY.jpg) as her target, she fired 200 shells and scored ~40 hits that started fires across her superstructure while evading return fire from multiple BBs and CAs. Once in torpedo range she launched them all at *Kumano*, scoring one hit which blew the CA's bow off and left her unable to continue fighting. As *Johnston* retreated she was hit by multiple BB shells, causing significant damage and casualties, and she dipped into a rain squall for repairs. Afterwards she rejoined the fight to cover the other DDs' torpedo runs, scoring multiple hits on BB [*Haruna*](https://i.imgur.com/zsluotM.jpg) and CA [*Tone*](https://i.imgur.com/Kd9IKrC.jpg) while avoiding return fire. She then charged CA [*Haguro*](https://i.imgur.com/pkbOXz2.jpg) in an attempt to distract her from the CVEs, scoring repeated hits but only partially drawing her attention. She then spotted an entire DD squadron moving in for a torpedo attack, and charged them too; scoring 12 hits on CL [*Noshiro*](https://i.imgur.com/K0MIvEZ.jpg) before she broke off and then 5 hits on the following DD, after which the entire destroyer squadron moved to relocate away from *Johnston* after launching torpedoes from extreme range. Barely operational now she continued to fire upon multiple CAs and DDs, dealing and receiving many hits. After over 2.5 hours of fighting she's finally disabled and sunk. The captain of DD [*Yukikaze*](https://i.imgur.com/kpjf7Jm.jpg) was seen saluting her as she went down.   -[*USS Hoel (DD-533)*](https://i.imgur.com/w1S53M1.jpg): *Hoel* was the flagship of the American force's DD and DE screen, and led the charge against the Japanese fleet. She was damaged so badly by all 4 BBs on her initial attack run that multiple Japanese ships recorded her as blowing up and sinking, yet she pushed onwards and managed to get into range to launch her torpedoes. She launched her torpedoes at BBs [*Kongō*](https://i.imgur.com/sO1VFCG.jpg) and [*Yamato*](https://i.imgur.com/wQue69c.jpg), forcing both of them into evasive maneuvers that would have significant consequences. From there she continued to fight despite her damage and the fact that she was surrounded by Japanese heavy units, trading fire with multiple BBs and CAs for over 40 minutes before finally being disabled and taking around 40 hits from 2 BBs and 4 CAs, her guns firing until she was ordered to be abandoned.  -[*USS Heerman (DD-532)*](https://i.imgur.com/OqY9fLS.jpg): The only destroyer of Taffy 3 to survive the engagement, *Heermann* was with *Hoel* during the torpedo run, selecting *Haruna* and CA [*Chikuma*](https://imgur.com/fA44IRm.jpg) as her targets, scoring no hits but forcing them to evade and firing a further 260 shells at multiple BBs and CAs. She then switched targets to BB [*Nagato*](https://i.imgur.com/UnXZE53.jpg) and engaged her while suffering only minor damage, then charged *Chikuma* once again and fired over 500 shells at her, scoring ~50 hits before taking significant damage from her return fire. *Heermann* was severely damaged at this point in the battle, but continued fighting, even taking on *Tone* in conjunction with *Chikuma*, both CAs eventually falling back thanks to air attacks. *Heermann* then returned to the CVEs to continue laying smoke, and made it out of the battle with heavy damage.  -[*USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413)*](https://i.imgur.com/36bD3gu.jpg): Despite being significantly smaller, slower, and weaker than the DDs, *Samuel B. Roberts* joined *Hoel* and *Heermann* in their torpedo run against the Japanese fleet, increasing the pressure in her boilers well above the safe limit to give her the speed to keep up. She chose CA [*Chōkai*](https://i.imgur.com/A3Zs0RQ.jpg) as her target, launching her torpedoes at her and opening fire, scoring several hits with her guns and potentially one with her torpedoes. She then charged the entire line of CAs as she's taken under fire by multiple BBs and CAs, targeting *Chikuma*. In the ensuing duel *Samuel B. Roberts* would fire over 600 shells, nearly her entire ammunition supply (including anti-aircraft and star shells), along with her 20mm and 40mm AA guns, into *Chikuma*, mauling her superstructure, disabling her #3 turret, and starting chemical fires, while evading the cruiser's return fire. She switched to targets back to *Chōkai* and is then hit by fire from multiple BBs and CAs, sinking shortly after, her remaining gun firing until she was abandoned.  -The other DEs [*USS John C. Butler (DE-339)*](https://i.imgur.com/H5Aauq1.jpg), [*USS Dennis (DE-405)*](https://i.imgur.com/BRzO7uF.jpg), and [*USS Raymond (DE-431)*](https://i.imgur.com/cp1R4JM.jpg): *John C. Butler* fired off her entire ammunition supply an hour into the battle, *Raymond* fired 414 shells and all her torpedoes at *Haguro*, engaging her in combat for some time, and *Dennis* also exhausted much of her ammunition in the fight with *Haguro*. All 3 ships received moderate damage, and their smokescreen was crucial to the CVEs' survival.   The CVEs [*USS St. Lo (CVE-63)*](https://i.imgur.com/ExJhPX5.jpg), [*USS White Plains (CVE-66)*](https://i.imgur.com/igg7YA7.jpg), [*USS Kalinin Bay (CVE-68)*](https://i.imgur.com/XVxGT0s.jpg), [*USS Fanshaw Bay* (CVE-70)](https://i.imgur.com/IB1GAqf.jpg), [*USS Kitkun Bay (CVE-71)*](https://i.imgur.com/vdbUaW7.jpg), and [*USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73)*](https://i.imgur.com/S1XawSR.jpg): Despite being incredibly slow and clumsy, being colloquially known as "Combustible, Vulnerable, Expendable," and only having a single 5" stern gun for defense, only one of Taffy 3's escort carriers (*Gambier Bay*) was [sunk by Japanese gunfire](https://i.redd.it/x0oau02ufnv71.jpg) (*St. Lo* would be [lost to a kamikaze](https://i.redd.it/x965dbbx8np61.jpg) shortly after the Japanese fleet retreated). They opened up on the CAs pursuing them with their stern guns, with *St. Lo* scoring hits on *Tone*, *Kalinin Bay* on *Tone*, *Haguro* (disabling her #2 turret), and a destroyer squadron, and *White Plains* on *Chōkai* (disabling one of her turrets). All but one (*Kitkun Bay*) suffered substantial damage, with some taking upwards of dozens of shells over the course of the battle, but most of them would live to fight another day.   The aircraft: While the ships' heroics are most well known, ultimately, the aircraft of Taffys 2 and 3 did the most damage and played the largest role in turning back the Japanese fleet, being responsible for sinking 3 CAs -*Chōkai, [Chikuma](https://imgur.com/zEiblu6.jpg),* and [*Suzuya*](https://i.imgur.com/jaN2zvO.jpg)- and causing significant damage to most of the Japanese heavy units. Taken completely by surprise, all aircraft were launched from the Taffy 3 CVEs regardless of armament (depth charges, anti-personnel bombs, propaganda leaflets, no weapons at all, there were very few anti-shipping bombs or torpedoes; the ones from Taffy 2 could be properly armed for anti-ship combat and the Taffy 3 ones would be rearmed with anti-ship weapons), condition, or fuel supply. If it could fly and there was a pilot available, it took off. After expending what paltry armaments they had, the pilots would make multiple dry runs against the Japanese ships, forcing them into evasive maneuvers which both slowed them down greatly and caused significant confusion across the fleet. One American pilot flew his plane upside-down and buzzed the bridge of *Yamato*, the largest and most heavily armed battleship ever built, and unloaded his service revolver into her. Others just started throwing whatever junk they had in their cockpits at ships. Another pilot landed on a nearby Army airstrip to refuel and rearm his plane, and upon being denied service, took the Major in charge of the base hostage, holding him at gunpoint and demanding that not only his plane gets serviced, but every Navy plane that came in that day, and told the Major that if he heard about any pilots being turned away, he'd fly back and shoot him.	1640897276.0	hqldabu	t3_rsbnvn	t3_rsbnvn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsbnvn/what_story_do_you_know_about_that_youre_surprised/hqldabu/

e9793u2b	When cryptocurrencies first started appearing the argument was that in ten years you would walk into Walmart and be able to buy something with bitcoin. Then of course people asked what advantages would cryptocurrencies have over traditional currency and it was basically limited to:  * Its not centralized. * Its not traceable. However, to the average person those two points are not really advantages at all and the traceable part is questionable. Then as time went on some vendors allowed the use of cryptocurrencies but eventually most pulled out because:  * Transaction settlement times were ridiculous. * Price fluctuations during that settlement time meant the vendor ended up rolling the dice on rather they would eat the loss.   So then more cryptocurrencies started to appear because they would fix the issues of the original bitcoin:  * Bitcoin has a fixed amount of coins so it can't grow. * Appearantly the blockchain design for bitcoin results in the transaction time problems. * Bitcoin wasn't ever really a cryptocurrency it's more like gold and should be used as a store value.   So these other cryptocurrencies started to appear but now we have dozens. Some of which are clearly jokes. I kept reading that newer cryptocurrencies still suffered from transaction time issues but then the developers said they had fixes coming down the line to resolve those but who knows if they ever came.  Now I am hearing that the value of cryptocurrencies is not the currency itself but rather the technology behind it like blockchain.  I dont know. The whole thing feels like a monster that kept getting fed to stay under control but now is roaming free. Everytime the cryptocurrency market hits a road bump it's a huge list of reasons why it's not a problem and how the goals have changed. Its crazy.  That isn't to say people won't make money. People are making out like bandits but eventually someone is going to be left holding the bag.	1640897808.0	hqleno0	t3_rs49bc	t1_hqk6ydn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs49bc/what_was_ruined_because_too_many_people_started/hqleno0/

I’m really a Libertarian, but on a practical level I vote Republican because I’m a small business owner and a fervent 2A advocate, and the Republicans are undeniably better **for me** in those regards.  Not saying that those two things are the only reasons I lean and vote right… there are many others — but for those two reasons I vote Republican especially on a local level.	1640908055.0	hqm45iq	t3_rs6sap	t3_rs6sap	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqm45iq/

15m7o8	I would say I'm agnostic, but the main reasons are:   1. What reason does an omnipotent and omniscient being have to create humanity or the Universe or any reason for that matter? If God can do anything and already knows everything that will ever happen, what is the point?   2. The idea of judgment, in Christianity for example. How is it fair to doom someone to eternal torment or paradise for what they did during one human lifetime?   3. Is what makes one culture's religion more right or real than another's? What about a tribe living on an isolated island with no contact with the outside world, how are they suppose to learn about whatever the "real" religion is? Would that be fair to condemn them to eternal torment because they did not believe in God, given the circumstances they were born in did not give the opportunity for them to even know about it?   I feel like I am agnostic because I want to believe that there is a greater purpose for us, and that there's a reason why everything is here, but because of the above I just can't drive myself to have faith in a religion.   One last thing, I don't mean to offend anyone, I respect everyone's religious beliefs, these are just my views and what I think of the question being asked.	1640917747.0	hqmqgfl	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqmqgfl/

9w25m	He'd always been a bit of a dick but I liked him well enough and had known him forever.  The last couple hangouts went iffy and then the final stray came when I took him out with some friends to a local bar and let him use the ID I used before I was 21.  He gets in there and starts acting a damn fool after a couple of drinks, drawing all sorts of attention and bothering other tables before getting up and slow dancing with himself when the dance floor is empty.  We finally just leave to keep from having it become a legal thing and then he's dropped himself to the ground in the gravel of the parking lot and is making snow...gravel angels.  I just left his ass there.  I think a buddy ended up giving him a ride home, but the whole thing just pissed me off.  One, the behavior in general.  Two, the fact that I did him a solid and he didn't respect or appreciate it enough to not act a dickhead when my ass is involved in some way.

g3u3kga2	After years of secretly sabotaging my personal relationships and borrowing money, clothes, booze and social contacts, the last straw was when she asked to borrow clothes for a music festival which I was also going to.  I lent her stuff I didn't mind her not returning, and handed the stuff over on site.  She then ignored me and avoided me (we were there with different groups) all weekend and I just dropped the rope completely.  I've pretty much gone no contact now, and she's on a major info diet, and thankfully she's been outed for the manipulative, two faced narcissist that she is.  I lost so much because of her, especially people, but more fool them because eventually she'll bleed them dry too.	1640919483.0	hqmu8es	t3_rs8cdg	t3_rs8cdg	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs8cdg/what_was_the_last_straw_that_caused_you_to_stop/hqmu8es/

7cme2mrc	After Columbine, a lot of schools went into panic mode and cranked security up to 11.  I grew up in a community fairly similar to Littleton and my high school was fairly similar to Columbine. It didn't take much imagination to see how something like that could happen at my high school.  In the weeks following the Columbine shooting, my school probably got evacuated three or four times. The school admins/faculty pretended it was a fire drill. But not all of us were stupid. It didn't take a genius to figure out that somebody had called in a bomb threat.  The second time we got evacuated, I realized that we students were being taken to the school's football stadium just like last time. Sitting in those bleachers waiting for the cops to give us the all clear was when I was the most frightened. Because I realized that IF some maniac was determined to set off a bomb, he knew exactly how the school would respond and he also knew exactly where to rig up the bomb for maximum carnage.  Thankfully, the bomb threats were all called in by students who understood the seriousness of the security measures but all they wanted was to skip a test or something. But I've thought a lot about how different things might've been if the threats had been called in by someone who was serious about hurting other people. Needless to say, he wouldn't have had any problems or surprises. And even now, that chills my blood.	1640920078.0	hqmvhoi	t3_rsc2ih	t3_rsc2ih	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsc2ih/people_of_reddit_whats_the_scariest_thing_thats/hqmvhoi/

6jdi3r6v	It's a real pity this "ideal reality" you are describing is in fact fictional, doesn't exist, and never will, and composers have had to put up with the lush, full bodied sound of the orchestral string section (that sounds nothing like a the cutting and brilliant sound of a solo violin) for three hundred years. The reason that composition classes advise that you *never* have two violins alone play the same passage, either one or three or more, is because real violinists can never hit exactly the same note at the same time, and with two the difference in tuning sounds godawful. The sound of forty first violins playing in unison sounds that way because they are all playing slightly different notes, (by a few cents here, not a lot), which, again, is a completely different timbre to a solo violin.	1640925092.0	hqn5u5s	t3_rs5xuu	t1_hqn324i	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs5xuu/whats_a_controversial_music_opinion_that_you_have/hqn5u5s/

3qi5w	I grew up in a strongly atheist household. Started reading the Bible and going to church in high school as a weird form of rebellion. I wanted to believe, but after a few years I had too much of twisting my mind into a pretzel trying to make sense of why all this extra story made sense. I enjoyed the people and the church very closely followed the teachings of the Bible, but I found their arguments for the existence of one specific higher power and one single story teaching the whole of salvation to be lacking. They were pretty weak. So, I left.   I don't consider myself a strong atheist now, but lemme tell you, I don't miss the religious way of living one bit. My mind feels far clearer by tuning all of that noise out. I'd rather focus on reality.	1640933311.0	hqnk83v	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqnk83v/

iaxw1	Lefty: if the right were to make permanent generous child subsidies/tax credits, made long-acting birth control free and readily available, supported major increases in financial support for the foster system and made daycare/preschool free at point-of-service for most Americans and the cost of the all that was that abortion was fully illegal in nearly all cases (with exceptions for truly heinous/dangerous circumstances), I would make that deal without a second's hesitation.   Also, a question: how do I interpret the fact that many of the top comments are right-leaning people saying they support environmental reform, conservation and action on climate change? Is it that reddit is younger than average and one day climate change etc will cease to be a partisan issue (in which case I can experience genuine hope for the first time in what feels like two years) or simply that the few right-leaning people who feel that way are getting upvoted?	1640939201.0	hqnsexe	t3_rs6sap	t3_rs6sap	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqnsexe/

Buyer didn't qualify for the loan.  Property management company said to let the buyers move in, pay the mortgage and they'd re-apply for the loan in a year.  Tenants still failed to qualify.

11spo9	Agnosticism I understand logically.  But I think both theists and atheists overstate the logical underpinnings of their cases.  They proclaim certainty where blind faith is ultimately what upholds their view.  Whether they realize that or not.  At least based on my limited understanding of what science currently has the answers for.  Which is why I don't understand how one goes from believing in a god(s) to starting that they have logically determined that there is no god(s).  It's one thing to prove you can't be sure, quite another thing to prove it doesn't exist.	1640942949.0	hqnx52f	t3_rsczdn	t1_hqnnsz5	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqnx52f/

Me and you also go into cryogenic sleep but in a spaceship far from earth.   Those 100 would eventually repopulate the earth and over the span of 1000’s to possibly hundreds of thousands of years we would rediscover in some form of another mathematics and science. It wouldn’t be 1 for 1 the same obviously, but a^2+b^2=c^2, F=ma E=mC^2 would all eventually come to be. It took our current generation ~3500 years to go from that first formula to the third. Then finally some smart person will give a good idea on how we came to be involving a Big Bang.  This wouldn’t happen with religion. You wouldn’t have Christianity, Islam etc and the stories/prophets would be very different.	1640944726.0	hqnzc9z	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqnzc9z/

Do rocks have genders? It’s sth like that. Not everything has to have a gender.   I also speak a non gendered language, so it’s easier for us to not think in genders for everything	1640944768.0	hqnze3o	t3_rspcru	t3_rspcru	/r/AskReddit/comments/rspcru/what_gender_does_your_god_have/hqnze3o/

Now let's say it came to light that for decades my entire marketing department had been committing unspeakable acts against millions of children and instead of owning up to it had been covering it up, my operations department had been destroying the families of its employees because their daughters simply decided they liked girls better than boys, and my logistics department had been carving out large swaths of the middle east, massacring hundreds of people indiscriminatly because "I willed it." Now because I know everything my employees do there's no doubt that I knew what was happening, the shareholder know for a fact that I let all of this shit go down and did nothing.

I received a scruffy stuffed toy that wasn't wrapped, and was massively disappointed. Two girls approached me later on and one asked if I'd liked my gift. I said "no, it's not even clean". The second girl looked kinda sad and they both walked away. Looking back on it, that poor girl was likely the one to gift me the toy, and wanted to know if I liked her gift. And I was just a fuckwit of a child, with the social skills of a steamed banana.

So the vision that differed from a dream was probably a near-death experience.	1640951231.0	hqo7ezy	t3_rsc2ih	t3_rsc2ih	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsc2ih/people_of_reddit_whats_the_scariest_thing_thats/hqo7ezy/

9r8b4igh	I use this wild thing called logic. I believe in what can proven. Faith is for those who can’t accept reality. Most religions placate man’s ego by representing our species to be more important than we are. Every religion was created to control the populace and keep them as docile as possible.   I could go on and on. The point is this: if you want to believe in religion I could care less. I’m not an atheist because it helps me in any way. I’m an atheist because that’s just the reality of the universe. I’m not looking for salvation. I’m looking for forgiveness of “sin”. I gain nothing by being atheist. There’s no community of people that also believe in my mythology (because it’s not a mythology).   I believe in what is real and higher powers are not real. They are figments of the imagination of man. Fantasies. Absurdities that many believe in because they don’t have the mental capacity to understand the complexities of the universe that prove their religion false.   I don’t mean to be insulting, but I’m sure this will seem rather harsh. When presented with this question atheists will provide you with facts. Statements about reality. A religious person presented this same question cannot do that. They can present absurd stories and reasons like faith. Which is foolishness. I’m sorry, if you’re religious, you’re just flat wrong. Believe whatever you want. Seriously. But know that you’re wrong and it’s been proven time and time again. Get over the fear of being wrong and start looking into it.	1640951787.0	hqo85mp	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqo85mp/

84phe6s5	Honestly one of the things that bothers me about the depiction of these small women in the MCU(Scarlett Johansson and others) twirling around and wrapping they're legs around a 240 pound built dude is that no amount of spy/assassin training in all of mother Russia can get around the fact that dude does one arm dumbbell presses with more weight than she carries. Sure a woman can punch a guy in the face and nuts or poke his eyeballs. But trying to out physical him just doesn't work.  I'm way past my prime. But I'm still a big guy. In would say a petite but confident woman who has trained in boxing or martial arts could out punch and kick me. But if I got a hold of her it'd be over. She wouldn't stand a chance at that point. I could just use my body weight to on her down. But I'm too old to want to find out.	1640951801.0	hqo869x	t3_rskugv	t3_rskugv	/r/AskReddit/comments/rskugv/a_petite_woman_says_i_could_take_you_in_a_fight/hqo869x/

574kz0fl	>I suppose my question is...what do you think the grandfather should have done? What would be the logical response here?    Honestly it really depends on factors we don't know.  If they grandfather did have enough knowledge of the bible to understand that the priest wasn't not acting in accordance, they could have left Catholicism in favor of a sect that followed the bible and left all the added bullshit of religion behind. That seems unlikely if the kid was young so I don't assume that choice was considered. But as he got older, at some point you can imagine he would have made the distinction between what the bible taught and what priest did and realized the bible wasn't part of the problem (in that particular case).  To dismiss the bible forever because a priest sinned against God seems very odd.  I get that there's an association with all things that fall under the category of religion, but to grow up and never make that distinction seems to indicate to me that the kid never really studied the bible and therefore in his mind the bible was completely tied to the actions of the church and the priest who violated him.   The trauma something like that can cause is incredible to the point that I don't blame the grandpa for leaving the church and religion at that time. But because his primary stated reason for leaving wasn't actually tied to the bible but a person/institution, I'd think he'd make the realization that the bible itself had nothing to do with what happened to him as a kid. Similarly, protestants who *study* the bible don't attend the mega churches with their private-jet millionaire preachers. That's the protestant version of social Catholicism. Christians who really study the bible are far less concerned with the practices of the church, as they only really care about whether those practices align with the teachings found in their holy book.  Although I don't believe a word of it, I do have a certain respect for people who bypass all aspects of religion and go straight to the source for their own understanding.    TL;DR OP's grandfather made a great choice to leave the church based on what happened to him. I don't think it was fair for him to completely dismiss what he supposedly believed in the bible because of the priest/churches sinful action, as they were in contradiction with each other.    Understand I know how this must sound coming from a fellow atheist and I'm happy for OP's grandfather and whole family from getting out from under the clutches of religion.	1640954174.0	hqobh4k	t3_rsczdn	t1_hqo585h	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqobh4k/
brrwo9j1	I think you’re placing the burden of explanation on ‘non-believers’ with your phrasing while you guys are the ones that should have to come up with a damn good reason for your position      Why should I believe in god, why should I be a part of organized religion which has committed countless atrocities across history, that has been a catalyst for some of the most depraved things humanity has ever done?      Why should I believe this massive claim with nothing to back it up at all, with thin air to back it up?      It is you, it is all who claim religion in their life that should feel a need to explain why you believe some thing that somehow billions of other people don’t believe, you have the burden of proof. Just because religion has a history of being fed to those who couldn’t read the books they were being told contained a holy afterlife doesn’t mean anything— it doesn’t mean that it is ‘abnormal’ to not believe    In the world we have now there is no inherent reason to believe unless you’re roped into somehow in your formative years. When I say I don’t believe no heads should turn, and people that do believe are not ‘above’, you are not the default    I believe in people, and connection and decency to all people, which is more than most religions seem to in action believe in, more than these leaders actually preach in between words written thousands of years ago we have no basis for    It’s so typical yet telling to phrase a question like this, like you’re the default, that belief is the default. If you’re outside of it and left to your own rational devices, I think almost no one on their own would ever think religion makes sense with all the information we have now	1640954178.0	hqobhcq	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqobhcq/

I hate forced representation. I don't want a character that's whole personality is being the minority. It's annoying. I'm a minority, several actually, I don't want to be giving talks about how I "made it". I don't want to be inspirational.  America is too obsessed with race, my country is too. I'm not dismissing racism. America has a terrible history with it. Again, I'm not American but your media mentions it a lot and I fail to see the relevance a lot.  The media twists things to fit their agenda. Most obvious one lately was the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. I had one opinion when I watched the news, another when I watched the trial.  Are the police that bad to the point you want them disbanded? Of course they have a bias, my country's police are shit too.

6inru	How are my core left-wing ideals that I described incompatible with those views expressed by the commenter I was replying to? I don't see it, please explain.  I agree that sex and gender identity are not the same. The former is a description of material biological reality, and the latter is a thought or a belief about oneself. People can believe whatever they like of course, but this redefinition of women and men in terms of an expressed self-belief, rather than biological reality, makes no sense to me.  By accepting this bizarre premise that people can identify into the opposite sex, we end up with absurd statements like "men can get pregnant" and "that's a woman's penis and testicles". I mean, come on - how can you actually believe this?	1640959027.0	hqojkza	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqofn28	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqojkza/
4dpxhxym	I want to add that this kind of thing isn't set in stone. Everyone is affected by their upbringing in some way or another. Some people had supportive parents, some had absent parents, some grew up alone with no siblings and some had so many they felt ignored. Everyone comes from a different place with different "damage", so it's important to be able to see how people communicate and to be willing to meet someone halfway.   Both my partner and I had a lot of *very different* traumas as children. His family was overbearing, calculating, coercive and dogmatic. Mine was loud, hateful, vindictive and neglectful. We had *very* different coping strategies we developed just to survive as kids.  As a result, my response to an argument was FIGHT, while his was freeze. My parents would bellow at me over what a fuckup I was and how I'll be dead on the street because I'm worthless, and his would silently judge him and say "you know who you are (and by disobeying my will, you're not being 'yourself')."  We both had to / have to do a lot of self-reflection and therapy and try and stop these malignant patterns of behavior. I had to trust that he wouldn't reject me. He had to trust that I wouldn't shame him.  I had to learn that he needs a moment of silence to collect his thoughts. I also learned to take a damn moment and calm down before thinking, because I'm not under attack with him like I was with my family.   And even if you do find someone you feel you can grow with, and it doesn't work, you've still grown as a person.  Even if you're a complete trainwreck and she's a big ol' clusterfuck, if you work on yourselves together, you could be a Cool Truck.  https://imgur.com/a/4Jtyrh3	1640959035.0	hqojlj0	t3_rskw51	t1_hqo9mfu	/r/AskReddit/comments/rskw51/what_are_signs_a_guy_hasnt_matured/hqojlj0/
11ijle	Yes. A land invasion is only possible from Mexico and Canada. The US would easily out number them, just with gun owning citizens. So that's not really an option  Ships would be bombed on the way there  Subs would too, although I don't doubt some would make it close enough to the US to fire bombs  Jets would be able to make it but they'd be out of fuel by the time they got there except over by Alaska..   The US is positioned that it would hold its own in defense assuming theres a competent leader at the time. The only good option is nukes. The US China and Russia have a lot of them.

fztun627	I remember as a kid asking my (religious) dad something along the lines of: “In different eras and places people believed in religions we consider “mythology” nowadays, like how the greeks believed in many gods and today we see them as myths... so in the future our religion will probably become a “myth” too, right?” (obviously I wasn’t perfectly articulate, I must have been 10 years old or something). The point is, he didn’t have an answer for me. He was just like “No, our religion is different, it’s not the same as a myth.” The thing is, my dad was usually very open minded and willing to discuss many things with me in reasonable manner. He would always try answering any “curiosities” I had. The fact that he didn’t give me any proper answer made me realize that what I was being told to believe... maybe... made no sense. I didn’t  immediately stop believing, but it was always in the back of my mind. I never looked at religion quite the same way after that, like it had an inherently “nonsensical” component to it that stopped me from fully believing.	1640959043.0	hqojm4h	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqojm4h/

7pqlikfc	I can concur with this. Late 20’s had zero confidence till now (still sorta don’t) recently started dating more girls till I met my gf who’s a whole ass doctor. All I did was take her on a simple coffee date and treat he like a normal person, not say some weird sexual comment, or put my hand down her pants. She was super into that… AKA just not being a creeper. The. When she came to my own house it was game over. She saw I had a bedroom, a kitchen with a regular wood table, and a clean bathroom and I cooked a simple meal for her. Her panties dropped because I’m just an average person.

5jpddxso	Your ex might’ve been a total loser, but tbh I have been guilty of getting a wave of motivation (fitness, saving money, eating healthier, whatever) and wanting to push it on my partner when they aren’t in the same headspace. It’s one thing to say “hey we need to save money because of these bills, I’m going to try to reduce a, b, c. Are there things you can think of to help cut down as well?” And another to say “I’m giving up a, b, and c and you should give up x, y, and z”. The first is coming to a solution together and the second is acting as a parental figure. Your partner might want to kill the Netflix subscription altogether and eat rice all day if it means keeping the gaming OR they might have something else entirely that could reduce expenses. If they’re also genuinely fine with the apartment and disagree with you that the need even exists, that’s something that needs to be sorted out, but not really a maturity issue imo	1640960785.0	hqon0xy	t3_rskw51	t1_hqnotv3	/r/AskReddit/comments/rskw51/what_are_signs_a_guy_hasnt_matured/hqon0xy/

It's the fear that determines their behavior. Most people's behavior and choices in general stem from some kind of fear. I get it.   I'm ok with the unknown. I'm ok with the random. I think it's beautiful in its own scary way.  Do you remember before you were born? Nope.

9dzp0k0c	I was schooled in a fundamentalist Christian school, where everything is taken literally. Jonah did live in a belly of a whale, this was not taken as an allegory. The Bible was taken as a prophecy book in which everything in Revelations was going to happen and we needed to always be looking for the “signs of the ends times.”  While my parents believed the Bible was literal, they also believed in asking questions. Well, that doesn't go over politely when you are an inquisitive kid in a room full of adult conspiracy theorists.   I didn't fully pull away from Christianity until I was in my early 20s, but I remember the final moment. I had moved in with a guy (now husband) before marriage and my sister had a lot of feelings about this. I visited her and the family for easter and was genuinely excited to see everyone. When I got to the house I was rushed by her and told to get in the car we are going to church. She looked down at my niece, who was maybe 5yrs old, and said Aunty needs Jesus. My heart dropped.  I was so deflated and hurt by her for portraying me to my very indoctrinated, child niece as a “bad person.” Mind you, I helped raise this child for the first 4yrs of her life.  I went to their church, and during the sermon I realized...A lot.  First off, the self-induced fluttery superior feelings were gone. I realized that I looked at the preacher as just a man. He was just a man and his sermon didn't address real life problems with real advice. And the worship songs no longer made me feel invincible.  When my time to leave came I took a minute to find my niece, she was playing in her toy kitchen (females in Christian households🤷‍♀️). She was cooking “eggs.” I asked if I could have a big hug before I go, but if she didn't want to that was okay too.  She came around and threw her arms around my neck and squeezed (she gave the absolute best hugs). I sucked up my tears, but she could tell I was sad. She threw her legs up, squeezed me, and said “I love you, aunty.”  At this point I wanted ball, instead, I told her that I loved her and that I would always love her no matter what.  My sister came in asked how was everything going. This was odd and then I realized that because I was living a non-Christian life then I could no longer be trusted around the children I helped to raise.   When I left I cried the whole way home. My crying was for an array of things. See, life was really good for me at that point. I was falling in love with an amazing person, I was doing great in college and I was promoted at work, but no one wanted to know this part of my life. The person my family knew had died and they were going to try to resurrect that person with every once of judgment that they could muster. And suddenly, I realized I was on the outside looking in.   My “fall” from God (Look I even uppercased it! Old habits die hard) did not just come from hurt and alienation. It was a trickle effect from the God in the Bible that is selfish and punishes people from a moral high ground, but somehow this is perceived as love. This is not love. It took me years to understand that love should never come with judgment, especially the love you show yourself.	1640963866.0	hqoti73	t3_rsczdn	t3_rsczdn	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsczdn/to_all_the_atheists_what_is_your_reason_for_not/hqoti73/
6wbooqro	USA. I'm Communist on ground level, democratic-socialist government level. Kind of a hippie. And USMC veteran.   Our military still needs to be good.  Throughout history we can see a pattern.   Strong nation gets uppity.   Weak nation gets genocided by strong nation.   I dont think for one second our military needs to have more bases around the world than there are countries. Our military shouldn't be doing what it's doing in other countries. Its imperialism and it's disgusting.   But  If we are to let our military fall behind Russia or China it's fair to say we will be invaded genocided or become Russian/Chinese citizens.   Saying otherwise is in my opinion is ignorant and detrimental to our survival.	1640964448.0	hqout98	t3_rs6sap	t3_rs6sap	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqout98/

We find a guy and after waiting around for nearly an hour, this guy comes back, but we refuse to buy it and walk away. This guy and his colleagues grab both of us by the arm and walk us along the beach and then to this sketchy area of town whilst saying stuff in broken English like they will kill us and all that shit as we walk. We we're both really shocked and they obviously knew it. This guy pulls up on his motorcycle taxi and starts questioning these guys and after a few minutes he pretty much tells these guys to fuck off and he pushes us into his cab, drives away and drops us off at our hotel.

711ah2ph	“extemporal creator” carries no more weight than a Disney princess.  The problem with religionists and self-identified christians is the foray and meddling into public life. Such as we’ve seen over the past decade and especially with your friend mr. trump.  Your lot has had to be dragged literally kicking and screaming through nearly every societal evolution of the past 2000 years.

Don’t get me wrong, some people really overdo it while sometimes it can save you trouble. Why trust someone 100%? Why not test to see if you are loyal first?  I ask questions I already know the answer to, just to see if someone is full of shit and it saved me MANY MANY MANY mistakes.

17dgy8	In Pittsburgh 2001 my friends & I were walking to our apartments after school and we noticed a block ahead there were two older homeless men yelling at each other. By the time we made it to the intersection the argument had come to blows & as we crossed the intersection we heard one of them scream “AGH, HE STABBED ME!” And sure enough the other one had shanked him and then bolted. My friends & I were so freaked out we turned and ran to a nearby CVS and asked for a phone to call police.  Once we explained what had happened a CVS employee accompanied us the short walk back to the scene of the crime. Now two people were tending to the stabbed man (luckily one of them was a nurse) and another guy was calling 911 on his cell phone. The homeless man was laying on the sidewalk, a pool of blood had formed around him, the nurse was applying pressure to the stab wound in his ribs, the CVS employee had removed his jacket, balled it up and used it to elevate the homeless man’s head, all the while my friends & I just kind of looked on horrified.  But the worst thing I saw that day was that poor homeless man, as the ambulance arrived and EMTs hurried to help him he just began sobbing angrily and, through labored breaths, telling the EMTs to let him die. He sounded so sad and hopeless.  The scene of a crying elderly homeless man in a pool of his own blood is one that I don’t think will ever leave my mind.	1640974528.0	hqpj7r8	t3_rshaxo	t3_rshaxo	/r/AskReddit/comments/rshaxo/whats_the_worst_thing_youve_seen_someone_do_in/hqpj7r8/

11spo9	Based on other discussions within this thread, I'm thinking my idea of "the universe" does not line up with the current scientific definition, due to my lack of understanding of time... I've never thought of time as being a part of the universe, rather just something to measure it with, but I will be doing some further reading.  But in answer to your question, I've always thought of "the universe" as the physical matter and the fundamental forces that govern it.

g7qjzccw	My sister had a nervous breakdown yesterday. So her husband brought her to my house to try and calm her down. Her phone is missing and she said she thinks she is losing her mind and thinks she is going to die. I got her to sleep some and she finally admitted to me that she asked her husband (who she has two kids with) for a divorce.   I offered to help him find her phone at their house. And it is horrible. Like a hoarder's house. It  made me sob cuz my niece and nephew live there. So I took the kids and told them they can't come back to that house until it is clean. They spent the night with me.  I offered to do all their laundry. And then, my washer flooded my kitchen twice. This was all yesterday.  Today, found out my sister has 1) been asking for a divorce for years from my BIL 2) cheated on him. So I am can't blame him for being mad (my empathy only goes so far considering historically he has not been great).   Also, BIL definitely stole her phone to look thru it. He changed the password and returned it today. So my sister is staying at her friend's house tonight with the kids. He is staying at a co-workers house.   And we got a plumber out today and our whole sewer line needs to be replaced. It'll cost around $5,000. So that was also great news.  Oh. And tomorrow is my birthday. I was supposed to go out with friends but instead I'll be spending tomorrow cleaning out their house so those kids have a home.	1640986014.0	hqqaohx	t3_rsvl24	t3_rsvl24	/r/AskReddit/comments/rsvl24/last_day_of_2021_what_u_doing_today/hqqaohx/
inszn	Unpopular opinion but I think porn is the main driver behind the current fitness trend, especially male fitness.   You cannot tell me young (and older) men taking massive amounts of caffeine, counting calories and spending hours in the gym, to achieve what they think is an attractive body is driven solely by sex and not health or fitness.   There's nothing healthy about building your body to become so unnaturally large that it requires enough food daily to feed 3 people.  It's great to take care of your body and eat right but there are so many taking it to extremes and viewing it as normal.  Young males watching porn thinking that kind of body is what attracts women is doing a lot of mental and physical harm.	1640986039.0	hqqaqix	t3_rt0jkr	t1_hqptv1h	/r/AskReddit/comments/rt0jkr/when_the_ballpoint_pen_was_invented_people/hqqaqix/

df4pm7i0	I grew up in a traditional Martial Arts family that has a few schools across the south east of the UK. This whole notion of taking on the guy with a gun or even a knife comes from the meathead MMA crowd. Ever since I was a kid the only people I’ve ever seen pretending like they can grab a loaded gun out of someone’s hands are those people. They think because they can take a punch in the face they are invincible which of course they aren’t. They stand there week in, week out, with their compliant Uke, grabbing that fake gun thinking they’re the shit. Until they aren’t. Our style of Karate has some prearranged ‘blocks’ (sequences of movements with a partner) that can be used as knife defense but on the whole we teach that if there’s a knife or a gun you either comply or you flee. You only engage actual attacks, not attempt to grab a knife or a gun. Preservation and living another day is the priority, not acting like a badass because you can get punched twenty times in a row.  Any martial arts school that teaches you to grab for a gun when it is aimed at you is a joke.	1641119883.0	hqx6nhj	t3_ru2wto	t1_hqwx9xo	/r/AskReddit/comments/ru2wto/what_is_a_survival_myth_that_is_completely_wrong/hqx6nhj/

8ql83	Did you get lost because of this or something? While this shouldn't be considered an absolute rule, it shouldn't be considered an absolute myth either. It just depends on where you are, because this rule only works under certain conditions. It can be helpful in forests in Colorado for example, where it's typically dry and sunny year round. In Washington state where it's cloudy and wet all the time, this won't work. Also, even if you're in Colorado where this can work, make sure to look for moss on many trees and rocks. If the moss is consistently only on one side of many different objects, then that is most likely the north side of those objects. Another Colorado tip is to look for Aspen trees if you need to know which way is North. Unlike moss, they grow best on South facing slopes of mountains where there is more sunlight. This can be useful if you are lost and have a wide view of the landscape. Neither "rule" is absolute, but depending where you are, (especially if you're in a dry sunny mountainous climate like Colorado in the Northern Hemisphere) these two tips can actually be helpful for finding North.	1641119978.0	hqx6rmo	t3_ru2wto	t1_hqwviht	/r/AskReddit/comments/ru2wto/what_is_a_survival_myth_that_is_completely_wrong/hqx6rmo/

I genuinely don't get how the things that held your interest when you were 6 still hold your interest when you're 36. You're supposed to grow, to progress on to more interesting things, but somehow that doesn't happen. From the perspective of people who did grow out of that stuff at age 12, seeing someone who still hasn't, decades later... it just seems sad. You can't really ask them about it, because they're so defensive, though.	1641121649.0	hqx8s8b	t3_rt5r4k	t1_hqx6uzl	/r/AskReddit/comments/rt5r4k/what_is_the_most_massively_overrated_film_of_all/hqx8s8b/

pvfeq	Men always say, that they want women to be more straightforward, and open about what they want, because we don't understand them. Daily question on this sub, is why women do not initiate. Men hate teasing, and having to work hard, and put in time and effort, to get to women. Then, if the woman is open about wanting to have sex, men promptly start to ridicule her (only of course, if she wants to have sex with someone else). The woman is easygoing, and fun, if wants to have sex with said man, but is free, and a slut, if she has a lot of sex with other men.  Just because it came up in other comments, again, this whole lock and key argument is the stupidest fucking shit, I've ever heard.  Men, especially good looking men with high social status, are going to reject women they don't like, just as much as women reject men, they don't like. There are a lot of average/above average women out there, who aim high, and because of that, they struggle to find a partner. So they might be easy, but only for a certeaing group of men.  If you are willing to sleep with anything that moves, it is going to be easy to rack up the numbers. And if you are putting your standard high, it is going to take time and effort to find partners, who can meet it, regardless of your sex/gender. Even if you are willing to bang on the first date.	1641123412.0	hqxawje	t3_ru6nz7	t3_ru6nz7	/r/AskReddit/comments/ru6nz7/whats_so_terrible_about_a_woman_being_free_and/hqxawje/

I worked for a fulfillment center for three years and the last six months were the best considering I was at a computer station fixing other people's fuck ups and even then it was physically and EMOTIONALLY draining. Most people who work their are sour, rude and trashy. And the although you say most managers are psychopaths... I wager to say they are just regular folk who are deeply brainwashed and just want their bonuses and 2 week vacations after peak.

We're in the water and my cousin "accidentally" slipped, got ontop of me taking me deeper to the water so that he could have his head ontop of the water. I'm slipping deeper and deeper. It was my first time in any kind of environment with water. Never went to the beach and whatnot so i never learned to swim.  Lifeguard saved me. My older brother wasnt near me but tried his hardest to save me. My cousin who got on top of me turns out could swim and my cousin's brother tried to save the lifeguard for whatever reason lol.  I'm 25yrs old. Ever since then, i rejected going to the beach or lake.

2owtu6az	 For me, and I would guess everyone posting, there is a ridiculous amount of insights that change from your 20's. Wherever you are now even just 3 years can put you in a completely different situation and state of mind.   Here's the stuff I would have said myself decades back:   >* First steps are the hardest.  >* Many small steps gets you to where you want to be.  >* Consistency keeps you focused.   >* Failing is OK. Failing fast enables you to learn fast.   >* Taking the right amount breaks encourages growth.  >* We ignore words more now and watch how people act. Some of the most externally vile people have hearts of gold. Some of the most pleasant people will use the sh*t out of you.   >* We care less about what people think. It matters, just not as much as it used to. I am who I am weaknesses and all. Took a while to find my core values I can't change, and the ones I can work on.   >* I stop when I realize I'm not happy. Reevaluating the situation is harder when you're younger. No experience to play from. Stop playing that game if there's no value for you. Stop seeing that person ... etc. It's sad but it's OK to let go. Hurts a lot more and longer, holding on to something you shouldn't be.  >* Value is subjective. Money is the easiest metric but love, challenge, comfort, and time, they matter. Sometime you have to sacrifice one for the other and the most important one might shift fairly quickly. You can make some really nice moves if you know what someone values and provide them with it.  >* My core support system/close friends are few but man are they tight. Lots of friends is nice and keeps things fun, but having someone you can trust and rely on when your confused, under pressure, or just making the wrong decisions, is beyond valuable. They'll tell me I'm being an idiot, or I'm wrong, ... or if I got literal sh*t on my face.  >* Oh ProgrammersAtelier, get started on your investments early, a little grows into a lot. Start small and no touchy   Man I was miserable as kid. Don't know if any of this would have helped the journey.   Enough ranting... please don't take this as truth.   It's just one persons perspective. Oh guess one last one, "Form your own opinion". Each situation is different. Each person is different. No need to follow but the more perspectives you can relate to the better the decision.  Take what you like, change what you want. I fully expect to be roasted by the internet for being pretentious or something, but if it can provide value to someone why the F not. And ... if it doesn't ... let the spitfires go off and call it day	1642717893.0	htipoc3	t3_s8g3r7	t3_s8g3r7	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8g3r7/30_redditors_what_do_adults_in_their_20s_just/htipoc3/

62zyo	I dated a girl for three months following a misunderstanding (e.g. I asked her friend out, but due to the language barrier- or maybe intentional by the friend- she ended up with my sweet note, I didn't know until she showed up at the bar).  I never told her, knowing it'd make her feel terrible and risk hurting her friendship.    I was her first.    The relationship was rocky.  With zero dating experience, we were going from one mini-crisis to another.  For example, she had her friend run a background check on me to see if I was lying about not being married.  I wasn't.  She was regularly juggling advice from her friends on how to navigate our budding romance.   I'm glad the relationship ended, but I feel guilty being her first time and she wasn't even the one I was chasing.	1642725684.0	htj7rmh	t3_s8ovtk	t3_s8ovtk	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8ovtk/whats_your_dirty_lil_secret/htj7rmh/

3km235js	Pretty sad story. I was in McDonald's waiting for his order comments on a tarot pin I had on my jacket.  Guy: that's a cool pin  Me: thank you Guy: where'd you get it and what is it made out of?  Me: it was actually a christmas gift from a friend I don't actually know but a quick Google search should get you there.  Guy: yea but like what's it made out of? some of that stuff can be amplified by satellites that shoot microwaves and turns it into a microphone.  Me: oh idk I'll have to look up later what it's made out of cause that sure sounds scary. ( Just politely trying to exit the conversation back to silence ) Guy: yea I keep em out with these. ( He lifted up his shirt and had what appeared to be a few television remote controls ducted tape to his bare skin )   This was years ago and I think about it all the time. That dude probably had schizophrenia or going through some shit and he was completely calm with what he was talking about. He seemed washed and dressed normally not on any sort of substances. What happens to some minds, at random , scares the crap out of me.	1642727814.0	htjcppv	t3_s8t52h	t3_s8t52h	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8t52h/what_did_somebody_say_that_made_you_think_this/htjcppv/

I don't have a partner for it so I do it to myself. It's very weird I guess but it is indeed a dirty secret. I have a few videos I love mainly because the woman is brought to ecstasy. I was in training for a while and I was deeply in love with my Master but he left to see the country and I was not in a position to go with him.

bwj99	I kind of didn't finish highschool.  I don't acknowledge this fact ever. I have a decent paying IT job. I was sick with recurrent pneumonia and fell behind in highschool. In my senior year it was determined I wouldn't be able to graduate until summer school, and I would be getting just the basic diploma when I had originally been on a more advanced track. I was working already, and was just so discouraged with school. I talked to my mom, and she reluctantly agreed. I was taking IT classes sponsored by the school system, so we talked with the director of that program and they came up with a scheme to allow me to continue the IT classes but effectively drop out. I became a "homeschool student", which let me stay in the program and also avoided hurting the school's graduation rate.  I never lie. I never state that I graduated or have a diploma. I'll refer to "finishing" highschool or whatever. It was more of an issue years ago, but I'm 30 now so it's not really a thing anymore.	1642733312.0	htjpebw	t3_s8ovtk	t3_s8ovtk	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8ovtk/whats_your_dirty_lil_secret/htjpebw/

So now I look like I’m wearing clown pants, but whatever.   I’m on board with elastic/stretch material though. Recently got an elastic belt and it has changed my life. Always wore a 1.5” leather belt that would cut me in half when squatting.

3b46nq54	Ooh, I had a date recently that topped my all time worst. Started out okay, dude seemed nice like he had been when we first met. When we ordered coffee he made a point of deciding for me without even asking what I wanted. I thought it was weird but I’m not a confrontational girl so I just went with it.  When we got to chatting he slowly began talking about stuff he hates, mostly other people. He then started making fun of other people at the cafe, quietly. After that he started talking about how he’s always horny and would get really mad when girls gave him blue balls. I was getting super bad feeling about him but I was also too afraid to just leave on my own so I went to the bathroom and called my brother to come get me and drop me at my car.   I actually havent been on any more dates after that guy.

When I went to turn in my calc grade to the new school, they didn't want to give me the entire credit nor the letter grade. I'm so glad I had the wherewithall at age 19 to say "my old school told me it would transfer over." That was all it took.  I have a bunch of moments like that from when I was younger where if I'd just knew how the world worked would've saved me so much trouble.

fdmcwtx5	2 times from the same teacher - my 11th grade history teacher Mr. Mercer.   The first time was when somebody in the class stole some girl's expensive earring she had sat down on her desk when she left the room. He asked calmly for whoever did it to give them back to her and there would be no trouble. Nobody did, so he told all the girls to wait in the hall while he screamed at the boys. He was red-faced and told us that he somebody was going to get all of us in trouble because they didn't have "the sack" to confess. (Those were his exact words, and I remember as he said it he held up his hand as if he was holding a pair of invisible testicles). Eventually, the thief broke into tears and confessed.  The 2nd time was later in the year in between classes, when he saw a junior named Sean Chess bullying a freshman. Mercer just went up to Sean and slammed him against the wall, holding him by his collar and screaming in his face. He almost put him through the wall, it was crazy.	1642740563.0	htk52wm	t3_s92hhq	t3_s92hhq	/r/AskReddit/comments/s92hhq/whats_the_most_enraged_youve_ever_seen_a/htk52wm/

At some point I found myself next to the teachers chair and decided to place a couple thumb tacks on the chair. A few minutes later he sat down and audibly yelped. I looked right at him when it happened and made very brief eye contact. Then right back down to the school work. He asked if anyone had put these on his chair….no one responded and I kept to my business. It seemed like less than half the classroom even noticed what happened.   Over the next few days I heard him telling other teachers about the tacks that fell onto his chair that he sat on. Joking about the odds….But it was me.

13v5sl	i was a client, and then befriended and outed an escort after she pissed me off.  i also convinced someone to get into escorting without her knowing it was really me (she thought she was chatting with someone else).  once i knew her escort profile and info, i booked her and had sex with her numerous times.  i know the real identities of many escort friends, and they dont know that i have their info.	1642747080.0	htkgnu5	t3_s8ovtk	t3_s8ovtk	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8ovtk/whats_your_dirty_lil_secret/htkgnu5/
bqhuu	Construction work. Concrete company.  We were working at a Government funded site. We were ahead of schedule. The day that we were pouring the entrance to the site, the “supervisor” (the brother of the boss), (lets call him Bob) for our company arrives and tells us that he wants the curb and gutters poured by the end of the day(which would have meant we’d be 100% finished at this location). When Bob said this, I responded to him “how’s the concrete truck going to get back there to pour the curb and gutters?”  Bob didn’t understand why I told him that cuz he just kept on speaking as if the crew was following his idea. He was rambling on about how at another site they were short on people and he wanted us to finish that day so that we’d be sent there the following Monday.  There was no way for the concrete truck to get to the back of the site to pour the curb and gutters, the entrance was already freshly poured.   The site supervisor wanted the entrance poured before anything else since he’d gotten permission that day for all construction crew to park at another nearby location for us.   The idea was that we’d pour the entrance on a Friday, and by the following Monday we’d be able to all drive into the site location without having any issues with that.  Since this was government funded, all workers were making close to 60$ an hour. Bob wanted to send us to another site where we’d be making 23-26$ an hour (our normal payrate). On top of this, he wanted to send us to the other site because the other workers at the company messed up and we needed to do Demo out A LOT of Concrete because the guy that was left in charge at the other site was incompetent.  The site supervisor was a cool dude. He came up to Bob and asked him what’s up. After he heard what Bob had to say, the site supervisor told him “oh we’re not finished here yet, I’m gonna need your workers here next week, there’s been a few additions added to the plans last second. We’ve already talked this over with your boss” and he opened up his Plans and started making up stuff on the spot of things that needed to be done.   Bob left the site and I got another week of working at the government funded site at a raised payrate.   Much respect to that site supervisor, not many site supervisors are that cool. He saw how fast the crew was finishing up and would tell us to slow down and relax. We were wanting to present work or we’d be fired(I’ve got other crazy stories). Turns out we’d still get punished for finishing up early (because of how Bob was ready to send us off to help clean up a mess). Can’t win! But that day (and the following week) we did.	1642747102.0	htkgp27	t3_s8t52h	t3_s8t52h	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8t52h/what_did_somebody_say_that_made_you_think_this/htkgp27/

3ajn7	I don't use any apps. I don't need the continued demoralization in my life.  I specifically am not into hookups and trying to find a hookup involves dealing with people who are even pickier than people looking for something real. I'm not a 20-something. I'm not conventionally attractive, and women I'm attracted to aren't attracted to me.  I can gratify myself sexually just fine. Lack of sex isn't my problem, it's lack of affection and intimacy, but people -- men and women alike -- prioritize sex and superficiality despite how fleeting all that is because we all eventually grow to live without it, except some of us have to learn to live without any romantic connection far too soon.	1642747974.0	htki0zd	t3_s8ovtk	t1_htk8ts4	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8ovtk/whats_your_dirty_lil_secret/htki0zd/

h2kuq3wq	> Well being kind to someone who wasn't kind to you isn't the same as telling them that what they did was ok   In an abuser's eyes, yes it is. This is what you're not understanding. You need to look at it from how *they* will interpret it and benefit from it, not yourself. Their brains literally do not function the same as empathetic, healthy people. Everything to them is opportunity and self-gain. If you hand them that opportunity, you can bet they will take it.

h2kuq3wq	And now how about the victims who aren't able to get away? How about kids who live with abusive parents, who all the aunts and uncles and other family enable? What about the message you're sending to an abuser that enables them to abuse any of their future victims they might come across?  The point I'm making is enabling an abuser sends them a message that their behavior is acceptable. Whether the victim is able to get away from the abuser is completely beside the point. The point is you're enabling the abuser's power and control in general, and invalidating victims.   And I'm done trying to explain over and over because for some reason there's just a block here, about something that is really quite simple to understand.

f0xonwy7	A roller coaster. I just quit a $27/hr job managing an aging car wash that I've had for a decade. The business changed hands and my workload increased drastically. I should have walked with the former owner, but I got way too invested in that job and chose to overlook the writing on the wall. I resigned on the spot Tuesday, and had a new job offered to me yesterday.  Now I'm off to do night stocking at Walmart. The money isn't as good, but still quite liveable here. At least I won't be on call 24/7, and spend my one day off a week going in four times because because something broke, or because someone did something stupid.

mzgf639	My mom. The last year for her has been hard for starters. She’s lost a three pets somewhat unexpectedly, her house had been struck by lightning and caught on fire, and while life has slowed due to Covid, the materials and labor to fix the home had forced them into a (nice) camper in her back yard. Insurance has been a headache for obvious reasons.   Last week her husband of 12 years, and together over 15, said that he wanted a divorce. I called her today and she said that she was ready to put herself out there again.   My heart hurts for my mother.

7si9kw8w	Years ago I was riding my bike down a street when I spotted a kitten, a tiny little thing crying and looking real scared for its life, hiding under a bush by the sidewalk near oncoming cars during heavy traffic. I got off my bike and I managed to pick up the little fellow from the ground. As I held him I noticed his face was roughly scratched up; poor thing was in awful shape. That evening I was visiting my parents and found him about 10 minutes walking distance from their house. I held the little guy tight in one arm and brought him home with me that night.  The next morning at my parent’s, I woke up to kitten just crying and crying. Poor thing was so stressed and my folks weren’t having it. And sadly I couldn’t keep him. So after placing some ads online for a lost kitten, I decided to take him with me to my place and care for him there.  The next day, while leaving for work, I stepped out the door in a hurry and the kitten for sure left to follow me outside, cause later that night when I got home from work the kitten was gone. I searched for him everywhere until finally realizing that he must have gotten out as I left for work, and now there was no way I’d find him or see him again. I just had to sadly accept he was gone.  I lived in a small house/apartment next to my ex-landlord’s townhome. A truly sweet and kind lady. We shared a small little yard, divided by a picket fence.   Fast forward 7 months later and I’m stepping out of the apartment one night, locking my front door when I look up at my landlord’s second floor window, and I notice a small silhouette of a cat staring down at me from above. I’m staring up and I’m thinking “my landlord does not have a cat… I’ve met her dogs… I’ve been invited inside and never did I see or meet a cat. This is odd…”  A few days then pass and I get home from work. I’m parking on the driveway and my landlord is out in her garage. I step out of my car and she says hello and we make some small talk. She then tells me something about her dogs, and ends her note with something like “oh I love them so much, my beautiful dogs—they’re my babies, you know—them and my cat…” and that’s when she turns and stares at me in the eyes and asks, “Hey, did you by any chance ever bring a kitten home? Many months ago? A little cat? A black and white little baby kitten?” And it suddenly hits me. She’s asking me, “did you ever bring a kitten??” And for SOME REASON—to this very day I still do not understand why—I answer her, “…No?” And that’s when my landlord begins to tell me all about her beloved pet, Ita. Her name short for “Bonita.”  Turns out the day SHE got out (not a him as I assumed) my landlord got home to her dogs in her yard barking up at a poor little terrified kitten hiding all the way up a tree. My landlord and her husband got her down from there and rescued her from her loud barking dogs and brought her inside, nursed her with food and water, and treated the wounds on her face. They took her in as their own and kept her, and I knew nothing about it until many months later.   Outside with my landlord in her garage she then asks me, “Do you want to come inside and meet her?” And surely enough, when I walk in to meet her, that is the cat. Now all grown up, cherished and loved by my landlord and her sweet loving family. Even the dogs.  I lived there for two years until sadly she needed to ask me to vacate the home last year for personal reasons. It was no hard feelings on her part, or mine. I packed up my things and moved out—and never did I tell her that it was in fact me who brought home her precious cat, Ita.  I kept that as my little secret.	1642762773.0	htl1ic9	t3_s8ovtk	t3_s8ovtk	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8ovtk/whats_your_dirty_lil_secret/htl1ic9/

hiyjrpyp	I think that the rising tensions with Western Europe are a result of the increasingly aggressive actions of the West. The Europeans have been trying to encroach on Russia's sphere of influence, and Russia has been pushing back. I don't see this as a bad thing, as it is natural for countries to compete for influence. However, I hope that the Russians can be successful in pushing back the West without resorting to violence.	1642763790.0	htl2uki	t3_s98ahs	t3_s98ahs	/r/AskReddit/comments/s98ahs/russians_of_reddit_how_do_you_view_the_rising/htl2uki/
hw8ehk9x	That he just likes to make people as miserable as he is. He berates his wife, he insults his kids, he talks shit about people when they're not there, and it's all just to make himself feel better about what a giant piece of shit he is. He takes it out on everybody else so he doesn't have to feel as bad about who he knows he really is.   His daughter just told him he can't walk her down the aisle at her wedding because he's been such an asshole to her fiancee. It was fucking rich. The look on his face I'm told was priceless. His other daughter distances herself, and has told him to stop talking to her husband without other people around. His wife doesn't sleep in the same bed with him anymore. He's slowly being boxed out of his own life and all he can do is lash out more and more.  He's a sad, pathetic little man and I honestly love hearing updates about him. Every time it's like "yeah he said this shit and his wife just told him to shut up in front of everyone in the family." It's so fucking funny to me how this guy can't figure out **any** way to be nice to the only people in his life.  Even his son is like "yeah I wouldn't listen to my dad on most things. He just wants you to feel bad." It's like acting in an acceptable way is just out of his reach for some reason and I don't get it.  And that's just one uncle. The two other uncles are also shitbirds. One cheated on his wife with a coworker, and lied about it to his kids. They still think he divorced their mom because it wasn't working out. What a bitch!  The other uncle is a bigot whose wife chests on him constantly with dudes she meets online, has refused to stop, and he **just takes it** like some fucking loser. They hate each other and constantly fight and he's always throwing out love letters she gets from other men.   All the older men in my family are fucking losers and pieces of shit.

You were likely somebodies kid, or a neighbors kid and it was going to cause more trouble arresting you.   Not that it didn’t happen- give them a reason, start some trouble, or just be alone and not with a group of 20 other kids- you might get protective custody (they’d put you in a jail cell and call your parents to pick you up, but there were be no charges) on a rare occasion you’d go to court but even then it was pay a hundred bucks for the courts time and don’t get in trouble again.	1642767685.0	htl8ljt	t3_s98z4i	t3_s98z4i	/r/AskReddit/comments/s98z4i/what_happens_if_you_get_caught_underage_drinking/htl8ljt/

dskb1o3q	Isolation hindered my developing social skills. Got social anxiety and depression. Destroyed my confidence and perceived self-worth because for 2 years I felt like a bum who stays home all day, even though that's not what I am. Made me paranoid, I think everyone is conspiring against me. My cardiovascular health has worsened, it's easy to say "just go for a jog outside" but I live in Toronto and we're LUCKY if we get 0' celsius. I have imposter syndrome too because while some essential workers are still being productive, I was at home so I felt inadequate. All in all, depressed, weak, lonely, anxious, nihilistic.  I've gotten much better though, in the past couple of months. I still have an 80 average in uni and I got a new job. My gym should be opening next week. Slowly but surely rehabilitating.

Of course there would be a lot of language detailing helping those in need before they turned to major crime. You’re going to kill someone? Bring back the chair. Rape? Castration.   The right to bare arms is bullshit too. Individuals should be able to own some selective, non-combat, weapon to provide for hunting and some form of personal protection. Families in 1859 typically didn’t own repeating rifles or Gatling guns for protection.   I don’t know.

1tdac9xl	My friends blame the government of my country for their family's economic problems, I know Alfonso, your father divorced your mother and probably is maintaining two families so you have not enough for party and drugs so you have to work 2 mid turn jobs, and yes Rafael, your mother and your father obviously struggle with sending you to other state to get a degree you are not sure to be prepared for because you do LSD, and of course, like the first dude, you are a spoiled kid with a middle class family that made you think you are one of the 1% who are privileged, so you choose nothing but an acomodated apartment in a fancy zone. Then when reality arrives every month they complain about gov taking all of their privileges they never even had. This is the kind of people that calls me 'you people'(poor class) because I let them but they get to work in a bus or a 1995 beetle and think the taxes we are collecting from shell affect their non existing stock. I heard like half an hour about how they (educated people with jobs) deserve money for just being them instead of a person like me, a student from a rural city with 3 brothers and a single mom with cancer, but of course I didn't tell my situation, i just wanted to know how far they could get...

I was assigned female at birth  >You said you felt disconnected from your mirror image—is this something that causes you distress of any sort? Does it feel, idk, wrong somehow? (Also, do you have issues like depersonalisation that could cause this, if you're comfortable telling me?)  I avoid mirrors as much as possible. If I can't remove them I cover them up. I really only look at myself as much as it takes to ensure I don't have toothpaste on my face kind of thing. But sometimes I'll stand and stare at myself with so much hatred and disgust that it's unnerving! Best to cover the mirrors up.   I don't know what depersonalition is enough to say if I have it or not. I don't like it when people use my name though.  >Are you comfortable being referred to as female/a woman? If not, is it more a neutral, "I don't really care either way" thing, or a negative, "no, that's not me" thing?  I don't care. I don't see many occasions when it's actually necessary though.   >What about male/a man? Or non-binary? What do those labels feel like for you?  They don't sit. Definitely not male.   >What about pronouns? Do you have any set that you actively prefer or is it more an "I don't care much either way"/"I haven't found a set that really fits yet"?  I don't care either way.   >You said you're more ambiguous/androgynous (?) in your own imagination—do you think you'd be more comfortable if your actual presentation were more ambiguous/less overtly feminine? Have you experimented with stuff like androgynous clothing and if so, what are your experiences?   It's hard to overstate how feminine I look, even in a hoodie and pants. I've just got one of those bodies and one of those faces. Getting me to look androgynous would be make-up artist level effort.   >[This is mostly for me to get a general read on you—whether you might have dysphoria, whether you might be gender apathetic in some capacity, stuff like that :).

2ov3yz1v	I realized that my family was not how people normally lived with one another and not everyone goes through so much intense stress for almost all of their childhood.   Seeing family dynamics of my friends made me realize how easy it is for some people to go ahead in life even if they're not barely putting anything in just because they have a good support system.   It really sucks seeing others breezing through life because their family has already done half the work for them while you're spending most of your time trying to undo your mental problems all by yourself while putting forward your best front so others don't see through it.   I've grown out of a lot of that, I did make my life better by myself a lot, I'm proud of it and I'm no longer a sufferer of the victim mentality, but it's sad to realize that a lot of the things that are wrong with me, I'm not even responsible for that and some of that is so badly ingrained into me that it'll take a lifetime to turn that around.   Consequently, I'm also becoming more and more uninterested in getting married as I age because I don't believe my lack of normalcy is gonna make anyone's life better so it's better not to start all that loop in the first place.   If you're gonna have kids, get help if you need it and don't ruin lives.	1643153536.0	hu7zmvm	t3_scks4o	t3_scks4o	/r/AskReddit/comments/scks4o/adults_whats_one_opinion_of_yours_that_completely/hu7zmvm/

Basically **EVERYTHING**.   1. Gay people did not cause aids and are not monsters 1. Black people are not "basically all criminals"  1. Weed does not evolve into an immediate need to shoot up *all* the heroin.  1. Sex before marriage is completely normal and you will, in fact, not burst into flames.  1. Masturbation as well.  1. The northern states are not actively trying to kill off the southern states 1. God probably isn't real.  1. The bible is actually kinda fucking terrifying and God's an immature dickbag if he is real.   There are a few things I still have my southern opinions on, but for the most part moving west and reddit really warped my worldview.	1643155088.0	hu83eey	t3_scks4o	t3_scks4o	/r/AskReddit/comments/scks4o/adults_whats_one_opinion_of_yours_that_completely/hu83eey/

hhq2h7dj	From Merriam Webster   Definition of [gender](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gender) (Entry 1 of 2)  1a: a subclass within a grammatical class (such as noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb) of a language that is partly arbitrary but also partly based on distinguishable characteristics (such as shape, social rank, manner of existence, or sex) and that determines agreement with and selection of other words or grammatical forms  b: membership of a word or a grammatical form in such a subclass  c: an inflectional form (see INFLECTION sense 2a) showing membership in such a subclass  2a: SEX sense  1a the feminine gender  b: the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex  So gender isn't really related to biological sex as more than just a societal term of identification. People would change their biological sex to match the gender they identify with for their mental health.	1643159857.0	hu8eusf	t3_sct8f7	t3_sct8f7	/r/AskReddit/comments/sct8f7/how_is_gender_different_from_biological_sex_if/hu8eusf/

1ty5qutw	Oh, hahaha! The picture exists. One time, the city sewer backed up in our basement and got clogged and wouldn't drain back out. The city wouldn't be able to help us until the next day; the plumbers were booked; the disaster remediation company wasn't answering. The smell was unbearable. I didn't have appropriate garb to tackle the job so I improvised. I had a ridiculous mismatch of sacrificial garments with a couple of layers of plastic sheeting duct taped strategically, mask and goggles. My husband took a photo of me holding my plunger just before I entered the basement to successfully clear the clog and hose down the basement.

1bs87p5b	I attended a daytime company party in LA, in June, where there was a "snow cone guy" who set up shop in the parking lot. All the attendees were in their 20s and everyone was drinking, so we were obviously bored with eating snow cones within the first hour. However, SCG was booked for three more, and seeking to entertain us, he started making snowballs for us to throw at each other. I'd had about 4 beers by this point, so obviously, I was down to fling some snowballs at my coworkers. I figure I threw about 100 over a couple hours (really lobbing them, of course), thought nothing of it, and went home.  My back and shoulder felt a little weird the next day, but nothing serious. The day after *that*, I awoke with a searing pain that spread from my middle back up and through my shoulder blade as well as toward my neck. It was an agonizing, intense, hot pain that made me feel panicky and trapped inside my own body. I ended up going to the ER, thinking I had done something horribly wrong to myself. The doctor assessed me, told me that what I was experiencing was called "muscle strain," wrote me a prescription for ibuprofen, and sent me home.  TL;DR - muscle strain can be horrifically painful and can be easily caused by random activities that seem fun and normal, if your body isn't used to them.	1643165225.0	hu8rjp0	t3_scfab0	t3_scfab0	/r/AskReddit/comments/scfab0/what_is_the_worst_nondeadly_pain_youve_experienced/hu8rjp0/

13erfl	I have a sister who is transgendered, and we come from a super Irish-Catholic conservative upbringing. I’m no longer religious, but the majority of my large family still is. They misgender and deadname my sister. They use religion as an excuse to protect themselves from my vocalized displeasure in their emotional abuse. “Don’t hate me for my beliefs!” and, “I can’t turn on my religion for the sake of my sick family member!” are their rally cries.  I’m glad the trans community exists. My sister needs the support of those who understand and can relate to her journey. She has me and two other sisters who support and love her. I’ve always had positive interactions with anyone from the trans community. I’m done with the rest of my family, though.	1643165240.0	hu8rkws	t3_scttl9	t3_scttl9	/r/AskReddit/comments/scttl9/cis_folks_how_do_you_feel_towards_the_trans/hu8rkws/

hzt78l7o	A foreskin princess puts copper coins under men's foreskin. She then harvests the coins once they turn the tip of the man's penis green. She uses the heavily tarnished coins to construct herself a crown. It is rumored that when a foreskin princess acquires enough coins for her crown she will turn into a foreskin queen which can retract any man's foreskin within a 10 mile radius. If a foreskin princess presents you with her coin and you've been circumcised expect a quick death.	1643166488.0	hu8uh17	t3_scvlig	t3_scvlig	/r/AskReddit/comments/scvlig/what_is_something_that_smells_bad_but_you_enjoy/hu8uh17/

My doctor was a specialist for cyst issues and set a date for the surgery, but we had grown close seeing as he looked at my ass every Thursday for about a year. When I went into surgery he had specifically asked for a male nurse that went to the college I wanted to go to. I wanted to go for music because I love singing. As I was getting ass surgery I sang an All Time Low song to the nurse and doctor that were trying to work on my ass because they wanted to hear my “talent”.

j03m9uw1	When I was 13, (I am now in my 30's) I pretended to have abdominal pain for three days to get days off school. On the third day, my mother took me to the doctor. Oops, I played it too long! I considered coming clean but was too scared of the consequences, I was in too deep. I had to push on, and my mum was a scary school teacher back then.  The appointment was at about 4 in the afternoon and I continued the charade with the doctor, but thought that surely he would to expose me as a fraud. He didn't. I should have won an Oscar! The only thing I really remember of the examination was getting the finger up the bum. I needed a visit to the toilet after that "inspection", and when I returned to the room, I heard my mother and the doctor discussing surgery. Yikes!  By 8 pm that night I was under the knife getting my appendix removed. If I thought I was in deep earlier, getting wheeled into surgery had me shitting bricks, but I was in even deeper now. I couldn't just jump of the bed in my surgical gown and say it was all a joke. So I took it like a liar.  I still wonder if the doctor saw my perfectly healthy pink appendix and thought, "Shit, it wasn't appendicitis." "Oh well...cha-ching!" My wife threatens to tell my mother every once in a while to see me squirm. This is probably going to be buried in the bottom of the thread somewhere, but it's out there now, even if it is with a throwaway account. Also, I still see that same doctor.	1643179595.0	hu9jh6b	t3_scznob	t3_scznob	/r/AskReddit/comments/scznob/whats_something_youre_hiding_from_your_parents_why/hu9jh6b/

It's not the Cartel that's the real problem if the economic disparity and surface level corruption is stamped out.  That's why no one wants to go to prison in the US.  The death of Kiki Camarena an American DEA agent is what gave the go ahead to the no holds barred takedown of Pablo Escobar and escalate the destruction of his cartel.

50703b4a	If you're doing missionary, and have gotten consent beforehand, you can do something really fun right after he cums (provided that he cums inside you).      Wait for his orgasm to subside, pause for a moment, then start moving your hips in a way that would get him deeper inside you. Especially if you have your legs wrapped around him. This drives my husband *crazy* for a very short time.      The reason you need consent first is because some men find it horribly uncomfortable to be stimulated right after they cum (kind of like how some women's clits are too sensitive after orgasm).	1643188083.0	hu9uqpv	t3_scr1a2	t3_scr1a2	/r/AskReddit/comments/scr1a2/guys_of_reddit_what_is_one_piece_of_sex_advice/hu9uqpv/

It bugs me that the King after being saved by Sokka and the gang never told them that he disclosed this extremely information to Azula when he was under the impression that they were Kiyoshi warriors. Because of this the invasion plan still happened and they lost the fight because the fire nation were prepared.	1643190157.0	hu9x998	t3_sd1x4e	t3_sd1x4e	/r/AskReddit/comments/sd1x4e/what_plot_hole_really_pisses_you_off/hu9x998/

Even if most of the white males were also property owners, there's a difference between saying "all white males can vote" vs "all property owners can vote" - one is explicitly capitalism, and the other is not.

ibazhqnu	Mental health is a spectrum that can get to extreme points that is influenced by external and internal influences and we as societies determine what is concidered to be healthy or not. So it's also about values an sociatal rules. So calling it mental health "disorders" is unnecessarily pathologizing. So yes they are real, although it should only be about helping people to live a "normal" life and stop them from hurting themselves and others and not about stigma. Disorder is only a term to describe something that is out of the norm.	1643193371.0	hua1842	t3_sd2i4p	t3_sd2i4p	/r/AskReddit/comments/sd2i4p/with_your_own_limited_knowledge_can_you_explain/hua1842/

No one should fuck with that shit.  I believe they taste great, never doubted you. Just too expensive for such a simple meal. You use ground beef because you’re trying to be cheap.

bn3x5b0x	It’s more so your intestines where pH matters because VERY slight changes in pH will dictate wether a drug will ionize or not. This substantially dictates the rate of absorption since ionized molecules are water soluble and can’t penetrate the intestinal wall (or most other linings; including skin)  Also grapefruit juice won’t have a clinically significant impact on pH anywhere in your body. Orange juice, however, does. It will lower pH in certain parts of your body which will disrupt absorption of some meds like adderall XL. On the other hand, some meds require an acidic pH for absorption so medications like omeprazole (proton pump inhibitors increase pH) can also alter drug absorption.  (Side note: if you take plavix do NOT USE PRILOSEC!!! Use a different PPI if you must)  Grapefruit juice also alters the function of CYP3A4 which is a major enzyme in your body that metabolizes a majority of medications that we take. That’s the real danger with grapefruit juice	1643317147.0	huhojou	t3_se42iu	t1_huh8bbj	/r/AskReddit/comments/se42iu/what_seems_harmless_but_is_actually_extremely/huhojou/

ubctv	I spent a lot of my teenage years walking on the railroad tracks near my house. You couldn't really hear the train itself until it was in sight but I could usually tell one was coming because the tracks start making a high pitched hissing like sound from the vibrations when the train is still fairly far away. It's extremely subtle though until the train is around a half to quarter mile away so it can definitely be masked by the wind. My friends were always surprised when I told them to get off the tracks because a train was coming and a few minutes later one came. They usually couldn't hear the noise.	1643319438.0	huhurgi	t3_se42iu	t1_huh6if6	/r/AskReddit/comments/se42iu/what_seems_harmless_but_is_actually_extremely/huhurgi/
