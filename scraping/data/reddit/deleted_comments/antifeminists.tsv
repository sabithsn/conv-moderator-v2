Nowadays women don't bring anything into a relationship and yet they expect to be given the world while they don't give anything back. They fight for rights they already have, keep doing what yall doing. When dating becomes harder as a woman because men don't accept it anymore don't go complaining when you're 45, single and unhappy.	1641092984.0	hqw0dhs	t3_rrsoy0	t1_hqmi08a	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrsoy0/whawhat_in_the_f/hqw0dhs/
hy1v32qe	These are literally the same talking points going around r/conspiracy which we can all agree is anything but a feminist sub. The general idea is to also hold the clients accountable.    the top comment on that post:    “That is infuriating to me. Of course all the women involved must rot in prison: they are awful criminals that committed terrible crimes...  But it's infuriating that the men are walking free, hiding in their multimillion dollar houses even though they are also awful criminals that also committed terrible crimes. We know it, they know it, the court knows it... And yet I feel like nothing is going to happen. The powerful really can do anything.”    https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rsm6zi/the_spotlight_must_now_turn_to_the_rich_men/    > The woman who procured girls for Jeffrey Epstein and his friends will die in prison – but most of the men involved still walk free    Even in the screenshot from the article posted.	1641110648.0	hqwvcc0	t3_rtk76l	t3_rtk76l	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtk76l/the_many_predictions_were_right_feminists_are/hqwvcc0/

e13pa32v	I used to think lonely/ugly girls are rather antifeminists lol (in my area i guess)  Or maybe it's for everywhere  As far as I have talked, girls who are lonely or were bullied previously (by fellow females) turn antifeminists  (As per my observations, talked to 7-8 antifeminist girls from all ages)	1642694761.0	hth0z57	t3_s8lkd8	t1_htgy3tn	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/hth0z57/
e13pa32v	I have talked to teenage girls here, antifeminist, and as per my survey (lol yeah "survey" XD), be it a first or third world nation, all girls had a track record of being bullied by females around them, thus they never fell for feminism in the first place  Or its maybe just a mere thing happening around me... Nevermind.  But yeah, don't waste time in making these Feminists learn.  For example, I did try, and got doxxed on all Indian Feminist subreddits instead, also got falsely accused for some matter (one of my post summarizes the situation)  Also even on an Exam related fun subreddit I just said Feminists are bad, whole Feminist woke gang started bashing me, the mod banned me and deleted my comments, and them ?

71v4lvfl	I would argue that men are more effected by rape. It's not really a contest though, but being told it doesn't effect men is just stupid. When your body enjoys something, but your mind is screaming kinda fucks ya up. Then there is being forced to do something by someone, it hurts your personal identity and is rather hard to recover from. I wouldn't know the effects on a women, but I can say it really fucks up a guy.   Then look at talking about it. Women at least have a support structure, and aren't constantly told how they are lucky it happened. Other men assume they would like it because for some reason everyone assumes it's a good looking women that you find attractive.   What about when a man is raped and a child if formed. The rapist has full control over that decision, and can then use you for child support. Even if you were a child when it happened. That won't cause any issues either right?	1642704314.0	hthr8g7	t3_s8h3vk	t3_s8h3vk	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8h3vk/the_vocal_minority/hthr8g7/

hwdced1y	I'm not an anime person, but old movies. They do a perfect job of portraying women realistically. Movies from the 70, 80s and all the blockbusters have Male leads, while women accompanying them.  No woke nonsense, no bs. As they say, "Go woke go broke." Modern movies with "empowered" women and joker males are cringe to watch.  Predator and Scarface in my opinion, best movies ever made.	1642743581.0	htkar2w	t3_s937zb	t3_s937zb	/r/antifeminists/comments/s937zb/which_fictional_media_seriesgenre_portrays_women/htkar2w/
fvm6rs7n	It is relevant in a number of ways.         Before answering your question, I am going to throw some statistics at you that will I hope help start making the connection between feminism and Jews.   Jews make up roughly 2% of the population in the US. In the UK, they make up 0.2% of the population, in France its roughly 1%, etc. Despite making up insignificant minorities in all of these countries where feminism was born and constructed then spread across the globe, Jews form the majority of the founders, leaders and financiers of feminism.   Most of the founders of the feminist movement are Jewish; Betty Friedan, Robin Morgan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, Simone Veil etc. Jews also played an important role in the early women's movement e.g. the Jewish League for Women Suffrage. They played an operative role in injecting in feminism its anti-Christian sentiments.   All of the Marxist theorists who pushed the idea of feminism in the 1800s were Jewish, Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Mosses Hess. The founders of the feminist sexual revolution, that revolution that has spread sexual degeneracy across the globe using it as a weapon to enslave, exploit and dull populations, were Jewish. Wilhelm Reich and Sigmund Freud the godfathers of the feminist sexual revolution were both Jewish.   Most of the most anti-male, radical  feminists have been Jewish: Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Gayle Rubin, Elizabeth Gould Davis, Sally Miller Geaarhart etc. etc. etc.   There is clear correlation between Judaism and feminism, but what causes this correlation? Why, of all people, have Jews played a significant role in the formation and rise of the feminist movement?        The answer to this question is very simple.   Judaism is made up of many branches. The largest branches of Judaism are those of atheistic Jews (Jews that do not believe in God, but are born racially Jewish) and Reform Jews (Jews that believe in a liberal approach to interpreting Jewish texts.   Reform Judaism is the largest branch in Judaism. It is heavily influenced by Marxism, communism and feminism. Reform Judaism is essentially feminism in the form of a religion. They believe in and promote the exact same ideas and principles as those of feminists. They believe in and promote the feminist interpretation of patriarchy, they believe in and promote the idea that gender is a social construct, that men have throughout the ages oppressed women, that sexuality is a social construct, that abortion is a right, that there is nothing wrong with sex outside of marriage, that consumption and production of pornography is normal etc. etc. etc. Reform Judaism, the largest branch of Judaism in the world is feminism and feminism is Reform Judaism.          I must note here that Judaism is a dogma that is unconventional. I would not even call it a religion, but a racist ideology. Let me elaborate on this. In Judaism, you don't have to believe in Judaism to be considered a Jew. In Judaism, so long as you have a matrilineal Jewish lineage i.e. you are born to a Jewish mother (note that Judaism is extremely matriarchal. It is from Judaism that feminism borrows many of its anti-male theories surrounding sexuality and gender etc), you are considered a Jew. In Judaism, you are considered a Jew so long as you are racially Jewish, even if you reject Judaism. They also believe that they are God's chosen people. Combine their racialism and their belief that they are God's chosen people and they are rendered a racist ideology.         I have just touched briefly on this topic here. If anyone has any questions, ask. Note that I am in the middle of exams at the moment, so my replies might be delayed.

55zca6ng	Same with this milder story from my own life a couple of months back. I was waiting in the hallway for class, and a girl, a year older than me in 11th grade started leering at me. First stared me in the eyes, made an exaggerated smirk, then looked down at my groin, and made another, more exaggerated and suggestive smirk.   For several months, she did some milder things. She would stand very close to me, less than a foot away, even when she had space somewhere else. I also caught her staring at my phone even when I turned away and clearly signaled for her to stop.  Now it is very mild, especially compared to other incidents I hear of, but imagine if, instead of an junior girl acting this way towards a sophomore guy, a junior guy did this to a sophomore girl.	1643046566.0	hu1nh4v	t3_sb6fkg	t1_htz80u8	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb6fkg/amys_tale/hu1nh4v/

dma1vesp	I mean mostly as an adult both sides are pretty harmless? But when i was 14-16 just hanging out in the mall i was asked by very clearly older men if i was “DTF” amongst being followed, and called numerous things lol. Obviously anecdotal. To be honest having the whole segregation is pretty ridiculous at this point, just leave? I can understand gyms possibly because literally everyone feels uncomfortable at some point in a gym. but if you are going to have gyms for just women they should make them for just men too.	1643231172.0	huciyx2	t3_sczl83	t3_sczl83	/r/antifeminists/comments/sczl83/as_a_woman_i_totally_need_special_treatment_and/huciyx2/
g4y3wkov	>..what. Are you trying to say im the one who thinks woc are ugly 😭 i cant believe i have to say this but i dont??   When did i say that? But you definitely implied many of them are.  >Poc usually dont have white features??  Mestizos (like me), mulattas, and any mixed person.  >And those are the features that is held as the beauty standard in many parts of society,  No......its really not. Having qhite skin doesnt automatically make them more attractive in the public eye. Thats not how most people see, even in colonial times they didnt see it that way as for example, spanish colonizers gotten into relationships and mixed with tainos.	1643316090.0	huhlp6a	t3_sdu2kp	t1_huhevas	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/huhlp6a/

de2puclt	[from the study one of the news articles linked....](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857885/)  "Another limitation of this research is the reliance of self-reported marital status. Prior research has noted that marital status is misreported; however, it is most often misreported by divorced individuals with deceased former spouses (Weaver 2000). This suggests that the divorce among our sample may be underestimated, while widowhood may be overestimated. In addition, our data does not permit us to observe which spouse initiates divorce."  study is unreliable at best.	1643323089.0	hui4dma	t3_sdu2kp	t1_hug578w	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/hui4dma/

71v4lvfl	I let my wife control the money, I just put away for retirement and some cash for me. That is because I don't care even the tiniest bit what is bought, as long as the bills are paid. I think it really comes down to most men not caring or needing much, while women seem to always want something. Buying things more then owning them seem to make women happy. Maybe it's just the shopping, but it's a never ending battle that's easier not to even fight. I don't think all women are like that, but I would say most are. My wife buys stupid stuff just because it was on sale, even if it will never be used. Then brags about finding it on sale. She never seems to know why she thought we would need it, but believed we would eventually.	1643364924.0	hukd84u	t3_sebpdn	t3_sebpdn	/r/antifeminists/comments/sebpdn/its_a_womans_world_women_control_80_of_consumer/hukd84u/
