glu4t2xq	>Not formed. Hamas won a democratic election. They did so because Hamas actually has an incredibly large civil service wing. They were providing a lot of the shelter, medical and food needs of people in Gaza, so people in Gaza liked and voted for them.  You're right, they were elected. That's kind of the scary part. They're not as humanitarian as you think. They steal money from civilians and use it for rockets into Israel. They use civilians as human shields. They are, by US legal definition, a terrorist group.   >Could we just not repeat blatant Israeli propaganda as if it were facts?  What propaganda? Hamas using human shields? That is a fact.  >This isn't the same as having a peace agreement.  >Like yeah, no shit Israel tends to agree to peace agreements when those agreements are almost always on their terms.

8zfrjw3	I think on some level you are right, OP. As the saying goes, sex is about everything but sex, meaning there's more going on in the minds of those in act. It's not just some mechanical process done by thoughtless drones. Sex is orchestrated by human who love to indulge in abstract thought and narrative often influenced by the context they find themselves in.      So naturally, sex is more of a representation or symbolic dance of ideas in a certain environment even when you just wanna get down and fuck.      Now this part might sound like I'm justifying the usage of aggressive sexual language, but I assure you I'm not. I am explaining what such aggressive language symbolizes, since language at its core is about turning an otherwise random group of sounds into a symbol that defines an idea.      Now what idea "getting fucked" symbolizes will vary depending on the person and context. In the context of consensual sex, I think the phrase generally represents receiving raw uninhibited carnal pleasure from another. For a lot of women, when they are in the context of consensual sex with someone they find attractive and comfortable with, this idea is very pleasurable. It is in no way othering to them, but sexual gratifying.      Where it becomes othering is when there is no attraction or comfort to be found in their partner or when the sex is outright nonconsensual. There's only disgust, anxiety, and trauma. Receiving their "raw uninhibited carnal pleasure" feels very unfulfilling to say the least. This is where I feel you are valid on your view, OP.      Anyway, I'm not sure if any of this will budge your view. Just thought I muse about the phrase you presented.	1640876456.0	hqjw60j	t3_rryt5i	t3_rryt5i	/r/changemyview/comments/rryt5i/cmv_the_way_we_use_sexual_language_is_deeply/hqjw60j/

c8ay6	What you mean to say is that it is absurd to enter into a relationship based on transactional exchanges and expect it to lead to an equal partnership with healthy boundaries.  The way you're describing the issue is problematic because you're couching it in terms that highlight and reflect the sexist outcomes of a provider/dependent arrangement.  It seems you're upset that transactional women haggle or set their price really high ("call the guy cheap"), but I think this is a symptom of the larger issue and is mostly besides the point... But I'm assuming you're not interested in a transactional relationship.  If that's the sort of relationship you are interested in, then I'd suggest that transactional women are allowed to set their price and transactional men are allowed to put a ceiling on what they'll pay.  For my part, I'd prefer to avoid transactions altogether.  It's easier to tell if someone loves you if they're not constantly asking you for gifts.  A week ago, I considered the idea of writing a CMV post about the female expectation that men be "adequate providers" to qualify as potential mates.  Although I do believe taking on the "provider" role in a relationship makes love untrustworthy ("do they stay with me for the money"), I ultimately rejected posting the opinion because part of the reason I hold this view is because I am not an overly wealthy man and dating apps make it clear that many women expect their next romance to lift them into a new tax bracket.  So, it's at least partly a rationalization of sour grapes.	1640879571.0	hqk3glx	t3_rrzncy	t3_rrzncy	/r/changemyview/comments/rrzncy/cmv_women_who_feel_entitled_that_guys_should_pay/hqk3glx/

dbb07lp0	This feels like a cookie cutter rant about cultural appropriation. One that has been made many, many, many, many times.  So how one sided is it exactly?   I hear/read/see more people bitch about the concept of cultural appropriation than the other side. In fact, I have never in my life seen an interaction where somebody got pissed at somebody or "called out" for cultural appropriation. I've only ever seen it third-hand online... And even then, mostly in the context of people mocking it or complaining about it.  So if you think it's super one sided the other way, I would suggest that you are just spending too much time online in certain circles where these interactions are being sought out and amplified for one reason or another.	1640881264.0	hqk7myj	t3_rs56oc	t3_rs56oc	/r/changemyview/comments/rs56oc/cmv_peoples_view_on_cultural_appropriation_show/hqk7myj/

America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so.

1i4rjbib	It’s my understanding that press very much can be arrested and convicted for breaking the same laws. In the case of civil unrest: they would need to prove that they were/weren’t engaging in the civil unrest and not just a bystander (similarly to how you and I can stand and watch while someone raids a liquor store). As far as curfew orders are concerned: it’s my understanding that curfews typically have a press exemption for people actively engaged in exercising their press freedoms and not other activities (investigative journalism where you are just watching wouldn’t be covered. But recording with your phone or journaling the series of events would be). There are currently some big constitutional fights going on about whether a curfew can be legal without allowing for people to exercise their freedoms, and it appears to be leaning in favor of it being unconstitutional.	1640882903.0	hqkbtnd	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqka6tl	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqkbtnd/
1i4rjbib	The two are disconnected: You can both be press and break laws/go to jail  for laws unrelated to your freedom to film. If there is evidence you smashed a window to climb through then started filming, you can go to jail for the window breakage even though you are exercising your first amendment right. Press is far from a get out of jail free card, which is why in cases like the capital riots, you won’t see any major news organization entering with the crowd, as there are a number of laws that can be broken that aren’t protected by 1A.	1640883579.0	hqkdkyo	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqkc7hl	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqkdkyo/
1i4rjbib	It’s not that everyone can be press, it’s that everyone is press, and can use the freedoms granted by that when they choose. In the case of your example: it would very likely be illegal for any press to unlawfully enter the building, there are no protections that protect press from trespassing laws. Calling yourself press, whether established or not, grants you zero extra protections other than to film/express yourself in public. Established press don’t have any additional freedoms or allowances that allow them to avoid arrest for any other laws, unless codified in the law that those exercising their 1A are exempt (see most curfew laws). To wrap it around your first point: no established or unestablished press has a right to unlawfully trespass. For example: the news can’t break into your backyard to film if police catch a criminal hiding back there.	1640884295.0	hqkfgjx	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqke8go	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqkfgjx/

4a3yu	As an Australian, I am currently living in a scenario where, at least in theory, I have access to everything you name, here.  I don't get free food, but I do get sufficient money that if I am willing to accept living in a one bedroom unit in the middle of nowhere, then I can feed myself.  I also have access to free health care, although I personally don't want to go anywhere near it, due to already having lost a kidney because of it.  This supposedly equitable system, however, is presided over by criminals; one of whom had to recently leave office due to a criminal investigation.  We have also experienced one of the most restrictive Covid lockdowns anywhere on the planet; and if Americans want to pass comment on it, you should remember that you don't live here, and you would not tolerate me passing comment on anything that happened in your country either.  There can never, and will never be a Socialist scenario without at least a degree of inprisonment for the entire population; and there will also never be a Socialist scenario where the provision of food and necessities will not be administered by the most evil members of the given society, as is currently the case in Australia.  Psychopaths will always gravitate to the management of such a system, because of their level of desire for complete control of everyone else; and there is no greater control of people in existence, than determining whether or not a person can eat.  Socialists themselves can often be compassionate people, and I recognise and acknowledge that; but because of their own compassion, they are incapable of recognising just how truly, indescribably monstrous those who would run a centralised Socialist scenario would be.

There's no logical reason the stories need to be told through exclusively white people, there's no way to logically get there when it's a fantasy story set in a fictional universe. Just because there's inspiration from predominately Caucasian societies doesn't change the reality that the need for exclusively white actors is a lie.  I get where you are coming from about the differences between Black Panther and Witcher, but what about if it were a Chinese story, say a Hollywood adaptation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms with a mostly white cast? Or speaking of movies that have been actually made, the 1956 Genghis Khan movie?

g2d45waj	You are right about the discrimination being true.  As for the second part, I think it is more productive to help fight discrimination that black people with natural hair face rather than to oppose white people that appropriate the hairstyles. Even if "everyone that is white benefits in someway from being white" is true (which I am doubtful about), it is unclear that getting mad at people who use those hairstyles without racist intent helps create much change other than some momentary stress relief about the discrimination.	1640886722.0	hqklxgi	t3_rs56oc	t1_hqkl0ft	/r/changemyview/comments/rs56oc/cmv_peoples_view_on_cultural_appropriation_show/hqklxgi/

g2d45waj	>There's a reason stories like the Last Samurai are viewed as respectful, and something like Ghost in the Shell wasn't and was viewed as cultural appropriation and a cash grab for a white actress to take a role from an Asian women... because that's what it was. Tom Cruise wasn't stealing an Asian man's role, the story being told required a white actor. With Ghost in the Shell, there was no respect for the source material and the culture it came from when they switched the leads, they simply did it from a money hungry perspective that they felt Scarlet would sell more tickets. It was purely done out of greed, and not out of respect.   >That's the big difference with cultural appropriation that people often ignore, the credit and the respect. And particularly with acting it gets complicated because so many POC and so many marginalized groups can't even get good respectful roles in the first place, that the roles even they would be best suited for get cast by white people simply out of greed and a desire for money. If everything was even these things wouldn't matter as much, but there's a reason that it's generally not a big deal when POC take "white roles", and a large part of the reason is because those aren't actual white roles. Just roles a white person would have normally because they never give POC the chance.   Something that worries me about arguments like yours is that it can be used by pretty much any group to justify their stances. For example, a white nationalist could say that Hollywood is evil because many white roles in movies are taken by Jewish actors instead of "real" white people.  >There's a fine line between telling a story how you wish, and just stealing and profiting off another culture without them getting their due from it.

D&D, Lovecraft, even Tolkien all have problems with their worlds being inherently racist of pro white, which adds to the racism in these genres that we see today.

1i4rjbib	Although the one guy is being pretty rude, they both are right. Press don't have protections from trespassing or curfews, unless otherwise specified by law. I've worked in public affairs, press are required to follow all normal state laws with no exceptions.   Something that might help clarify is this: https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/imported/RFG.pdf  Particularly the pieces on public and private spaces. To summarize it basically says reporters are only allowed where the public is. I pulled it from this link: https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/civil-matters-and-disturbances/	1640894246.0	hql5msz	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqkygvl	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hql5msz/
1i4rjbib	So yes, journalists are equally at risk for being arrested for being past curfew. If the cops are only arresting journalists for being past curfew, they could be in their own hot water, but that still wouldn't excuse the journalists for breaking the law (an extreme example, but imagine 30 people are robbing a bank, and the police only arrest the black people even though people of all races were there. The police can be in trouble for racial bias, but the people arrested are still in trouble for robbery). There's no first amendment defense for violating laws, regardless of police bias. If you break laws as press (curfew, trespassing, tax avoidance), you're equally as susceptible to arrest and prosecution.   As far as treatment impacted by motivation: it depends. If there are a bunch of people physically fighting cops, and you can prove you weren't fighting cops you have a legal defense (which often reporters use their video evidence), but that's a defense specific to reporters, that's a defense capable of being given to anyone that can prove they were doing something else at the time span. If people start punching babies at 12:00, and I start tweeting every minute at 12:15, I have no defense to say I wasn't doing it, but if I'm tweeting every minute starting at 11:59, i have a defense. Its a crazy example but it highlights how journalism and filming is disconnected entirely from other crimes (trespassing, curfew), aside from the fact that they happen to be people in the US with equipment that proves what they were doing at a specific timestamp, but nothing in particular about being press.	1640895193.0	hql80e0	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hql6sq1	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hql80e0/

1i4rjbib	That's not correct, replace tweet with a timestamped speedrun on a cell phone game and it still holds true. You are always a member of the press, but your "press" activities aren't coupled to a defense other than that you have timestamped proof you weren't committing a crime. If I have a twitch clip of me eating donuts at that time, or a security camera sees me running laps around a fire hydrant at that time, it doesn't matter, all are equal defense with someone doing reporter-esque things. The only freedoms and protections given with everyone being press (either professional or not) are  the ability to record in public/freely express yourself, nothing more. "doing press shit" doesn't net you any additional protections other than protections from loitering rules in town halls and such, but that just requires that you are doing some form of expression (photography, videography, interviews, what have you) and not just sitting on the floor with an ipad playing angry birds. To reiterate: being "press" at a curfew protest or riot or civil unrest scenario doesn't give you any additional protections more than anyone who can prove they weren't rioting, and the act of being some sort of official-sounding press (fox, nbc) doesn't protect you from being arrested for getting involved in the illegal activity (trespassing, being out after curfew, ignoring lawful orders from police, etc). Press is not an exemption in any scenario unless press-activity is otherwise stated in the law, and in those cases where press is exempted, you have no burden of proof required that you are an official member of some sort of journalism company, you just have to proof you were exercising your 1A rights (filming with a cell phone, taking notes on your phone, whatever).  In the case of jan 6, if there was some sort of Capitol law exemption that said reporters are allowed to freely enter the Capitol, then anyone following the crowd with a cell phone video cam out is well within their right to do so, and wouldn't be arrested. If they kicked over a fence then rushed in the building, with their cell phone out, they can be arrested for kicking over the fence, but still not the entry.	1640896269.0	hqlaqqj	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hql8ptz	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqlaqqj/

You can be imprisoned. The government takes these cases and prosecutes on behalf of the people.   In a civil case, you are being sued. You have done something to harm another person or entity. They are seeking redress. You can be ordered to make redress financially. The impacted individual is taking this case against you on their own behalf.  The former - prosecution by the government - is what people typically mean is protected against by ‘freedom of speech’ in America.   But [there are limits. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions)  > Categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment (and therefore may be restricted) include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising.

This past year I inline skated over 2,000 miles. I competed in 5 marathons and won a medal in each of them.  I still smoke pot. Every. Single. Day.  The point of my contrasting anecdote is that pot affects everyone differently. The ratio of THC to CBD matters. Wether you smoke it or eat it matters. The amount of pot consumed matters.  We need to stop painting with a broad brush and acting like this plant is 100% evil or 100% medicine. Allow individuals the liberty to do what’s best for themselves and offer treatment for those that abuse substances.	1640906849.0	hqm18gk	t3_rs5g3c	t1_hqllq3k	/r/changemyview/comments/rs5g3c/cmv_weed_is_not_nearly_dangerous_enough_to_be/hqm18gk/

f2x4kuc9	1. The not caring is a feature. Being deeply personally (emotionally, financially) tied up in a person's medical care creates a layer of complication in decision making. If we argue that there is an objective correct decision, then it may be harder to come to for people who have other interests in the ill person. This is why doctors can't treat their kids or parents.  2. Almost everything that is prescribed is dangerous: doctors are liable for that risk, and practice with an awareness of those risks. These risks are far more complicated than a list of adverse events in a monograph. Particularly when considering combinations of medications. In the case that there is an avoidable drug error who's to blame? Upto date? The pharmacy? The drug company?  3. Most medical knowledge is experiencial. Books say so much, but the application to an individual is a synthesis of formal knowledge and experience that cant be taken from books alone. That's why doctors increase in seniority with experience. No one could argue that doctors are perfect or even very good, nor that all doctors are good all the time. But the same weakness would be present in people prescribing and taking meds for themselves.  There are circumstances where a non-medical person knows far more about the care of themselves or the person they care for. And I certainly think that doctors should work extremely hard to be responsive to their experience, including providing prescriptions with lots of leeway or discretion for the patient.	1640920786.0	hqmwzaf	t3_rsjmaq	t3_rsjmaq	/r/changemyview/comments/rsjmaq/cmv_people_should_have_access_to_any_and_all/hqmwzaf/

Chess pieces are entirely circumstantial. The symbolic meaning of pieces as "King", "Queen", etc, these are dramatic representations that have no practical bearing on the mechanics of the game beyond establishing a hierarchy of which pieces can move which way. Why wouldn't this same logic apply to Chaturaji, a Hindu variant of chess with no female pieces? Or Shatranj, the Persian version of chaturaji which is literally the pre-cursor to modern chess and again has no thematically female pieces?  It seems like the entire argument hangs on the fact that a piece happens to be symbolized as female but this is just one of hundreds of variations of the same game which the majority don't share. So the argument would be somehow limited to "Culturally Western/European fathers who happen to live in these certain countries and happen to play this specific variation of this game at this particular point of history" and when that's the case, I just don't see it.	1640926981.0	hqn9gv4	t3_rslo34	t3_rslo34	/r/changemyview/comments/rslo34/cmv_fathers_who_teach_their_sons_chess_are/hqn9gv4/

ld53i	> How do we know Oedipal complexes aren't more common in countries with Western chess as opposed to those with an elephant-piece? I have no data on the subject whatsoever.  How do you know they are? It's your claim, not mine. Complete lack of evidence is just conjecture and while I think that's fine, expressing a false-positive with complete lack of evidence is somewhat redundant because I can just throw that back at you like I've just done, right?  My hangup on this is this specific paragraph:  > Chess represents the Oedipal battle in reverse with taking the other's queen and "queening a pawn" (mother-son), as well as the final goal, checkmating the opponent's king. Of course, it's also possible to knight the pawn, to bishop or rook it, but queening is most common.  Because we're attributing symbolic meaning to the arbitrary movement of arbitrary pieces here. [I've found this site that makes claims about the origin of chess promotion which seems to verify that promotion as a mechanic is not specifically Western](https://new.uschess.org/news/evolution-modern-chess-rules-pawn-promotion), so the argument based on promotion of a specific piece's perceived symbolic value (which itself again could as easily be an elephant instead of a female monarch depending on where we are on the globe and in time) to me doesn't address the arbitrary nature of assigning symbolism to the pieces.  If I create a Harry Potter themed chess set with Harry Potter themed pieces which doesn't share this same perceived pawn-queen-king parallel of son-mother-father but otherwise is functionally identical to chess even to the extent of "queen'ing" the relevant piece, would this Oedipal theme still apply?	1640930133.0	hqnf32e	t3_rslo34	t1_hqnc2b7	/r/changemyview/comments/rslo34/cmv_fathers_who_teach_their_sons_chess_are/hqnf32e/

ld53i	Thanks! I don't blame you at all for that. I actually was the exact same way until moving to Phoenix AZ where I started being an adoption counselor at the local animal shelter. I was afraid of pitbulls when I started, but now 6 years later, *nearly every single one of my favorite animals from the shelter have been pit-terriers*. They've consistently been my favorite and I personally handle up to 50 dogs per week. I've also had to take classes on dispelling common myths (this being the biggest one in this field) specifically so I don't perpetuate them while I'm going through the adoption process with future owners.  The reality is that:  - Yes, pits are indeed responsible for the most bites and fatalities of any breed in the US (while this is somewhat murky because of breed identification issues, it's still very likely to be true). No one is really in a position to deny this. - No, these numbers are nowhere near as outrageous as certain people claim. If 10-20 million killing machines were truly on our streets and in our homes, the numbers wouldn't be so comically low as 20/year in a country with ~330mil people. - Yes, any pitbull who exhibits any explicitly aggressive behavior and is deemed as a risk to society should be euthanized. **That's already how it works regardless of breed in shelters, however.** You should not trust a dog because it's a dog and you should educate yourself on their body language because the majority of all bites are fear-aggression, not dominance-based or predatory. - Yes, there's about 1 new video per week showing a very tragic and often brutal display of a pit attacking another dog or human. But consider that we live in a world with over 6 billion smartphone users so only one video a week is again, in context, extremely low given these claims. - No, genocide and breed-wide euthanization is not an option I'm willing to entertain. **If you want me to compromise, you should present me with a reasonable compromise that isn't limited to eugenics or genocide.**	1640931115.0	hqngqgk	t3_rsk2fd	t1_hqndr14	/r/changemyview/comments/rsk2fd/cmv_pit_bulls_are_a_danger_to_society_and_should/hqngqgk/
ld53i	> I am 90% sure it was your claim. I don't believe I made any claim in that regard and you brought up the topic.  It's your claim that Oedipal themes are present at all to begin with. It was my claim that I don't see how that would be possible unless it was also the case for the various other iterations of chess with nearly identical features, to which you essentially reply "Maybe their more present" and my response is essentially "Are they? Are they present at all? That's your claim, it's a false positive when you present no evidence".  > I don't understand the relevance of the Harry Potter chess set.  > Just because you can use the rules of chess with other pieces... how is that relevant at all?  See I don't understand why the symbolic value of a piece being female is of so much significance. If my father teaches me how to play chess through a themed set; and all pieces and mechanics are performatively identical to normal chess; the fact a Queen isn't called a "Queen" is enough to make us sitting at a table regularly over two decades suddenly *not* Oedipal? If it's the exact same thing and just painted a slightly different color, but under such a small and slight change it would no longer apply, then that appears to be an extremely shallow theme.  > We can use numbers for money or time. Why would it make any difference in counting money to point out that numbers can be used to represent times?  I don't think you're connecting what I'm saying here. I'm saying that your argument is something to the effect of "Fathers who play baseball with their sons are good fathers because of the symbolic or underlying dramatic value of baseball" and my argument is "Well softball is basically identical, shouldn't that mean fathers who teach softball are also good fathers" and your answer is no? Because the difference between these (and the symbolic value) is completely arbitrary and surface-level.	1640932075.0	hqnianj	t3_rslo34	t1_hqnfr3m	/r/changemyview/comments/rslo34/cmv_fathers_who_teach_their_sons_chess_are/hqnianj/

You don't need to have sex right now, just chill out. If you get side effects from birth control you should get a copper IUD, it contains no hormones and as such doesn't cause the side effects. It's the most effective birth control out there as well.  I don't think you are aware of the struggles many women face. First of all, teenagers' brains haven't finished developing, so are you really going to make them have a baby if they get pregnant, or even worse if they got pregnant because they wanted to use protection but we're unable to? This doesn't make sense. Birth control always has side effects in some regards as a hormonal medication. Plus it is easy to miss a pill. The IUD reacts badly in some people and you need access to quality medical care to do it.	1640937546.0	hqnq80e	t3_rsnhc0	t1_hqnomn0	/r/changemyview/comments/rsnhc0/cmv_abortion_really_isnt_great_and_encouraging_it/hqnq80e/

7z1oto59	This is entirely anecdotal and most likely won’t change your mind I didn’t believe in the concept of soul mates either until I met mine. I thought the idea you had one person to find and be with was ridiculous as relationships require work, commitment, and shared values to work. Coming from a practical background, I was also personally very staunchly anti-marriage, anti-fairy-tale-romance/unrealistic expectations. Then I met my husband. It was like getting hit with a ton of bricks. We just *clicked* right from the moment we met. I can’t even describe it to you, it was very instinctual for both of us, like everything had finally fallen into place and I had finally found what I wasn’t even looking for even though I didn’t even know what I was looking for. It sounds cheesy and unbelievable even now, but neither of us can even remember what life was like before we knew each other, and even now we have this overwhelming general feeling of “how have we possibly lived this long without each other?” It is a feeling of belonging.   I’m not saying it isn’t hard work, of course it is. Like everyone else, we have disagreements and go through hard times. But I think it’s easier because we both know to our bones the other person only wants the best for us and are willing to do anything for the others happiness. Everything we own is jointly ours and we are partners in every sense of the word. It isn’t a magic catch-all, but it *feels* like magic everyday to be with someone who is quite literally my other half.	1640991119.0	hqqm5nx	t3_rslzdc	t3_rslzdc	/r/changemyview/comments/rslzdc/cmv_soulmates_dont_exist_and_pretending_they_do/hqqm5nx/

(This is part of why Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock and so many other comedians all use such distinctive stage voices.)   And if your initial reaction to their distinct style is to think that it's ugly or unpleasant? Well, aside from the fact that your opinion is subjective, after watching a few episodes, you won't notice it anymore. Because Our sense of beauty is rooted in familiarity and typicality. (If you're curious, you can google \[beauty familiarity\] and see a slew of articles and studies examining it.)  Basically, we have an idea of how things "ought" to look and appreciate those that conform to our expectations. But those expectations are moldable. Repeated exposure to an unfamiliar style makes it familiar, and seeing it duplicated in other places makes it seem typical. It's not even limited to cartoons: Think about hairstyles over the decades. We laugh at '80s and '90s hair, but why weren't they laughing then? Distinctive looks made people stare. Copycats made it familiar and attractive. Oversaturation made it lose its distinctiveness. We all moved on.   \*\*\*Distinctive visuals (and voices) also serve another solid purpose. The *initial* unfamiliarity makes you uncomfortable, which itself primes you to laugh. And laughing keeps you engaged which helps you build up that familiarity.	1640997003.0	hqqytht	t3_rt2go6	t3_rt2go6	/r/changemyview/comments/rt2go6/cmv_the_philosophy_that_nothing_is_ugly_cartoon/hqqytht/
944l62xo	I think it is hilarious how so many people approve of citizens rioting - until the political side they do not like does it.   I actually strongly approve of the Capitol riots. Partisan politics aside - it is far more appropriate than most other riots I have seen. Most other riots I see on tv involves burning down, destroying, and looting private property. Citizens punishing other citizens for the actions of government.   At least in the case of the Capitol riots, the citizens rioted against the very government they had an issue with.   I remember back during the Seattle riots when the left took over a part of downtown Seattle - I disapproved. Except when I heard they took over a police station. Then, even though I largely support the police (not completely but that doesn't matter for this post), I shrugged. They were taking their complaints and riot directly to the government entity they had an issue with.   The Capitol riots - in my ever so humble opinion - was the CORRECT way to riot if you are going to do so.	1641025505.0	hqsc6ja	t3_rrjzy3	t3_rrjzy3	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqsc6ja/

2h8owb	First, if the "simulation" is so complete that its component elements have individual identities and personalities, is it at all meaningful to call it a simulation? It's simply a different part of reality. All you're doing is expanding the scope of the unexplored territory in your universe. Like Europe discovering the Americas, it's just more reality that we didn't know about before. It only means that space isn't the *final* frontier.  Second, if we are outsiders inserted *into* the simulation a la The Matrix, then the scale of the universe makes no sense. What need is there for Saturn or galaxies outside the milky way when we're all confined to Earth? And if other faraway planets *are* hosting life, why? When you could just simulate it in instances?	1641031668.0	hqsja3q	t3_rtfaut	t3_rtfaut	/r/changemyview/comments/rtfaut/cmv_we_live_in_a_simulation/hqsja3q/

3a3smqa2	You do understand how people use language, right?  Like you know that old canard teachers used to love to use? You'd say "Can I go to the bathroom" And they'd try to make it a learning experience by asking "I don't know, *can* you?"  Well that has always been really stupid, because it ignores how language is used. The teacher knows what I meant, which means the message was conveyed by the use of the word 'can' instead of 'may'. Moreover, the phrase 'May I go to the bathroom' suffers the same damn problem. "May you? Sure you may, but do you mean may you do so now?"  See, the way people use language includes a whole bunch of assumptions in essentially everything we say. Can I go to the bathroom is "Can I go to the bathroom now". It is also "Can I go to the bathroom because I need to pee" and "Can I go to the bathroom during class" and "Can I go right now" and so on and so forth.  So when I said:  "These markets aren't tied into anything people actually use. AIG's collapse broke the buck in money market mutual funds which caused the commercial paper market to pop. The biggest connection to reality of a crypto crash is that I might be able to afford a GPU."   A reasonable person would, or should, be able to understand that I'm talking about how they are not interconnected in a systemic way. And that same person would, or should, reasonably understand that chiming in with "Well ackshually, a miniscule amount of people are taking bank loans so it will have a minuscule impact" says nothing. It is pedantry for the sake of pedantry.  At best, you've said nothing of value.

q1r4t	Imagine two co-workers, one male and one female.  They are both individually in relationships, but they've known each other for a very long time are quite comfortable around each other.  While mostly their relationship is platonic, they can be occasionally flirty, but it's understood that they don't mean anything by it and no one has shown discomfort regarding their behavior, including their partners.  One evening, they have drinks after work, get a bit drunk, and do something that crosses a line.  It's hard to know where the line was, but they both understand that it was crossed.  They don't want to leave their relationships, they don't want to stop being friends, but they MUST stop the flirty banter if they don't want things to go bad.  It means policing their habits and occasional awkwardness as they find a new normal.  \_\_\_  Honestly, this metaphor breaks down really quickly and I wish that I was clever enough to come up with one that fit better, but there is still a lesson here.  Men are being policed for their sexualization of women because we, as a society, have agreed that they crossed a line.  We're all looking for a new normal that keeps us further from the line to prevent it from happening again.  Eventually, we'll get comfortable enough to allow some of that behavior to become acceptable again, but probably with a bit more caution than it used to have.  This transition isn't affecting judgement of women's actions because there is no consensus that women crossed the same line.  Unfortunately, as we adjust, not everyone takes it well.  Some women and SJWs react overly harshly, expecting habits to disappear overnight or being unduly willing to further damage the relationship.  Some men and conservative women take offense to having to change their behaviors, going so far as to argue that "the line" was never crossed in the first place.  And many men and women have trouble with the apparent hypocrisy of policing one dominant sex's actions and not the other.  I think it all really boils down to trust.  It isn't acceptable for men to sexualize women because we are rebuilding trust.  It is, marginally, more acceptable for women to sexualize men because they aren't rebuilding trust.  Also, women who take advantage of this dichotomy to behave however they want while still claiming the moral high ground are rubbish people.	1641134882.0	hqxsnqy	t3_rtzi3u	t3_rtzi3u	/r/changemyview/comments/rtzi3u/cmv_it_is_much_more_acceptable_for_women_to/hqxsnqy/

4riao	It's not about sexualization alone, it's about power.  Have you, as a man, ever been catcalled on the street? Or had an older woman in a car follow you while you were jogging? Have you ever had a boss hit on you at work? Or had a person staring at you at a red light and whine clearly masturbating?  Because all of those are things that have happened to women I know personally. The issue is not about whether men or women sexualize each other more, it's about the freedom men feel to objectify women who are trying to live their life. It's not equal and it's not really close. Ask the adult women and men in your life if these kinds of things have happened to them. I think you'll find that the counterexamples are few and far between.	1641147913.0	hqyoea3	t3_rtzi3u	t1_hqw683r	/r/changemyview/comments/rtzi3u/cmv_it_is_much_more_acceptable_for_women_to/hqyoea3/

flajjc9n	I guess you can argue it’s not a racial slur based on the origin of the word.   If I’m not mistaken, the word cracker usually referred to poor white people particularly from the south. While this is a term directed towards a particular group of people, it’s not like it was a word that was only used by non-white to specifically degrade white people.  White people referred to other white people as crackers.  While more commonly known racial slurs such as the N-word, spick, wetback, or chink more or less we’re not actually used by the POC communities these were retarding. They were used by people who considered these particular groups as less than.	1641149060.0	hqyrm2h	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqyrm2h/
1lf6zu76	Okay, so generally people who call themselves proud Americans have a very specific idea of what America is that is exclusive to a very small group of Americans. They paper over the blood that built up their jingoistic fantasy and they can potentially be radicalized into zealots with little reflection upon the weakness that was America's bigoted history.   Native Americans also tend to ignore the negative elements of their cultures, but their cultures are nearly dead, so they have the leeway to do so. Their won't be a returning to scalpings, human sacrifices or the like, so why step on their toes in the preservation of their cultural memory? We don't all share their story and we don't fear their future. It's not our business to repaint that narrative.   As an African-American, so-called proud Americans erase our role in building this nation constantly. They see us as "unAmerican," in some way, an other that has been there instead of as the people who raised the leaders of the nation, who built it's first economy, who altered it's culture and we're acculturated by it moreso than any group except possibly Anglo-Americans and Scotch-Irish. How can you love America and erase our story? You can't and you don't, you love a fiction. A dangerous fiction. They're allowed to of course, but why should we not take part in adding the details so long erased? And if they don't want to hear it, they'll stop spreading the false story.   I am a proud American by the way, and I invite White Americans to continue being proud Americans in spite of the shaming they'll get for it. Prove the haters wrong like every other culture had to.	1641149705.0	hqyteps	t3_ru8dkr	t3_ru8dkr	/r/changemyview/comments/ru8dkr/cmv_other_cultures_who_are_proud_of_themselves/hqyteps/
flajjc9n	Words change over time…..  Cracker, like I said, used to refer to poor white people. Other white people fed into the use of the word cracker. It’s not a racial slur because it did not exist to specifically degrade you based on race.   The N-word did.  The N-word still exists to degrade you based on race. Black people referring to each other as the N-word does not do this. However, people still very much use the N-word as a means to degrade you because you’re black.  Quite frankly, I personally believe usage of the N-word with a black communities is a very western phenomenon so I don’t have the greatest opinion about it. But I’m points does stands, that other recognized racial slurs more or less are not commonly used by or within POC communities.	1641149881.0	hqytvv4	t3_rug2bf	t1_hqytbn9	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqytvv4/

35a93s8y	I agree with your 3 questions. Thanks for making these topics more clear. I'll give a piece-by-piece analysis of my response since I had to read it a few times.   > Firstly, there's an economics terms that explains why no nations ever want to go to war: pareto efficiency. Hence throwing cookies away is pareto inefficient.  This sounds like a lose-lose scenario in negotiation. This is a logical point of view but there can be uncertainty (due to lack of trust), mistakes can happen, resources can become limited, etc. I think it's just more complicated than thinking about win-lose lose-lose scenarios.  The world isn't that black and white. I'd argue there are more questions to be discussed, maybe such as should China, Russia, or the US have the influence it does in the world? What are the intentions of all these countries?   I don't believe war is good for anyone but nationalism/competition seems to be a spark that causes countries to aim to increase influence through extreme measures, which I guess is really what my view is on the matter. **To this point, I have a solution that would be a win-win and I'd be interested to hear what you think.**  >The CCP isn't stupid, far from it. They want Taiwan, they want the South China Sea, they want control over the Himalayas. They might be willing to go to war, but they would prefer the US just gave up first. They would prefer the US just looks at their military, thinks "eh, not worth it" and surrenders support from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea.   Full disclosure: I'm a Gen-Z American and went to public schools. we learned about something called "[Manifest Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny)" in school. So for those of you talking about Texas, I can't really argue with you on that. I think what should be argued is the reasons behind conflict at a moral level because we are complex individuals and societies after all. Is it bad for Russia and China to fundamentally want control of Ukraine and Taiwan? I guess not, but I can't say it is fundamentally bad for Taiwan or Ukraine to want to be sovereign states either. Why do China and Russia want this control?  >   >   >Secondly, I'm not sure that American hegemony is so clearly beneficial to the world.  I'd argue the US is the lesser of two evils. My solution is related to this if you are willing to hear.   >For China, Hong Kong is dangerous because it's a source of internal dissent and international control within China. The American strategy has been to control the seas around China to block it in (alliances with Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea). This makes it so that the US poses, again, a real threat to China. If there is a war, China will be hemmed in and the US will control what happens. This was essentially the problem in the century of humiliation, and has been shown to lead to China not having control.  Is it possible Hong Kong aided China to become as powerful as it is today? Also, I think the real issue is what the dissent is about, which is related to my solution. This sounds like a chicken and egg kind of argument too.	1641150543.0	hqyvpkj	t3_rtc4b4	t1_hqs2a4v	/r/changemyview/comments/rtc4b4/cmv_russia_and_china_are_looking_for_war/hqyvpkj/

2h8owb	Technically? Yes.  Meaningfully? No.  It's *literally* a racial/ethnic slur, as it is a term that disparages a person for their membership in a racial/ethnic group and nothing else. End of discussion.  But as far as slurs go, it's pretty much worthless. As John Mulaney put it, "If you're comparing the badness of two words, and you won’t even say one of them? That's the worse word!" And no one really hesitates to say "cracker."   I'm a white dude. I've been called it a few times in my life, but never in a conflict, and never with any degree of hate behind it. It's been, at worst, vaguely dismissive? But even if that was the intent, it was never the effect. Because the word is empty. It doesn't actually convey anything insulting because no one actually knows what it's supposed to mean.   * Are they Scots-Irish Americans who like to brag (cracker from "craic," and the original documented use of the word)?     * Not really insulting. Maybe slightly demeaning, but lots of people take pride in their chattiness.  * Are they bland and uninteresting (soda cracker)?     * Not really a *racial* slur. It's targeting at an individual's personality, not identity. * Or are they powerful people with control over the insulter (from a whip's crack)?    * Not really a racial *slur.* It's certainly racial, but the "insult" is pretty weak. You'd be better off feigning subservience and saying "yes massa" and "no massa" to just make people generally uncomfortable.  The problem is that no one's actually using the word as if it means any of those things. They say it as if it means "you're white and therefore bad," just the same as any other racial slur. And how do those work? Well they tend to serve as a stand in for saying "you embody all the negative stereotypes commonly associated with your race." So if you call someone a "cracker," what are the *negative* stereotypes associated with white people inside the US?  I'm seriously asking. Because as far as I can tell there aren't any *universal* ones.  So again, is it technically a racial slur? Sure. But is it actually a racial *slur?* No.	1641163946.0	hqzv1ju	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqzv1ju/

2h8owb	What you've outlined essentially boils down to "being taken seriously; being treated as though your words, thoughts, and actions all have meaning; and being rewarded or penalized accordingly." And *many* women would absolutely love to have that as their default status instead of something they have to fight for.  Plenty of women would find some aspects of it intolerable, I'm sure. But it's not a categorical thing.   And it's not really a meaningful point to argue over. Because the things that men find frustrating aren't the only things that define the experience of being a man. There are a *ton* of great things too. So you could just as easily reverse this and say "if men were treated like women, they would hate it."   The problem isn't a blanket statement about "how men are treated," but a criticism of certain specific aspects of how men experience daily life or how they're expected to behave. i.e., the *toxic* aspects of masculine standards contrasted with the healthy and positive ones.	1641165187.0	hqzy6iq	t3_rulxnz	t3_rulxnz	/r/changemyview/comments/rulxnz/cmv_if_women_were_treated_like_men_they_would/hqzy6iq/

htwiy9av	Cracker is a slur. However, I think it's important to consider what's behind it, as opposed to, say, the N word.   Cracker is a reference to the sound of a whip, evoking the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. As such, when used toward white people, it comes from a place of relative powerlessness. It brings up a history of violence and oppression by white people.   The N-word is almost the opposite - it comes from a place of power, further degrading its targets. It brings up a history of oppression *to the oppressed,* and conjures histories of poverty, myths about intelligence, and memories of violence. The N word's goal is to tear people down. The word "cracker" doesn't tear people down - at most it may alienate someone.	1641170120.0	hr0aho5	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0aho5/
4p6wj88t	What mansion are you living in that requires 8 hours straight of chores every single day? If was anything close to as strenuous as you describe, then how do single people/even single parents with kids work and complete chores?  My high school sweet heart had a stay at home mom (the dad brought in 150k as a safety supervisor or some such) who was awesome. My girlfriend had a younger sister who hadn’t started school just yet.   Everyday she would:  - get up early, go for a run.  - make a ridiculously good lunch for my partner to take to school.  - every single day, drive my partner to and from school.  - every day, do a general tidy of the house, complete all the laundry and start cooking a complex meal (she likes cooking, think like slow cooked roast etc) and often proclaimed she would be doing a “fun” activity with the younger sister before 11am.  - she would then spend the rest of her day hobby chasing, reading or watching movies. She was very vocal about how much she loved her life and how she couldn’t believe the husband made the deal that they lived (he hated all domestic chores and was always appreciative.  So, I witnessed this spouse growing up (easily could have been roles reversed) be an absolute weapon of a homemaker, having all “work done” (even including excercise which is realistically leisure) done in 4-5 hours (and she did it to a, sometimes comically, high standard) then having 6 hours to do whatever they wanted. It’s not even like at 5pm when the husband gets home, the day is over either. Then she would just tack on to everyone else’s “normal” leisure time. The only negative that could be presented is sometimes yes, the younger sister may have just general child issues that take up time randomly throughout the week, tantrums etc. Tbh tho, it just doesn’t compare, even if it took up 6 hours that would just start to equal a genuine job. The only caveat being the mental exhaustion that you don’t get to leave the workplace.  Imo, I’ve seen the dynamic multiple times throughout my life, especially entering my 30’s as my friends have started to settle and the balance is clear to me. Which ever partner takes on the house keeper role deserves recognition, appreciation and gratitude because the tasks can be seen as less desirable or sometimes just unpleasant but once the actual math is done: it’s simply less work in quantity. If they treat home making as an actual job of employment, they will always finish earlier and even if they don’t, it’s under their own steam as they are their own boss which in itself it’s unbelievably liberating. I’m just trying to imagine if I was allowed to have Netflix blasting in my work place while I completed my tasks for the day, good perks lol.  Obviously, exceptions to the rule such as 10+ kids, the first year a baby is born and if they own a massive property that requires maintenance etc.	1641170131.0	hr0ailb	t3_rulmib	t1_hr03jgr	/r/changemyview/comments/rulmib/cmv_its_the_stay_at_home_parents_job_regardless/hr0ailb/

8n24i	This is a narrow definition of privilege which is kind of nonsense. You're basically saying if I'm in a 400m race and I get to line up at the start line but everyone else has to line up 20m behind it, I'm not privileged, I'm precisely where I should be, rather they're disadvantaged. Whereas, if they're at the start line and I get a 20m head, then I'm privileged and they're not disadvantageous?   Sure, whatever, who cares? It's bullshit either way.  Also, even employing this very-narrow definition of privilege, white people are still *very* privileged. Even if we limit to times where the black and white rule rarely applies to white people in the same way it applies to Black people but the application to Black people is in keeping with the wording of the rule.  Speeding and other common traffic infractions are against the law, you're much more likely to get pulled over for them if you're Black. Weed is still against the law on the books in a number of places, but in practice it's basically legal for white people and has been for a generation. And on and on.  Even if we limit "privilege" to instances where a teacher says to 5 kids everyone is going to lose one cookie, but only actually takes a cookie from 4, it's still the case that that happens a lot.	1641171607.0	hr0e2ll	t3_ruoepp	t3_ruoepp	/r/changemyview/comments/ruoepp/cmv_white_privilege_does_not_exist_poc/hr0e2ll/

I also take shifts taking care of my son during the day or at night because I love my wife and kid. My wife is not a babysitter and a maid, she is the mother of my kid and needs proper rest and respect.   My work is not too demanding and if I were to act like how you think working parent should act, my wife would leave me in a second and I will deserve it.	1641174129.0	hr0k3my	t3_rulmib	t3_rulmib	/r/changemyview/comments/rulmib/cmv_its_the_stay_at_home_parents_job_regardless/hr0k3my/
dqntho5j	>But the usage of the word would only be for appeasement then since you only change your usage due to their preference.  well yes, but isn't that how social constructs work? you say in your OP that pronouns are "constructed to assist communication", and allowing people to express themselves and their identities more accurately certainly assists with that   >Could you confidently draw a line between a hotdog and a sandwich? Of course not but this does not mean that we should begin calling toasts hotdogs  if a piece of toast became sentient and politely asked to be called "hotdog", i would gladly meet their request. objects do not have their own internal gender identities, but humans do  if i'm understanding you correctly, your argument is that people should not be allowed to determine their own pronouns because it makes language more "confusing". i think this is a shallow way to look at the issue  transgender people (and people who have existed outside of the binary of "male/female") have existed throughout the entirety of human history, and by saying that people should not be allowed to determine their own pronouns, you are erasing their very real experiences  the cost of simplifying something as nuanced and personal as gender into a binary that people aren't allowed to deviate from in any way is that it means transgender people and gender non-conforming people will suffer as a result. in my view, your position goes against the lived experiences and reality of millions upon millions of people solely in the name of "simplifying" language, and i find that to be inhumane	1641174267.0	hr0kfrj	t3_ruonrl	t1_hr0iphv	/r/changemyview/comments/ruonrl/cmv_self_identifying_pronouns_does_not_make_any/hr0kfrj/

2az883be	This is a useless CMV. This isn’t a “view”. Are you really going to contend that a terms meaning is it’s meaning?  When you use the word cracker to describe a thin baked snack it doesn’t refer to a person of a certain race. When you use it to refer to a person, you are using it to infer a race.  If your CMV was contending it being comparable to a variety of derogatory racial terms used to describe people of non-white races, then that would be a view to contend. You’re not going to find anyone who disagrees that “cracker” describes a white person and not in a complimentary way. But try to argue that it’s hurtful or offensive in a way comparable to any of a number of other racial slurs and you’re going to get owned.	1641175862.0	hr0ob04	t3_rug2bf	t1_hqzbtr9	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0ob04/

2ru41zdc	Listen, I acknowledge the existence of institutional racism and the lasting impact it has had on African American people to this day. I think enslavement, lynching, segregation, and other forms of oppression that have been thrust upon African Americans are absolutely appalling.   My quarrel with the word “cracker” and racial slurs more broadly is how some are seen as inoffensive to certain people, and the asinine justifications these people make up as to why they aren’t offensive. I am aware that some racial slurs are worse than others - I know that. I like to see progress, and when I see people condoning the use of racial slurs against white people, it honestly confuses me. I myself am  not offended by cracker, but it’s important to note that one person’s feelings( mine in this scenario) are not representative of everyone. I think racial slurs of all forms should be cast into the abyss and never used again, but that obviously won’t happen because there are a lot of racist people out there.   My brain is fried. I’m taking a break.	1641176568.0	hr0pzpu	t3_rug2bf	t1_hr0nd37	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0pzpu/
3mqd2	Part of white privilege is having our experience and perspective be considered the default or norm. We are the standard that everything else is contrasted to. In our society we are the “us” that every “them” is defined as different from.  Changing the term from “white privilege” to some variation of “POC disadvantage” is perpetuating and capitulating to the exact phenomenon it is used to critique. The term comes from conversations made by POC for POC, so of course it is from the viewpoint of POC—and subsequently that the POC experience is the baseline to be compared to. To me at least it feels like the height of entitlement to demand POC reframe their ideas and their discussions around my perspective as white person before I’m willing to even engage with the topic.  The fact that many white people are so uncomfortable having a discussion where they are the “other” and crudely lumped together under a label is not unexpected, nor is it unique to white people. It doesn’t feel good when it happens to any person or group. The difference is that white people largely have the privilege of not experiencing that with any regularity in regards to their race. It’s a discomfort that we as group have not gotten used to, and don’t know how to cope with. Other races experience it all the time in our society, and they have been forced to learn how to live with it.  So it’s not even anything along the lines of “white people have treated us badly so we will treat them badly in the same way to show them what it feels like” which is how I’ve seen things rationalized before. It’s literally simply that the conversation around white privilege is from the perspective of POC. Even if your argument is that we should remove disadvantages—one of those disadvantages is POC not being allowed to center conversations from their identity and their perspective. Equality in that sense is white people not using our discomfort as justification for marginalizing or outright dismissing those conversations and viewpoints.  As long as human brains function with and in-group vs out-group mentality everyone will experience being placed in an out-group by someone else. It is a privilege that white people have forcibly established a monopoly on being considered the in-group in order to not experience the discomfort of being in an out-group. The rule isn’t that no one should feel like they’re in an out-group, and POC are disadvantaged by being placed in that position. The rule is the that in-group vs out-group is an inevitable aspect of human interaction, and white people have done just about everything in their power to exempt themselves from that at the expense of everyone else.	1641176837.0	hr0qmgy	t3_ruoepp	t3_ruoepp	/r/changemyview/comments/ruoepp/cmv_white_privilege_does_not_exist_poc/hr0qmgy/
espobaf	Yeah but MOST white people lose no sleep over being called a cracker. It's like someone calling you short. Are short people oppressed in society? No. Are they going to care when you call them short? If you're not a friend teasing them they'll probably be offended or annoyed but it's most likely not gonna give them nightmares. That's unless they do have trauma associated with it and they are being bullied. But in that relatively rare case the same applies to white people and bullying for any physical feature you can't change is wrong. The thing with the n word is that it has trauma and the history of oppression associated with it. Racism is still alive today and no matter how much you try and distance the word (especially the hard r) from that racism it's never going to lose that impact until every black person has lived a full life free from being called the n word or affected by those who call them that.	1641177354.0	hr0rv7r	t3_rug2bf	t1_hr05bdv	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0rv7r/
171sgb	You're right that it's technically a racial slur. But in reality nobody actually cares. Like...I've never seen it affect someone, because they don't care.   I'm not a fan of feigning offense where none exists, or getting offended "on principle" in lieu of any real-world effect, or getting offended on behalf of other people (none of whom are actually offended). So in that spirit: I'm not gonna pretend to care about this one because not only do I like...never hear it outside of TV and moves, but even if I did it's so weak it would mean nothing to me.   >...and people that get offended by the word are either white supremacists or just frail.  Well, this is a thing that racists and/or garbage people say because they take +any excuse to act like the very shitheads they pretend to oppose. There's nothing people love more than to belittle, insult, and watch other people suffer, *and feel righteous for doing it.* But that's a separate issue.     Someone who turns the slightest disagreement to anything they say into "das racissss" is just a shit person and you can ignore them and move on with your life.   TL;DR: While you're technically right I don't see how it benefits anyone to focus on it or to search for more reasons to amp up the language policing.	1641177671.0	hr0smee	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0smee/

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia\_cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_cracker) (Also, Florida.)  Yes, the *original* meaning of the word is not the intent behind its use as a slur. But that's why I said "no one's actually using the word as if it means any of those things." Rather, its original use strongly suggests the *origin* of the slur (it's in the right location too, in the heart of the American south), which may have had other meanings tacked on after the fact.	1641177912.0	hr0t70h	t3_rug2bf	t1_hr0jmzb	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0t70h/

bcbhlary	Kind of the first thing you said. I'm saying that men's ideal height being at least 6'0 and anything less than that being considered short is a meme because it's only just recently been so widespread and popular. Specifically 6'0+ height. I believe it's a passing body ideal trend just like being extremely skinny was in the 90's/early 2000's.  It seems this is something that affects men very personally so I wanted to challenge people on the idea that it has always or will always be this way. I posted it here because I wanted to see if anyone had any evidence to the contrary. I also wanted anyone seeing it to realize how much you shouldn't base your value on the whims of society, the goal post that always changes.  It's just a meme that a lot of people are taking way too seriously when before, nobody really paid that much attention to any specific number and being less than 6'0 tall wasn't nearly as big of a deal as it is today.	1641184110.0	hr171cb	t3_ruqn0v	t1_hr13h21	/r/changemyview/comments/ruqn0v/cmv_ideal_male_height_being_60_or_more_is_a_meme/hr171cb/

I'm not sure if a guy that height has any significant disadvantages specifically related to short people, other than being socially perceived as short due to the popularity of this meme, which will hopefully not last forever.	1641184285.0	hr17en8	t3_ruqn0v	t1_hr124mh	/r/changemyview/comments/ruqn0v/cmv_ideal_male_height_being_60_or_more_is_a_meme/hr17en8/

It might be plausible that a sex doll user might be more likely to become a necrophiliac, but without actual evidence they do, then we really don't know this.	1641189717.0	hr1hjbr	t3_ruskf3	t1_hr1gir4	/r/changemyview/comments/ruskf3/cmv_having_sex_with_a_sexdoll_may_push_some/hr1hjbr/

42n355dn	Not seeing race in the long run might be usefull however, for now it is important, here is why:  Racism can exist in a systemical way, so teaching people to not see race would lead to them not realising that the system might be prejudice towards some races, here is an example:   In the 1800s someone made a law or something that said that if your grandfather could not vote, you also could not, (how could this be racist?) well this was in the times where slavery recently ended and with that black people could not vote, therefore  racism would still exist even if we did not see it, the damage of the system has already been done and the victims would still be opressed.   I think a better way is acknowledging the fact that race is a important thing although meaningless, under todays society it plays a huge role, the damage of racism has been done already, and, without being able to see race those problems will still exist.

Let's call a spade a spade here.  >Whether they're high school dropouts or Stanford engineers, his employees are the highest paid workers in America for their level of education. Unions are a response to crappy executives. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX are currently ranked the number 1 and number 2 most desirable employers in America.  They aren't though? None of this is true. Both Tesla and SpaceX are known for underpayment & you're delusional if you think they pay anywhere near comparable tech companies. Also, not sure where you found them to be the most desirable places to work. Couldn't find a single poll showing that. All I found was Glassdoors top 100 work environments - which I didn't see Tesla or SpaceX on.  Then again, that's not surprising considering SpaceX got sued, and lost, for illegally denying employees breaks.

4xzidbky	From a policy standpoint the card balances are a liability of the company and the money isn't subject to taxes until the gift card is spent. The card balances also need to be escheated to the local states after they're considered abandoned property under state laws. If they never expire and are good forever this allows the companies to keep the money forever tax free. This sort of thing shouldn't happen.	1641200067.0	hr1wccf	t3_rux1o2	t3_rux1o2	/r/changemyview/comments/rux1o2/cmv_gift_cards_should_never_expire/hr1wccf/

Businesses do take on that risk. Every gift card sold isn’t treated as cash but as a liability for future services or goods. It’s like airplane miles.   Most people use gift cards within eight weeks. Those that don’t: three to four years. The rest, you shift from liability to asset.   In that case, the later the person uses the card, the greater the business cost. I’d want late fees to encourage use. I wouldn’t want the opportunity cost of outstanding gift cards as an anchor on my balance sheet.	1641201192.0	hr1xrqu	t3_rux1o2	t3_rux1o2	/r/changemyview/comments/rux1o2/cmv_gift_cards_should_never_expire/hr1xrqu/

There's tons of cultural groups that support white communities and aren't used as a weapon. Milwaukee for example hosts an Italian fest, German Fest, Irish Fest, Polish Fest a place near me hosts Swedish fest. These are all put on by identity interest groups that are made up of white people. In many situations black people can't really host Ethiopia fest or Ghana fest because many don't know where their ancestors came from (due to them being captured slaves).

4g6va	A long time ago I read a quote from one of the writers of the Exalted TTRPG talking about one of that setting's ultimate evils, the Ebon Dragon, that I didn't think I'd be paraphrasing on this sub of all places but here goes:  > "His evil is pathetic. It's contemptible. That doesn't make him weak, but neither is he heroic in any sense of the word. He's a force of evil without scruples or morals that stands for nothing except making life worse for everyone. He will stab you in the back at every turn and cannot be reformed. But when you pull back the curtain and really *look* at him, you can see him for what he is: Not different or alien, just a loser. A dangerous loser, a loser with nothing stopping him hurting you any way he thinks he can get away with, but a loser nonetheless. None of this makes him less dangerous - he's smart and powerful enough that there's a very real threat he might win, but it won't be a triumphant victory and trying to frame it as such misses the point. He doesn't get to be cool for being evil. He doesn't get to win at his own game, he gets to lose at everyone else's. Give him half a chance and he'll go on and on about how virtue and morality are a tangled mess of pointless delusion and hypocrisy, but it's all to cover up the fact of the matter: That he's stuck playing in the same moral sandbox as everyone else, and he *sucks* at it. And on some level, he knows it.  A villain that's a loser isn't an oxymoron. There's something compelling about someone who's so insecure and shitty that the only thing they know what to do with that is make everyone else as miserable than they are. At the very least it's *a* valid way to write a villain.	1642555278.0	ht9apbg	t3_s7d4ii	t3_s7d4ii	/r/changemyview/comments/s7d4ii/cmv_voldemort_is_an_insecure_manchild_that_sits/ht9apbg/

Also if you treat media as escapism it's a disservice to it as a creative endeavor. It means that you are not really appreciating it for what it is but for some temporary relief. You could replace the media with something else and it wouldn't matter because it's just a distraction.  The whole idea of killing time or distractions is a bit sad in itself. Time is our most precious thing. Life is strange and mysterious. Why not live each moment fully? Even if you're just watching a show to rest, why not enjoy the show instead of tresting it as an escape? Plus it won't work since your problems will not go away.  Adorno's comments are pretty relevant today because it seems as though escapism is cannibalizing whole swathes of culture, making it interchangeable.

gzycg4vs	I agree with a lot of what you say, but I think your last point there is a bit disingenuous.  I'm not saying white nationalism is okay because black nationalism is okay. I'm just saying that it is completely unrealistic to expect white people NOT to rally around their identity overtly while other races are doing the exact same thing. Whether or not it's justified is besides the point. Unfortunately I do believe identity politics sort of plays into white nationalists wet dreams as it helps create a unified white identity by painting society as an eternal struggle between White People and POC. I don't like it anymore than you do. I certainly would prefer an identity politics movement that focused on class and improving the material conditions of the lower and middle classes through a united front but that is fundamentally incompatible with the modern approach.	1642533315.0	ht7qd9i	t3_s74jq4	t1_ht7o95q	/r/changemyview/comments/s74jq4/cmv_conservatives_pandering_to_white_people_more/ht7qd9i/

They also have zero incentive to muck around with the Constitution because its structure benefits them quite nicely.  The 2006 Democratic Party could still beat the stuffing out of them under the existing rules, the problem is that Democrats both want an electorally unviable coalition based on liberal social issues (as opposed to their old coalition based on rural-friendly economic populism) AND to win at the same time.  I don't know what it's going to take for people to figure out that's untenable, but the GOP will keep will be able to get away with pretty much anything until they do.	1642535761.0	ht7wzvr	t3_s6jhhk	t1_ht72flr	/r/changemyview/comments/s6jhhk/cmv_be_careful_what_you_wish_for_by_getting_rid/ht7wzvr/
3s4ve8nm	>I see them as all "needs", they are just on a hierarchy where some need to be fulfilled before others (e.g. Mazlow's hierarchy).  Which doesn't necessitate that that need be an (optional) career.  >Agreed. But being a full-time parent rather than balancing parenthood with a full-time job is not necessarily the right or moral choice.  It would be an issue of morality and responsibility if you're prioritizing an optional career over that of your children. You're own sentence implies that balancing that with a job would mean you're a part-time parent. If this is already the situation with one parent who works and is able to provide for the family comfortably, why would you want to have *both* parents be "part-time" parents?   >How much time is one expected to devote to one's family before one is allowed to take time to do something for oneself as an individual?  This is reframing the role of homemaker as someone who doesn't have any autonomy or agency for themselves. Are mothers who don't have a salaried job really not able to do anything for themselves? They don't have their own friends, their own interests, pursuits, hobbies, etc? They don't act as individuals? Why is a man who is *expected* to work and provide for himself and his family seen as being somehow freer?   >It relies on the assumption that these boys, consciously or subconsciously, see this as a "failure" of parenting (or of "strong" fatherhood) in the same way you (an adult with the benefit of years of experience, hindsight, and frontal cortex development) have.  I never said that they see it as a *failure* of parenting, subconsciously or consciously. What I said is that they begin to look up to other role models, and that gradually that erodes the respect they have for their parents, in this case, their fathers. As I said before with the example of condescension, it's an issue of respect through actions, not necessarily through conscious thought.   >I agreed allowing others the opportunity to save face in business situations was useful.   You initially were dismissive of it in general application though, as you said it's something that needs to "stay lost."   >I Googled for this poster and from what I found it looks like just an average rap artist poster.   It wouldn't matter if it looked like the "average" rap poster, as something being commonplace doesn't mean it should be seen as acceptable, or that it doesn't produce a negative effect. Racist caricatures of black people were common in the U.S., pre-Jim Crow, from entertainment to advertisements.   >The tattoos don't even really stand out, it's just ink I wouldn't otherwise pay much mind if you hadn't pointed them out as something you believe to be a problem.   This speaks to people being deficient in standards and lacking awareness. And as a parent, you should have higher standards and be more aware of these things when raising your children. And we've already agreed that Tupac Shakur is a horrible role model, an example of actual toxic masculinity, and a performer who's entire catalogue consists of promoting criminality, misogyny, drug use, and violence. Not to mention, hip-hop music itself is generally problematic in what it promotes. I have a hard time believing that adults, let alone parents, are that clueless.  >There doesn't seem to be anything overtly immoral or objectively wrong with these posters. So why assume any given father would be holding the same beliefs as you with the same experiences as you and react the same way as you would?  This is a signifiant lowering of general moral standards then if you don't find anything morally objectionable about someone with "Thug Life" tattooed prominently on their body. As I mentioned before, I'd assume that you would object to a poster of an entertainer who had "White Pride" tattooed on their stomach, or "Rapist 4 Life." But promoting a criminal or thug lifestyle is seen as "just ink" to you.  The poster is telling you what he's about, and you're arguing that there's no reason for a parent to draw conclusions from the poster. Again, this speaks to the deficiency of adults and parents if they were to see that poster and not see a problem.   >I'm basing it on my own experiences and the experiences of people I've interacted with. Why do you believe that as a general rule it does not not benefit men to show emotional vulnerability?  I edited my previous comment right before you replied, but I'll repeat it here as I think it better illustrates my point:  **I think a problem is that many people don't realize that men in general express vulnerability and empathy differently from how women in general do.**   [YouTube: Why “boys will be boys” is a myth—and a harmful one at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydzfQ1X7ips)  I think an example of this lack of understanding is apparent in the above video featuring developmental psychologist Niobe Way.  I don't want to focus too much on saving face, as social dynamics among men are more complex than just that, but the concept itself is one way men express vulnerability and empathy. But if you're not a man, or if you haven't learned those types of social skills, then you might mistake it for a lack of emotion. You wouldn't understand why it might be healthier or more beneficial in certain situations or environments.   >Why should they seek support from their parents/fathers first before their wife and children?   One big reason is that the parents have more life experience then that of a man's wife or children. They're more likely to have been through what he's going through. The parents, and in particular the father, would likely and ideally be more capable of support because of that. And the problem is that the wisdom and experience of men's parents, as a form of support,  isn't even mentioned in the article. They suggest men going directly to his wife and the children with his problems.   >Does this stem from your belief that men must be seen as invulnerable protectors to the people they "protect" at all times?   Partly yes, although I wouldn't use the term "invulnerable," as its hyperbolic and inaccurate.  >You've already indicated that there is a benefit to fathers not showing fear in certain situations so that their kids can remain calm, which I agree with. Why do you believe seeking support from one's wife and children constitutes a "burden"?   It's important that the husband and father appear strong, and that the wife and children have a sense of safety and security from him. If he's seen cracking under the pressure, and if he's confiding in them all these worries, concerns, fears, etc that he has, their sense of safety and security is being eroded. This doesn't just apply to life or death situations, but for day-to-day things as well. If he's worried about finances or his job, and he confides these worries to his children, then *they* are now worried about their situation, and whether or not their father might lose his job, if they lose their house, etc.   >Why does seeking support from one's own own fathers/parents, religious figures, male friends, etc not constitute a burden on those parties?   To some degree it may create *some* degree of burden or concern for the parents. But parents are used to that. It's their job as parents to parent, to listen to their children, to help them and support them, throughout life. It's not the children's job or responsibility to parent the parent, at least not in the context of adolescent children.  Additionally, in most cases the parents wouldn't be directly dependent on the son, as they are likely married to each other, living on their own, in their own home, with their own savings. The man's parents' physical, emotional, and financial safety and security, is not being directly threatened.   As far as male friends, again, the male friends are not dependent on the man, nor is their well-being directly threatened. So why would it be a burden on them? Most friends confide in each other.  And why would a religious advisor, who's job it is to console and advise people, be burdened by this? People in those roles are usually better trained and equipped to deal with these things than children.	1642536074.0	ht7xut1	t3_s05bon	t1_ht7c6cv	/r/changemyview/comments/s05bon/cmv_trans_men_are_often_ignored_by_conservatives/ht7xut1/

In the hospital, absolutely none of them would even dream of introducing themselves as "doctor" even though they've earned the right to do so outside of the clinical context; in a medical setting, there's an issue of ethics when it comes to accurately representing yourself.

You say that as if people controlled criminals to be mostly dangerous to women just to spite women.   No, there's nothing wrong with it, it's reasonable, most women fall victim to rape more than men so people naturally tell them more to be careful, that's reality.   >Why isn't advises given to men to "stay at home", "don't approach women"    or "castrate yourself" because men have higher risk of committing these    crimes?

Just as a man should view his wife and children as his top priorities.   >There is always more she could be doing for the children, always. Why have hobbies and friends when you could focus on your children even more?   Because human beings require some degree of downtime. In the U.S. we have a 5-day work week, with two-days off, typically. The typical work day is limited to 8 hours. Even in Abrahamic religions people are required to at least one day of rest.   >Point being, at what point can a woman say "I am doing enough for my children, this next choice I am making is for the sake of myself"?  I think there's a significant difference between having additional interests in your life, and being away from home for 40-80 hrs a week.   >I think you need to clarify here...  It's not a binary choice. It could be one, the other, or both. It even be none of the above as unlikely as that is.    >The "art" of being insincere with the intent to manipulate social dynamics is one that I think should stay lost, but that's me.  Something like saving face is showing intent to manipulate? I guess you could categorize it as that, but that's creating a low bar for what's considered manipulation. Parents, managers, and teachers could be seen as manipulators.  >Idolizing the thug life is not acceptable, but having a poster like this does not necessarily mean the person who hung that poster idolizes the thug life, because it could simply be they really like the subject's music.  You would be idolizing someone who is a thug and who promotes the thug lifestyle. And you've come back to saying it could simply be they really like the subject's music, which just so happens to be about promoting criminality, misogyny, violence, and drug dealing.   This would be akin to a teenager putting up a poster of a swastika tattooed, racist skinhead rock performer on their wall, and listening to the racist skinhead's music that promotes violence towards blacks, Jews, gays, and other minorities.  *They could just like the music.*  Maybe, but it would be irresponsible of me as a parent to just accept that.  >I would be surprised if most parents of that day and age with children of an age to like this type of music knew who Tupac Shakur was, let alone what he stands for.  That's hard to believe consider the reputation rap music has had since the early 1990s. Not to mention the CD album cover art and track listings, the lyrics from the music being played in the house or in the car, or again, posters where Shakur is showing off his THUG LIFE tattoo, wearing a gun medallion, or wearing bandanas and throwing gang signs. We're getting to the point where we're assuming that parents aren't just deaf and blind, but apparently live under a rock.   >Maybe this is due to a difference in perspectives and experiences between us, **but I see this sort of ink as an acknowledgement of a reality** rather than a celebration of that reality.   Did you have this belief prior to the article you linked? It would be a strange acknowledgement of reality. I don't see too many people getting tattoos of "White Supremacy," as a simple acknowledgment that it exists.   >I'm just looking into this further now, and I would have never known this if I just took his ink at face value.  Did you consider that this may be an instance of a charismatic entertainer manipulating a gullible audience in order to deflect from legitimate criticism of what he promotes in his music and personal life?  [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU) of Shakur's most popular and well-known songs:  *First off fuck your bitch and the click you claim/ Westside when we ride, call me quick with game/ you claim to be a player but I fucked your wife/ we bust on Bad Boys/ Niggas fucked for life...*  *...This is how we do it on our side/ Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it/ But we ain't singin'/ We bringing drama/ fuck you and your mothafuckin' mama/ we gon' kill all you muthafuckas...We mothafuckin' Thug Life riders/ Westside 'til we die!*  And if you don't know the context of the song, he's bragging about having sex with the Notorious B.I.G.'s wife, Faith Evans, while threatening the life of B.I.G. and several other New York rap artists, which ignited a eastcoast/westcoast [feud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast%E2%80%93West_Coast_hip_hop_rivalry) that resulted in both Tupac and Biggie being murdered in separate drive-bys.   >Perhaps you can provide an example of these different ways and methods of expressing vulnerability and empathy.  Ex 1. In high school one of our friends got into a fight with another dude after school, with what seemed like half the school watching. Our friend got knocked out, laid out on his back, dazed and not able to get back up, with the fight obviously being over at that point. Instead of asking if he was alright, or showing open concern, my other friend just put his hand out to him to  pull himself up and said, "Damn bro, what are you trying to do, run down the clock?"  Ex 2. In college, a friend's girlfriend got a new car. A few days later when our group were going back to her car, someone had scratched "BITCH" in giant letters across the hood. She was devastated, and everyone felt bad for her. Her boyfriend broke the awkwardness by flippantly remarking, "Damn, that sucks...But at least they got your personality right."  Ex 3. Three older teenagers are walking through an area when someone from somewhere yells "Fuck you pussy!" One of the three teenagers yells back, "Who the fuck said that!?" A larger teen emerges with his own group behind him and says, "I did." The one who was initially insulted responds, "So what, you just like to yell random shit at people to make yourself look cool?"  >Yes, that's definitely a pragmatic choice, but I think whether it's a good idea to go to his parents or wife first depends on the situation.  Of course, but the article itself is skipping all other possible options, while also recommending that the father go to the children with his problems. So the most obvious, pragmatic choices are being completely ignored, in an attempt to counter, what the writer thinks is toxic masculinity.  >This idea that he can't open up to his own wife about difficulties or else she'll lose faith in his ability to provide safety and security comes from where exactly?  It's kind of human nature, as seen through history or personal experience. Just from my own life, having the only parent in the home cry to me about not being able to make the rent and what is she going to do, or waking me up in the middle of the night because she thought someone was breaking into our house didn't make me feel too secure as a 13 year old. I think it would have been worse had it been my father acting this way.   >Or is it because you don't see you and your partner as a team?  You can still be part of a team, while being team leader.	1642562410.0	ht9qyqr	t3_s05bon	t1_ht85jld	/r/changemyview/comments/s05bon/cmv_trans_men_are_often_ignored_by_conservatives/ht9qyqr/

The very idea that someone knows your sexuality better also goes against a lot of what people making that claim argue in general. It’s either people know their own sexuality the best or they don’t. The vast majority of people are 0 or 7. We know this because they’ve said they are.

4kzvpbvd	none of that makes any sense.  you don't just magically get better gas mileage because your car produces torque at a lower RPM range.  And the argument isn't about having torque or not having torque, it is about having torque at a low RPM range.  A car that produces peak torque at high RPM accelerates just as effortlessly as a car that produces torque at low RPMs.    Why does it matter if a dealer won't let you test drive without a deposit (which I have never run into personally.  All they have ever asked is proof I had insurance)  If you can't manage a deposit to test drive the car, you shouldn't be buying the car.    I can understand some people buy cars sight unseen, but in that case, there is far more to performance than its torque at a certain RPM range.  Since the point of this is for non-enthusiasts, do they want the car that produces 250 ft-lbs of torque but weighs 4000 lbs or the car that only  produces 200 ft-lbs but only weighs 3000 lbs?    What does being pulled by a sprinter or pushed by a football player have to do with anything assuming both are capable of doing the job and the sprinter just happens to takes smaller steps at a faster pace while the football player takes larger steps at a slower pace?  take drivers who aren't car enthusiasts and have them drive 2 different cars that have 2 different power bands but cover up the tachometer and you know what will happen?  They will push the pedal as far as they feel they need to to get the performance they are wanting.  And if the car is more powerful than they need, they will reach their desired power to overtake a car on a 2 lane road with less pedal travel, and if their car has less power than they need, they will end up bottoming out the pedal and still be disappointed in the acceleration.  They are in an automatic, there is nothing they need to do regarding the tachometer.  And as for engine noise, you can easily tune exhaust to make a high revving engine sound more mild and a low revving engine sound more intense, but for most modern non-sports cars, you are still getting a pretty quiet and calm cabin even when you are revving to 5k.    No driver is or should be trying to pass in an oncoming lane with an automatic transmissions and basing their driving on watching their tachometer.	1642566839.0	hta06tg	t3_s746xb	t1_ht9tejj	/r/changemyview/comments/s746xb/cmv_they_should_clearly_label_all_cars_with_how/hta06tg/
5c5jxlcp	The issue is they are highly confrontational by nature because it comes along with a social norm that you expect others to call you by the pronoun of your choice regardless of whether or not they agree with the underlying assumptions.    What people forgot almost instantly about the gay rights movement is it spent a good 25+ years normalizing being gay in popular culture as "we are just like you and we just want the same rights as you."  That was a highly successful approach, gay rights are now basically non-controversial politically.    Pushing pronoun usage is the oppose tactic.  It assumes one can ignore the mores of people who aren't on your page and actively seeks confrontation with them just by going around day to day life.  One may argue that's unfair and they  shouldn't have to worry about how others will react, but that's a very unrealistic view of social change.	1642568074.0	hta2l8r	t3_s7hlem	t3_s7hlem	/r/changemyview/comments/s7hlem/cmv_there_is_no_problem_with_neopronouns/hta2l8r/

4kzvpbvd	being at low rpm doesn't automatically get you better fuel economy.  being in the correct rpm range for your needs and your vehicle gets you better fuel economy.  lower rpm tends to get better fuel economy because you aren't accelerating as quickly as if you were at higher rpms.  tune the vehicle to accelerate more at low rpm and you just hurt fuel economy.  dealerships being a thing has nothing to do with this.  if people slowly get up to speed, wouldn't they just push the pedal more slowly if their vehicle seems to be accelerating faster than they expected for the rpm or pedal position?  also, pedal position can be tuned to be whatever you want.  its not a direct tie to rpm.  luckily since cars don't have a single gear transmission, you don't have to choose between these two.  lower gears function like the football player, higher gears function like the sprinter, and the automatic transmission automatically shifts between them.  push the pedal to go faster and your car will downshift and accelerate.	1642578483.0	htajah5	t3_s746xb	t1_htah0v3	/r/changemyview/comments/s746xb/cmv_they_should_clearly_label_all_cars_with_how/htajah5/
s0g4g	Not necessarily. Molecular cell biology covers a lot of turf. Just as the same person pointed out there are many different specializations in medical studies. Like I said before, it’s not too hard to check credentials of someone that is calling themselves a doctor while discussing specialized topics in a public setting. Although OP told me it was hard to find information on this individual, OP also uses “a tiny bit of research shows that he has a PhD in theology” in their original post. Admittedly a PhD in theology is a stretch for discussing virology. This is also a question of media throwing people on a stage with a fancy title that also support their rhetoric or increase viewership with controversial views. There are plenty of MDs in the public eye who dole out sketchy information and advice as well. Sadly, the viewing audience has to be careful these days with where they get any information. OP basically wants to strip people of their title in public settings that they’ve worked hard for unless he/she thinks their qualifications are suitable to discuss medical sciences or if they are an MD.  Further, OPs post is not well written saying that he thinks it’s ok for PhD’s to introduce themselves as Doctors (WoW thanks!) but ‘it’s immoral’. What’s immoral? Just to reiterate the point that was made by izzawlgood, there are plenty of specialized doctors in different scientific disciplines who may have stronger knowledge about a medical topic than a medical doctor, how do we decide when someone is or is not ‘allowed’ to use their credentials in a public forum? Secondly, there are plenty of MDs hawking bad information backed by their title but that’s a different conversation. Consumer has some responsibility here to eke out reliable sources with ‘a tiny bit of research’.	1642579826.0	htal33z	t3_s6vnxe	t1_htah7np	/r/changemyview/comments/s6vnxe/cmv_people_with_a_phd_in_an_unrelated_field/htal33z/

c14jklqh	Humans are inconsistent and it can be a matter of both not wanting to see a complex living being with a developed sensory system suffer and finding certain animals cute and cuddly. But the fact that humans are inconsistent doesn't mean that we can't reduce suffering in a limited or localized way, ought of a sense of moral outrage that we aren't saving all animals. This is the reason why I used the word whataboutism. If you transpose to helping humans it becomes clearer. Example 'Why should I help this American kid in foster care get an education when we don't even help Yemeni children not starve?' This is no different from saying 'I'm not going to improve factory farming conditions in my city because Orcas are being treated poorly in SeaWorld.' The urge to morally condemn actions should not be stronger than the thought given to things that can alleviate the problem. This is actually a moral argument rebranded as a form of rationality, since the rational strategy would be to actually do things that have an effect. Even if you educate just one foster kid or save just one whale from living in a pool, that's still something.  It's true that we can't reliably turn people into vegans. But some progress has been made in that area. In turn that progress has led to research on developing new types of food, and this in turn will have ripple effects in unrelated fields such as ecology since the environmental impact of meat is so large.	1642599577.0	htbdx7v	t3_s6lv89	t1_htagi24	/r/changemyview/comments/s6lv89/cmv_many_animals_we_consume_are_too_intelligent/htbdx7v/

I suppose I could keep a burrito in my pocket, but I think the scotch egg has it beat in terms of transportation. Health wise, I could imagine you could make the burrito as healthy or as unhealthy as you wanted which makes it very customisable. Though I've never made one, I'm going to assume that the scotch egg is cheaper to make just due to the ingredients needed, although this could vary depending on your burrito.   Hmm. Interesting. It hurts to say it but if I'm being objective here, it sounds like the scotch egg has been beaten. I don't think anything can ever take the spot it has in my heart though.

Who makes the determination of what worth is? Human beings. No animal is there with us to partake in that debate. We narrowly define worth according to our own instincts and anthropocentric reasoning. Even if we determine that animals are of equal worth, that's still us making that decision collectively. Therefore we are still on another plane of existence since we can add a layer to the world that animals can't.  To be clear, I am not advocating for the poor treatment of animals, just saying that the debate is circular at its core.	1642600063.0	htbey33	t3_s7qezu	t3_s7qezu	/r/changemyview/comments/s7qezu/cmv_the_belief_that_humans_are_special_godshaped/htbey33/

c14jklqh	Based on your answers in the thread it seems you are redefining what 'worst' means to fit depression specifically. Sounds as though you are simply frustrated at comments you have received in real life, and are trying to counter them. But the more rational response to those would be to avoid their framework altogether instead of trying to argue against them. It doesn't matter if there are other illnesses out there given that you have to deal with this one currently. Defining your illness as the 'worst' will not help in the slightest in the fight against it. At best you'll 'gotcha' the people in your life but their comments are probably in response to not wanting to deal with your negativity and complaints as a result of the depression to begin with, so that's a pointless fight since it does not address the source of their hostility.  On a purely logical basis it should be obvious that there are worse illnesses in absolute terms, given the existence of cluster headaches, cancer, genetic disorders, being almost entirely paralyzed but conscious. Heck even gender dysphoria has an incredibly high suicide rate.	1642602531.0	htbkeij	t3_s7ovpt	t3_s7ovpt	/r/changemyview/comments/s7ovpt/cmv_depression_is_the_worst_illness_out_there/htbkeij/

5c5jxlcp	Re confrontation, how do you envision the reactions and social norms around someone who doesn't use a neopronoun when you would want them to?  Is it something you use yourself and if others mis-pronoun you you're fine with it and hope they adopt it on their own later, or do you tell them you are unhappy about it or try to create social sanction around it in the wider culture?    The former is a non-confrontational strategy, the later is highly confrontational.  My impression is that the proponents of neopronouns seek to create a high level of social sanction around misgendering or using the wrong pronouns which is by nature forcing a high stakes social confrontation.  RE the Civil Rights movement in the 50's and 60's, I don't think you have the history right.  The movement consciously adopted the a very non-confrontational strategy culturally (non-violence, focus on religious imagery, highly conformist clothing, etc).  Also, I don't think use of specific names was a big focus although I don't know the history well enough to confirm that 100%.	1642603652.0	htbn12n	t3_s7hlem	t1_htahi09	/r/changemyview/comments/s7hlem/cmv_there_is_no_problem_with_neopronouns/htbn12n/

l4fasxy	Let me correct some of your errors as far as Catholic theology is concerned.  1. Per Aquinas, humans are animals. The distinction between humans and other animals is that humans are the only animals we know of that are rational, defined as capable of abstract thought. 2. In Catholicism, the soul is defined as the form (Aristotelian sense) of a living being. So animals and plants have souls. But as far as we know, humans are the only life forms that have *rational* souls. Catholic theology does allow for the possibility that we may discover one day some other animals (e.g. ceteceans, corvids, other primates, aliens) also are capable of rational thought. 3. It is possible to prove that a *rational* soul survives death. (If you are interested in the details of this proof, ask about it on /r/catholicphilosophy.  Note this does not rule out the possibility that non-rational souls, such as those of animals, also survive death. Also note that this is not the same thing as consciousness surviving death, because it would just be the faculties of will and rationality that survive death and not the ability to experience qualia. 4. Believing that human rational souls survive death is NOT a response to existentialism, because the theology of the soul was worked out many centuries before philosophers developed existentialism.	1642604626.0	htbpdvc	t3_s7qezu	t3_s7qezu	/r/changemyview/comments/s7qezu/cmv_the_belief_that_humans_are_special_godshaped/htbpdvc/

It's a bit like weed. It's not likely to fund terrorism or make you crazy or any of the boomer fears about it but it will make you fine with not doing stuff in general or having a mediocre existence. It will keep the edge off precisely when you need to ask yourself uncomfortable questions.  What I find funny is that opposition to porn is often done for sex-negative reasons but in reality porn is one of the most sex-negative facets of modern life out there given that it sedates so many people and makes them fine with getting less action than they otherwise would have.	1642605447.0	htbrea2	t3_s7r2vr	t3_s7r2vr	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htbrea2/
c14jklqh	Nofap is pseudoscience. But you are confusing giving on porn with giving up on masturbation, and the fact that nofap is dumb with the idea that there's no drawback to porn.  My point is that you have ambivalent views on porn and hentai. So why not drop them? Shouldn't that be a huge part of the convo?	1642606576.0	htbu69s	t3_s7r2vr	t1_htbrq9b	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htbu69s/
c14jklqh	Another way of thinking about it: so you are already of the view that mainstream porn is unethical. Let's imagine for the sake of the argument that you find that hentai is also unethical for whatever reason. What do you do now? Do you continue watching hentai?  The answer is important because you might be evaluating hentai from the starting point of *needing* a substitute for regular porn, as per your own post. So a strong bias in favor of the status quo will creep in. It would make more sense to confront what your stance on ethics and values are, and then evaluate both porn and hentai separately and on their own merits. The answer might still be that you will continue watching one of them, but the decision should at least come from an actual ethical decision as opposed to being the result of being accustomed to something.	1642608639.0	htbzdyu	t3_s7r2vr	t1_htbwf3s	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htbzdyu/

4kzvpbvd	Look at most chefs through history.  They were men.  Cooking isn’t a feminine thing, staying at home because they weren’t working was a feminine thing, and since they were at home, cooking was something they could do.    Most of the tasks around the home became associated with women not because it was a feminine thing, but because it was essentially a smaller scale of a profession that they felt a woman could manage.  They didn’t trust a woman to run a commercial kitchen, but she can at least feed the kids and have something hot for her husband when he gets home.    Men didn’t not cook because it wasn’t a manly thing to do, but because they had more important things to do that they women couldn’t do (partially due to physical labor and partially due to education, and other social factors, so women did what was left, not what was best suited for them. Men couldn’t be the ones to stay home with children because they can’t produce milk or get pregnant, and if you have 5 kids, and you breastfeed each one for 1 year and are pregnant with each one for 9 months, that is around a 9 year span (let’s call it 10 years because statistically there will be at least one child that doesn’t make it) during which the mother can’t reliably work outside the home.  So it made sense to prepare women to care for the home and family and men to work outside the home.	1642700888.0	hthhsxs	t3_s8nd8z	t1_hthbutj	/r/changemyview/comments/s8nd8z/cmv_nobody_is_more_preoccupied_with_the_opinions/hthhsxs/

4kzvpbvd	I saw that comment, you say you are going to give a definition then give an example that never explains why that is related to the term homoerotic. I think you know that definition makes no sense based on the structure of the compound word homo and erotic.   Can you cite a legitimate definition of how this is used sociologically?  Otherwise it feels like an attempt to force the use of a more dramatic sounding name to a fairly simple behavior.  If you were asking your coworker how much they get paid and your boss decided to send out an email to the company saying certain employees, and then name dropping you, are engaging in erotic behavior with their coworker on company time and that while it isn’t officially illegal, it is not appreciated, it would be very strange and unlikely he chose that word with pure intention, and instead chose that word to gain an advantage in the situation.	1642706377.0	hthwtfp	t3_s8nd8z	t1_hthj1ku	/r/changemyview/comments/s8nd8z/cmv_nobody_is_more_preoccupied_with_the_opinions/hthwtfp/
4kzvpbvd	Yeah, the use of that word and the defense that it means something different is pretty weak.  If I am writing a sociological research report and refer to women as “poopy faced whiney babies, but when questioned, I explain that I have redefined that phrase to mean “average women in the US”.

4kzvpbvd	So since women have those same traits toward women, women are homoerotic as well?  Since children love and mimic their parents and love praise from their parents, children are erotic towards their parents?

l4fasxy	The point is to increase demand for people to go into these fields. In the US there appears to be a shortage of physicians, so making it so they don't have to deal with these high amounts of debts would help greatly.  Please note that in the US, not everyone who gets a MD degree is able to obtain a residency and then practice medicine.  One of my neighbors got a MD degree but could not get a residency (because there are fewer residency slots than people getting MD degrees each year in the US, which is just plain wrong!)  so he was stuck with his huge student loan and no chance of getting a high pay position to pay it off.	1642707176.0	hthyy2n	t3_s8qeuu	t1_hthx6tl	/r/changemyview/comments/s8qeuu/cmv_forgiving_all_student_debt_is_a_bad_idea_and/hthyy2n/

3s4ve8nm	>There are plenty of wants/needs that I think are acceptable to pursue in addition to maintaining parental responsibilities; I contend that having a job/career is one of those.  But you based this on fulfilling a personal need, not on whether or not it was acceptable. Why is one it acceptable to fulfill one need and not the other? I would argue is that it's because we see a career that's traditional (law, medicine, business, etc) as acceptable and "normal." So because a traditional, high-paying salaried job is seen as respectable and aspirational in society, then it's gradually come to be acceptable for a mother to *choose* to do that, instead of taking advantage of the opportunity provided by her husband to NOT stay away from her family and kids for 40-80 hrs a week. We talk about the problem with traditional norms (gender norms for ex) , but yet we like to reinforce others without really thinking about them.  >I think it's important for teenagers to buck the norms of the day a little bit.  I've heard that same argument as well, but it doesn't seem to have much substance. What if bucking the norm is morally wrong? It's justifying rebellion for it's own sake instead of basing it on logic and reason.  >I don't see how "just being a teenager" is problematic. You'd have to demonstrate some problem extending from that before I'd consider agreeing to it.  A kid gets caught smoking weed. Parent: *He's just being a teenager, that's what they do.*  A middle schooler is in a gang: *That's just what teenagers do. He'll grow out of it. I remember when I was in a 'gang.' We used to drag the main in my Plymouth and sometimes get into fisticuffs with the kids across town. And look at me now. I turned out fine.*  >Why would it follow that because I'm unfamiliar with gang culture I couldn't come to the conclusion that gangs exist and gang violence exists?  I wasn't questioning your awareness of whether gangs or gang violence exists. I was questioning how you've come to the conclusion that it's a result of poverty, racism and a faulty system.  >I assumed he was just another gangbanger who made it big because he was a talented and popular rap artist.  This goes to my point about assumptions, conditioning, and relying on pop-culture and mainstream beliefs that don't seem to be very helpful. You assumed he was a gang banger, and because of that, he was a victim of circumstance and didn't have control over his own actions.  >Am I wrong that poverty and crime are connected?  In a way, yes. Crime exists at all levels, and it's actually counterproductive to view it as something that the poor mostly engage in, when it's rampant at all levels of society. This thinking is why society differentiates between crime and "white collar crime." Or how, the average person stealing is a "thief," whereas someone rich and of high status stealing is considered an "embezzler." I've known gang members of all different races, from a variety of gangs, and none of them were in a position where they were deprived of any basic needs. Not to mention, I've lived in hood areas, big cities, the suburbs, small towns, and they all had gangs.    >Or that poverty, crime, and institutional racism are connected? I didn't realize I needed an intimate understanding of gang culture to grasp these basic well-established facts.  I would think you would if you're trying to argue that these are well-established facts. Again, where are you getting these facts from exactly? I've heard the same claims and beliefs throughout my life, whether it be from books, academics, professors in college, documentaries, etc. But I can't say they're facts.  For example, one [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips_and_Bloods:_Made_in_America) claims the gangs started in Los Angeles in the 1960s because black youth were turned away from joining the Boy Scouts due to racism. I've seen this and similar things repeated in college social science classes, to various news articles like "How Boy Scouts Racism helped Spark LA's Bloods and Crips." It sounds good, but it's not true.  >The difference from my perspective is that one is a symptom of a problem and the other is a cause of a problem (although technically still a symptom of core human tendencies IMO).  But you said earlier you don't have a problem with entertainers like Shakur who promote criminal organizations, gang violence, violence, misogyny, homophobia etc in their music, but you *would* have a problem with a white supremacist entertainer doing the same.  >Maybe you don't. I don't either, but I'm not going to pretend like it's some moral violation to do so...It's not some scandal. And also: rightly or wrongly, topless men != topless women in our (US) culture.  I think this comes back to the topic of masculinity, respect and social etiquette, and how people don't have an understanding of these things because they're not being taught anymore.  You seem to be implying that I'm some type of prude, especially when bringing up being at the pool. I think it would be obvious that a kid's bedroom is not the pool, nor is it the beach.  As a husband and father, I wouldn't walk around the house without my shirt off because I'm setting the example for my children to follow. I don't want my son (or daughter) walking around like that in the house. And why wouldn't you want your children, in particular, your son to be walking around shirtless? A variety of reasons, but one being the more casual the wear, the more casual your attitude and behavior is to be, which is why some jobs and schools have uniforms or a dress code. Being in a state of undress increases the likelihood that kids/teens will gradually become too casual in how they interact with their parents, to the point of disrespect, however big or small that may be.  There's many other reasons on the meaning of a man being shirtless in a environment that doesn't require it, but...character limits.  >Probably true to a certain extent, but is there not a grain of truth to it?  In the case of the former, yeah. For example kids who grow up in the gang life due to their parents being active gang members, in the same way white supremacists grow up thinking that way because of their parents. They were screwed up due to that type of indoctrination.   In the case of the latter, them being these scrappy underdogs, trying to do right in their own way? Absolutely not. And I'm not saying this as some social conservative, who's on the outside looking in. I grew up with these types, I had close friends who were gang members. You can't be a gang member and have any type of morals. It's a very cut throat life that the average person doesn't realize because of media portrayals. And what I mean by that is that it's very political, in that everyone's plotting on one another, even people from within the same hood and those that they consider friends. *If I can take from you, I will.*  >I was ready to see him exactly as you portrayed him, but now I'm ready to see him as someone much more complicated than that.  You seem to be  letting yourself be swayed by hagiographic accounts, romanticizations and outright falsehoods.  **The Baltimore Sun** You know it's a puff piece when they won't even call rape "rape," and instead, describe it as "forcing someone into sex." I read the whole thing, and yeah, it's a gushing puff piece, maybe written by a fan.  **Reddit TIL** Full of misinformation. Tupac relied on the NOI for security after he was shot. He also included a speech by NOI leader Louis Farrakhan for his 1995 song ["Da Struggle Continuez."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFkD3pCkwtQ) Tupac Shakur was befriend by Haitian Jack and saw him as a criminal mentor by his own admission. They were close friends until they were both accused by a woman of gang rape. That's when he started to put distance between himself and Jack. Jimmy Henchman never tried to extort Tupac, but offered to pay him $7k to record a song for one of his artists, to which Shakur agreed. Tupac was not released from prison because of new evidence regarding his case, but because he made bail, which he didn't have money for initially. And no one is "found innocent" in a court of law. It's either "guilty" or "not guilty," the latter meaning there's not enough evidence to prove a guilty conviction.	1642715636.0	htikxcy	t3_s05bon	t1_htgy5dc	/r/changemyview/comments/s05bon/cmv_trans_men_are_often_ignored_by_conservatives/htikxcy/

I believe I've understood your view, at least in relation to sub-topic, but I'm trying to show how it appears to be inconsistent, which is why I mentioned how we're conditioned by various norms, for better or worse.   >Why does someone want to do OnlyFans? Are they trying to validate their insecurities? Are they trying to make ends meet? Are they cashing in on some asset?...I think I already alluded to this with the gambling example.  I'm not trying to sound flippant, but for the vast majority of the time, it's just people (mostly women) looking to make easy money. And if we're to have some degree of moral standards, and I'm sure we both do and even shared ones, then OnlyFans and porn in general is not something that should be normalized. It's in very rare and extreme cases where someone would need to rely on porn as their only option to clothe, feed and shelter themselves, and if that is the case, it would then become an issue of exploiting the poor and vulnerable.  >If her husband is working full-time and her kids are in school full-time, it will largely make no difference in terms of being "away from her family and kids" if she works full-time or stays home full-time: either way, she's away from her family and kids for 8 hours of the day.  Kids go to school from 8am and get out as early as 2pm. A traditional 9 to 5 has the mom getting home as early 5:30pm. If dad's working too, who's watching the kids from 2pm to 5:30pm? And this is in an ideal situation, and not one where the mom is choosing to work a salaried job where she's putting in way more hours than that.  >I'm pretty sure we were talking about listening to certain kinds of music and hanging up posters in one's bedroom.  But you asked me how the expression/justification "just being teenagers" is problematic in the same way "boys will be boys" is. So I gave you examples.   >I don't view it that way, but it doesn't mean they're not connected. You're bordering on pedantry here.   It may sound like I'm being pedantic if you're not aware of the amount of corruption and crime that goes on in the "legit" world. Hence, why I don't believe that poverty or racism is the root or main cause as much as ideology.   >Redlining   >   >I'm not really here to convince you systematic/institutional racism exists or how it manifests.  I'm not arguing that those things don't exist or that they aren't a problem. But sayings gangs were created as a result of that is misguided and simplistic. You've admitted that you don't know much about gangs. I've grown up in that environment and know it pretty well, but even if I hadn't, just reading up on American and world history in an objective manner would tell me that this isn't the case. If you feel confident that it is, tell me which gangs you believe are a result of this and how exactly.   >I think what I said was I don't see them as the same. I don't like it. I don't like songs like that. I don't like people who promote behaviors like that. But I don't see it as the same as a similar situation with white supremacy instead.  I wasn't trying to say that you *like* the content, but my point is that you seem to be saying you would object to one but not the other. In that, you don't see anything wrong with a kid having a poster of an entertainer who who promotes and commits violence,  but you would if that same entertainer was a white supremacist. Unless you're saying that now, with new information you would object to both.  >OK so these are beliefs that stem from tradition. Fair enough if that's how you want to run your household.  But it's not for tradition, it's for a purpose. That's the disconnect we seem to be having. You let your son or daughter get into the habit of walking around half dressed you're cultivating poor social skills and a lack of respect in them. And that's just practical reasons off the top of my head.   >I'm so disappointed by the existence of character limits right now.  If we get back to talking directly about toxic masculinity and gender norms, hopefully I can work that into it.   >Do I have reason not to take Tupac's own words in that article at face value?  I mean, yeah. The author himself is cherry-picking Shakur's quotes to paint him as this rebel-saint. Additionally, Tupac was a master manipulator and liar, like most of the gangbangers I grew up with. As I said before, even as a teenage fan I knew when he was running a con with some of things he was saying. He lied about why he was fired from the set of *Menace II Society*, he lied about being shot five times (he shot himself in the groin), he lied about Biggie's involvement in his shooting, and so on and so on. He's definitely the Marvin Gaye of hip-hop, and a tremendous artist in every sense of the word. But he was also a scumbag who promoted degeneracy and violence in the community he claimed to love.   >Good news: you're on reddit and you can correct the record. Or better yet, challenge that user publicly so that none of us have any misapprehensions about Tupac Shakur's life.   I don't think it would be very productive, as the person who typed all that seems to be extremely biased and has an agenda. I grew up on Tupac's music, I was a big fan, I know his entire life story, and even I wouldn't make the errors or claims that he made in that post, so I'm assuming it's intentional on their part.   Not to mention, we have Google where people can separate truth from lies. Anyone that wants reads that Reddit post and believes it wholeheartedly is doing so because they want to.   >I have now received conflicting accounts of Tupac's life. I don't know what you're expecting, but needless to say I'm skeptical all-around.  I'm not trying to have a have a pissing contest here and brow beat you so I can say, "Hah, I win the debate!" I'm trying to give a heads up to someone who seems like a good person and who's reasonable. Maybe you won't ever come across anyone that's connected to gangs or crime in any capacity. But if you do, you might be more able to pick up on the signs so that you or your family don't get harmed in some way, and this extends to outside influences as well.  Tupac himself is a fascinating figure as an artist, and the Reddit post has a lot of truth, but mixed in with a lot of lies and conspiracy theories as well.   At the end of the day, we should judge people by their actions. But you, me, and others get swayed by charisma and talent, and subconsciously use that as an excuse to either justify these people's reprehensible behavior, or convince ourselves, "*he/she* couldn't have done that. They're so sincere and genuine. And look, at the great songs/movies they made! And everybody else likes them.

And this is in an ideal situation, and not one where the mom is choosing to work a salaried job where she's putting in way more hours than that. And that's just scraping the surface.  Depending on how old they are they might be able to look after themselves. Again, *context-dependent.* There is no hard and fast rule here.  There are going to be plenty of circumstances where we can both look at a situation and agree that it would be better for the kids if mom wasn't working the way that she is.

4kzvpbvd	no they wouldn't.  Even if was just a tiny minority of people, that's all it takes.    Just look at how people reacted when even the most minimal restrictions were imposed in the US.  A woman in Oklahoma shot and killed McDonalds employees because only the drive-thru was open and she wanted to eat inside.  People have lied about being vaccinated and fake vaccination cards can be found all over online.    Companies have sprung up bragging that they make the thinnest and most useless masks possible just to stick it to the people who mandate masks.  Are you going to completely shut down any human to human interaction?  Because any less than that, and the people who care the least who are infected will absolutely hide their symptoms in order to not have to be isolated.   Even workers who have paid time off to use for sick days don't want to waste vacation days for the sake of their coworkers, and when you try to give people unlimited time off with no punishment for using it if you are sick, some people will absolutely take advantage of that.  With any virus there will be higher and lower risk populations, so even if covid killed 10% of the people who got it, there would be some subset of healthy men in their 20's or such that only have a 1% chance or so, and some of those people would doubt those numbers and happily contract covid to get 2 full paid weeks off of work.    My in-laws believe covid is a conspiracy spread by the wealthy elite New World Order.  If it was more deadly, they would believe this even more strongly, and they refuse to wear masks, get vaccinated, get tested, or take any precautions for themselves or others.  They owned a restaurant and refused to have their workers wear masks, or even increased the frequency of workers washing their hands, and while my father-in-law has never been tested, he insists he had covid and was sick for 2 weeks before feeling better, the whole time he worked at the restaurant.  I agree a majority of people would take more precautions, but with it being more deadly, the minority of would actively oppose any safety measures would more than make of for any slowdown efforts from the majority.	1642750103.0	htkl3nx	t3_s8hryl	t1_htgl7ge	/r/changemyview/comments/s8hryl/cmv_covid_would_have_killed_less_people_if_it_was/htkl3nx/

yyhba	>Secondly, it gives students that are talented at something besides academics a taste of talent and interest being rewarded. Even if "gym" isn't a skill always required in the adult world, giving students a taste of success outside of raw academics would be beneficial for students self esteem.

It's not like these establishments are trying to trick people into the type of environment they offer.  >It also does what a lot of these CMV's related to kids do, which is divorce the concepts of how parents should behave, the reality of the challenges you face raising kids, and the place of new generations in supporting older generations as time passes. Without parents, human race doesn't just die but our current system collapses hard. But raising a child to modern standards is fucking hard.

3s4ve8nm	>Obviously it would be better if Hollywood just cast more Asian-American women in roles that weren't "roles for Asians" but you know, this is Hollywood, right? They probably won't, especially not after the whole Rose Tico debacle  This is what's so frustrating, with both sides of the argument. I always thought it was silly (although I get it) that "Hollywood" believed that female superheroes just don't sell based on a few awful female superhero films (Supergirl, Catwoman, Elektra). On the other hand, I don't think that one big superhero hit starring a woman means that audiences are craving female superheroes, and that that's where the money is. I would like to think it's because of the quality of the film that has audiences resonate with it.   Kelly Marie Tran seems like a lovely person, she seems like a solid actress, and very attractive. But holy crap, they made her to be a very cringey character in the film, while giving her a look that was very unflattering. I would like to think that anybody could see it was the writing and make-up/wardrobe that that turned people off from the character, not her ethnicity or acting.   But people forget too, it's not necessarily "Hollywood" but it's about convincing investors to fund the movie in the first place. They don't care about quality, they don't understand nuance. They just want to be convinced that they'll get a big return on their investment, and the producers do that by saying "Look, we got this big name actor/actress who's last three films grossed over a 100M! And look, this particular genre is a sure thing because of other successful films! Our film will be just like those ones!"	1642793955.0	htn1b8i	t3_s8musd	t1_hth6wd6	/r/changemyview/comments/s8musd/cmv_whitewashing_of_live_action_japanese_media_by/htn1b8i/

672cekt	> There are indeed several ways to formalize Occam's razor (or at least something derived/inspired by it), but they all actually came about much later than the original proposition. What you're proposing is just one of many possibilities, but it's a more limited statement than the original Occam's razor that was around long before it. I actually tried not to suggest anything to the contrary in my original comment, because I still think the important issue is this: These formalizations (particularly the one you're proposing here) really don't really seem to apply here, specifically.  But it seems like we agree only one of them is objectively true in a fully general way and that Solomonoff induction would allow us to use Occam’s razor to construct standards for *objectively better* explanations. I can get into this more but it seems like a can of worms we don’t need to open.   > Your proposal in particular only applies precisely if we can say that any competitor to many worlds strictly implies it, which is clearly not the case.   It actually is though. At least in the same sense that looking at the sky and thinking “those are stars not galaxies” requires all the same laws of physics that would cause galaxies *plus* some new exceptions to the rule to prevent galaxies from forming.   > It's equivalent to saying "assuming the other interpretations imply that many worlds is already true, then many worlds is at least as likely to be true as them."  Other interpretations do imply that many worlds is the physical outcome of quantum theory. It then posits some new unexplained phenomena that *prevent* those worlds from forming.   > Your description is of course very good, and I don't want to dismiss that, but I still think it's sweeping under the rug the fact that many worlds also does bring along some "more stuff," and we'd need to drop that entirely to make a strict inequality here. Simply: many worlds doesn't really conjecture nothing extra compared to its competitors.  Why does the amount of “stuff” matter? Does the extra stuff required for those stars to be galaxies mean we should conjecture that something prevents galaxies from forming?  The universe can have as much stuff as it wants.   We should already accept a far greater sudden expansion of “stuff” considering the possibility of a functionally infinite universe. And that has nothing to do with quantum theory.   > And we'd actually need there to be nothing extra at all, at least for a true, formal argument based on this law of probability.  Logically speaking, there is nothing extra. I think you’re conflating the parsimony of a logical proposition with the amount of physical things predicted.   A logical comparison of statements like:  *(A) all men are mortal*  Is far simpler than:  *(B) all men are mortal except Socrates*  There’s less mortal stuff in the second statement. But I hope it’s evident why removing things adds complexity.   > I have almost the opposite takeaway here, actually: the true advantage of the Copernican model is that it does have the potential for making better predictions (and better explanations, but I'll get to that in a moment) -- you can predict the motions of bodies that are moving at a constant speed with fewer special cases than the alternative model, and those predictions can be made in a general way.    Exactly. But not with what we knew about the world at the time. At the time, the geocentric model was exactly the same as the heliocentric model but with extra steps added to explain all the exceptions to the rules (epicycles, etc.).   Collapse postulates are exactly the same. MW requires merely the schrodinger equation. Collapse postulates add:  - spooky action at a distance - instantaneous faster than light effects - retrocausality (in quantum erasers) - indeterminacy - uncertainty leaving the realm of the mind and existing in the world instead  The number of exceptions required is truly staggering. Collapse postulates are the only law in all of ~~quantum mechanics~~ physics that is non-linear, non-unitary, non-differentiable, CPT symmetry violating, causality violating, and discontinuous.	1642795161.0	htn4nzt	t3_s8w8as	t1_htmx5b1	/r/changemyview/comments/s8w8as/cmv_everything_that_has_ever_happened_and_will/htn4nzt/

htnpbfml	I’m not a fan of the couch of “one of the best” since that’s an ejection seat for your view.   In my faith complex music like Casting Crowns as a means to preach is frowned upon. Personally I agree: I don’t understand why worshipers of any religion think rock music is a faithful way to teach us biblical themes. It’s extravagant: a man made tool to ease the bitter medicine of learning holy lessons and attract people through catchy earthly means.   But beyond my own faith, I have no idea why this genre exists. There must be huge demand and great profits/prophets surely. But didn’t many Christians this music is targeted at besmirch rock music?

64e6d	Heh, you didn't read your own link.   "The use of placebos in cancer clinical trials is rare..."  While I'm not sure why you're stalking my posts, it's quite obvious that you do not understand how clinical trials are conducted. Here's some more information so you can learn something new. Terms to look up -   Historical Controls  Standard of Care  https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-13-44  "It should be noted that there are many types of trials for which it is    not reasonable or even possible to use placebo controls. Examples of    these include surgical interventions, behavioral interventions, and    conditions for which there is a standard of care or an effective active    drug. While placebo, or sham, controls are theoretically possible for    many of these trials, ethical or practical considerations limit the    feasibility of conducting such trials. For example, alternative    approaches to case management in mental health care cannot employ    placebo controls. For the purposes of this discussion, we consider    trials for which it is both ethical and feasible to utilize a placebo    control group."  It's ok to not know how clinical trails are conducted, they're often quite complicated and require a lot of learning about to try and get your hands around.  Regarding your most recent misinformation, it's hilarious to point to Ian Miller. And regarding distancing policy, I am well aware and in agreement that there are variables to consider, such if you're in an enclosed space or outdoors.  You are continuing to underline your ignorance, so I'm glad you're in a position to be learning something new.

If NFTs were carbon neutral I might agree with your view. But we’re boiling the planet alive, and putting everything on the blockchain to create artificial scarcity so a few people can profit off of gullible buyers is a terrible thing to do, and we shouldn’t condone it on that basis.	1642822327.0	htp1vkh	t3_s9ptkg	t3_s9ptkg	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp1vkh/

5dkg4	At that point, why not consider how we value anything? Currency is just paper and bits on a computer somewhere. As a society, we’ve decided to collectively place value on it. Imagine if you only knew a world where we used bartering for everything, and some guy came around with tokens and tried saying “your home is the same as this token”.   If someone chooses to place value on an image, that’s none of my business. I don’t know why someone would pay millions for a canvas painted 1 color, but it happens. I don’t think spending money on luxury clothing brands is smart; it doesn’t mean I have a problem with people who buy them.	1642823609.0	htp4tcc	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp3g7n	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp4tcc/
5dkg4	The atoms that make up the paint on the canvas would be impossible to replicate from a photo. The pixels that make up a 30000x40000 digital photo would be impossible to replicate from a screenshot. Sure, atoms vs pixels is a different scale, but they’re both so infinite that it doesn’t matter because it can’t be done easily.   Also, you’re still making the argument that the ability to be replicated is tied to worth. Worth is entirely subjective.	1642824074.0	htp5uch	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp4ws7	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp5uch/
5dkg4	“If the art is easy to duplicate it’s worth less.” Definitely.   “If the art is easy to duplicate it’s worthless.” This is what I’m arguing against. It could still have some value to someone.   If your banana duct tape to a wall is valued the same by the buyer, they will buy it. If hundreds of people want it, it could go for insane prices. The likelihood of someone placing any value to this at all is very, very small.   Compare that to the NFT marketplace, where we have demonstrable proof that people assign value to different pieces of art. I personally find value in owning any NFT; that doesn’t mean I care if someone else finds millions of dollars in value in owning one. I could scream from the mountains about how much I wouldn’t like to buy one, but that doesn’t mean I’d ever stop someone who would.	1642824522.0	htp6td4	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp3r89	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp6td4/
5dkg4	I think you’re misunderstanding my second point, which better explains my first point.   The “Bored Ape” group of NFTs were specifically designed to be easy to create variations of. Different hats, glasses, hair, fur color etc. This was done in attempt to quickly produce thousands of unique images.  The motivations for creating that art are obvious. I don’t think the art is particularly good. This has fed into the image that NFTs are a scam.	1642824796.0	htp7e7y	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp6b3w	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp7e7y/
5dkg4	I just don’t think you’re addressing the fact that the only reason we don’t find money “weird” is because we have collectively as a society agreed that it makes sense. Same for backing it with gold; why do find gold valuable? If it’s rare, then why do we find rare things valuable? It’s almost a philosophical question. Value is whatever the buyer and seller assign to it.	1642824992.0	htp7suk	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp60zn	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp7suk/
5dkg4	The argument against NFTs goes beyond the fact that most major NFTs are speculative bubbles meant to make some people very wealthy at the expense of others, or that the technology isn't sound- it is that the entire model has no benefit for the artist, that in many ways it has detrimental effects, and that making digital goods unique and scarce is a bad idea.  > the entire model has no benefit for the artist  Have no NFTs been sold? Have no artists made profits by selling NFTs?   > that in many ways it has detrimental effects  I can’t really argue against this. I imagine in a perfect world, NFT transactions would slow down an insane amount, and that would lead to less negative impacts on the environment.

I figured he has some ability with the eye rolling and someone else did the eyeroll part aswell so I assumed they are some form of organization like the Bene Gesserit but more explanation would have been great. I just assume we will learn more about them in the upcoming movies. There is just too much to introduce at once and to be honest it wasn't really necessary for the story so far.  The betrayal by the Emperor was very obvious. They explained fairly well that House Atreides was getting too influencial with other nobel houses and thus too powerfull and the Emporer doesn't like that (they even say something along the lines of the Emperor being jealous man), so he set them up. Same with Dr Yueh who clearly was the royal doctor (he had multiple appearances where he checks the health of someone from the royal family or was talked about) and betrayed them because the Harkonnen had his wife and tortured her. That's why he also gave that fake teeth to kill the Baron, he didn't like them but had no choice.	1642856073.0	htqkmii	t3_sa0bgn	t3_sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/htqkmii/

That being said, your comparison is not fully equivalent because your actions had nothing to do with the violinist being connected to your body. Other than cases or rape or incest (which make up a tiny fraction of abortions and I don’t often see anyone debating against), the pregnancy occurred as a direct result of choices made by the couple. I feel like that adds more obligation as the woman was at least partly responsible for the pregnancy, making it less black and white than the violinist comparison.	1642857944.0	htqnt77	t3_sa1tlj	t1_htqmfms	/r/changemyview/comments/sa1tlj/cmv_abortion_shouldnt_be_seen_as_a_womans_rights/htqnt77/

(this is also big-budget of course but you get what I mean) I was about to argue with each of your points with specific details shown in the movie but the other posters have done a great job of that already.  I don't want to say it's Cinema with a capital C or anything pretentious like that, but it's clearly a movie that does show don't tell to a greater extent than Marvel. I had the opposite viewpoint in that the flow of the movie seemed really to work better than usual and it felt incredibly refreshing. They did not do the usual overly detailed exposition scene commonly found in sci-fi movies where one character drops down aspects of the lore during a contrived conversation that a person already living in the universe would not be having.  Actually a way to change your view would be to see Villeneuve's other movies. For instance, in 2049 he had some huge pacing and plot issues that didn't show up in Dune. The conclusion being that with a pre-cooked and well marinated plotline to follow he was able to effectively work on his scenes, and was clearly able to tell the story of Dune.	1642867075.0	htr76k5	t3_sa0bgn	t3_sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/htr76k5/

Of course, I know some were taking the 'zoo' hypothesis seriously in the past, despite some decrying it as pseudo-science.

3pqaxquz	In the case where there was no one to adopt and no state to take the child, then I don't see how the utility for the child is greater than the utility for the fetus. In both cases, they will be able to live their life instead of being chopped up or starved to death.  There is other negative utility to forcing a woman to carry a child that doesn't apply to forcing parents to feed and house their children. But I don't see how there isn't *any* utility to be gained, or maybe I don't understand your wording.  Also, utilitarianism is somewhat controversial.  Edit: I must not have seen your edit.  Okay, if the difference is labor vs liberty, then we need only change the violinist analogy such that you must work X months of the year for the violinist, as for some reason, only the work that you do can save the violinist. Does it seem wrong that you work a large amount of the year for a stranger? Seems that way. Then it would also be wrong to do that for your child if the child is also considered to be a stranger by the analogy.	1642867847.0	htr90yr	t3_sa1tlj	t1_htr7gbk	/r/changemyview/comments/sa1tlj/cmv_abortion_shouldnt_be_seen_as_a_womans_rights/htr90yr/

9isyki51	 "it's quite obvious that if someone is all-loving they wouldn't want to cause suffering especially the terrible suffering so many endure"  Why is God the cause? Is humanity not the cause? To love someone means to allow them to exercise their own freedom. A God could click his fingers and make us all bow down and worship him, but he does not. The heart of the problem is the problem of the heart, suffering is not God's doing. It's ours. Since you are loved by God and free to not choose him, and you remove yourself from relationship with all peace, all perfection, and all justice, then the suffering that is a consequence of that is a human responsibility. An inevitable result of rejecting God. God does not cause it. Humanity does	1642874217.0	htrp6wx	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrp6wx/

Revenge doesn’t work and capital punishment/the OPs suggestion is on the verge of being worse than a stereotypical child sex offenders crime.   People forget nuance. Not every child sex offender is a paedo. I.e. a young adult 18/19/20 are very unlikely to be repeat offenders once rehabilitated	1642876234.0	htrueq4	t3_s4ffvu	t1_hst2vgk	/r/changemyview/comments/s4ffvu/cmv_repeat_pedophiles_rapists_and_sex_offenders/htrueq4/
771dooie	One of the issue if we conflate all child sex offenders as paedophiles, when clinically some may not be deemed so. I.e. links between prior abuse, religion, social standing.   There is so much nuance to crimes such as these that ‘paedophiles’ in the UK rightfully undergo deep psychological assessment prior to sentencing to assess any potential future harm and as a guidance for sentencing.   Two cases i’m quite familiar with is two people who had attended my school. Later in life, one was found to have had received oral sex from a 14 year old when he was 19. His background was that he was autistic, abused at home and socially ridiculed prior to the offence. He was deemed to not have an active interest in children and displayed remorse for his actions. The other was another socially reclusive boy from my school who had an active interest in children. No abuse etc but was diagnosed as a paedophile under IDC and DSM criterias. He has reoffended twice and had prison sentences each time.  Now, I don’t condone either persons actions. But the former I would not define as a paedophile, nor bash him for something he did many many years ago. The other. Well he has an active interest in children, has received rehab for his condition etc but has reoffended. Will I judge him? A little but ultimately, I am not in his head. The only thing I hope is that he is segregated away from children and vulnerable adults, receives any help that is deemed necessary and hopefully gets better.  In a nutshell. There is too much nuance and a pitchfork mob mentality when it comes to this demographic. The threat of Torture, castration, segregation will never stop a potential sex offender.	1642877420.0	htrxh4z	t3_s4ffvu	t1_hsta4ng	/r/changemyview/comments/s4ffvu/cmv_repeat_pedophiles_rapists_and_sex_offenders/htrxh4z/

The simulation argument doesn't actually assume that "any other species" capable would do so, it assumes that more than one would be created per universe, so you have exponentially many universes as you go deeper. Technically, you can still meet this condition with a universe with many species, each of which has a minuscule probability of choosing to build their own simulation.

jt7tc	The counter argument i have heard most eloquently stated is from ravi zacharias.  Suffering and pain in the world is the result of free will.  If there is no free will then god could take pain and suffering away from people.  However, without free will you do not have a huge host of things you can do and that make humans capable of achieving great heights, indeed, achieving their potential in life.  This leads to massive questions and answers and speculation, but thats the jist of it.  So without free will, we would not ever be able to achieve our potential.

y9f2x	I think you fail to see that once a civilization manage to create a simulated reality that is indistinguishable from their own, there is no point in living in the physical reality anymore and abide by its limitations. Assuming the civilization is fairly advanced (judging by their ability to build a planet sized computer) they would be able to tackle the physical challenges of connecting every individual on their planet to the simulated reality, and thereby solving all their problems, e.g. lack of resources, conflicts/war, global warming, pandemics etc. (albeit not any non-controllable disastrous events such as giant meteors). You could ague that an advanced civilization would already have tackled most of these problems, but there is still no reason to live with the physical worlds limitations. The physical world could be run by AI, which would limit the need for unnecessary spending of resources and pollution. Its purpose would be to keep the individuals alive, and ensure the wellbeing of the planets ecosystems (which would thrive in a situation like this).   Everything you could do in the physical world, you could do in the simulated one and more, thereby removing the need to continue living in it.	1642904043.0	httqcbo	t3_sacb46	t3_sacb46	/r/changemyview/comments/sacb46/cmv_any_being_advanced_enough_to_create_planet/httqcbo/

Shouldn't take them more than a few weeks.    > I know hiding a post only hides for myself now but when I was a new reddit user, how tf can I know?  Google exists.  > My friends know my username on reddit. That's how they know  And how is reddit supposed to know the names of your fiends?  > Bruh Every point you make is bs  Let me just recap your argument as to why you want the hide functionality changed: "I posted something on the internet where everyone can see what I post and got upset when people saw it".  Or did I miss something?    > Also for the pop up thing, maybe only appear for the FIRST time you use it?  You are aware that most people close popups without ever reading them, right?    You have yet to respond to any of my actual argument.  The combination of everyone being able to see your post except for your friends is literally impossible as reddit doesn't know who your friends are.	1642934288.0	htv6yy8	t3_saq1rb	t1_htv6hr7	/r/changemyview/comments/saq1rb/cmv_reddit_should_allow_users_to_choose_not_to/htv6yy8/

In a lot of rural towns in the US, a DMV can be 10+ miles from where someone lives. What this feeds into is a lot of rural poor people not having IDs - they can’t walk there because it’s too far, can’t drive there because they’re not licensed - so they lack a solid form of transportation to get an ID. They also have to miss work to go get their ID and pay for likely a taxi (in rural America, which is not insanely common) / ride service / hope someone they know can take them. So there’s also a much higher opportunity cost of a missed day of work + paying for a ride service for a poor person living paycheck to paycheck.   I like the ID of voter ID. but until licenses/state ID are available online or via Mail *the first time you get them* you’re absolutely creating a scenario where a certain type of citizen (poor folk not near a DMV) are disproportionately advantaged, and that’s anti-democratic.	1642950648.0	htvxmkr	t3_sam3w3	t3_sam3w3	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3w3/cmv_voter_id_should_be_legalized_as_getting_an_id/htvxmkr/

Some people overcome that baggage, many never can.

5c5jxlcp	I say this a a serious theist - there's a good way to talk about God in science and a destructive way that I suspect taints the discussion.  The destructive way is there's an old tendency (the "God of the gaps") to say "I don't understand this phenomenon, therefore let's say God did that part, or that my lack of understanding proves an outside force is at work."  That attitude is antithetical to scientific inquiry because it suggests giving up looking for deeper understanding and using God as a knowledge crutch.   The more productive approach is to look at the beauty and unlikeness of the universe we live in as a very strong argument for the existence of God.  But that's not a "proof" in the sense of a mathematical proof, it's a proof in the social science sense of "this is the most likely outcome given currently available evidence.  As a related aside, the best take I have heard on this is that God created a universe quite capable of running itself without outside intervention.  The idea of searching for "outside intervention" as a proof of God basically assumed God did a bad job creating the thing in the first place.  So "why would there ever be a miracle" is a better question than "why don't we see miracles."	1642969442.0	htx9i20	t3_sam3n2	t3_sam3n2	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/htx9i20/

Viruses **only** reproduce, but lack mechanical structures for all the other characteristics. The field of biology generally agrees (there are many nuanced versions, but nearly all models require a metabolism, which a virus lacks) that these attributes define life:  order sensitivity or response to the environment reproduction growth and development regulation homeostasis energy processing  Importantly, living things posses all of these. As far as your question about a hypothetical robot, so long as it checks these boxes, then yes I would say it qualifies as inorganic life or just…life. It would need to check a great number more boxes before I’d ever view it as possessing sapience or even sentience.	1642974658.0	htxn8o0	t3_sb1i9b	t3_sb1i9b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/htxn8o0/

96ioh	“What is a woman?” is a fair question to ask, but is there really a clear cut definition that you can apply without excluding some population of cis women. If you base it in biology, there’s cis women born without reproductive organs, there’s non XX chromosome pairings, there’s about 1.7% of the population that’s born intersex (in the US alone that’s about 5.6 million people) so based on this SEX isn’t even a binary. Now even if we operate under the binary understanding of sex, gender is something that is separate from sex. So modern understanding of gender is that it’s a socially constructed set of norms and behaviors that is typical for people of a given biological sex. But even within these norms and behaviors, there’s not a clear demarcation that you can draw between man and woman. Additionally our understanding of what’s “manly” and “womanly” has evolved over time. If you look at pictures of 17th century French royalty that doesn’t exactly coincide with current days standards of “manliness”. The reason why the trans activists brought on didn’t give a definition is simply because there isn’t one. If you give any social norm that we typically ascribe to bring a “man” I can almost guarantee you there’s at least one cis woman out there that has Matt Walsh beaten on that metric. Does that make Matt Walsh a woman? No, of course not. The whole point is that the metrics that we use to define these categories ARE arbitrary and have evolved over time so trying to gatekeep who can identify in those categories is silly.	1642976258.0	htxrcr4	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htxcj0c	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/htxrcr4/

i163riup	I know I’m missing out on important parts of film history too, but I feel like if I watched his films I would be very distracted by my impressions of him as a person (maybe that’s not always a bad thing though?). It worries me that someone who I think is a bad person could profit from me consuming their work, but certainly there are ways around that.   To me the phrase “separate the art from the artist” implies that a work of art should be viewed independently from its creator but I’m sure people have different definitions.   Picasso is an interesting example, thanks for bringing it up. I think visual art is interesting in this scenario because it’s not “for sale” in the same way as films and literature (unless you’re the mega-rich) so viewing a work of art feels less like an endorsement than buying a copy of something.	1642982035.0	hty6h3v	t3_sb77vg	t1_hty4hh7	/r/changemyview/comments/sb77vg/cmv_i_dont_want_to_separate_art_from_the_author/hty6h3v/

In my field we answer the question of "what is true" using a combination of statistical inference, repetition, and biology.

Regardless, if you can catch the illness multiple times, the odds of fully eradicating it, even with a fully-effective vaccine, are low. That's why we still have outbreaks of polio, measles, smallpox, and more. Not because of ineffective vaccines, but because of how interconnected our world is woth different regions and cultures who share different beliefs, different societal norms, and different levels of access to healthcare.  The only way to fully eradicate these diseases and others like it would be to implement a zero-tolerance worldwide vaccine mandate with ZERO exceptions, whoch violates a whole list of human rights.  https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article254111268.html	1642982291.0	hty736p	t3_sb7l0v	t3_sb7l0v	/r/changemyview/comments/sb7l0v/cmv_the_only_way_this_pandemic_will_end_is_if_we/hty736p/

42j663tx	Can you clarify your view for me: are you saying that we should not watch films (or other types of artworks) by artists who were bad people? Or that we should not forget about their badness when we watch them?   To take the Woody Allen example from elsewhere in the thread, I was a fan of his films before I knew about his daughter’s allegations. I still like some of them quite a lot, but I can’t view them the same way now — and my understanding of them is much richer than it was. I’m able to see not only (more of) the sexual weirdness that’s there, but also the outright sociopathy that animates movies like Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors, which before I thought was part of their clever take on the “crime and punishment” narrative. Knowing about an artist’s flaws doesn’t mean we accept or condone those flaws, or become uncritical viewers of the work. If anything it can sharpen our critical eye towards a work.	1642983622.0	htyaba9	t3_sb77vg	t1_hty462b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb77vg/cmv_i_dont_want_to_separate_art_from_the_author/htyaba9/

171sgb	The simplest answer is that yes, any time you make a transition like this it will be inherently unfair. Some will benefit, some won't. Some will have *just* paid off their loans right before a loan forgiveness happens. It will seem unfair. But this will be the case no matter when or how you do it, unless you make all tuition free and then just wait for those with student loans to die out. But that doesn't help them either.   If it's a good idea then it should be implemented as soon as practical. That it will be unfair to some is unfortunate but unavoidable, and we shouldn't delay its implementation just because of that.  Whether it's actually a good idea or not isn't in the scope of my answer, I'm just providing a background to why haggling over how "fair" it is is missing the forest for the trees.	1642984566.0	htyclnx	t3_sawxc2	t3_sawxc2	/r/changemyview/comments/sawxc2/cmv_until_college_is_made_free_in_the_usa/htyclnx/

gtwwl3w5	I understand the confusion! I think faith has indeed gotten a bad rap, in large part due to people of faith not explaining it very well. But the truth is, ‘Faith 2.0’ (love the term, I’m stealing it!) is actually quite a bit older than the ‘leap of faith’ idea (which comes from Kierkegaard).  When I explain faith to students (I was a youth pastor, and still volunteer) I use the story of Jesus walking on water. In the story, Peter walks out to Jesus on the water but lets his fear get the better of him, causing him to sink. Jesus chastises him for his lack of faith.  How did Peter lack faith? Jesus isn’t criticizing him for failing to ‘irrationally cling to an unproven belief.’ In the context of the book, Peter saw Jesus walking on water with his own eyes, and had seen Him perform countless other miracles before. He knew that Jesus was perfectly capable of keeping him safe despite the wind and waves.   Peter’s failure was allowing his momentary, animalistic fear get the better of his reason. He allowed his irrationality get the better of his reason.   Hope that helps!

This is quickly dismissed because we have so much evidence against it.  -  The creator is stated to have made the universe in a completely unfalsifiable way that happens to align with all evidence we have (eg there's an all-powerful god who created the universe in seemingly godless fashion, which has never done anything to the universe since before the big bang and is literally impossible to detect). This is seen as useless and irrelevant in scientific discussion - there are plenty of scientists who believe in this kind of god and face no conflict about it, but there's no reason for them to bring it up in a geology/physics/biology/etc conversation.	1643002244.0	htzgo52	t3_sam3n2	t1_htullam	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/htzgo52/

3muzmzop	In my opinion you are 100% correct.  I've read every argument against and I do not see much merit in any of them. Worrying about the game going on forever? During the regular season it's 10 minutes. So those games aren't going on forever. In the playoffs, there is some more potential for overtime to go a little longer but even that is unlikely. How often do teams match score for score constantly unless neither team can score and in that case it would go on forever anyway in the playoffs until there is a winner...  Besides, there is always going to be an element of sudden death. Like right now, if one team kicks a field goal and the other team returns a field goal, any point scored ends the game immediately. Which is perfectly fine as long as both teams were given an equal opportunity to possess the ball on both sides. This would be exactly the same only extended to touchdowns.  I keep also seeing the argument that it would switch the advantage to the defense which I find lacking as well. First of all in the NFL, because of the rules the offense already has a massive advantage. Second of all, the offense already knows what they need to do to win the game immediately, which is score a touchdown or a field goal and a stop.  So in that argument, if the initial possessing team scores a field goal, it's an advantage for the defense because they know they can win the game with a touchdown? Either way they have to try scoring a touchdown to either tie the game or win the game just by the very fact the game is continuing on. Or if the offense did not score any points, they just need a field goal which changes nothing since that's how it is right now anyway.  As it is right now the defense knows the exact same information. If it was a field goal they need a field goal to tie and continue on to true sudden death or a touchdown to win. Obviously if they don't score at all the game is over.   The game would be more fair to both teams if they kept the rules the way they are but extended it to touchdowns as well.   Btw, I am a huge Patriots fan and they obviously benefited from the rules the way they are now in the biggest game and immediately I did not think it was fair.  The idea the game is going to go on forever with this change is nonsensical. Especially in the regular season. I can't believe anybody would even argue against this.  Last point on this ridiculously long post. Saying the defense had a chance to make a stop and didn't therefore the game should be over is also very flawed. If that was the case, we should also be saying if the defense makes a stop the game should be over immediately. The initial possessing team had every opportunity to score points and they failed. Game should be over right there. But obviously that wouldn't make sense. Same as this argument against the defense having a chance to make a stop.  I'm really looking for any argument against both teams offenses having a shot to possess the ball before "true sudden death" begins which would result in the game being less fair and I can't find one. Besides once the game is tied up 7-7 in OT, a field goal wins because it is now sudden death. Exactly the same as if it was 3-3, making winning the game significantly easier for whoever possesses the ball. The games will still end relatively quickly only it'll be a more fair outcome.

Well, since over a million voters were purged in Georgia, that’s at least the right order of magnitude.   > In the minds of many people who are photo-voter-id proponents, dismissing their concerns in this way comes across as a malicious disdain for their own votes. In their minds, someone who cares so little for whether a vote comes from a citizen or not is someone who wants the election to be tampered with.  That’s fine. People can be wrong about stuff. In order for those views to be legitimate, they would have to comport with the data. And they don’t.   > So these kinds of accusations of malfeasance go both ways, and it's just as easy for people to point fingers as it is for us to recognize the other side's concerns and try to find a path forward that meets them all, or at least doesn't cause any new harm.  No. Only one of the ways is backed up by data.   > I think it requires the assumption of maliciousness on the part of the person who thinks that better verification of citizenship status is good, in order to reach the conclusion that they either lack respect for thousands of peoples votes, or actively want to suppress those votes.  We don’t have to assume anything. They’ve told you their intent is malicious.        What systems are in place, how are they ensured to work properly, and what are the adversarial checks and balances to protect against interference? While I'm sure an answer to all of those questions could be had, simply saying "There's no voter fraud" is a pretty bold claim without also providing some transparency to the methods by which that answer is determined.  Eventually, a person would have to point at some other person, group, or agency, who did some study, or some investigation, but you can't actually say with certainty, unless you happen to be one of the lead investigators in sniffing out voter fraud every election?	1643034373.0	hu0sdwf	t3_sam3w3	t1_htza1wd	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3w3/cmv_voter_id_should_be_legalized_as_getting_an_id/hu0sdwf/

16mqhm	I don't come across a lot of people who just are filthy rich from inheritance, so maybe that's just you?  From what I've seen dating (a lot of dating) and my buddy's dating lives is that their earnings are just part of the equation in their value as a partner. For men, men don't really care what a women makes, money wise, so it's less weight in the pool of things men look for in a woman.  However, if a man makes a lot of money, women can and will overlook other minor flaws. Most women will not date just some slob with money. The concept that you have of "a slob with money" is also extremely rare, as typically people with money also have some positive characteristics that help them with their earning (charismatic, charming, good-looking, extremely knowledgeable in their field).

htnpbfml	It’s a safety feature. The assumption is that a person buying a safe pistol or safe places a premium on safety. Most gun owners are normal people. If you think a bunch of guys are going to break into your house to assault your wife, personally I think you should get out of the drug selling business and get a grip. I know many here won’t agree.   I’d rather have a barrier (not high barrier) between my kids and my guns, because as we all know, we are more likely to shoot ourselves or each other in our home than ever be near a self defense scenario. If you think that’s different in your life, why bother with a safe at all: keep your shotgun by your door locked and loaded. If you place a premium on safety, invest in a lock and if a smart lock works for your situation, great. Rationally, most gun owners fear self defense but will never use their gun that way:  > Most gun owners cite multiple reasons for owning a gun. In fact, eight-in-ten say they have more than one reason for owning, and 44% have more than one major reason. Still, protection tops the list, with 67% of current gun owners saying this is a major reason they personally own a gun. About four-in-ten say the same about hunting (38%), while three-in-ten say sport shooting, including target, trap and skeet shooting is a major reason they own a gun. Fewer cite a gun collection (13%) or their job (8%) as major reasons for owning a gun.  Four in ten compared to six in ten, hunt to defense (give or take). It’s not a massive gap: many people appear to use their guns in ways beyond self defense as the primary purpose. In that case, factor safety precautions like smart locks into what the usage is.	1643047773.0	hu1qrs7	t3_sbs3k7	t3_sbs3k7	/r/changemyview/comments/sbs3k7/cmv_smart_guns_are_a_good_idea_in_theory_but/hu1qrs7/

42geoc20	Absolutely not. We don’t try to define humans by your terms for the exact reason you think we should, but we do define them.   From evolutionary biology to phylogeny, all the way to the human genome, we have ways to categorize. Just today my biology teacher reminded us that when you have an XX chromosome, you’re a female.   There’s a reason why you’ll never find a textbook that claims the way to categorize a species is through a similarity in limbs- those are called homologous structures. We have generalities because they apply to the majority. Sex and gender are the chromosome type you have, which is why people with the condition of intersex are called intersex.	1643048345.0	hu1sb56	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htyg9hc	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu1sb56/

mxq6r06	> Do you think the factory farming industry responds to a single hunter going out and deciding to kill an animal or not each day? That's what I'm debating here.  No you aren't though. You very explicitly stated that you want to talk about the *individual* decision to hunt, and your argument is because hunting causes X+1 animals to die instead of X animals. My analogy explained why this isn't true. Less demand for factory farmed animals means less animals killed. It won't abolish factory farming as a whole, but it *will* mean fewer animals killed.  >You, /u/thinkingpains aren't going to change how much meat the factory farming industry produces.  Yes, I can. If I eat less factory farmed meat, less animals are killed in factory farms. That is an indisputable fact.  > Do you think if 10 people started/stopped hunting, factory farming would change how much meat it produces?  Yes. Obviously. Again, this is how supply and demand works.   >The answer is no, and if you think it does, then you are extremely naïve.  No....I just know how supply and demand works.  >You think that supply and demand in an industry the size of factory farming responds on an individual 1-to-1 change, than this conversation has run it's course.  Again, it doesn't matter, because you *explicitly stated* that you only want to talk about individual choice. I as an individual cannot personally abolish *all* factory farming with my choices. But I can, with my choices, choose not contribute to factory farming, which to me, as an individual, is a moral choice, because factory farming is immoral and hunting is not.

But Windows was so slow in comparison that I stopped using it entirely and ended up just deleting that partition and expanding the Linux one. Sure, the hardware I was using was a few year old, and I'm aware Windows 10 on good hardware is fine. However I'm personally not interested in buying better hardware just to run Windows when Linux suits my needs perfectly (programming and web-browsing mainly). It doesn't matter what hardware I have, Linux will always be more efficient with power and resources, and my PC will likely be cooler and quieter too.	1641122893.0	hqxa9uh	t3_rtuc2l	t1_hqvevhm	/r/changemyview/comments/rtuc2l/cmv_switching_from_windows_10_to_linux_would_be_a/hqxa9uh/

t3n0za	I think it's more accurate to say "tell me you've never spent time with children, and no one you are close to has kids."  I am recently an aunt (and a great aunt? Some cousins have kiddos). I am amazed by just how much time, energy, and \*mess\* happens...continually! No one is doing anything 'wrong' they aren't messy people...but it's a constant battle to keep things in some kind of functional, non-disaster zone state of existence. They are organized, share responsibilities, one works full time, and the other is part time....but neither of them get anywhere NEAR enough sleep.   Not only does everything take longer (because they try to encourage the kiddo to do as much as they are able to, and they are continually explaining, encouraging, and asking them to do certain things). It's amazing, and even being an observer that's largely uninvolved is tiring.   I've had sleeping issues (bouts of insomnia throughout my life) and none of it is comparable to spending three days around an under 2 year old that hates to nap and doesn't settle down at night easily.   I've never been angry/upset with parents (the childfree community on reddit is genuinely scary to me, and I say that as someone that is \*also\* scared of the very idea of being pregnant and that has never wanted children).  I've realized that I'm \*definitely\* not cut out to be a parent (which was a really affirming and reassuring moment for me), but I also have so much compassion for other guardians/parents/caretakers (even more so than I did previously).

9j292xcr	I know, I was being sarcastic when I said species haha. But yeah, overall I do believe men were created to provide, fend for themselves and family, provide sperm, and be self sacrificing. Honestly, it the reasons women are generally shorter, have more attractive faces and bodies and have a higher voice is simply to always have a males attention. Whether that be sexual attention, or purely a caring/affectionate attention. In literally every mammalian species, females are the ones to be preserved. At ALL costs. Men are not. I will say being a male comes with great responsibility, if you want to actually have value.	1642544349.0	ht8kaud	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8j580	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8kaud/
9j292xcr	I don’t mean like a literal baby tho, more so like a young child. But that’s not t say women aren’t as capable as men when it comes to things like intelligence. IQ levels are fairly equal. And women are actually wayyyy more emotionally intelligent than us. And a lot of people are so confident in saying men are physically surperior because of their greater maximum strength output. But remember, that’s only for a short amount of time. Women have much more type 1 muscle fibres than men, meaning women are much more resistant to muscle fatigue, and recover a lot quicker than men.	1642544618.0	ht8l0jy	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8jkuh	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8l0jy/

Thing is that rapes that are not stranger rapes are almost unavoidable because they're by people you know and unexpected hence why people don't talk about those.

9j292xcr	This is why when a male does lose all those typical masculine things, he’s then replaced. But obviously we’ve evolved into a very socially/emotionally intelligent species, and can create lifelong relationships with others, man or woman. However, I still do believe men are NEEDED for their sperm to fertilize the egg, and WANTED for other typical traditional masculine traits (protector, provider, etc.) I could be wrong tho, because maybe men are actually needed for that too, but research isn’t really clear on these topics.	1642545434.0	ht8n4c3	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8lh7d	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8n4c3/

9j292xcr	Looks wise, no. They’re not distinctly feminine, which biologically to most men, isn’t a good thing (kinda makes males seem like pedos), however their traditionally feminine attitudes are what makes them loved and adored by quite a lot of people. A traditionally looking masculine man with masculine psychological traits will NOT be seen as someone who need to be protected, cared for, etc. But for the male, it wont really bother him all too much because males emotions are specifically tuned towards anger or content. That’s why it’s so easy to NOT feel bad when seeing a male tragedy rather than a female tragedy.	1642546000.0	ht8oktq	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8mc0v	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8oktq/
9j292xcr	I still believe it’s nature. Simply because those changes in physical masculine traits are distinctly distinguishable from a females, or child’s traits. Moreover, this is also evidence males aren’t meant to be monogamous, as a female wouldn’t want to settle with just ONE man. ONE man can’t be masculine, and feminine/nurturing at the same time.	1642546268.0	ht8p9vu	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8no12	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8p9vu/

9j292xcr	I believe the great difference in male and female sexual preferences also correlate to accepted and encouraged gender roles as well. So a woman who looks sexually feminine, and acts like it too, is seen much much differently than a 6’4 chiseled chad, and who acts like it as well. So since sexual preferences are mostly genetic, i believe that influences character traits of genders as well, therefore favouring gender roles when picking a mate.	1642548394.0	ht8ukn9	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8t5j6	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8ukn9/

9j292xcr	And those aren’t at all similar to traditional gender roles either. More like biological gender roles. But also stems from a biological characteristic that I believe men have, and that’s the selfless will to protect and love women. So this could be a another way of categorizing a modern traditional male and a biologically traditional male. Height, size, intimidating good looks are equal to being very financially stable, intelligent, and confident, however these dominant traits are just expressed differently I guess.	1642549055.0	ht8w63i	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8uccn	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8w63i/
9j292xcr	I believe that what drives men to strive in society and push their potential to its limits physically and mentally all come down to winning a women over. So this correlated back to gender roles. Men are seen as stoic, always on guard, and rather emotionless because it’s meant to not only impress the potential female mate, but compete with other males in order to assert dominance. I believe cooperation amongst men isn’t something that they’re naturally capable of, rather learned, after realizing we’re much more than brainless, barbaric, impulse controlled mammals. Females having a more traditional gender role of being the nurturer, and loving and empathetic towards everyone works in their best interest to gain the most affectionate attention from others, so they’re lives can always be protected, at least until they have children.	1642549434.0	ht8x2n1	t3_s795a5	t1_ht8udec	/r/changemyview/comments/s795a5/cmv_i_believe_gender_roles_and_sexual_dimorphism/ht8x2n1/

That includes the actual sales positions and the ones that are glorified Ponzi schemes which often result in debt.  Most of us sell our bodies every day and frankly the long term damage is worse. It can’t be undone by a society changing its views or just not giving a crap. There was a point at which I thought I’d pass on something like that but even at 27 I realize I’d almost certainly do it if I had the looks. I have a masters in Engineering and even with that the potential extra cash would be nice. Though if I had the looks I’d go with the $400+ an hour escort service route. My list of sexual partners is short and I’ve passed up 1 night stands regularly but even with that kind of attitude I’ve come to realize I’m far cheaper then I thought.   Frankly only fans is better then the porn industry in general if you are worried about those things. These women at least aren’t having to go to potentially sketchy locations or worry about if it is or sign contracts that then end up with them getting paid a few hundred to have sex with strangers that ends up online.  Edit- Thought experiment from a recent Reddit post. How much would you suck a dick for (or the opposite of whatever you are attracted to if you aren’t bi)?

Rapists are not supervillain masterminds, and even if this is true, what's your point? That's how it works, which is why it's a good thing we have laws and technology to be able to stop those criminals of any kind. There's never gonna be a point in time where criminals are just not going to be criminals because there will always be people that will break the law, that's reality.  >Asking everyone to carry a gun is firstly useless in places where obtaining a gun and a concealed carry permit is difficult (so everywhere outside the US basically),  You can thank the nutty anti-gun politicians for that. And I don't know what your point is in saying that says it says nothing about the idea of having a gun to defend yourself and only talks about the legality of it.   >everyone were carrying a gun then nightclub's would be a much more dangerous place. Put 300 drunk people with guns in a room every Saturday night and someone is going to get shot by accident.  If they shouldn't be allowed to have guns then by that logic people shouldn't ever be allowed to own cars because somebody at some point drives one drunk and crashes into someone. Not just that, if you really cared about victims, you would have no problem with them carrying guns to protect themselves from potential rapists regardless of some chance that someone will accidently shoot someone else.	1642729836.0	htjhdvl	t3_s23kof	t1_htgh8op	/r/changemyview/comments/s23kof/cmv_in_violent_rape_prevention_it_makes_sense_for/htjhdvl/

1dektgv2	Theoretically, legalizing murder could make it safer. If law enforcement currently kill murderers at any frequency in situations involving murder, then surely legalizing it might reduce the risk that a would-be murderer is killed by a law enforcement officer. You could also forget about the death penalty in cases of murder.  People who take extremely strong positions against abortion genuinely believe it is murder, so given their premise, how would it be morally distinguishable from murder? Would a woman seeking an abortion, or a physician performing one, not be as morally bankrupt as a murderer of grown human beings? On the other side of that coin, should the life of a murderer not be equally worth protecting as the life of a prospective mother?

Being in public entails dealing with things around you that you dont like. Why do you have this expectation that people around you need to behave a certain way to make your experience better? Thats not how the world works. People have children and do not need to hide in their homes with them to make sure people like you dont get annoyed.

wesx8	Is the underlying principle just "under no circumstances should bad people be honored"?

wesx8	That seems quite strange.

wesx8	I think we're talking past each other. I'm not saying Nazis weren't horrible. I'm saying that this is a fact you learn based on things like, as you say, what they did. We then use other moral principles to analyze how we ought to relate to someone like Rommel. My point is that you're cutting out this analysis and just taking as an axiom that a barracks shouldn't be named after Rommel, without really explaining the underlying reasoning.	1642793516.0	htn03d8	t3_s9g73t	t1_htmz7kh	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn03d8/
wesx8	Right, my original point was asking them why they believe this principle. If it isn't a base level fact, then they might have some reasons for it. My first response was asking whether they think it harms people, or increases the liklihood of resurrecting Nazism in Germany. If they think so, we can examine the evidence for it, if they just say "these are my core beliefs, they are the base level from which other beliefs are derived" I'm not sure what the point of the CMV is.	1642794061.0	htn1lv3	t3_s9g73t	t1_htn17z3	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn1lv3/

wesx8	I mean, I guess my default would be that things are fine if there isn't a compelling reason against them. I don't think there's a particularly compelling reason to name the big city on the mouth of the Hudson "New York City", but absent a compelling reason not to, it seems fine.	1642794331.0	htn2csn	t3_s9g73t	t1_htn24ah	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn2csn/
wesx8	Well no, but I think I can pretty clearly articulate the harms there. The people who want to name a library after Hitler are almost certainly themselves Nazis, as Hitler doesn't have any other real connotations, and their ability to name things signals that they have a decent amount of social capital. Signaling that you have social capital in turn creates more social capital, and social capital can help them accomplish their goals, which are bad.  Given that the people wanting to name the barracks after Rommel are probably not themselves Nazis, and Rommel has connotations outside of Naziism, that reasoning doesn't seem to apply.	1642794626.0	htn36gk	t3_s9g73t	t1_htn2o6q	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn36gk/

wesx8	Right, but that doesn't mean that the harm of naming something after Hitler has the same harms of naming something after Rommel here in 2022.	1642795827.0	htn6h4x	t3_s9g73t	t1_htn5nwv	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn6h4x/
wesx8	What makes you think that? I explain why I think the Hitler Library could cause real harm, but those reasons don't seem to apply to the Rommel barracks - why do you think the renaming causes harm?	1642795948.0	htn6sz5	t3_s9g73t	t1_htn6nvt	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn6sz5/
wesx8	Which Nazis are being encouraged? Are you saying that the people behind the barracks are Nazis? Because that was my reasoning behind the Hitler library.	1642796094.0	htn776e	t3_s9g73t	t1_htn727l	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/htn776e/
wesx8	  > Probably. I see no other reason to have such barracks other than Nazi sympathy.  Is there some empirical support for this?

wesx8	I mean, evreybody who I've met who liked Hitler was in fact also a Nazi, whereas nobody that I've met who liked Rommel turned out to be one (at least openly).

pj8sq	>long term PED abuse leads is extremely detrimental to your health  It's interesting that you're talking about PED **abuse**, rather than **use**. What are the characteristics of PED *abuse* rather than appropriate or proper *use*?   >it gives an unfair advantage over athletes who choose not to take PED’s in order to stay healthy.  Here's where we get to the **other** element of PED use. While steroids and other substances *can* be used to bulk up faster or improve performance during competition, some of the most beneficial use of these substances is to [recover from injury faster](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/body-work/some-olympic-doping-drugs-may-have-legitimate-medical-uses)  In other words, using steroids and similar substances to *recover from an injury* allows an athlete to return to competition sooner. That's not giving them an unfair advantage, that's letting them remove a disadvantage quickly.   And since we're talking about MMA fighters specifically, that question of use (recovery versus competition) is pretty significant given the prevalence of injury and recovery in that particular sport. No one thought Lance Armstrong was at a high risk of breaking a bone or tearing ligaments while he was racing, but MMA fighters literally have regulations on how often they can fight *because* injury is so prevalent in the sport.   It's one thing if Nate Diaz was fighting while he was so high on cannabis he couldn't feel anything, but when fighters are *regularly* suffering injuries that have recovery times, using PEDs to shorten that recovery time is a pretty big deal given how very short the lifetime career of most MMA fighters is.	1642798153.0	htncxu5	t3_s9i897	t1_htn07tb	/r/changemyview/comments/s9i897/cmv_mma_fighters_that_test_positive_for/htncxu5/

The M&M characters *aren't* animate; they move, they speak, they act. They are *anthropomorphic* candies, with arms and legs and eyes and mouths. They talk with human voices.   I'm not sure why you are having trouble seeing how people can relate to something that has human features, a human voice, uses human speech, and acts like a human being. The [premise of this particular ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMHbCZkVX8&ab_channel=KentCadoganLoftsgard) highlights that the "M&M characters" aren't "inanimate candies to be eaten".  > I don’t see how investing in a redesign will help as opposed to fighting violence that people face  This is what's called a "false dilemma", where you artificially limit possible choices. Who (other than you) is claiming that the Mars company must choose between making charitable donations and redesigning characters. Why can't they do both?   > Evidence that the old M&Ms design is problematic  [Watch this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXbzPOs9MW4). It was part of an ad campaign called "What is it about the green ones", which you can google if you want more content and context. [Here's another TV spot from that campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMDq-rFSqRY&ab_channel=LittleKittyCheezPoof) that's pretty clear in what it's about.   If you're still not clear on why that campaign, and the 'Green' character are problematic, let's spell it out explicitly. The Red M&M has a personality. (sarcastic? Snappy? I dunno) The Yellow M&M has a different personality. (Friendly but dumb?) The Green M&M's personality is... sexy. Fuckable. Setting aside how deeply *weird* 'fuckable candy' is, the problem is this: the male M&Ms (and Orange and Blue were characters that were also given men's voices) can be funny or silly or friendly or nervous; male characters can have a variety of characteristics. But our female M&M has only one trait: she's sexy. Can you see how that isn't exactly great?   Yes, it's a publicity stunt. Yes, it's marketing. No, it's not the only thing the Mars company does for charity or social activist purposes. And yeah, the whole thing does read a little like trolling. But it doesn't change the fact that the Green M&M's one personality trait was 'fuckable'.	1642811235.0	htobi5n	t3_s9ool2	t3_s9ool2	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ool2/cmv_there_is_nothing_uninclusive_or_problematic/htobi5n/
2aev6qqq	>(Yes, victim blaming always happens to some degree or another.  Unlocked    doors mean trespassing, locked means breaking and entering.  Leaving    keys in your car means joyriding if stolen, compared to grand theft if    the keys were not in the car…but taking 30 seconds to lock a door or to    place your keys in your pocket is vastly different than the amount of    “precaution” a woman is warned to take.)  Even if it took a lot of work to lock the door, I would still do it.    It doesn't matter how much it takes, doing those precautions are good to avoid something as bad as rape.      >the first question is usually “why jog alone so early?”.

Don't jog at all, even if it is your only option.    You're literally making it likely that something bad will happen, just don't jog at all.    If it's something as bad as rape, it doesn't matter what your options are, just don't jog if it will make it more likely that something bad will happen.   >So this does put a completely    ridiculous restriction on her, and also eliminates her ability to get    the cardio exercises that she needs to be healthy.  It's not ridiculous if it's to avoid rape, nobody is doing this because they want to restrict women for fun or for the hell of it, poeple are doing this because it's good for them.    In life, you have to "restrict" yourself for many things to avoid danger, if it's really bad danger like fire, you think it matters how "restrictive" wearing a firefighter suit is?   As long as they're eating healthy and are doing exercise in their own home like jumping jacks, they're not going to literally die.      >even if they were at a close friends place and had no reason to expect    anyone to assault them.  Should women just not drink with friends  In situations where it's unavoidable like your close friends, that's a different circumstance and it is unreasonable to say it's avoidable.   It's not unreasonable to say that drinking in a suspicious place where it's shady leaves you vulnerable is reasonable.     >But the knowledge that you can be raped regardless of how careful you    are is not something everyone can actually come to terms with.  How? The majority of people understand this because this is true for every single thing.   You can be the most careful in a car crash and still crash and etc.   Everyone already knows this and has "come to terms with."    This doesn't mean that you should just do nothing, doing something is better than not doing anything even if it's not 100%.     >Our social and criminal justice system response needs to make a shift    from looking at how a victim created the situation…to looking direct at    the person who used the situation to their advantage…  Everyone already knows and agrees that the person who's a rapist is responsible for being a rapist.    There's no more use to discussing about that, discussing how bad rapists are doesn't tell poeple how to avoid them.    The reason why people focus on how people can take precautions against it is because they're the victims and people want them to know how to avoid a bad situation so that it doesn't happen to them.      Simple as that, if you squish any useful discussion about that then more women are going to get raped because they weren't told how to take precautions against it.	1642868494.0	htralpm	t3_s23kof	t1_hschxg5	/r/changemyview/comments/s23kof/cmv_in_violent_rape_prevention_it_makes_sense_for/htralpm/
pj8sq	>I believe that it failed to tell the story of Dune.  There's your mistake, right there. There is no "**the** story of Dune", because Dune (as a novel) has *multiple* simultaneous stories going on.   Dune has the story of feuding houses, political maneuvering, and the conflicts between noble houses, economic powers, and religious orders.   Dune has the story of a religious order that manipulates both the sophisticated high society as well as indigenous populations with religious myths and superstitions.   Dune has the story of ecology on a planetary scale, of how an ecological vision could spread and lead to planet-wide collective action.   Dune has the story of an indigenous people being oppressed and hunted because the land they live on is rich in natural resources.   Dune has the story of a young man coming of age, discovering/realizing the advantages he was born into relative to others, and intentionally choosing to exploit those advantages to pursue his personal agenda of revenge.    Novels can be broad and contain a lot of stories. Movies need to be a bit more streamlined. One isn't better than the other, but they **are** different storytelling mediums which require different choices about story.   The filmmakers for 2021 Dune movie made the choice to focus on **Paul's** story specifically. Many scenes that didn't involve Paul were cut, and other scenes were shifted to reflect *Paul's* perspective. Yes, this mean that the story arcs of "complex betrayals and elaborate politics of the Lansaraad" aren't as clear and present in the movie as in the book, but the elements that tie to Paul's story ('the Emperor betrayed us') are still there.   Tom Bombadil got cut from the movie version of "The Fellowship of the Rings". Glorfindiel got eliminated and his role given to Arwen. That doesn't mean the book is 'better' or that the movie is 'bad', just that they're *different kinds of storytelling*, with different limitations which led to different choices.	1642871036.0	htrh0pm	t3_sa0bgn	t3_sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/htrh0pm/

a4i64	Raisin in the Sun is admittedly a goofy example because race is such a central theme. A mostly non-black theater group would probably never think to do that play, but as artists they'd have every right to, is my point. As for "plenty of black students around", did they sign up for theater? Did they give a good audition? Do they have acting experience? I think people should be judged as individuals. The fact someone is black doesn't even necessarily mean they have much in common with the characters in Raisin in the Sun. Ridiculous to assume that. It shouldn't matter anyway. The whole conceit of acting is pretending to be someone else. Appearance does play a role though. Like, a guy who looks dreamy might have a better shot at Romeo than others, even if he's not the best actor. You might prefer someone thin and spry for Peter Pan. Optics do count for something. And ethnicity factors into that too. For an Asian part, all else equal, you might prefer an Asian actor.

wesx8	1 presumably ancapistan would come up with some sort of Rube Goldberg political machine to allow it to conduct basic foreign policy. EG, the UK’s ambassadors may be called the Queen’s ambassadors, but their actual actions are controlled by parliament. 3 presumably the strategic value of ancapistan would just be a industry/agriculture/service base + a consumer market - how would actors within ancapistan thwart a country arranging protection in exchange for access to these things? 2 I mean, places like Luxembourg or the Vatican aren’t really strategically important. I think the thing that large alliances get is access to a market for their goods, and a source of goods where the protected have a comparative advantage in making. They also like to reinforce the basic Westphalian norms around national sovereignty snd international law.

However, my post intends to engage individuals (which may include yourself) who find other exploitations acceptable while drawing a line at "sex". For example, if you accept "non-consensual sex is wrong", why do you think "non-consensual murdering/imprisonment/impregnation is okay?"

h69cjfq0	First of all, thank you for the refreshing argument!  Here, I raises two challenges.  1. How does consumption of meat remotely qualify as "unintended/incidental suffering"? Humans are evolved to be omnivores, capable of surviving independent of meat. Do you maintain that meat-eaters are unaware of the simple biological fact or "the murdering" behind the purchase? 2. Why would you make the assumption that "suffering is the point" for people engage in bestiality? Traditionally, bestiality has been identified as "surrogate for human sex". Recently, psychological research has provided evidence that zoophilic tendency is an actual "sexual orientation". There are people out there who have sex animals either because "they have no real life partners" or "they are sexually attracted to animals" are these people intentionally inflicting sufferings, to your understanding?    * [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/animal-lovers-zoophiles-make-scientists-rethink-human-sexuality/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/animal-lovers-zoophiles-make-scientists-rethink-human-sexuality/)	1642965450.0	htwzcpw	t3_saz6dy	t1_htwoknl	/r/changemyview/comments/saz6dy/cmv_theres_no_good_argument_against_beastiality/htwzcpw/

5sb54	>And changing the definitions to make a fish and a cat the same species would be stupid, it would obscure reality.  In what way would it obscure reality? They would still have the same qualities that we can observe, before and after redefinition, we just wouldn’t distinguish between them as species. A major part of what defines a species is the ability to interbreed so we would have to get rid of that part of the definition to classify them as the same species, which has no real value for us to do. If we suddenly did have a value in doing it for whatever reason, we absolutely would.    >Similarly, making man and woman the same thing obscures reality.  You’ve made a massive jump here. The function of gender for us is vastly different than the function of defining species. We use man and woman to describe people we interact with in every context, in the majority of which we have no idea what their reproductive systems are like, if they even have one. We still categorise everyone into man or woman.   >Where do you think this push came from to force pronouns on everyone, and to destroy the definition of man and woman? It forcefully hit the entire country quickly, how and why?  Pronouns were already forced on everyone in English, that’s been the case for hundreds of years. For all of human history we have defined people that look like men as men and people that look like women as women. Trans people aren’t changing either of these things. Non-binary is fairly new however, at least for western culture.   >So if I become skilled enough at redefining terms and forcing people to accept them, then it changes reality? What a horrible world to live in! 1984 here we come.  Yeah you could theoretically do that. It doesn’t change “reality” it changes how we categorise and define things.   >This suggests people should not accept the redefinitions then, so then it doesn't catch on. Rather, we should actively resist them. The far left political movements will create far right political movements to bring the chaos back into order.  No people mainly define things based on their intuition and it intuitively makes sense for people to call someone that looks like a woman a woman, regardless of their reproductive system.   >Yes, it does not change the qualities of the thing itself. Men will still be stronger than women and dominate in sports. Women will still be the only ones able to have children and nurse a child.  These aren’t absolute qualities for the categories. If men and women are the only options, and only women can give birth to children why don’t we call all the ones that can’t men?   >When woman and man is so bastardized to lose all meaning, I wonder what new words will replace current "woman" and "man"?   At that point why would we need to replace them if they don’t provide a function for us anymore? Male and female still exist and work very well to describe sex.

3p8tftxj	I never quite bought this argument. It seems to suggest that we only accept transgender people because it is politically expedient to do so; that their identity isn't an immutable truth (which I think it is), but rather something we *temporarily* grant them based on an external, changing scale of injustice or inequality.  For example, there are many countries around the world where women face *more* systematic and structural injustice and inequality than racial minorities in the current US. Under the logic presented in this article, trans women in those countries wouldn't be truly valid, because it would "undermine collective reckoning with injustice."  In my thinking, transgender people (and, to be honest, transracial people) should be accepted regardless of how politically correct or incorrect it is to do so in a given moment.	1642990008.0	htypn4p	t3_sba0n6	t1_htyn244	/r/changemyview/comments/sba0n6/cmv_identifying_as_transracial_is_as_valid_as/htypn4p/

d2vxs7xo	To clarify, it seems what is being said here is essentially that "Male people have X brain characteristics and female people have Y brain characteristics. Therefore if we see a male with Y characteristics, that is evidence they are actually female (at least neurologically)." But couldn't we equally draw the conclusion that the initial supposition was incorrect and that while certain brain characteristics might be found more frequently in one sex than the other, there are no characteristics exclusive to one sex? In the same way that a man is more likely to be 6′2″ and a woman is more likely to be 5′ but there is no exclusively “male height” or “female height."	1642999431.0	htzbiqa	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htxu115	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/htzbiqa/
bxxstmqp	Oh gotcha, that's a little different. You're working customer service and make customers talk to you? Yeah, I would separate that from when you're off the clock and compartmentalize that as working. When you're working, it's cut and dry business.  Outside of work, and if the place is appropriate, like you pointed out, then you're open to socializing beyond "hi".   It's difficult because men are required to pursue women. So there's a super blurry line there. Flirting with a girl who's working isn't ok however.	1642999763.0	htzc5q7	t3_sbd7ga	t1_htzbj6c	/r/changemyview/comments/sbd7ga/cmv_society_cant_do_anything_nor_do_they_need_to/htzc5q7/
5sb54	I’m not disagreeing with that, the point is we still make these categorisations and treat people as either men or women when we interact with people in society, which has nothing to do with their sex the vast majority of the time. If a trans woman completely passes everyone that interacts with them would call them a woman and treat them as such, and that would be true from a social standpoint.	1643016758.0	hu012so	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htz3xef	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu012so/
5sb54	>I would say "Can I have another piece of fish to eat?" and you would hand me my pet cat cooked up. You lose the labels that distinguish them as being different.  You would say “can I have another piece of the sea fish to eat?” Or something like that to distinguish them, the same way we distinguish between existing types of fish. I disagree with that whole idea though because when you say "Can I have another piece of fish to eat?" I don’t hand you cooked shark. This is already how we function, it’s not obscuring reality.   >We don't have value in destroying the distinction between man and woman. It actually produces more harm than good. The "value" is an artificial one forced upon us by groups that shame, deplatform, and claim we cause death if we don't accept it.  If it’s becoming a thing at all then there’s obviously some value in it for people.   >Then why did you continue the species examples?  I’m using species because you brought up cats and raccoons saying they can never be categorised as the same, which is not true. The underlying principle of categorising is the same, we can change anything we want if it has value to us. Changing gender is far more valuable to society than changing species at the moment.   >Except that isn't what is happening. The pronouns and genders are not a natural occurrence, it is a forceful push by political groups and installed DEI centers in companies and schools.  Pronouns (he/she/they) have existed naturally in English for hundreds of years, how are they not a natural occurrence? The same for gender. Trans people are responding to its existence, not creating it.   >I never said all women can have children, I said only women can have children.  So then there’s something about being a woman that isn’t based on their reproductive sex, can you identify what that is?   >It blows my mind how much I need to pull teeth to get you to understand basic biology.  Don’t worry I understand it just fine.  >These nouns are interchangeable. The point I was making is biological reality will assert itself even if you erase the labels, and new labels will arise out of necessity because you can't avoid reality.  Why would you need new labels if we already have male and female to describe biological sex and that works is what I said.   >It's a trick question, you shared AI generated faces, the poorly merging pixels gives it away.

fyzgz1nq	You're right. I was circumcised in my teens (here in the US) and cannot say it had any negative effect. I actually found it a lot nicer being circumcised including THAT way. I see no issue with it and it has clear health and hygiene benefits. Sexually it is a bit different of course but I prefer it circumcised. Frankly I feel it made it more pleasurable and opened up more experiences if you will. You do lose some of the over sensitivity (a good thing) which should not be confused with sexual pleasure. Also, an orgasm is still an orgasm. And let's face it, if circumcision has any negative sexual effect it would not have lasted more than a week. Instead it's mankind oldest medical procedure... for good reason.	1643039413.0	hu14f7q	t3_sbejct	t1_htzjufw	/r/changemyview/comments/sbejct/cmv_circumcision_at_birth_is_genital_mutilation/hu14f7q/

aaqpyyp	I've generally found that the more insistent someone is that I'm wrong for not supporting the full party platform, the less they're capable of actually giving any kind of nuanced explanation of how the party intends to carry out the platform. (They almost always put in the built-in excuse of the other party blocking all the great things they want to do out of evilness)     I've got a history degree, and I often study the history of a political party's policy outcomes vs their policy positions. A certain political party in the U.S. always has worker's rights as part of their platform, but on almost all major legislation, when they have to compromise between corporate giveaways and what's in the best interests of the working-class, the stuff for the working-class is always the first thing that gets compromised.      Or, even worse in my book, is when they put some free giveaways to public sector unions (government employees) and act like that's a big victory for people who work jobs where they actually have to perform or be fired. (Giving free stuff to public sector unions requires taking from the taxpayers that the elected officials have zero respect for, while negotiating for broader worker's initiatives requires the consent of their rich donors, who the politicians really don't like to inconvenience)      Yet sure enough, the next election the party platform will once again be talking about how they support the rights of laborers and advocates for the party will insist that I'm wrong for questioning the blatant, repeated, and predictable betrayals.	1643043772.0	hu1fvcc	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu1axss	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu1fvcc/

aaqpyyp	American progressives are the beaten housewives of politics in the U.S. No matter how many times they get betrayed after supporting corporate Democrats, they keep on convincing themselves that next time will be different. Since there's zero penalty for betraying progressives, the corporate Democrats just keep on doing it, and they're going to continue that pattern until they suffer for their behavior. All the corporate Democrats have to do is say, "What are you going to do, let a Republican win?" and the progressives dutifully show up to vote for some dipshit whose going to do nothing for them unless it costs that politician nothing.      At least the Tea Party Republicans made a few stands and took some election losses to send a message. Initially the Republican establishment told them to go fuck themselves, and then proceeded to lose close elections they would have won if the tea party faction had shown up.	1643044240.0	hu1h4pg	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu1a9r8	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu1h4pg/
171sgb	I'm not sure why this part is giving you pause. You may not have experienced it, but it's not exactly uncommon. There are absolutely people who will take hardline stances and refuse to engage with anyone from the other side of the political aisle. Likewise those who - as a rule - refuse to engage with those who argue in defense of a particular viewpoint when it comes from the "wrong" party.   A good friend of mine here in CA (we're all pretty liberal) just got dumped by his recent GF (of \~3 months) because she told him she would never date anyone who voted for Trump no matter what. He said (to paraphrase) "no matter what? That seems a *little* extreme to me." She then asked him if he voted for Trump (he didn't, he's a liberal CA surfer bro), he said no, and she dumped him anyway because she didn't believe him and didn't want to "take the chance."  I'm liberal mostly across the board, except that I don't knee-jerk hate all corporations, or rich people, I'm fine with guns, and the idea of personal accountability doesn't make me faint of a gasping spell. Any one of those things can easily be (and has been) used by people to accuse me of being a MAGA-hat-wearing die hard Trump stan. Mostly on the internet where most of the crazies hang out. People in real life tend to be considerably more level headed.   All that to say, yes, there are absolutely a whole bunch of people out there who behave just as u/myay-noos describes. That we're debating whether this is even a thing on Reddit of all places is just bizarre.	1643045474.0	hu1khn8	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu1emva	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu1khn8/

171sgb	I don't think you two disagree, you're talking past each other. The difference between you and who u/DancinginAshes is describing is that you recognize that compromise even needs to happen, and you're still capable of talking about the things you're compromising on.  Whereas the other person doesn't even recognize that a compromise is being made, because you support the party, period, so disagreement with the finer points of certain policies is irrelevant and tantamount to blasphemy. There's no "compromise" at all because you support it on principle. Which of course just perpetuates and feeds these blind spots until you suffer some major defeat that nobody (i.e. everyone but you) saw coming. Then, instead of re-evaluating your refusal to substantively consider faults in your party platform, you just blame it all on other\_party and do it again. Before you know it everyone is only capable of seeing other\_party as a grotesque caricature and everything just devolves into demagoguery and a total inability to communicate or compromise on anything.

171sgb	I thought I was talking about pretty much the first quote. It really is "any agreement with the other party on literally anything is bad." Of course, if we want to be nitpicky about it, it rarely means *literally everything*. Like if Trump said "slavery is bad" and you said "yes, I agree slavery is bad," I doubt you'd find anyone to complain. But technicalities aside, day-to-day, on 99% of topics: agreeing with the other party on a viewpoint that conflicts with *your* party's viewpoint (maybe this is the key part to the argument I should have mentioned) is often seen as a betrayal and proof that you're not *really* an in\_group member.   Again I rarely ever see this in real life (though it's happened a couple times), but on the internet?

ips76c06	Agreed lol    I think a lot of people don't actually watch football games because it's clear that this current OT is the best solution given how NFL teams play. Unlike college, you have way better offenses so if the whole thing is well the defense cannot make stops then it just continues to go on until one team gets tired or a fluke play happens or one random stop.   I don't see how it's fair if one team beats the other because out of 10 times, 1 time they make a stop. What if the other team scored faster each of the 9 times?   Another aspect is the NFL wants to protect players at the end of games because if the Bills or Chiefs win but don't have their QB or star players then it's going to be a bad AFC Championship game.  People propose doing the OT period fully, but we've seen teams take the ball down the field and milk 10 minutes or close to it. T  he coin toss is 50/50. It's fair.   BUF had the ball to kick off, they could've tried an onsides or they could've just made a stop.	1643048747.0	hu1teio	t3_sbbjoo	t1_hu1in3k	/r/changemyview/comments/sbbjoo/cmv_current_nfl_overtime_rules_are_awful/hu1teio/

ips76c06	baseball is an entirely different sport! The nature of baseball prevents you from scoring if you're fielding/pitching. The bills had a chance to win the game. They could've kicked an onsides kick. They could've gotten a pick six or a strip and ran it in. They could've blocked a field goal and returned it or blocked a punt and returned it. They could've returned a punt w/o ever having to have Allen come back on the field.   A pitcher cannot strike someone out and get a run.	1643048932.0	hu1twhb	t3_sbbjoo	t1_hu0x46r	/r/changemyview/comments/sbbjoo/cmv_current_nfl_overtime_rules_are_awful/hu1twhb/
171sgb	I mean I think we're both right. I agree that the vast majority of people understand the things you're saying and discuss/debate in good faith based on that understanding, but also that there's a small and vocal minority who either don't understand that or don't let on to the outside world that they do. Who consider anything originating from the other party to be unworthy of consideration because of who said it - regardless of what was said. That last bit is almost becoming mainstream in some circles. They definitely exist too. Maybe deep down they are more thoughtful, but it certainly doesn't come out.   Just like there are people who think that literally every world problem is the fault of capitalism, or that the entire world would be living in peace and harmony and prosperity if not for "colonialism," or that every wealthy person is inherently immoral, so too there are people who think every word uttered by Republicans or Democrats is so infected with greed and ulterior motives and "corporate interests" and a generic desire for evil-doing that none of them can ever be trusted, should be discarded out of hand, and that you're an idiot if you think otherwise.   If you've not met any of them - lucky you. Maybe I just need to spend less time reading the inane ramblings of such people or engaging with them in person. 🤷‍♂️	1643054040.0	hu27i8y	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu244vz	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu27i8y/

ips76c06	>" The 3 percent of adults with professional and doctorate degrees hold 20 percent of the education debt. These households have median earnings more than twice as high as the overall median "  This is the wrong way to look at student loans because current income doesn't explain why the person took out the loans.  Student loans originate from not having enough capital to pay for tuition or not receiving enough grants/scholarships. So a poor person can become a doctor and make six figures yet have massive loans.   A rich kid isn't going to have loans. You also use a bad fact/stat here:   >"Many of the lowest-income households consist of adults who did not go to college and thus have little education debt. " [1]  This is the outcome of not going to college, this is not the outcome of making less money w/ a college degree. So again we miss the actual representation of people with student loans, who are most likely kids from middle class or poor families.  Also it is easy to fix this issue. You add a surcharge of a few percent based on income to loan forgiveness and its taxed. But simply making 100k a year doesn't suddenly mean you are rich. It's odd that when we talk about wealth for the super rich it ends up being well their non-liquid assets are realized so they're not rich yet the person w/ 100k debt making six figures is rich.   The average person with student debt has around 30k. I don't see a world where someone carries around 30k in debt for the fun of it. This isn't a mortgage where you get an asset you can resell.   Trickle down economics is built on the idea that if you cut the taxes for rich it will lead to higher wages and more jobs, which isn't true. It also is way to lower the amount of money the government receives to fund social programs. As others have explained a regressive tax is something where it ends up hurting poor people the most.   Forgiving any debt. Student debt, medical debt, or credit card debt does not harm another individual since they do not have to pay a larger % of their income towards anything and it doesn't come at the expense of social programs.   If we had free college in the US, would it be a regressive policy because someone can become an engineer and another person can become a data analyst? No. Student loan forgiveness is lifting the burden of debt from everyone. Going by income currently is not reflective of past instances where you needed to take on debt.	1643054551.0	hu28u7m	t3_sbtdbf	t3_sbtdbf	/r/changemyview/comments/sbtdbf/cmv_blanket_student_loan_forgiveness_is_a/hu28u7m/

aaqpyyp	They chose corporate interests over worker's rights when they kept big box stores open and closed small stores and restaurants with extended lockdowns.      Teachers vote overwhelmingly Democrat, there are a lot of them, and they'll vote as a block when asked. This means they're a power player in Democratic primaries. They can be counted on to back whichever candidate has the blessing of the DNC. In red states this doesn't do them much good because Republican governors don't give a shit if teachers threaten to vote for Democrats. They got told to get their asses back in school and they had to comply. In states controlled by Democrats though the teachers got to call the tune the Democratic politicians marched to, and that's where we saw the stupidity and avarice of teacher's refusing to return to teach in person. They never missed a damn paycheck, but a whole lot of parents who couldn't go to work did.      Also, remember in February when the director of the CDC said there was no data showing that kids shouldn't be attending school in person, and then the teacher's unions cried to the Biden admin and they made the CDC Director kiss the ring and rewrite the CDC school guidelines with the "help" of the "we're absolutely not doctors or public health expert" teacher's unions? That's a direct example of the federal government screwing the people to appease a public sector union.      Last, but not least, there are 313,000 dues-paying members of the biggest public sector union in the country, and they represent an additional 400,000 workers as well. [https://www.afge.org/about-us/afge-at-a-glance/](https://www.afge.org/about-us/afge-at-a-glance/)  Every negotiation with this union results in a shitshow of giveaways because the politicians are negotiating with taxpayer money, not "real" money. These people get 44 paid holidays, sick days, and vacation days per year. Almost 9 weeks.  Tell me any private sector job that comes anywhere close to that. Most European countries are capped out at 6 weeks of paid days off.	1643057937.0	hu2hphn	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu2cpue	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu2hphn/
aaqpyyp	Exactly.  They kept schools closed, primarily in blue states where they have the most influence, without any good goddamn reason behind it. It was just because they wanted to. They didn't care about the harm to the children or the financial catastrophe they were creating for parents who couldn't afford childcare and had to stay home with a kid rather than going to work.	1643058040.0	hu2hzgb	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu2d6vl	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu2hzgb/
171sgb	Genuine good-faith disagreement tends to accompany a discussion, or at least a brief explanation. If they can disagree and explain why they disagree calmly and without going straight for name calling and angry gesticulating towards the Trump/Hillary/Biden, then I agree that it's just a normal disagreement. If they can't - or don't even know what they're supposedly disagreeing with or what you're talking about, and don't want to find out - that seems like more of a giveaway.   >disagree pretty much entirely with the mainstream republican/democratic ideology.  That's exactly what I'm talking about though. That would be an arrogant viewpoint. "I disagree with the mainstream ideology, as I understand it, so I don't need to hear any more and I don't need to seriously consider anything any politician from that party says." Disagreeing with your perspective of the ideology (which isn't the only one, and possibly not even the majority one) doesn't grant you omniscient powers to know everything without learning it. You don't know whether that state bill sponsored by a republican congressmen is actually worthwhile or not if you reject it out of hand just because there's an "R" next to his name. You don't know if that infrastructure bill by the democrat is actually a good one if you vote for it because "Oh, a democratic bill. Sounds good."  People like this exist, and there's no difference between blanket rejection and fooling yourself into believing that you not only know what and how every mainstream politician thinks but can comprehend the impact of their legislation without reading it.	1643059541.0	hu2lzb3	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu2ayp8	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu2lzb3/
1dektgv2	It just means they're not outsourcing the killing to someone else. If you eat meat, an animal needs to die, or else you have no meat. Whether someone fires a bullet through an animal in the wild, or someone else puts a steel bolt through an animal's skull in a factory farm, doesn't make much difference to the fact that an animal was destroyed before being processed. Both are gruesome, yes.  Here's what I would ask you. Do you think factory farming is immoral as well? If so, I wouldn't try to change your mind about whether a hunter is immoral for hunting, but rather whether they would be immoral for purchasing from the grocery store instead.  If both options are immoral, does it make sense for the hunter to take on the burden of killing a wild animal to avoid contributing to an industry that capitalizes on mass animal suffering? Assume they are going to eat meat one way or the other.	1643060135.0	hu2nkks	t3_sbwknv	t1_hu2lk4h	/r/changemyview/comments/sbwknv/cmv_hunting_animals_is_generally_immoral/hu2nkks/
fyzgz1nq	Actually... I did have sex before. Albeit very limited - lol. Had infection issues and when the doctor saw I was uncut he had me circumcised. Eliminated all the issues and sex felt better than ever. I will admit that I was done before all this poisonous social media which might explain why I'm not feeling like a victim. There was no controversy about circumcision and couldn't find much info about it. I didn't know what to expect and it was a revelation to be honest.

3i8j0bav	Couldn't agree more. My issue is best reflected with Morgan Wallen because it was something overheard on his own camera and he still got a lot of heat for it even though he was in the privacy of his own home around close friends. Please understand, I don't care for him or his music at all, he's just a good example of someone using this word with zero bad intentions yet he was made to look like a racist prick. My argument being, that intention is everything and nobody deserves to be villainized if they mean no harm. Especially with a word thats become synonymous with 'homie' or 'friend'	1643063239.0	hu2vont	t3_sbxd7z	t1_hu2qr3k	/r/changemyview/comments/sbxd7z/cmv_everybody_should_be_allowed_to_say_nigga_not/hu2vont/
3i8j0bav	No joke, a Black Marine gave me an 'n-pass' when I was deployed with him. It was literally a piece of paper that said "n-word pass" and he signed it lmao. Obviously I'm not just going to say it around anyone, just as I wouldn't refer to a stranger with any type of profanity like I would my close friends. I just think this conversation is worth having, especially since most Hispanics I know say nigga and I worry they could be villainized even though they're not racist at all including myself	1643063777.0	hu2x2fr	t3_sbxd7z	t1_hu2ufdg	/r/changemyview/comments/sbxd7z/cmv_everybody_should_be_allowed_to_say_nigga_not/hu2x2fr/
3i8j0bav	Forgot to add that I feel like 'nigga' is unique in that it's a cuss word while simultaneously being endearing. For someone to say you're my nigga has a much deeper and personal meaning as opposed to someone saying "you're my bitch" or gay people saying "you're my fag" which isn't  really endearing at all nor does it make sense so I dont feel like that's a fair comparison	1643064110.0	hu2xwrc	t3_sbxd7z	t1_hu2vont	/r/changemyview/comments/sbxd7z/cmv_everybody_should_be_allowed_to_say_nigga_not/hu2xwrc/

1dektgv2	Have you considered that not all diseases kill 100% of those who become infected? And less than 100% of people are ever infected to begin with. So no matter what stance on vaccination someone takes, no matter what their actions or behaviors look like, and no matter how vulnerable they are, there will always be a select few who are just lucky enough to get through without infection.  As for natural immunity, it's not as though recovering from an infection leaves zero protection. It's probably variable at best, so some might be naturally protected and some won't.	1643065339.0	hu30zuf	t3_sbz28m	t3_sbz28m	/r/changemyview/comments/sbz28m/cmv_antivaxxers_should_have_died_off/hu30zuf/

3i8j0bav	What about other POC? I can totally see how most people wouldn't feel comfortable with a White person using that word given the history.

3i8j0bav	What you're not understanding is that spic, beaner, wetback, etc,. has only ever been an insult.

107o8q	I have a depression that makes my life rather hard for like past 15 years, e.g. I am unemployed for last two years and have serious problems with leaving my home etc. Often I contemplate suicide. But while my life kind of sucks, it doesn't suck so much that I want to die 100% of time. In fact, most of the time I recognize that death is a bad thing. Yet it is an temptation.  And what I really dislike is when I am tempted by something and people decide that it is a good idea to tempt me even more. Like what if instead I was a barely functioning alcoholic? Would it be ok to go "you should have right to drink", "it is your informed decision", "let's open a wine shop nearby, it'll make it easier for you"?  Having a "right to commit suicide" won't make my life easier, it'll make it easier to make a bad but tempting decision.	1643144684.0	hu7d3pi	t3_scmhaw	t3_scmhaw	/r/changemyview/comments/scmhaw/cmv_people_with_severe_depression_should_have_the/hu7d3pi/

h362v	I love seeing the Cambridge study still being thrown around. It’s so out of touch it’s comical.  I am happy to go through any portion of the study with you, but at this time you are focused on the energy consumption of the network.  The study states under the methodology section “Assumption 3c (best -guess): all miners that do not operate Antminer S7 or S9 machines are assumed to use an equally-weighted basket of hardware types that are profitable in electricity terms”  The antminer S7 4.73Th/s (0.273j/Gh) came out in September 2015 and the antminer S9 13.5Th/s (0.098j/Gh) came out in September 2017. Moving on to the current times we see the newest miner the antminer S19xp 140Th/s (0.022j/Gh. This newest miner and its efficiency rating is never mentioned or plugged into any of the models.  The study states under the methodology section “Assumption 3a (lower bound): all miners always run the most efficient hardware available.”  Then continues to state “In the case of bitcoin mining, however, electricity costs account for the vast majority of operational expenditures. Mining farm operators therefore have a clear incentive to optimize cooling systems in order to reduce overall costs. Conversations with miners support the hypothesis that mining facilities generally have significantly lower PUE than traditional data centers.  In a best-case scenario, mining facilities have optimized data center operations to a point where there is nearly zero overhead. This scenario is represented by a PUE of 1.01.”  They also state “googles average PUE is 1.11” and then go on to the “upper bound as 1.2 PUE”  This May all sound insignificant but it brings us back to their bound numbers as a whole 5.62GW for their lower bound at 49.26TWh, estimated at 15GW and 131.47TWh, and upper bound at 37.66GW and 330.11TWh. Again the lower bound is not done at the newest miner efficiency rating not that it really matters.  They have stated they have spoken to miners and confirmed that “mining facilities generally have significantly lower PUE than traditional data centers”  You also have to come at this from a different angle of what is the world getting from bitcoin for all this power. Well at 49,000 gigawatt hours on the lower end it lands bitcoin between Uzbekistan and Greece in terms of consumption (Wikipedia) but in terms of transaction values on a yearly basis there was 12 trillion transacted in 2021 which puts it 3rd in terms of GDP behind only China and the US 8 trillion ahead of Japan. It doesn’t really matter which country you pair it with in terms of electric consumption BTC does more in nominal dollar valued transactions.  Those numbers don’t even include facts such as this one that the number one way to transact in Venezuela is via binance a centralized exchange that allows for free instant transfers that get batched onto the blockchain when/if a user decides to remove their funds from the exchange resulting in many transactions that take place that are never recorded on the blockchain.	1643147628.0	hu7ktqw	t3_qogjrr	t1_hkdzx1e	/r/changemyview/comments/qogjrr/cmv_bitcoin_scales_human_economization_across/hu7ktqw/

dipispgb	The thing that changed my mind are recent studies that show how other developed countries have about the same mental health issue and violent crime rates as America. The biggest difference is a gun makes any situation far more dangerous. It's far easier to escape a robbery or domestic violence incident when the attacker has a knife vs a gun. It's also much easier to overpower a knife wielding mass murderer than it is to take out a gunman. I'll give you that truck attacks can do a lot of damage on the street, but at least people who are inside are relatively safe. And crazy mass shootings by clearly mentally ill people (think the Batman movie shooter) are a fraction of gun deaths. Most shootings are either by criminals or people with severe anger management issues like angry husbands or road ragers.  Here's an excellent article with further links to the studies: [https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9217163/america-guns-europe](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9217163/america-guns-europe)	1643150247.0	hu7rbve	t3_scnbto	t3_scnbto	/r/changemyview/comments/scnbto/cmv_mass_shootings_are_a_mental_health_problem/hu7rbve/
wesx8	[here](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2020/) is the population pyramid. The ratios of men/women are higher for everyone born during the one child policy. My point is that even with that the "few young people overall" tilt is much bigger than the "among young people, there are more than the expected number of men relative to women" tilt.   Consider for example, China, vs [Burkina Faso](https://www.populationpyramid.net/burkina-faso/2020/) where they just had a coup (not quite a violent revolution, but you get what I'm gesturing at). 27.6% of China's population are males under 40.  In Burkina Faso, it's 42.5%. The one child policy effects on the sex ratios are absolutely swamped by the different shape in population pyramid.	1643150696.0	hu7sgnv	t3_scg14g	t1_hu7lt2j	/r/changemyview/comments/scg14g/cmv_china_has_a_60_chance_of_a_violent_revolution/hu7sgnv/

h362v	I would like to quickly point out that we live in a world that is constantly improving and evolving and as such buying anything that is in any way “cutting edge” or “new” results in it being improved upon very quickly after having paid for it.  For example cars, computers, even a washing machine. People don’t just not buy a car because they know that the car will lose value and that the next year they could’ve bought a different one with more bells and whistles for the same price. People don’t just not buy a washing machine for the same reason. There are however people that will wait for the heated steering wheel on the new BMWs to finally be 5 years old so they can buy one at what they deem an affordable price. There are however people that look at the current housing market and go “This is a bubble I will wait.”   What you are missing is the psychology of markets in your equation. The guy waiting to buy a house is part of the reason the housing bubble occurs and you can see this at play in markets like Japan and even China right now.  All of these things point to deflation not being disastrous at all.   Deflation is good.	1643159232.0	hu8ddcw	t3_qogjrr	t1_hjncbfp	/r/changemyview/comments/qogjrr/cmv_bitcoin_scales_human_economization_across/hu8ddcw/

r7vzy	Yep, there's only a few scenarios that could realistically result in first strike nuclear weapons usage:      1) Irrational actor - An unhinged, crazy leader launching nukes just to watch the world burn.  Not currently likely, not even Kim Jong Un would fall under this category.      2) An accidental launch - next to impossible with all safeguards in place with modern nukes.      3) Nothing to lose - pushing a nuclear power to the edge where they either cease to exist or use nukes and take the world with them.  Think something like invading Russia with conventional warfare and be the the verge of completely taking them over.  They could either surrender and no longer exist as a country, or take the world with them.  This would also likely never happen since an attacking country would know this and the attacked country would threaten a scorched earth response.      Never forget, people in power no matter how power hungry or corrupt don't want to die.  They want to keep their power and control.  Nukes don't discriminate and nuclear war WILL cause even the most ruthless leader to lose what they desire most, their power.	1643160164.0	hu8fl6e	t3_sc0ylg	t1_hu3lguz	/r/changemyview/comments/sc0ylg/cmv_wwiii_is_going_to_happen_very_soon/hu8fl6e/
h362v	I disagree with OP but I disagree with you too.  “Bitcoin has regressed, not progressed. Bitcoin started off as a medium of exchange, not a store of value. It’s primary use was online payments (primarily criminals on Silk Road, but still payments nonetheless) and it was used for this purpose for years. Heck, the whitepaper was called “Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system”. It was designed as a medium of exchange first and foremost, and used as such. It wasn’t until many years later that people started arguing that bitcoin is primarily a store of value, mostly because it’s price started going up and it’s use as a currency started to decrease.”  Let’s start at the top “bitcoin started off as a medium of exchange  not a store of value”   agreed  It’s primary use was online payments (primarily criminals on Silk Road, but still payments nonetheless)  Disagree would love to see a source from you on this but I can tell you right now that back when Silk Road got busted the price of bitcoin was $10-$15 each (October 2013) so those crazy headlines you see showing 1 billion in bitcoin are due to the increase in the price of bitcoin. I went ahead and did a quick calculation and the 69,000 BTC he had at a price of $12 was worth around 900k at the time no small sum for sure but hardly as if it was the only thing the currency was being used for. Bloomberg’s Matt Miller did his “12 days of bitcoin” in 2014 and did everything with Bitcoin he ate, bought coffee, and gas all with bitcoin even back then and it’s only gotten easier. Don’t forget the infamous bitcoin pizza. Oh and don’t forget the precursor to Silk Road known as “The Farmers Market” used PayPal and WesternUnion.  “It wasn’t until many years later that people started arguing that bitcoin is primarily a store of value, mostly because it’s price started going up and it’s use as a currency started to decrease.”  Mostly false. People do argue it’s a store of value but these are mostly people in developed nations like the US that are out of touch with the rest of the world. In Venezuela the number one way to transact is through binance exchange which is instantaneous and free. The lightning network has seen immense growth and directly counters the idea that it’s seeing less use as a currency. The increasing number of transactions performed and the increasing dollar amount those transactions are worth is often struck down by people saying “those are just traders” sure some are traders, but millions of people worldwide transact solely in bitcoin everyday even in developed nations like the US.	1643161553.0	hu8iv2t	t3_qogjrr	t1_hjnx779	/r/changemyview/comments/qogjrr/cmv_bitcoin_scales_human_economization_across/hu8iv2t/

The news and the NRA may define it differently.   In my home, nothing looks like it came off a cheap assembly line and will bounce around your bowel four times before landing in your shoulder. Again, as a NRA member for the past seven years, I could be wrong.   Nothing I own takes an extended magazine. Nothing I own is black or tan.

That binary lens through which you’re attempting to rationalize one’s belief system, factors out our idiosyncratic nature as humans. There’s no right or wrong. There’s no yes or no. This isn’t some choice between black or white! Agnosticism proposes the idea of “knowledge” and nothing further. While Theism/Atheism explores what we “believe” in. You can believe in the existence of god, but can’t categorically claim to know for a fact if it’s true or not. Religion is sort of road map to god’s existence.

And what if work was a part of flourishing? Even in Christianity, the Garden of Eden (which was paradise) involved work.  And what about people who find fulfillment in their job? I argue that a good job is a job that brings about happiness, which would fit into a lot of definitions of flourishing. Having a job that you know makes a difference can be fulfilling.  And then do you know how boring life is without a job? Think of when you were in school and had breaks off. Life gets incredibly boring and monotonous without work. Work gives us a since of accomplishment and routine, which can also attribute to flourishing.  TLDR- you need to define flourishing, and I'd argue that work is a part of flourishing.

9gphfw6b	This just isn't true though. In the United States, orphans don't always go to foster care. They can go to an appointed guardian or to another family member.  And foster care is meant to reunite families. This obviously doesn't always happen, but the foster care system wants the child to go back to parents if possible.  Other countries handle child welfare systems differently, but for this I'll focus on US since that's what I'm assuming most are familiar with.  Orphan and foster kids are different. Yes, there's an overlap, but they are not synonymous as you claim.	1643189281.0	hu9w74m	t3_sd1se7	t3_sd1se7	/r/changemyview/comments/sd1se7/cmv_people_in_this_world_do_not_care_about_orphans/hu9w74m/

If everyone just started working only 3 out of 7 days, our city environment would probably be radically different from what it is today.

As a psychology fan, and medical professional myself, I read/listen a lot his lectures in Psychology. He is incredible at this. Its fascinating. People who REALLY listen to his lectures keep asking the same, why is he so hated by this specific group.. Maybe after he dies, a growing number of people stop to listen.

This is repeated with each successive level of coursework, depending on how far the students wish to go.

43m7t9fl	The thing is, the United States already implements my solution to some extent.  Impoverished neighborhoods are overpoliced and poor people (most especially poor black people) are disproportionately imprisoned. California utilizing prisoners to fight the wildfires is an example of prison labor being used for labor that could be filled by prospecting firefighters, but isn’t because it’s cheaper to pay prisoners less. Locking up poor people to use for prison labor is the status quo, so this solution isn’t too far fetched for me.  The United States hasn’t done nor will ever implement any of the radical solutions that would work, especially with this senate.	1643220829.0	hubpupq	t3_sdc5z5	t1_huboli4	/r/changemyview/comments/sdc5z5/cmv_in_the_us_the_only_way_homelessness_will_ever/hubpupq/

That’s actually a meaningful solution that I could see being passed at the local and national level, as compared to literally locking up all the homeless. Here’s a delta.  !delta  My only question is that you imply that allowing more construction to occur would help alleviate homelessness, unregulated. Would you agree that the effects of this could be amplified if legislature at the local level was passed to order more contracts for cheap housing to be built?

43m7t9fl	I already agree with this perspective. I’m saying that the “radical” solutions are never going to be implemented on the local or federal level, and politicians would likely be more okay with imprisoning the homeless than actually helping them.

43m7t9fl	If none of the aforementioned politicians support pro-social policies that actually would help the homeless, then they, by default, support the status quo, which is allowing impoverished and homeless people to have incentives to commit crimes and be thrown into prison to be used for prison labor.

l4fasxy	But it is not always so clear that a law is unconstitutional.  Most cases would fall into grey areas where some legal scholars think it is constitutional and others don't.    Also, a highly politicized court would mean that what is consitutional is not objective but dependent on the court's current makeup. So what we would have is legislators getting imprisoned simply because their politics doesn't agree with the supreme court's.	1643224726.0	huc0s4x	t3_sddlco	t3_sddlco	/r/changemyview/comments/sddlco/cmv_elected_officials_who_knowingly_pass/huc0s4x/

One problem is that people running for president would pretty much be forced to disclose who their nominee would be. And that would open up a whole can of worms. Another would be that the retirement/appointment things would be Justices without presidential approval or Senate confirmation, which is to say very far removed from the voters (and one such Justice could theoretically serve 35 years).  It doesn't solve the Garland situation of a Senate that refuses to do its job.   But overall it's not a very terrible proposal. It might well be better than the current system.

g57q5oet	I have high functioning autism. I am not a rude asshole. I only have meltdowns at home. I mask well enough to function, by a thread. People think im shy, and awkward. I don’t need people to know im autistic, but I wish people viewed it differently, so i’d feel more comfortable asking for what I need.   I feel problematic having to ask for accommodations, I don’t want to make other people have to go out of their way for me, a small minority. So, I silently suffer. Accommodating autistic people isn’t something that ever crosses NT minds. Autistic people have a hard time advocating for themselves, which doesn’t help.   Now, every single grocery store has bright lights, music, every public place is built for NT’s. Makes sense, most people are NT.. But it’s like we don’t exist. Jobs are set against me. The interview process is built against me. Everything is built in a way that brings out my weaknesses. It’s hard, I try to remember i’m a minority, and it is how it is.

Even if you use overweight models, i doubt this will change the over all females beauty standard.   If there's anything we should stop promoting, it is the stuff they inject into their lips to make them bigger. That looks absolutely ridiculous in most cases that i have seen.	1643232673.0	hucn65g	t3_sdfyt7	t3_sdfyt7	/r/changemyview/comments/sdfyt7/cmv_if_we_have_moved_away_from_using_thin_models/hucn65g/
qbwqq	There is a difference between 'normalizing' and 'glorifying'.   When we normalize something, we make it 'normal'. We make it unexceptional. In this case, people who are *already overweight* see themselves represented in fashion, they see clothes on models that match their own body type so they can envision it better, and the range of diversity show in body types means that it covers for a variety of people.   To normalize something in this context is good. Fat people *still* deserve representation. They still deserve to see people lik themselves interacting in society and wearing clothes that are fashionable.   Fat people exist. They have money to spend and they need clothes, they need furniture, they need to buy outfits for weddings and for funerals and for sports and for business and for running around with the kids in winter. Not showing them does not erase their existence but it *does* alienate them from society. It means that they don't feel welcomed in shops, by brands, and they feel ostracised. Being ostracised for their weight *does not make them unfat*. In fact, it increases the likelihood of them being fatter for longer. Taking away the ability to see themselves frustrates them, makes them less likely to dress well and to dress in fashionable styles, less likely to contribute to the fashion economy, and feel less positive about engaging in being fashionable and feeling good about themselves. They can’t stop buying clothes so it helps to contribute to feeling unhappy and depressed which are not conducive to constructive engaging in discussions about their health or weight. This is *one element* to reducing weight gain and changing our understanding towards obesity in society and there are many facets to it. Many. Dozens.   Let's also be clear here that showing a fat model or even a hundred of them does not *cause* people to be fat. It does not *glorify* it if someone happens to be fat and models a dress or walks the catwalk.   The problem with the thinness of models was not that a model was 'genetically thin', or that they had a 'thin body type'. Even now, thin models are still in high demand. The criticism of 'thin' models is of the excessively thin ones, particularly in the 2000s.   They were *anorexic*. They had a serious mental health condition that has the single highest mortality rate, publicly, and rather than being encouraged to seek mental health support, they were being put on a catwalk and made to wear high fashion clothes as part of an ensemble of luxury. It was repeatedly leaked to the press about diets such as the cotton ball diet, eating nothing but cabbage soup or ice, and exercising excessively to get down to weights that were genuinely unsafe for their heights and ages. They stopped having periods, they were physically unwell, and the body type was *glorified*. It was shown as an aspirational goal , and designers made clothing that showed off their bodies in this condition. Celebrities began to appear in similar condition, and pop culture began to publicly espouse such dangerous trends and encourage a fixation on weight as being synonymous with health.   It was not that they had a thin body or even that it was very thin that was the most problematic part. It was the way that it was glorified, highlighted, and effectively 'sold' as a lifestyle that made it a toxic and dangerous example to set for young people.   The same is not happening with fat bodies. Encouraging people to love themselves and to express happiness in their own body is not saying, "being fat is the best! It's the single greatest gift to humanity and we should all become extra fat!" Unhappy, stressed people who hate their own bodies do not want to engage in changing long held habits, take up radical life changes, or investigate their mental blocks when it comes to achieving weight loss.	1643233481.0	hucpelx	t3_sdfyt7	t1_hucj7h8	/r/changemyview/comments/sdfyt7/cmv_if_we_have_moved_away_from_using_thin_models/hucpelx/

1a0bbz3n	The term "best person for the job" is not an objective quality. People have all sorts of biases for which that even exists. They will often code "best person for the job" as  white/male qualities, which is why white men tend to get the jobs. [Which may explain exactly why 95% of all supreme court justices have been white men](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/95-percent-of-supreme-court-justices-have-been-white-men.html). So if there are a bunch of qualified people, *why not* give to someone who has never been represented?

iy6j4pk7	> The questions I asked are very straight-forward, and you're still not answering them. Your view hinges on the idea that candidates for the Supreme Court should be picked because they are the "best', not because of their sex or race. All I want to know is, how do you think we should decide who is the best Supreme Court candidate? "Not based on race" is not an answer. I'm asking what criteria we should use, not what criteria we shouldn't.  I am saying that I am not qualified to determine the criteria that make someone a good supreme court justice.  I also couldn't tell you what would make someone a good corporate attorney but I can at least say that how qualified someone is should not be determined by their race or gender.  >And you ignored this part, so I'll ask you again: Do you think all the current sitting justices were picked because they were the absolute best, yes or no?

bb478	I agree the act itself is racial in effect, but the motives from whence it comes aren't - by definition - racist, or even prejudiced.  **However**: I think it's fair to critique his valuation of "what is best".  I'm not sure OP is correct in calling it racist - but misguided or morally over-simplistic may be more accurate.  My take is that we should be concerned with a wealth of perspectives leading to better outcomes.  We acknowledge that individuals of different life experiences and identities tend to also have different perspectives.  Setting goals around diversifying our perspectives is vital to success and acceptance of a program, an institution, or a nation.  "Quotas" to me are the simplest path, but I feel they're the least equitable in that they define *a priori* which perspectives are more important than others or which identities will provide those perspectives.  **OP brings up a great point:** why does a Black individual's perspective take precedence over an Asian individual's perspective on the court?  The justification of "there's more black people" seems shaky at best.  Both minorities make up a *considerable* percentage of the US population and both have a history of under-representation and oppression.	1643240247.0	hud71t3	t3_sdg32u	t1_hucn24r	/r/changemyview/comments/sdg32u/cmv_its_racist_and_sexist_that_biden_said_he/hud71t3/

Would you prefer your time to become more valuable in the future? Or less valuable?  “I don't really give a shit about weird philosophy with regards to economic arguments. What will make a stronger economy. The answer has been found. It's slight deflation.”   Starting with this I am assuming you meant inflation rather than deflation… but it’s far from weird philosophy with regard to economics.  “I’ve given examples of this not being true in every current economy under the sun and yet you still deny it.  You haven't though.”  Moore’s law  “Debt is a problem for any economy debt is bad debt is terrible? How is debt not bad?  Holy shit. Your understanding of economics is pathetic. No, all debt is not bad.

This is inarguable as we can see it in the data since as long as the US has been recording the data. Interest rates go down home prices go up and Vice versa.  Any evidence for this? Because interests rates having some effect on house prices is not evidence that loans are the reason houses became more expensive.”  You clearly either don’t know the formula for a loan or you are trolling me at this point rather than actually learning something so this is probably the last reply I make. If the interest rate decreases it reduces the overall cost of the loan for the consumer which results in their money being used to pay for more house as the bank is taking a lower cut.  https://acting-man.com/blog/media/2015/05/3-30-year-fixed-rate.png  “Specifically with regard to homes the reason they go up is because everyone has more purchasing power due to the decrease in rates last month alone consumer interest rates saw a 50% jump from like 2.7 to 3.6 as the consumer rates continue to increase eventually the market will hit a tipping point and begin the domino effect.

h89qte64	Ok, you’re mostly right. But you’re a little off on some things. Weight. Aside from race rifles that were specifically built from the ground up to be light, I’ve never encountered an AR that weighed 3.5 pounds. Even on its own. For an off the shelf rifle, try more like 5. And that’s pushing it.  Accuracy. An AR isn’t going to give you any significant edge in accuracy, at least not enough to matter. The only exception to that would be a purpose built PRS gun. A 1 MOA rifle isn’t all that impressive. With Russian steel cased ammo, I can hit a 10x12 target at 300 yards using a norinco mak 90 all day long. And that’s an AK using irons. So while you’re correct, your accuracy argument can apply to almost any modern rifle that has been assembled properly. There aren’t too many exceptions.  Accessories. This goes back to the weight argument in the end. Most guys I know who use an AR to hunt run an LPVO, which is going to be heavier than a red dot. They’re usually going to be running heavier projectiles as well, 77 grain over 55 or 62. That adds up. So a loaded 16 inch gun with a sling and an LPVO, you’re probably coming in around 7 pounds. Now add a bipod or monopod, maybe an offset red dot in addition to an LPVO. Then if you’re running an IR illuminator, you’re also going to be running an IR laser. In addition to your pressure pad setup and extra batteries. Ounces equal pounds, remember? By the end of it, your rifle will be slightly north of 10 pounds. Ask me how I know.  In short, you’re right. But you arguments apply to more than just an AR.	1643320967.0	huhytze	t3_se9958	t3_se9958	/r/changemyview/comments/se9958/cmv_an_ar15_can_make_an_excellent_hunting_rifle/huhytze/

All I would have to do to defeat Starfleet was to load up civilian ships with explosives and ram them into Starfleet ships. Or install massive single shot weapons in them, or make Q ships, or protect my fleet with a wall of ships full of hostages.  People who live by absolutes are the easiest to work around. In a real life scenario that whole mantra of never hurt civilians even if we have to die for it would end after the very first war or the alliance would simply of been wiped off the map. Its a world expecting shining knights on horseback proclaiming intent on the battle field. When A good commander would simply shoot the fool when he left himself exposed.

h89qte64	I wouldn’t refer to either one of those as an off the shelf rifle. They’re special to say the least. But they are factory rifles in the end so I’ll give you that one. With that being said, the OIP is a bit of a unicorn. And I don’t think the ENYO is made anymore. I thought that company just sold the parts now. I’ve never seen either one in the wild. I’d be surprised to find one on a shelf.  I said 1 MOA isn’t impressive because it’s not hard to find a 1 MOA rifle. Is it enough to get a clean kill? Yes. But there are plenty of rifles that can meet that standard, so I didn’t see that as an argument.  And you mentioned the idea of being able to attach all of these things to help with a hunt, but then you say a simple setup to run with is just an optic. They’re both valid in my opinion, but those points conflict with each other. If you go with one, it negates the other is what I’m saying.  But yes, that’s my point. You said an AR can make an excellent hunting rifle, I 100% agree. But none of the reasons you gave are exclusive to the AR, with the only potential exception being the weight.	1643323011.0	hui46d0	t3_se9958	t1_huhzwfq	/r/changemyview/comments/se9958/cmv_an_ar15_can_make_an_excellent_hunting_rifle/hui46d0/
jnypl0w	I am a mod. I think you're looking at one problem created by the current system, and missing the reason that system is in place to begin with.   Moderating an internet forum is unpleasant. It is a form of unpaid labor. It can also be rather easy to do badly, depending on the situation. You need to have a level head, and you need to care about the community you're moderating.  If moderators were elected, you would just end up with bad moderators. It's not like a political office. There is technically a little power that goes with it, but mostly it just consists of the application of rules.   Mods are janitors, basically.  Running with the "janitor" thing: Suppose your office needed someone to do janitorial work for free (because you couldn't pay for a janitor). If you elected someone from your office to do the janitorial work for no pay, it would not work out. You need a very particular kind of person to take a role like that. You would need someone who, for whatever reason, cares about the office enough to clean it for no monetary reward.

But the problem of topics that are strictly about looks matter is that they don't in terms of dating success.   Do you think that women cannot be racist or problematic? Like first you are assuming people read entire profiles and not just swipe right/like a profile based on a pic.   You also are acting like people aren't aware that OLD puts an emphasis on looks. But posts about how looks matter in the end just spins the tires on increasing matches. I mean while there's things you can do to improve how you look, some of them require time and effort so it's not instant. And that doesn't help confidence and it assumes an external fix is needed when it could be internal.   Plenty of pretty average/good looking dudes don't have good personalities and have terrible dating profiles.   I just am trying to understand your view bc it just comes off as like conventionally hot people get more attention despite any red flags	1643328873.0	huiiku4	t3_se3vxq	t3_se3vxq	/r/changemyview/comments/se3vxq/cmv_theres_not_a_single_written_turnoff_on_a_guys/huiiku4/

That license is a privilege.  Technically it would be putting people in danger, semi trucks aren’t small and aren’t exactly easy to maneuver in tight spaces. These truckers want to gridlock an entire downtown area of the capital city. I live in the city and the streets are narrow, and not much in the way of mobility.

8ueldoly	>The Nazi political belief system unique in that its the only political system that actively encourages violence against a class of innocent people. Republican, democratic, capitalist, an socialist all support violence against criminals and violence in war or self defense, but otherwise condemn violence. But Nazi's support violence against racises that they view as inferior.  Normally in that context one replaces "criminal" with "enemy" because once you are in power the term "criminal" becomes meaningless as you can call anything you don't like "criminal" if you're the one making the laws.  Also the Nazis didn't consider the Jews to be innocent, they ran on a narrative that the Jews secretly plotted to murder the German people and so they had to strike first and because of the heinousness of the crime had to show no mercy to the criminal. So combine that with a racist worldview where people are part of the enemy not by the merit of their character or their actions but simply by being born and you got yourself some murderous madness.  So one should indeed be careful with overarching victim narratives in order to justify preemptive violence as this could end up being the same but in reverse. There's also the saying that "If you're nothing but an antifascist you're not an antifascist". Meaning that it's not enough to kill nazis you'd need to have something that you're fighting for, democratic values and humanity that you hold up against this madness.  >But... That applies to modern day america. Transport me back in time to 1940s germany and this is a different story.  Also for historical correctness. The Nazis did NOT come to power in the 40s, but in 1933 and their discrimination against the Jews happened from the start on. In 1939 they started WWII with the invasion of Poland and the Holocaust, so the systematic murder of Jews (not that individuals weren't already murdered before that) started in 1941. But it's pretty safe to say that "elections" weren't really of any significance anymore in the early 1940s.	1643333685.0	huiu1qn	t3_sedasu	t1_huinfa5	/r/changemyview/comments/sedasu/cmv_encouraging_violence_against_nazis_is_wrong/huiu1qn/

be0ez4l3	Maybe you didn’t get my implication of that paragraph. I used ‘prove.’  Relationships in general, are not so black and white. And both parties have a side. Posting something about your ‘toxic ex’ actually proves how toxic the poster actually is.   There’s a difference between exposing someone who is *actually toxic* versus someone who you just couldn’t get on terms with in the relationship. And a lot of the videos I seen, have shown only the bad side of the other person; and not the full context.   Trying to criticise a man for being so called ‘toxic’ while covering up other important information before making an informed judgement, does show that it’s misandrist.   You don’t leave out information unless you’re trying to get confirmation bias.	1643335327.0	huixv73	t3_sdtp1i	t1_hui0lv8	/r/changemyview/comments/sdtp1i/cmv_it_is_logical_to_think_we_live_in_a/huixv73/
be0ez4l3	That’s quite my point actually. People who are outside of the relationship (esp stranger online) wouldn’t be able to effectively tell if someone is actually toxic or not.   So to post media like that, and air out your dirty laundry, or even private conversations, is a huge sign of distrust. Would you be able to trust someone who would leak private messages online just to prove you wrong?   If a guy did the same, then yes, it is misogynistic.   That’s why my earlier point is, you don’t post private messages that only show your side of the story. It’s a very shitty thing to do, and makes the other party looks worse than how they actually are.   Showing full text messages between both parties that actually expose a toxic / abusive person; seems more viable than just posting 1 side of the story to get confirmation bias.   I have no words if you think this is even a moral thing to do by posting private conversations online that probably does more harm than good to the other person (who may or may not be innocent) [emphasis on *may*]	1643336810.0	huj1bd5	t3_sdtp1i	t1_huiz7ru	/r/changemyview/comments/sdtp1i/cmv_it_is_logical_to_think_we_live_in_a/huj1bd5/

As of now, unless you’re President Trump and the Twitter CEO publicly explains the reasoning, any user has zero insight into this process to even begin wondering if the platform is biased.

An enormous change in law and jurisprudence would need to happen. A Twitter or Facebook doesn’t provide the service imagined by that legal understanding at all (like an ISO would).

htnpbfml	The content and the rights implicated are wholly separate from the backend. Let me say firstly there likely is zero justification from say Twitter that this poses a hardship. It’s all automated and digital sitting there for their own review internally. Banning isn’t a trade secret. The algorithm Twitter uses may be, except Congress empowered the FTC to investigate and prevent harmful, unfair, manipulative, and deceptive business practices including internal algorithms.   You can argue any government interest here for those records: the state wants to know the data under its own trade practice laws; the state wants to ensure citizens receive actual customer support advertised; if veterans are implicitly targeted by ban appeal denials because of how their politics align with the class, as an example. There are tons of what are called business records under state and federal laws that are kept for potential audit by a state.   New York is an example where a state defines a technological business record as any *act* in civil procedure. It’s that broad.  The SEC prohibits any “materially misleading”: you can imagine that a Twitter 10-K bragging about X million users gained without accounting for users suspended and banned could be misleading in a public statement that overstates Twitter’s business performance. This is why the SEC and IRS require businesses to keep financial records, meeting records… here’s a famous case you’ve probably heard of, hinging on whether users did or [may](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-140) have been subject to a harm. Another case about a company exaggerating growth in users [eligible](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp24723.pdf) for participation on the platform.   So this isn’t a dictation beyond what any business including these businesses already collect. The content is irrelevant. The reasoning as you can see is broad as to why verifying the user base and how and why users aren’t participating are important to the state.	1641190036.0	hr1i2jq	t3_rut4y6	t1_hr1fo38	/r/changemyview/comments/rut4y6/cmv_the_best_step_to_prevent_online_cancellation/hr1i2jq/
htnpbfml	I actually disagree it works for Reddit, well it works for Reddit, but I’m not a fan of the business model.   Even if we adopt ranking, isn’t it more useful to understand why Twitter thinks the way it does when executing a ban and considering an appeal?  That informs us when tackling big problems like speech and politics.   The Reddit permanent ban appeal form allows two lines of text. Can you convince a Reddit contractor, possibly abroad, of why your post was reasonable in a sentence? Not at all.  So I’d like Reddit and others to take the appeal process seriously, in detail, hopefully shared in some form, because otherwise you’ve lost Gmail access and are angry and think you’re persecuted.	1641191387.0	hr1k8nk	t3_rut4y6	t1_hr1i6ee	/r/changemyview/comments/rut4y6/cmv_the_best_step_to_prevent_online_cancellation/hr1k8nk/
htnpbfml	Interesting example. Absolutely believable.   I’m going to split hairs here. This is illegal behavior previously addressed by the FTC. A [well known case](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/10/devumi-owner-ceo-settle-ftc-charges-they-sold-fake-indicators): a makeup company’s employees posted reviews and ads everywhere while a contractor spammed the product. The FTC reasoning is the protection of e-commerce and halting pollution of market clouding consumer choice.   Ban, reasoning or not, is subservient to public policy as I said in the first of this chain. I’d argue regulators would not expect much reasoning other than illegal use of the platform is prohibited so an appeal is unnecessary.

htnpbfml	Maybe we want to start simpler. How about a “census” survey of America focusing on homeowners with a gun present (legal or illegal). We can begin learning about where guns live, how many, by which population to draft regulations. Adding a registry specifically to ID guns and gun holders jeopardizes the success of any solution below fully outing gun owners. Small, trusted steps to begin the process of lawmaking if necessary. The registry will be incomplete, most likely, so we should also try to get anonymized gun owning metrics.	1641203628.0	hr20unz	t3_ruy0aq	t3_ruy0aq	/r/changemyview/comments/ruy0aq/cmv_there_should_be_a_registry_of_firearms_and/hr20unz/

Presumption is one thing but that 25% 1-19 figure looks suspicious. Assume 1/4 of an influencer’s audience is tweens.   The influence is bombarding a *reasonable, knowledgeable, sophisticated adult* audience with requests to pay the creator.  We can assume all we want, but there are children and yes children with pay accounts, and not in small numbers. I don’t think it’s an overreaction for people to question the motive and method, including parents.

htnpbfml	The war powers resolution is far more specific than simply requiring 48 hours. I’ll say that presidents have protested if WPA applies to them, reflected in my post. But WPA requires approval by congress, a citation to a resolution in existence, or in this case: a state of national emergency like a nuclear attack. Of course the article I belief is that a preemptive nuclear attack without any particular urgency is an act of war subject to WPA approval. A president cannot merely start attacks without some citation to law, as all presidents have since… well for a very long time and especially since gulf of Tonkin.   “I cribbed this summary from the DOD nuclear matters manual 2020 and a senate hearing I believe in 2019, linked somewhere in this thread, it’s really not intended as a commentary on Trump. It’s how the national security council and military brass describe their own roles and the history of it.   That said, it’s very easy to imagine how a White House lawyer could consider a preemptive nuclear attack without any urgency to be an act of war subject to congressional approval. Whereas the examples you cite are allegedly stemmed from the authorization to use force against Al qaeda and its “affiliates” or UN invitation. Nuclear war would be disproportionate and not particularly necessary to conduct operations similar to Libya and Syria, so that’s easier though still difficult to believe as justification.”  Absolutely yes. The UCMJ applies to the chain of command, not the president. You’ll have White House, defense, state, justice lawyers weighing in on legality outside an incredible emergency. The president cannot issue illegal orders through that chain, and that’s what this all intends to mean. That’s the president’s own understanding of how the UCMJ pertains to his own orders as commander.	1642545042.0	ht8m3vq	t3_s6s9fl	t1_ht6vylh	/r/changemyview/comments/s6s9fl/cmv_if_donald_trump_is_president_for_a_second/ht8m3vq/

In whose interest would developing a nuclear deterrent controlled by Taiwan really serve in the region?  Think about it: the US nuclear umbrella covers Taiwan, the only overlap with China, and Japan. There is no need for the US or China to permit Taiwan to possess more WMDs than what it has today. Taiwan and Japan are more closely aligned that any other in the region, and if a nuclear deterrent will benefit both, they already are covered.   Arming Taiwan creates political pressure on Japan to develop its own nuclear deterrent to China, [which it can easily do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_latency). As can South Korea, overlapping with China and North Korea interests, and Australia with similar overlap. This is just nuclear: Philippines is nuclear capable today, and as of [2000](https://irp.fas.org/threat/wmd_state.htm) Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Indonesia possess biological and chemical weapons.

Counterintuitively, it was not the inheritance of a cache of strategic weaponry that was the biggest proliferation opportunity, since at the moment of Soviet dissolution, Ukraine’s strategic armaments were looped into a centralized command and control system, the keys to which remained in Moscow.** Rather, Ukraine’s most important asset was the extent of scientific know-how and military-industrial capacity that contributed to the Soviet nuclear enterprise.

htnpbfml	Your position is of an entirely political nature. While that can be a valid view, it’s not something universally agreed upon by any regional leadership. In other words, placing Taiwan’s interests above others isn’t going to be popular to Americans and Chinese. It’s not even popular in Taiwan. And really, who is going to acknowledge Taiwan as the rightful successor to China with equal sovereign status? What else can we extract from the world for Taiwan: ROC on the security council like 1978?  The reason both Koreas and Japan aren’t nuclear is us. Proliferation can be [caused](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/denuclearization-again-lessons-from-ukraines-decision-to-disarm/) by supply side/capability and demand side/political will. Japan and S. Korea aren’t nuclear because they have extracted [intense security assurances](https://fsi-live.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Sagan_Causesof_NuclearWeaponsProliferation.pdf) from us despite domestic demand.   Taiwan is similar. It gains little to nothing with more damaging weapons. Neither does its benefactor the US. Let’s also be reminded that Taiwan is the tightest tripwire in the region. Why tighten it further and increase the consequences by giving Taiwan or Japan, or whomever, unilateral control and WMD strategy?   No one wants that, including their leadership and ours. This Taiwan superpower ideal is a foolish exercise and contrary to *my* interests as an American considering the political power it would give these countries.	1642803584.0	htnrxzv	t3_s9f134	t1_htnpmgk	/r/changemyview/comments/s9f134/cmv_unilateral_nuclear_disarmament_by_any_nuclear/htnrxzv/

I don’t know if that was due to their control structure or because it would take an intense industrial effort. But as I said previously Russia would not have permitted such a program. Neither would the US and UK. Going nuclear unilaterally using junk from Russia missiles and partial designs without any security assurances seems risky to Ukraine, considering what we see today and could imagine in 1994, doesn’t it?

Russian bombs didn’t factor into that decision other than as a political bargaining chip, which the article states is demand side / political will.

htnpbfml	I disagree I moved a goalpost. My only goal, clearly stated, was to dispute that Ukraine could use the “SFSR” warheads. Obviously, they couldn’t, as you later said.   I agree. They made the best decision they could. Ukraine became a free country, leaning toward the west, with full relations with UK and US and recognition by Russia. What’s interesting is that arguably the US and UK are “abiding” in quotes by the letter of the agreement. They aren’t obliged to defend Ukraine in the sense of boots on the ground, but to defend Ukraine generally.   I think that speaks to Ukraine’s bargaining position in 1993: it was the 3rd largest nuclear power, but with useless nuclear control and useful potential industrial and academic knowledge to fix that problem, while also being a neighbor of the central Soviet, imposing power. It did the best it could to extract what it could from the superpowers it needed to exist and prosper.	1642807873.0	hto35jz	t3_s9f134	t1_hto1kfo	/r/changemyview/comments/s9f134/cmv_unilateral_nuclear_disarmament_by_any_nuclear/hto35jz/

3s4ve8nm	>I have two thoughts on this. One, there are a lot of people that get to be 60, 70, and older that say legitimately stupid and ignorant things.  True. But unless their outright idiots who have never been able to care for themselves or function properly in society, almost always there's something you can learn from them. I've met people of all ages, of all different backgrounds, and they all say legit stupid and ignorant things. But often times the people who are in their senior years have been through and seen first hand things I never will have.   > Secondly, life experience is anecdotal. Someone can easily go their whole life and believe certain things that have no statistical or scientific support, especially considering confirmation bias and other biases.  True again. But you have similar problems with bias and flawed methodologies that occur in academic research and studies.   For example, I know first hand that gangs have spread exponentially throughout the United States since the late '80s, and I noticed that this coincided with gang culture  getting pushed heavy in mainstream entertainment, starting with the Sean Penn movie *Colors* (1987) and gangsta rap of the late '80s/early '90s. Not the sole contributing factor, but definitely *a* contributing factor, and a strong one at that. People online will argue with me, claiming that crime actually starting going down overall across the country in the early 90s, so therefore, Hollywood and gangsta rap had no influence, and there's no proof that gangs grew during this time period. This just isn't true.   >I think "experience", in a general sense, can be important but it depends how and on what. I don't hold life experience in as high regard as you seem to knowing the faults that people have even late into their age.  No one can be well-informed about everything. I think there's a legit problem when people are in retirement age, not leaving the house, and are relying solely on Fox News or MSNBC to know what's going on. They can be in a bubble. But again, unless they lived an entirely sheltered life, they're more likely to have experienced things that I haven't. They're going to have unique insight into some things that I don't.  Other cultures seem to have respect for their elders and the wisdom and experience they've acquired. In American culture, we're very ageist. What was it in the '60s, "Don't trust anyone over 30?"

ggw5fsyd	why is context necessary when in almost all the situations, i know what those words mean. in most social  contexts, the switch isn't necessary because the switch doesn't exist.  let me explain - here, we only encounter hijras on certain occasions/festivals or in Trains where they beg for money. while i am an advocate for providing the community with education and job opportunity (and thankfully some work is happening in that direction) so that they don't have to resort to begging or worse, prostitution, in the same vein...we use the linguistic terms that are analogous to they/them and not he or she.  the context only comes into play if you decouple sex and gender, and that doesn't happen here. Hijras are always regarded as someone in between, hence the third gender  to accomodate them.	1642856916.0	htqm1ql	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htql2bj	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqm1ql/
ggw5fsyd	there isn't a contradiction if you take it in the context on gender debate. if you say that a trans woman is a woman because she's a social woman, then that characterization doesn't exist. that's why we don't refer to hijras as narr or nari but a third catagory that's somewhere in between. if the gender debate is to applied on that, you'll essentially be saying that Indians start believing that a hijra is a nari, a samajik( social) nari. it simply isn't the case.   there's a difference between hoping something catches on and forcing something on larger society against their will.   it's a very simple analysis imo. If you're going to ask general society whether they believe in aiding hijra community so that they get more opportunities, then i believe a majority will be in favour. this is the same case when people cite that a majority in UK/US support trans rights.  but when you take that conversation and ask cis men/women to consider dating trans women/men (underpinning being heterosexuality) or else you're a bigot, a lot of those supportive people won't consider it as worthy.q	1642857520.0	htqn23e	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqkikq	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqn23e/
ggw5fsyd	i haven't decoupled sex at all. imo, there are no gendered brains nor are there gendered souls. social rules can be fluid because they've always been the case in my society.    We've had a history of men dominating fields that are considered traditional female social roles and vice versa. our mythology also says that men and women can be as feminine or masculine as they want but that doesn't change their biology.	1642857811.0	htqnku9	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqme2n	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqnku9/
ggw5fsyd	no, i didn't. let me clarify again...the sex binary and gender binary are so interlinked that there are only two words to define them narr/nari.   What's defined as traditionally masculine or traditionally feminine is simply based on how many members of a particular sex/gender are participating in it and if there's a social or biological advantage for such (see the concept of "cost of sex" in evolution).  the hijras aren't considered narr or nari, they don't impact the narr and nari binary. historically, hijra community are also provided same social flexibility of choosing gender roles.  to accomodate hijras, the decoupling never occurred. there's no proof for such in either mythology or written and spoken history.	1642858350.0	htqoj9x	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqno22	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqoj9x/
ggw5fsyd	why do you require decoupling if the same social flexibility is provided across the groups. if a certain group is historically poor and there are certain stigmas attached because there's little interaction, then isn't it better to aid the individuals of said group in gaining some wealth and then let them fight their own battles.  instead of that, whole energy is spent on fighting people who hold some stereotypical views that are harmless and by throwing labels at them, you start alienating potential allies from a majority.  here's a personal example - as part of college excursion, i went to Koovagam (it holds the largest congregation of trans people in the world in April/May). I was able to get my insights on what the community wants and then was able to do some good with the help of an NGO.  but if you ask me today to be a trans activist, after seeing how toxic the TRAs become on social media...I don't think I'll even try and go back to that same NGO and aid the cause	1642859340.0	htqqdsp	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqp3lz	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqqdsp/
ggw5fsyd	Hijras are Trans. The largest congregation of Trans people happen in India at Koovagam and guess what, Hijras are there.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koovagam   sure, the intersex condition does shift the distribution from binary to bimodal but that still doesn't add anything to the Trans cause, unless one claims that all trans people are intersex. afaik, they aren't so bringing up intersex in a gender debate is moot point.   i mean isn't that what what i am asking? if someone is claiming to being born in the wrong body, then what entity is exactly born because the body is certainly a biological reality.    Some people definitely believe that earth is flat but they're not part of a community that believes earth is a spherical ball based on evidence. they're two mutually exclusive groups. When you say that some trans people and activists put up that argument of soul, it's still a part of that group making the argument. trans people who make the soul argument aren't mutually exclusive of general trans community.  i will however award you a delta because my post was under the assumption that all or at least most trans people are putting that argument up. ∆   i mean isn't it clear? gender ideology is an ideology that says TWAW and TMAM by providing circular definition of man and woman, and call everyone who doesn't believe in this as hateful bigot.  if an ideological position is established (TWAW, TMAM) and then people are attacked for not accepting that ideolgue, then that makes the position an ideology.   1. on surface, equal rights which is a noble goal imo. it gets muddled really fast when you start defining those rights in different conditions (say the sports debate or prison debate).  2. 6 months ago, i would've said dysphoria causes it but i don't even know anymore. your side (considering you're a trans activist) is trying to convince me that a person can still be trans without dysphoria when your initial lure was appeal to kindness for dysphoria.	1642860589.0	htqst7f	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqoamm	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqst7f/
ggw5fsyd	according to me people of same sex are same gender with some experiencing a condition called gender dysphoria.   just because there's a mental condition, that doesn't mean a decoupling for larger society is needed.  Hijras take up the attire that's mostly worn by women (nari) in India but that doesn't mean they're a naari.  isn't that the whole point? if you're suggesting that i buy into the notion of TWAW because they're social women cause they present socially as women, then pointing to the hijras (who are trans) is basically an self goal.	1642861021.0	htqtnza	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqqpz8	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htqtnza/
ggw5fsyd	hijras are what you call trans women in west mate. they're born men, with male genitals but they live aspects of their life as naari (wearing female attire for most part).  no, what i am saying is that in order to accept the social definition of woman, we first have to establish that there's a social and biological distinction. in India, there's none and that why narr/nari means both male and man and nari means both female and women. Hijras aren't called Naari because they're not naari biologically and there no decoupling of sex and gender in India   yes, we have third gender and hijras fall in that category but hijras are considered something in between a narr and nari.	1642861513.0	htquo1n	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqs63l	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htquo1n/

They're basically homosexual  men and it's been painted in a few books where men having sex with another effimate man. Homesexuality wasn't looked down upon in Medival India (i am using Medival frame because the word Kothi originates from Punjabi and partly from Urdu and kothas came to be in Medival India).  i mean, the major difference is that kothis don't really stay in a group, Hijras do.  there's a term called Kotha in Hindi which translates to a place where men go to enjoy dance and engage in sexual activity with the perfomer (tawayaf in Urdu)  kothis generally take the roles of a background singer/dancer or even instrument player.	1642869272.0	htrcivo	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqvax5	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htrcivo/

3s4ve8nm	>You now might think "without suffering there is no joy" or "These are caused by the laws of the universe", well if God is all-powerful then I could make it so that we couldn't suffer, but only feel joy, if he can't then he is not all-powerful, he can make the world work beyond the laws of the universe, not make any predators exist and when too much vegetation is consumed just make the animals not want to breed, their population goes down and the grass grows back, then let them want to breed again, or just let them breed so little that they don't overpopulate and there is no problem anymore.  All this is based on the assumption that a mere human could have the same knowledge and comprehension as that of God who has always existed, is all-knowing, and all-powerful. If God does exist, it would be akin to trying to get an ant to comprehend the actions and thoughts of a human being, and even then the comparison only scratches the surface since both ants and human beings are pretty close together, like specks of dust in the overall universe.  As children, we don't always understand the rules and teachings that are parents set up for us, and we get upset when they give us consequences or punish us. We can't understand why because we're so young, but only know enough that if continue to to x, we'll get punished with y, so we're inclined to stop doing it. But as child we think, *why can't they just give me what I want? They have the ability? Why are they so mean? Why can't the world just give me what I want?*  As you stated in your OP, people would argue that it's because you can't have or understand joy without pain. And you're response is, why not just erase pain and hardship completely if one were to have the ability, in this case, God.  Well, if that's the case, if there's no struggle, no variation in  life, just an infinite existence of joy, how much difference is that from not existing at all? Wouldn't non-existence be just as preferable? There would be no chance that God should suddenly change His mind and suddenly give all of humanity a never-ending existence of pain. Why should God bother creating in the first place if He's just going to create one thing (man), and have it just experience one single emotion (joy) for all existence, without end?	1642871199.0	htrhg1j	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrhg1j/
3s4ve8nm	If gender is just a social construct, completely separate from sex, why continue with it at all? If you're born a biological man or woman, then why not just accept the biological reality of that, but do and wear whatever you like (within legal and moral reason)? Wear a dress as a man, high heels and make up, change your name even, but if gender is just a social construct, what's the point of referring to yourself as something other than what you are biologically?  What is a woman? *A woman is someone who identifies as a woman.*  That doesn't seem to be a very good definition or standard to go by.  And if there are multiple or infinite amount of genders, what is the purpose of that, and how beneficial is it for people to create their own pronouns and expect people to follow them?  *I don't feel like a man.*  What is a man?  *A man is anyone who identifies as a man. A man can live and look "traditionally" masculine, or he can carry himself in a feminine way, wearing make up, dresses, high heels, and even undergo surgery to appear more feminine (breasts implants, electrolysis, etc) but if he identifies as a man, then he's still a man.*  So how it that you don't feel like a man, if a man can be anything?	1642871868.0	htrj5xp	t3_sa4hu1	t3_sa4hu1	/r/changemyview/comments/sa4hu1/cmv_there_are_not_only_two_genders/htrj5xp/
ggw5fsyd	i never argued against them being an old and/stable phenomenon. our texts describe them since dawn of civilization.  sure, but intersex people don't really add anything to the debate, no matter how someone shoehorn it in. my background is in evolutionary biology and a particular topic of interest back in my undergrad was of this woman with an XY genetic makeup but a female body. through research, it was concluded that her Y chromosome wasn't functioning and hence the X chromosome took over. it was an anamoly, a phenomenon so rare that it can define nothing except that in one in a million cases, we might have a masked/dysfunction SRY gene on Y chromosome. it doesn't change anything because her case was a faliure of downward expression of a gene.  to put a parallel, think of an assembly line of cars. out of a million cars, one was assembled in a way that it had an engine missing. what would you conclude from that? any reasonable conclusion would be that there was a faliure in the process of making that car. what trans debate tries to conclude in this analogy is that because the assembly line created it, then it must be a car and that the system was designed to produce it.    i was trying to counter your flat earth theory example but seems like it was lost in transition.   and that's precisely the case why this debate is so frustrating. you can agree with one set of people by listening to their reasoning and incomes this other group that just makes it stupid. it becomes a whole lot of motte and Bailey and let me show how.   you tried convincing me that because trans people have gender dysphoria and me saying their preferred pronouns help that. i was convinced but then came this other groups that said one doesn't need to have dysphoria to be trans, they just need to self Id a gender. It breaks your whole premise on which you convinced me to change my language to accomodate a person with dysphoria.    I did demonstrate the ideology precisely and clearly imo. let me spell it out for you in much clearer terms "the ideology is accepting someone for who they claim they are even if your senses are giving you different data". it's suggesting that my senses are lying to me. to accept anyone without dysphoria as a woman and to treat them as such, when my eyes are telling me otherwise is literally a mocking my sanity.   I mean don't you find it frustrating that once you cave into demands of someone because they appealed to your kindness, they start making up more and more nonsense and the moment you challenge it, you become a bigot.   how can I even begin to fight for a community that initially appealed to my courtesy and kindness by displaying horrible conditions like dysphoria and once i was onboard, they told me that dysphoria is not needed to be trans. like WTF.	1642872518.0	htrkuir	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htqxjzn	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htrkuir/

If there doesn't need to be a physical or mental difference, all you're asking from me is to be a part of make believe clown reality.   >n what way exactly? Like actually explain how any part of my reasoning concludes that.  with gender identity being a protected category and you suggesting that either i play into fantasies of others or there can be legal and social ramifications (losing a job et al), you're literally forcing an ideology upon me. i mean it's similar to being kidnapped and the kidnapper tells you that hey, you are free to run away....I'll only pull the trigger if you tried to though.  in that scenario, yes technically i have a choice but practically... i don't have a choice.   if i don't believe that someone is a woman when my eyes tell me otherwise, and you force me to either treat them as woman or get fired and possibly go to jail( let's not even go to social shaming where it seems like not accepting TWAW is a bigger crime than rape and murder), then yes....my analogy fits perfectly.	1642873198.0	htrmm2o	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htrfghe	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htrmm2o/

ggw5fsyd	yes, a hijra isn't a man because they clearly convey it( or atleast try to convey it) through their mannerisms and attire. they however don't become women and that's why the categorisation of Third Gender but fair enough.  i mean the primary debate is whether TWAW and TMAM because it's this baseline that everyone builds upon, so i don't really understand you position of "nothing to do with what a woman or man is ( i mean we know according to Plato it's a featherless biped).	1642874245.0	htrp9m7	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htro2hs	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htrp9m7/

ggw5fsyd	and yet, those deviations aren't really functional and trying to define them as different outcomes mean that you have to believe that a car without an engine is a car. If any company tries to rationalise that nonsense and to then try to sell an engine less car as a different outcome, they'll be mocked and rightly so.   I mean you did say you're a trans activist, and you clearly don't identify with the crazier narrative...hence i rationalised the whole trans activists because support for  folks with dysphoria. what exactly is your stance then and what do you support that makes you a trans activist.   how is it different than what i previously stated. i first stated that the ideology is TWAW and TMAM. one can't make that claim without accepting and rationalising that claim themselves. One who doesn't accept that claim automatically is labelled a bigot.  Those aren't mutually exclusive or different definitions, mere explanation of how the whole premise of that ideology works.   i mean they're mocking my sanity because either i accept their premise against my own sanity and sing the same tune. if i challenge it, all that needs to be done is call me a bigot and then whole social coercion can begin.   trans folks are appealing to my kindness and courtesy. i mean isn't that apparent when i say that I'll happily entertain a different set of pronouns for someone if they ask me to when my eyes tell me otherwise. the underlying reason for doing is because i can sympathize with pain that can manifest through dysphoria.   it becomes a mockery when those same people suggest to me that to be trans, you don't even need dysphoria. that's when i feel like my ability to sympathize with someone else's suffering is being mocked.  i mean in a way, it seems to be the case. I think it has to do with the lack of gatekeeping where the community or atleast a majority in the community is willing to entertain batshit crazy ideas in the name of acceptance. that's why when you hear community supporting stuff like clowngender or bunnygender...it again feels like a mockery of sanity.   one more gripe i have is with the whole "you don't have understand it to support it". i mean what the hell is that and why is the community even asking me to accept and support something that i simply can't wrap my head around.  i can literally take this whole narrative to absurdity. I don't really understand why some nutjobs want to blow themselves up via a bomb, but if i should accept with understanding....then should i support that nutjob too.  isn't the whole understanding part important because if you can't understand something, how can you ascertain it's negatives and positives.	1642877283.0	htrx4gl	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htrqxw7	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htrx4gl/

ggw5fsyd	yours is a rather odd position but I'll bite.  >I will say, you clearly have read a decent amount on this issue and have identified a key point that many on either side don't recognize, that most of this debate is linguistic.   The fundamental question is what defines a man or a woman? Since this is a linguistic debate, the case for accepting trans identities is not a matter of scientific fact but of what definitions are the most useful to us and bring about the best outcomes through their adoption (Keep in mind though, commonly used language and definitions do not care about our debate. They are merely descriptive, the definition is simply whatever people use that word to mean).    that's the fundamental issue that you've realised and yet missed completely. the initial gripe i have with what's defined as man and woman through trans debate lens is absolutely meaningless circular definition.  it's dilution to a point where it's rendered meaningless. if i define acid as a solution with excess protons and then keep on diluting it to a point where that protons part is redundant, then even water will be acid, this rendering the definition completely meaningless. that's what you essentially do when you say "a man/woman is someone who says they're a man/woman".    >You seem to believe that the answer is that sex and gender are one and the same and therefore man means XY and male secondary sex characteristics and woman means XX and female secondary sex characteristics.   Your issue is that you are pretending that gender does not exist and simply substitute in the definition for "sex". Regardless of your choice of definition, the concept behind gender is indisputable: there exists a set of outward presentations, mannerisms, modes of speech, etc. that (in my culture) traditionally align along the spectrum of masculinity and femininity.   It is NOT the same as sex. When you perceive someone you meet as a man or woman, you did not sequence their DNA or feel their crotch. You do not KNOW their sex, you are assuming based on their gender presentation. However close sex and gender usually correlate, you cannot deny that they are distinct. You have almost certainly met several people whose sex did not match the gender you assumed of them and never realized.    I mean for an overwhelming majority of humans, it is the same thing and pretending otherwise is foolish. I mean masculinity and femininity has got nothing to do with being a man or woman. A man can adopt and be as feminine as he wants in a given situation and it still won't change him into a woman and vice versa. Masculinity and Femininity are expressions.   yeah, and those mannerisms, modes of speech et al grew organically because they aided the biological reality.  I mean i would suggest you to read upon the cost of sex as a concept in evolutionary biology and how that impacted social structures in anthropology. Those mannerisms didn't happen because some dudes sat in a bar and decided upon them, they developed through time.   > It is NOT the same as sex. When you perceive someone you meet as a man or woman, you did not sequence their DNA or feel their crotch. You do not KNOW their sex, you are assuming based on their gender presentation. However close sex and gender usually correlate, you cannot deny that they are distinct. You have almost certainly met several people whose sex did not match the gender you assumed of them and never realized.   Additionally, you must agree that what characteristics are associated with each gender and which we assign to particular people is entirely a choice we as a society make and teach to the next generations. It is not a set law of the universe.   This newest generation, at least in the west, is making a choice to radically change how we express and assign gender. We have recognized how limiting traditional modes of gender expression are and how damaging it is to many people when they are assigned a gender at birth and forced to conform to that social role. It's important to remember that people didn't choose to be trans or adopt nontraditional gender presentation because of this linguistic debate. People are and have been doing this for centuries with or without the language to describe it. We have chosen to definitionally decouple sex and gender completely because this confers more utility in describing human behavior (which is the entire purpose of this language) and because it makes people happier.   So we have established:  1. Sex and gender are distinct concepts.  2. The purpose of language is to describe the world around us.  3. Our choice of definitions should be those which confer the greatest utility.   i mean i can guess a lot based on secondary sexual characteristics that can't really be mimicked easily. again, you're under the assumption that those mannerisms were some plot but in reality, it was a natural progression.   you can't easily mimick an Adam's apple, you can't easily mimick a male walk( because there's a certain thing that hangs), you can't fake breasts without going under the knife.   I mean sure, people sometimes think i am a woman if they're hearing my voice as it's a sharp voice but it doesn't send me into an existential crisis is someone over the phone misgenders me.   and limiting to whom exactly? you're trying to paint a picture that a majority was oppressed under the previous   linking of sex and gender and that can't be further from truth.  and no, you haven't established anything. you only repeated stale arguments that are nothing but gibberish.  1. sure, but are heavily linked.  2. sure, but it's purpose is also to keep things simple and not overcomplicate things.  3. sure, but a spectrum of identities doesn't really provide  any utility. it's only used by bored individuals to feel special.   >Now I ask you:   Why should anyone use your definition? What utility does it provide us?   You believe that we should essentially be referring to people by a word synonymous with what genitals or chromosomes they possess. Doesn't that sound really strange? Among all the people that you interact with day-to-day and perceive/refer to as a man or woman, how often is the morphology of their genitals or their genetic makeup in any way in need of being communicated? I'm going to say never.   Additionally, people are increasingly choosing non-traditional gender expressions and your desire to optically categorize them as penis-havers and non-penis-havers is becoming more and more futile in addition to being useless.   if someone whom I can visually figure out to be a man, then I'll call him a man. if he insists on using she/her pronouns, I'll do it out of courtesy but that's about it. I won't suddenly start believe that the person is a woman just because a certain set of pronouns were asked.   No one is asking you to "believe" that this person possesses ovaries and XX chromosomes, this isn't about beliefs at all. Just adopt a definition of woman that includes all people who identify as a woman.   It is exceedingly rare that someone who publicly identifies as a woman does not make an attempt to present as a woman through hair style, clothing, makeup, speech, etc. Let's say you see someone presenting feminine (wearing a dress, long hair, makeup, heels) but who you are also convinced is biologically male due to their facial structure. These two characteristics are both equally obvious to you. All we ask of you is to primarily consider the former characteristic instead of the latter when assigning their gender.  It's good of you to not misgender them, but holding this outdated and practically useless idea of gender in your head is simply not doing you any good and only serves to position you in a (losing) ideological opposition to people for absolutely no gain.  i mean, my definition provides simplicity and structure.... something that's required to make a stable society. that seems quite a utility to me.   I mean i am not calling them penis havers and vagina bearers, you are. i am calling them man and woman because it simple and has been working for most. if it's not working for someone, then they are the odd ones.  i already stated that i am not willing to adopt circular definitions that doesn't mean or convey anything. i am not going to call my mother a birthing person because some dumb senator in US wants me to.    nope, those characters aren't obvious but you're trying to convince me they are, and i simply am not convinced. if i can visually figure out the person to be male, then they're  a man.   also, it serves me no real purpose to consider feminine presentation over male secondary sexual characters. If i am in a social setting, say a blind date and i can see that the individual infront of me is a man who's presenting feminine...then the date ends the moment i make notice of those things.   also, something isn't "outdated" just because you believe it is outdated. as long as those definitions aid me in classifying the world accurately 96+ percent of the times, those definitions are staying.	1642880565.0	hts5fz9	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htr0fg6	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/hts5fz9/

I see no point in it, I don't think it does anything for the greater good. I agree.  Since you're arguing (or other people are arguing) that gender isn't connected to biological sex, and that gender itself is just a social construct with no real root in anything substantial, then it makes sense to refer to each other according to sex. Man/woman, he/she.   >If someone with female sex organs identifies as a man I think that for all intents and purposes they truly are one, it's just that I wish those intents and purposes weren't ingrained into society.

htnpbfml	Wait, you’re qualified to correct this person re: how the legal system works?  Regulations have zilch to do with guilt. Did you read the court case wikipedias? The test for the constitutional right to own a firearm is whether the state has a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly tailored law to address it.   Obviously, it’s an easy argument from a state to a court that there is a governmental interest in checking the background of potential gun owners, and a law that deems some prohibited obtaining the gun within a certain time frame and with the ability to challenge the result is a narrowly construed solution to poor background results.  You’ve got the reasoning flipped how rights work. Everyday you are inconvenienced by regulations. That something in your research is rare or relies on guilt or whatever doesn’t impact what can be regulated by your community. If you don’t believe me, paint your house pink and convert your garage into a second bedroom.  Not many do it, and it’s a inconvenience to be told you can’t do what you want with your property exactly how you wish, but you won’t be able to by local law for good reason.	1642883447.0	htschi6	t3_saa9g2	t1_hts9ru5	/r/changemyview/comments/saa9g2/cmv_the_us_doesnt_have_a_gun_problem_thats/htschi6/

Then close to the end of his presidency he gave out those stimulus checks (that wouldn’t be needed if he didn’t fuck up with covid)    Now biden is president and he has to deal with all of these things caused by covid, For example inflation.   Now when people think biden they aren’t gonna think about the fact that he brought in millions of jobs. Almost weekly. Their gonna think about the fact that under his leadership the country experienced inflation. They’re gonna think about how trump gave them 2’000$ in stimulus and biden only 500$   They’re gonna look outside and see covid cases rising despite his promise of a plan… a plan that was rejected by trumps followers.

ggw5fsyd	i mean i don't know what i'd call it really but i started reading into this debate about 7 months ago, after the Rowling drama.   while i initially leaned and agreed with trans activists, especially around the idea of dysphoria. then i read into how much hate Rowling recieved, especially rape and death threats and how the trans creators handwaived that harrassment as nothing major.  that's when i started to really read into the communities and that's when i found that, atleast on major social platform, the groups are actively condoning and mocking cis people in a manner that if reversed, would be labelled as Transphobia by them.  so call it hypocrisy, making unrealistic demands and outright denying and sometimes even supporting harrassment of women like Rowling....was what turned me away from a cause i was initially supportive of.   as a closing note, it's mostly because of the Rowling situation because her stories formed my childhood and inculcated some values that helped me a lot. Seeing that woman recieve constant rape threats pushed me firmly away from Trans activists.  anyways, thanks for your insights into all of this. have a good day	1642885812.0	htsiak4	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htsfuxl	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htsiak4/

Your telling me that registering a gun, passing a check, anything burdensome to you is telling me that there must be no state interest at all. If that’s what you’re telling me, you’re taking an extreme position. If so, justify it: outweigh the interest (if any) and describe a sufficiently tailors law in your view (if any). Don’t tell us: few people are bad so it’s not worth it, which isn’t how regulations work.

3s4ve8nm	>I'd like to get to a point where gender isn't really a thing used to describe someone's identity and that person just is who they are,   But the thing is that gender, as you're using the term, hasn't, until recently, been used to merely describe how someone "identifies" superficially. It's "this person is a man," or "that person is a woman." It wouldn't matter how effeminate or butch the man or woman looks, they're literally either a man or a woman.  Now it gets a little complicated when we speak of transmen and transwomen who make effort to live and appear as a man or a woman, as you're obviously going to either not know they're trans, or, if they're not passable, appear in a way to signal the sex they want to be associated with.   It's not really common anymore for someone to say, "you're a girl but you like baseball!?!?? But..but..you're a *girl*!  I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of people have an identity beyond being a man or a woman, or else all men would be identical and all women would be identical, down to appearance, personality, interests, opinions, etc. We already take people for who they are. But things get, imo, unnecessarily complicated when you have a man who is born a man, appears as a man, dresses as a man, acts like a man, but says he's a woman. Or we have cases like Rachel Dolezal who is white but insists that she's black or African-American.   >and their biological sex is not really anybody's business, but as long as gender is a thing and someone's identity agrees more with feminine stereotypes then they deserved to be recognized as a woman by society whether or not their biological sex is male.  It would be somebody's business like a doctor's. If you're going to a doctor for the first time, then it's probably be important for that doctor to know if you were born a different sex from the way you appear. Same goes for dating someone.   If someone merely "identifies" as a woman, but makes no effort to look or act like a woman, should society indulge them in having access to the same safe spaces that women have, like women's restroom and locker rooms?   >Well what makes a woman "truly" a woman? It would be odd if you placed biological sex high on the list because that's one of the last things that matter.   I think it would matter considerably in regards to medicine or having children.   >In daily life you meet several women and most the time you don't know what their biological sex is. There's a lot or different variables that make that person a woman, and I don't see why someone biologically male who has all of those characteristics couldn't be a woman.   You said "truly." I consider a transwoman to be a woman (who presents to *some* degree as a woman). I'm not going to intentionally misgender her or discriminate in terms of rights. But "truly" to mean would mean literally, biologically. The definition of woman is that of an "adult female human being."  The definition of female is: "of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes."  So that would be the criteria for truly being a woman.   >Idk, I just think it would be weird to insist that you can't be a man if you don't have a dick etc when you almost never determine someone's gender in the wild based off of whether or not they have a dick, cause you can't see their dick.  We're going off the rails a bit here. By that reasoning I mean...you could argue that it's possible that all the houses I see on the street, with cars parked in the driveway, and mail in the mail-box might not actually be owned, rented, or lived in by anyone since I don't can't see inside the house to determine if anyone's actually in there, nor do I have evidence that anyone owns or pays rent for the house. Yeah, you could argue that, but how reasonable would it be to assume that every house in all these neighborhoods, that *look* occupied, have no one living there at all?  Again, you made mention of a woman who identifies as a man, so therefore, "for all intents and purposes **truly** is a man."  This just isn't the case. Now they might be considered a man by society in terms of social interactions, but "truly" refers to truth and fact. It's not a *fact* that this person is *actually* a man, in the sense that they have no male reproductive organ, they cannot impregnante a woman, they themselves were born on a woman, and so on.   If a woman got married to this person, without knowing they were born a woman, and after years of not being able to conceive, the wife found out her husband was born a woman. Would it be fair to attribute the inability to conceive due to something like low sperm count or the husband being sterile, or would it be more truthful and accurate to attribute it to the fact that, despite the outward appearance and personality, the person beneath is a biological woman?	1642890470.0	htsts98	t3_sa4hu1	t1_htsio03	/r/changemyview/comments/sa4hu1/cmv_there_are_not_only_two_genders/htsts98/

Maybe mere life to an advanced society in a crowded galaxy of life isn’t worth the resources of traveling far and for millennia to a solar system of sparse life.

Maybe they can survive interstellar accelerated travel and [thrive](https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/can-germs-live-in-outer-space) on the surface, or inside the ship. Or in their corpses on an automated trip.   Both civilizations have an obligation to prevent the spread of novel diseases that could destroy each other or any part of the food chain.

3s4ve8nm	>But that's not the order in which it happened. Dresses weren't invented because someone was trying to make something that looked feminine nor are they objectively feminine, we only see them that way because women typically wear them, but women typically wear them because they were arbitrarily decided to be feminine, not because they were objectively feminine and therefore women preferred them.   I don't think women in western culture wore dresses because culture arbitrarily decided that they were feminine. I'd assume that it's because, at one point in time, it was more common for men to be laborers, whereas women stayed in-doors and tended the house and children. If you're riding a horse, or working in a factory or in the field, then it doesn't make much sense to wear a dress, as opposed to pants, which are more durable, can't get caught on anything, and doesn't expose your bare legs or nether regions when doing strenuous physical activity.   Now I suppose robes are pretty much like dresses, and royalty and religious leaders wore them, but that speaks to function as well, since they're not in the habit of doing hard, physical labor.   >That's just a rule we made up. 100 years ago boys wore dresses too and it was completely normal, it's something society arbitrarily decides.  In the 1920s boys wore dresses in the U.S.? I think it would be farther back then that, and I'd assume it was for very small boys, at an age where they're engaging in no more strenuous physical activity than a small girl would, or that an working-age male *wouldn't*.   > So no, I wouldn't say we consider dresses feminine because women typically wear them, I think women wear them because we consider them feminine. That changes things a bit.  I think as time progresses, and there is less separation between the sexes in terms of social interaction and customs, the more we forget about why things like fashion norms exist.   In western culture, (Rome and Greece) make-up was used by prostitutes and rich women. I'm assuming in the case of prostitutes, it's to attract attention from potential male customers while simulating the effect of a flush face and blood-filled lips during love-making to make intent known.   At one point in American culture, excessive make-up was considered being "painted up like a whore," because prostitutes would apply more make-up to separate themselves from the average woman in the street, while also disguising advanced age.   Fast forward today and it's almost a social requirement that women apply a significant amount of make-up to their face just to go to work, rivaling the effect and process of Kabuki actors.	1642903873.0	httpymk	t3_sa4hu1	t1_htsrw1s	/r/changemyview/comments/sa4hu1/cmv_there_are_not_only_two_genders/httpymk/

Then nothing else needs to be answered.

BLM has a specific agenda, fighting police brutality against Black folks in America.  you implied that.  reprehensible according to who? no one's going out there  to attack trans people because they read TERF wars. it's the same bullshit we hear from people about video games. "oh, the video games are reprehensible because they teach violence". i am yet to see someone go out and  torture a person because they did that as Trevor in GTA 5.  again, anything can be described as harrassment when identities are built on circular definitions. we have blasphemy laws here in India and sure, no one has been charged for it for a long time but law still stands. people in past were charged for blasphemy because it's definition is watered down to point of hurt feelings of believers.	1642912416.0	htu9iul	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htsp99e	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htu9iul/

ggw5fsyd	because it's circular and meaningless.  i mean it's frustrating that i have to explain to a chemist why water is used as a standard for pH table and is defined as neutral at 7.  we can go into all those details about how acidic or alkaline water exist but that still accounts for excess of either protons or hydroxide ions. In essence, it always has a significant a measurable value on one side of the scale and it's also the precise reason for distilled water to be a bad conductor of electricity.  Your definitions are circular because they suggest dilution to an infinite value which becomes something like this. baseball is a sport and football is a sport, so baseball is football. that's how ridiculous the definitions of man and woman are according to trans activists.	1642917512.0	htujinx	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htugx97	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htujinx/

Here's an example, in India there are reserved seats for women on public transport and people (including me) tend to leave their seat if they see a woman/old person standing. under your circular definition, it's not communicating the information that will/won't prompt me or anyone else to vacate the seat.  it can be extended to daily social interactions and cause others to walk on eggshells and walking on eggshells is not utility, it's liability. People tend to joke in a certain way when the crowd is all men vs when it's a mixed group or all women. if i apply your circular definition, then i am constantly on eggshells about the whole "I'm offended".  I mean honestly, you wanna go into the dynamic equilibrium at a particular pH and stability of a water molecule to defend a circular definition from sociology?	1642919394.0	htumtpt	t3_s9yy7t	t1_htukv7l	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/htumtpt/

wiwo1	A hypothesis is a possible explanation to some physical phenomenom. I don't think that all hpyothesis are equally valid. When proposing a hypothesis, why do we consider that explanation in the first place? What I mean can be shown with this example:   Today I saw that the ground outside was wet. One possible explanation is that it had rained during night. Why do I propose this explanation? Because I'm being backed up by past experience, so at least I know that it's plausible. Another hypothesis is that someone went all around the city pouring buckets of water on the ground. Does this explain why the ground is wet? Yes. However, why should I believe this claim? It came out of nowhere (compared to somehting based on previous experience) and I have probably no way to check if that's what really happened. For me, this hypothesis is less valid than the first one.  Now, your post. The reason why belief in God is "discriminated" in scientific research is, I believe, for two reasons: 1. Where does the claim that God exists come from? Did someone came up with it out of nowhere? I don't want to create a debate around this, but there are many reasons to be doubtful about religion. At the end of the day, many religions are about faith: you need to believe in it. But I think that such thing it's simply not enough for an explanation to be reasonable. 2. This point is, I think, even more important: Imagine that, for a second, God existed. Now what? How can we prove it? What experiments can we design so that the existence of God can be verified? I think that even many religious people would agree that we cannot simply prove God by experimentation. But if this hypothesis cannot be verified (or disproven), why should we waste our time on it? If it cannot be studied by science, I find perfectly reasonable that scientists "discriminate" about the existence of God.  You talk about multiverses. I will answer the same two questions that I made to the belief that God exists:  1. Where does the claim that multiverses exists come from? 2. Imagine that multiverses existed. How can we prove it?  Regarding point 1: multivererses can refer to many different things. For example, in some models of string theory, the theory predicts that [our universe coexists with many other universes](https://medium.com/predict/string-theory-a-different-kind-of-multiverse-835687c706c). I will more thoroughly explain why this is different from the belief that God exists, but in short, this claim is a prediction made by a theory, not a claim made out of nowhere.  Regarding point 2: One way to prove that this can be the case is to show that the underlying theory which predicts the existence of multiverse is true. [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Phenomenology) that there are proposed ways to check if string theory is correct, but it hasn't been done yet empirically for reasons mentioned in the article.  You might find point 1. unsatisfactoty. Why should you find predictions made by theories to be reasonable? The answer to that question is that this is how many scientific discoveries have been made. It usually goes like this: novel experiments show that the current theory is obsolete. Someone comes up with a new theory, which is able to explain everything that the previous theory could as well as the new experiments (which the old theory couldn't). The new theory also predicts the existence of some stuff, which the scientific community verifies experimentally, and so the new theory becomes accepted.  The theory of gravity which Einstein developed 100 years ago predicted the existence of black holes, which have been shown to exist. It also predicted the existence of gravitational waves. Why did scientists consider the existence of these waves to be a reasonable hypothesis? Because Einstein's model for gravity was so good (it could explain so many things accurately) that it was a safe bet. Indeed, in 2002 [an experiment called LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) began operating, which eventually discovered evidence for the existence of gravitational waves and awarded Rainer Weiss Barry Barish and Kip Thorne the physics Nobel prize in 2017.  I hope that now I've changed the focus on why we should consider multiverses to be more reasonable than the existence of God: there are partial ways to verify if they do exist, it's not just some thought experiment; also, it's a prediction made by a theory. But that begs the question: why trust that theory? As I pointed out before, there is no empirical evidence for string theory, so why is it something reasonable? I think that someone woke up one day and proposed that fundamental particles of the universe are made of strings, we shold consider that as reasonable as the explanation of someone pouring buckets of water instead of simply having rainded.  [I highly encourage you to watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ccXzM3x8A), which makes a compelling argument for string theory. TL;DW: String theory is a consequence of solving a problem in physics, not a cause. That is, there was some open problem in physics that was solved, but upon inspection, that solution implied that the fundamental objects in nature were strings.  Let me recap: 1. Where does the claim that multiverses exists come from? String theory is a possible model for particle physics. It came to be as a result of solving an open problem, so many people believe that this makes a case for string theory. One branch of string theory predicts the existence of multiverses. 2. Imagine that multiverses existed. How can we prove it? As of right now, we don't even know if string theory is correct. But experiments have been proposed to check it's validity.  Even if I don't personally hold the view that multiverses are a thing, I think that it is not comparable to the existence of God: multiverses are not a claim made out of thin air (like the simulation theory that you mention), but rather, a prediction made by a theory which have reasons to be believed, and it's not a thought experiment, since we could verify it through experiments. That's why I think that these two "hypothesis" are not comparable.	1642953551.0	htw4ma7	t3_sam3n2	t3_sam3n2	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/htw4ma7/

That starts reducing the supplier deadweight loss rather than working around tax revenue. Though doing either also reduces agriculture output. I’m not sure how that applies but we can assume less subsidy/more tax, less output, higher production cost, less suppliers, less employment, less land used for housing and industry.

htnpbfml	How can we change your view that the felons “should” have songs about them? Is there some criteria to standardize your view?  Otherwise, as an example, Ruben Carter is the subject of Dylan’s Hurricane. Bob Dylan couldn’t actually send a share of the proceeds to felon Carter while still in prison. He wasn’t released for 11 years after Dylan performed the song, after already being in jail for 8. He was convicted of triple homicide twice.   Carter’s wife divorced him mid-incarceration, assuming she also is owed part of the royalties. Dylan’s doesn’t own the royalties to his music anymore at all.   Carter became a public figure as a boxer, a murderer, a prisoner (Dylan did a concert outside Trenton State Prison), and as an exonerated man. Plus, most states prohibit prisoners from proceeds of their crimes. That’s a logistical and two-strike legal challenge for Carter to overcome to be paid, and he died a few years later. Who should Song Music send the royalties to, his ex-wife from 1983?	1642970337.0	htxbuhx	t3_sb2wlx	t3_sb2wlx	/r/changemyview/comments/sb2wlx/cmv_some_felons_deserve_to_have_songs_written_and/htxbuhx/

htnpbfml	The CIA cites many authorities in its memo, the overarching one being whether the senate appropriately asked for the one document CIA contested as a breach of its executive control of its record auditing. The cia director halted the effort when notified by the project’s legal referral and the FBI refused to prosecute. There wasn’t a lack for authority but facts and political finesse. Wrong, but not made up and certainly rooted in the constitution: can the senate and the CIA both review documents for release when one is legislative with its own goal and one is executive with its own?  They did face senate and public backlash and the small team was punished. The senate received the record for oversight. The CIA expanded access and apologized. The report was released. Is that not constitutional accountability?  The crux of the problem are the specific programs. Off the top of my head: national security letters, business record exemptions, roving wiretaps, five eyes loop hole, the surveillance court rubber stamp (expand friends of court) created by congress and exploited by president, the unrestricted force and emergency authorizations making a lot of this possible. The constitutional challenges are relatively low compared to congress just expressing its own authorities. The president’s expansive powers to use the laws are limited by congress’ laws, not mere oversight.	1642974539.0	htxmxuj	t3_saka0m	t1_htxjhsx	/r/changemyview/comments/saka0m/cmv_the_patriot_act_and_all_its_reauthorizations/htxmxuj/

htnpbfml	Pecan and pumpkin pies are both known by the designation pie, and not by a term specifically for something else. A slab of meat in pastry is a pie, but not like a quiche (unless it too is [surrounded](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/double-crust-onion-quiche/) by pastry), but pumpkin and pecan aren’t pies.   But Julia Childs’ lemon tart recipe is actually a pie, because it’s fully enclosed in pastry, even though she specifically used the word tart, as in the new key lime tarts (not pies) sold in Florida.  Her double pastry lemon tart is more of a pie than a hamantaschen (now a tart) even though the hamantaschen has a small hole on top for filling and the lemon tart (now pie) has no hole on top. That’s so, even though rugelach is a hamantaschen [dough tube](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/515ecaf0e4b0875140cb8775/1543868301965-FKY7KY8T2XGKHOS96CZA/molly-yeh-sprinkle-rugelach-33.jpg) surrounding the filling: a pie more than a tart.   It probably makes more sense to define things as people envision them: beef Wellington isn’t a pie at all unlike grape pie. A cookie isn’t a pie, and a lemon tart isn’t a lemon pie either.

htnpbfml	I think we can’t get any more set than something like this: a [jello](https://www.hy-vee.com/recipes-ideas/recipes/jell-o-easy-patriotic-pie) pie. See [also](https://spaceshipsandlaserbeams.com/no-bake-strawberry-jello-pie/).  With this outlook, we’d now call jello pie jello tart. Instead let’s just look at tart filling.   Let’s take the filling that makes a false pie, like loose fruit with an open top, and add jello to it? Now [this](https://www.tablespoon.com/recipes/retro-jello-strawberry-pie/29c556f2-218d-4e65-acd5-7f9720480245) strawberry pie “firm-ly” becomes a strawberry tart. We can take a pie and miraculously turn it into a tart.    Why did the advertisers lie to us [all](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/delanotooke/83408268/25190/25190_900.jpg) about those ice box pies? If we take [baked Alaska pie](https://everydaypie.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_1686.jpg), also a false pie, it has a set filling, until it melts. The baked Alaska goes from tart to pie because the ice cream is no longer as solid, as soon as it is removed from the freezer, and like the jello strawberry pie filling, may be firm (tart) or loose (pie). Any pie can be made firm or loose, so not a great differentiator.   Back to pecan pie. A pecan pie is a [custard](https://www.dispatch.com/story/lifestyle/food/2014/12/10/runny-pie-likely-due-to/24164009007/) pie. It’s always been [known](https://www.nicholaslodge.com/blog/is-it-time-for-pie-yet) as a pie back to the 1800s when invented. It appears to me that your definition is simply placing a divider between custard-based pastries and not custard-based pastries more so than the envelopment by pastry. Accurate?  Is pecan pie a custard? Yes. Is jello pie a custard? [Yes](https://www.justapinch.com/recipes/dessert/pie/mile-high-lemon-pie-jello-easy.html). Is key lime pie a custard? Yes. Is a cream puff a custard? Yes. Is a pumpkin pie a custard? Yes. Is a jello pudding pie custard? Yes. Is a quiche a custard? Yes. Anything with milk and eggs is a custard, and any set custard people bring up you claim is a tart.   Can an apple pie be a custard? [Yes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/13820/glazed-apple-cream-pie/). Can rhubarb pie be a custard? [Yes](https://www.midwestliving.com/recipe/pies/rhubarb-custard-pie/). Can any recipe you imagine be a custard? Yes. Can any custard be made to firm up or not? Yes. That’s why we use different amounts of things like corn syrup and temperature to make sure pecan pie doesn’t get watery or stay loose.   So that leaves us not with the custard but the double crust. You’ve already seen crust can be a poor definition of a pie or tart. Beef is now a tart and rugelach is a pie. Now maybe you’ve seen whether the filling is firm or not also has little to do with the pie definition. Jello can be a pie, a tart, and a custard or not. Key lime pie can be a pie, a tart, part of a custard, even jello pudding, or not.	1642990361.0	htyqhhy	t3_sb8j11	t1_htyjq8d	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8j11/cmv_to_be_considered_a_pie_it_must_be_fully/htyqhhy/

One is [circumcision](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3663585/), which is probably the most accessible, least expensive, most permanent HIV preventative treatment in Africa.

ggw5fsyd	then how do you explain blasphemy laws applied to insulting Muhammad in any country that follows any form of Sharia. how would you explain cases like Asia Bibi or riots in Bangladesh to defend "Prophet's honour".  if he's not on a pedestal, then why do the 4 schools of Islam regard him as an ideal man. and how exactly would you explain the whole Hajj, which is a central tenet but you have to do it exactly like Muhammad and followers did.  there might be no literal pedestal, but suggesting that Muhammad isn't on a metaphorical pedestal is a laughable proposition.	1643044730.0	hu1iged	t3_sblxcw	t1_hu1gubq	/r/changemyview/comments/sblxcw/cmv_if_the_society_has_decided_that_were_to_pull/hu1iged/
htnpbfml	I understand your angle. If we can focus on modern times: Taiwan in jeopardy causes other nations to be nervous. It’s already resulting in mumbles about Japan rearming itself. If that happens the countries that aren’t as fond of Japan as Taiwan is, Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, Vietnam, are going to assume the American order has failed and will want to arm themselves to meet the threat Taiwan faced.   So if you go back to WWII, what caused rearmament around the world: Germany and Japan building its own might. The U.S. didn’t ignore China and Japan: how could it when it was based out of Philippines and UK out of India, Burma, Malay? I think you’ll study up on WWII, but you’re right that comparisons can be made today. Comparisons like:  * If countries like Japan, Taiwan, S. Korea and Philippines are nuclear capable, what will happen with US nuclear assurance missing? Will these countries use that knowledge to extract even more assurances and materiel from us?  * If countries like Vietnam and Indonesia have biological and chemical weapons, what will happen without US mediation?  * How can we guarantee international freedom of navigation of China asserts a giant zone of control?  * How can we ensure nationalist movements that rise without US presence in India and elsewhere don’t boil into Chinese conflict as they have already?  * How do we protect Taiwan from invasion without actually being there as a barrier?  * How will this affect our intelligence capabilities in Asia?  * Where will Taiwan refugees go and which states will take them when we announce our intentions?  * What will happen to Taiwan’s technology and skilled workforce?  * Why would China refrain from expansion without a giant island in their craw?  * Why would we eliminate a persuasive symbol that could attract Chinese attention in good ways and bad? You can see Taiwan and know they’re “different” than CPP?  * What message would this send to democratizing nations, that democratizing leads to enormous trials and potential loss of your country?  That’s just my rambling. There’s probably a lot more.	1643045799.0	hu1ldio	t3_sbqywx	t1_hu1ht82	/r/changemyview/comments/sbqywx/cmv_taiwan_is_not_worth_igniting_ww3_the_us/hu1ldio/

htnpbfml	Does Ukraine want to join NATO today, or a year ago, or eight years ago?  If Ukraine really wanted NATO to help them (which it has no treaty obligation to do), or even joined NATO to protect Kyiv, Ukraine would need to give up any formal hope of uniting its country.   In other words, joining NATO or preserving this border may be politically untenable to Ukraine, not western politicians and media. Joining NATO means the vision of uniting Donbas and Crimea is over. Those populations in significant majorities want no part of NATO, for one reason. Another reason is NATO involvement freezes the border. They couldn’t fight over it either.   Perhaps they just want weapons instead of some formal intervention, because to do otherwise would be unpopular even confronting an existential threat that likely is not going to end that way.	1643049837.0	hu1wbza	t3_sbsnym	t3_sbsnym	/r/changemyview/comments/sbsnym/cmv_the_eu_nato_and_the_rest_wont_do_anything_of/hu1wbza/

ggw5fsyd	I can't be bothered with this again because you clearly aren't listening. here's my last reply to you because it's just circular at this point.  after the seige of Mecca, Muhammad smashed the pre existing idols himself as a celebration of his victory, so erecting his own statue would be a hypocrisy no one would digest, even in 6th century Arabia.  doesn't change the fact that his revelations almost always favoured him. it doesn't change the fact that Hadith idolise his life and form the freakin law of a Muslim state in form of Sharia.  if they're not idolising him in Hadits, what are they doing exactly? trolling the followers?   yeah, i already gave a delta against that. i only reiterated the point of disclaimer because that the only way you can   drag him through the mud.	1643056562.0	hu2e281	t3_sblxcw	t1_hu2bcrn	/r/changemyview/comments/sblxcw/cmv_if_the_society_has_decided_that_were_to_pull/hu2e281/

This [one](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-how-body-brokers-took-over-county-morgue-20190408-story.html) describes lobbying efforts:  > The relationship wasn’t always so warm. Only a decade before, coroners and medical examiners complained they were shut out as the companies helped rewrite the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. Within three years and with a push from the company’s lobbyists, a version of this new model law had been passed by 46 states.  >The act makes it much easier for body parts to be harvested quickly — even in cases in which coroners believe it interferes with their ability to determine the cause of death.  >Mary Ann Sens, the acting state forensic examiner in North Dakota, had warned state legislators the law “revokes the historic responsibility” of the coroner and gives the procurement companies “equal or greater priority.” Despite the concerns of Sens, North Dakota adopted the proposed law almost verbatim.  >As The Times has reported, dozens of death investigations across the country have been complicated or upended when body parts were harvested before an autopsy…  > But, in convincing people to become donors, companies rarely mention that a growing part of the multibillion-dollar body parts industry is cosmetic surgery — or that unlike organs, tissues are rarely of immediate need. Distributors employ salespeople whose job it is to persuade surgeons to use body parts rather than materials produced in a lab.  Can I opt out partially of the express lane of private donation that apparently impacts coroners’ jobs? Can I opt out partially of harvesting bodies when artificial means exist to do the same thing, allowing even greater profit off of my body?  Don’t get me wrong: I’m a donor myself.

We need to address this.*  Single mothers and a lack of fathers is a problem across racial demographics. The vast majority of all my Latino friends were being raised by single mothers, including myself. I've known many whites being raised by single mothers. When society acknowledges it as a problem in general, people are more inclined to listen to the advice that's being dispensed. When you single out people, it comes across as a personal attack.   *Why are you singling out gangs/drugs/single mothers as our problem? That doesn't happen to whites or Mexicans? They don't deal with these things? Why are you always going on about blacks and the black community? Get your own house in order before you come at us.*  If someone says to me, "you know what your problem is? X, y, and z."  Because of pride, I'm first response would be to deny I had these problems, reject them outright, and then proceed to call out the personal problems of the person telling me *my* suppose problems.  But if they speak about problems that he thinks we *both* have, I'd be more willing to hear him out. Or if he speaks about it as a problem that people have in general, I might be like, "Y'know what, I do that too sometimes.

115zr4a2	My gut reaction: Lack of scientific knowledge from students/teachers to actually UNDERSTAND the litterature that matters. I used research papers as sources for both of my graduation projects for Middle School and High School, went way beyond the learning objectives and content that was expected of a middle/high schooler. Guess what, spent way too much time making my teachers and then the proctor understand the content -\_- I still doubt I can pick up some advanced biotech journal, and actually understand what I'm reading without spending too much effort.   **"Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?"**   You are expecting the researchers to have errorlessly acted in good faith. What about the bad research? what about the stuff clearly set up for one specific answer? How to deem stuff trustworthy, does this conclusion actually matter, is this misleading etc.  **"Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well."**  Coming from a school-system that actually teach this (reading media critically), stats was covered in math (and in HS it was partly covered in some of my economic courses).  **"There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles."**  Got access through the national library, membership = free.  Reading media critically has been covered in almost every course I've had, but how to identify and handle misinformation etc. was primarily covered in a dedicated week.	1644081494.0	hvpwqv0	t3_skko1g	t3_skko1g	/r/changemyview/comments/skko1g/cmv_students_should_be_taught_how_to_read/hvpwqv0/

Race is sometimes used specific to phenotype and is other times used in reference to ethnicity, religion and language.   Thirdly even if using race in the narrow phenotypic sense, there is no such thing as discrete races even though every form in the US seems to think there is.  I think you alluded to this.  If Arabs are a particular race (White or whatever) what about Persians?  If Persians, what about north Indians?

I can understand the agony and pain of those people whose families were massacred in those events.  the generation that saw all that is still mostly alive and they pass down the stories as legacy of what happened to them. If those stories breed resentment towards Pakistanis, then i won't really blame or fault them for it.  think of it like legacy of Slavery...If something that hasn't been relevant as a practice for more 150 years and multiple generation can wedge a divide in US, then Bangladesh's wounds are still fresh.	1644162123.0	hvtlbsp	t3_slunrx	t1_hvt3fmh	/r/changemyview/comments/slunrx/cmv_hating_pakistanis_of_this_generation_based_on/hvtlbsp/
10seol	I'm hardly defending any particular government. I dont know the socioeconomic situation in your country. But printing money and just giving it away is a bad thing. The money has to come from somewhere, or you will experience massive amounts of inflation in the end.   >My govt. Had built 2 hospitals from start to finish, and 3rd had great repairs, for 4 months...  2 hospitals built from the ground up, and a 3rd with with an overhaul in 4 months? That seems ludicrously impossible just from a logistics standpoint point. Much less a construction one. Having worked my share of time in a construction field. Most houses take more than that. A hospital can take years. Are these hospitals incredibly tiny, without proper equipment, or poor building codes? Because the only way I see two hospitals going up in 4 months, even if built concurrently, would be to cut corners everywhere.   I appreciate that you're not happy with the way your government works. I appreciate that you have a sacred view of life, that we should be doing our best to save everyone. But its idealistic, and irrational. We can't save everyone, and trying to do so has lead to exactly what we have. Full hospitals turning away patients desperately in need of life saving medical care, because their beds are full of people who listened to political propaganda for medical advice. People are dying of previously easily treated illness in record numbers because there's no room to treat them. As for my moral compass. You'll have to forgive me. But people who actively destroy their own health for the sake of their political, religious, or social views can go to the bottom of the list. We shouldn't be giving lungs to chronic smokers, livers to alcoholics, or ventilators to antivaxers if someone else who made the best effort to take care of themselves also needs it, and there's a limited supply. And I say that as a smoker. As someone who would likely be passed up for a lung transplant due to my choices if another suitable candidate was an otherwise healthy person. Reality is we do not have unlimited resources. Reality is that many people will die. In order to save as many people as possible. It is necessary to prioritize the people who have a higher chance of survival. Simple as that.

And I stated the system to make it irrelevant is to improve systems to alleviate poverty which is essentially what you said: money. Do we agree up to this point?  I think where we diverge is whether we should use racism to try to make past racism irrelevant. I believe that by continuing to be racist, even if we think it justified, we will only perpetuate the mistakes of the past. There is no amount of racism that will end racism.  By improving our systems for helping alleviate poverty we can minimize the effects of past racism and we gain the added bonus of helping everyone in the past who was wronged.

158w0c	>The diffrence is when racism isn't focused on minorities people get left behind  I am going to assume you mean when the **efforts** aren't focused on minorities, not when racism isn't focused on minorities. Is that correct?     My understanding of your stance is that colorblindness would perhaps reduce current racism, but it would not reduce historical racism which continues to affect people today. Is that also correct?  I believe the way historic racism most harms people today is by affecting wealth. Do we agree if we were able to help remove that inequality in wealth it would go a long way in minimizing the effects of historic racism?  &#x200B;  So we have two options: We can set up racist policies into the law that will help specific groups of people. This would imply that we believe it can be a good thing to treat people differently based on their race. While this may feel justified, can you possibly imagine racism actually being reduced by us actively increasing the amount of racism in our system? Can you really say that it can be a good thing to judge someone by the color of their skin?  Instead, I propose as the alternative option, we seek out solutions that do not perpetuate racism. By not judging individuals by their race we also gain the added benefit of helping ALL people in the past who have been given unfair treatment; racism is not the only thing in history that has lead to inequality.  You're worry then is that people will get left behind, and this is justified. This does not mean we have to continue to be racist, though. It means we need to work on those systems so they do not leave people behind. One example could be universal basic income. It has flaws and I'm not here to debate them, but if such a system was implemented would it not address the issue of leaving people behind?	1644171409.0	hvu8khd	t3_sm0gf0	t1_hvu100u	/r/changemyview/comments/sm0gf0/cmv_color_blindness_in_accordance_to_race_wont/hvu8khd/

158w0c	>Acknowledging the history of racism and working to correct it is not racist.  I agree.  >Policies that benefit racial minorities are not racist.  If a policy benefits a minority it is not racist, but if it benefits them solely because of their race then it is racist.  For example, if we create a law that say people of race X are given $500 and people of race Y are given $100, that would be racist, correct? It doesn't matter which race is treated better, if a policy treats someone differently depending on their race, it is racist. It could be argued that such racism is justified, but ultimately I believe by being racist we will only perpetuate racism.  >Unless you agree that we must actively address the past to correct the future, we are not in alignment.  I also agree we should take steps to minimize the effects of historical racism. Where we diverge is I believe our efforts should not themselves perpetuate the racism we aim to solve.   >Deciding we won't be racist from now on is not enough.

158w0c	I would summarize my definition of racism as, "Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable evaluation or treatment of an individual or group based on race or ethnicity." This happens to be the current definition ADL uses.  > it doesn't capture anything about the historical dominance of some races over others   >   >It puts anti-racist corrective action in the same category of the unjust shit it's trying to correct.  This is exactly why the above definition is good, it forces everyone who wishes to treat others differently based on their race to confront the fact that they support some forms of racism. They may feel their racism is justified, but all racists have felt their racism is justified.  >How do you propose we correct historical injustices without acknowledging they happened to some races and not others?  First, I agree that acknowledging wrongs of the past is good and necessary. I just don't believe committing those same wrongs again will solve them. Instead, I propose we help ALL individuals who are behind by improving systems to alleviate poverty. This will help those who fell behind due to racism, and it will help others who fell behind due to other past wrongs. I do not close off all options, just the racist ones.	1644173843.0	hvueoll	t3_sm0gf0	t1_hvub7fu	/r/changemyview/comments/sm0gf0/cmv_color_blindness_in_accordance_to_race_wont/hvueoll/

If ABC business exists by making money off uninformed people, then a program that informs people so they no longer need to pay ABC isn't "killing the free market."   It's cutting society's dead weight.  If an industry relies *so heavily* on people not knowing how their car works, that a single website would be enough to kill off the entire industry, then maybe we need to ask ourselves whether it needed to exist in the first place.  Maybe at some point, yes. Before the internet it would have been harder to diagnose car problems so parts stores filled that gap. But for the most part that gap doesn't exist anymore.

There's a difference between forgiving the state for atrocities that it perpetrated, and acting with common decency towards an individual of that country who had nothing to do with the atrocities.  I would never blame an Armenian individual for hating the Turkish state. But I would be disturbed if an Armenian individual was rude to a Turkish individual solely because they were Turkish.  It's not about forgiving anything. An individual who didn't take part in atrocities, and who quite possibly was born 100 years after they happened, should not be held responsible (and beg forgiveness) for the atrocities.   The state, and the actual individuals who carried out the atrocities, are the only ones in a position to be (or not be) forgiven.

Also, a degree might not *immediately* help you get a great job, but it does in the long run. I had to work retail for six months out of college, but I eventually got a job that I never could have gotten without a degree.  All that being said, I agree college is exorbitantly expensive, not for everyone, and shouldn't be a barrier to entry for every single white-collar career. But the world being as it is now, a college degree is still fairly necessary.	1644177643.0	hvuo5kf	t3_sm5jb6	t3_sm5jb6	/r/changemyview/comments/sm5jb6/cmv_college_is_not_worth_it_for_most_people/hvuo5kf/

This means they don't want to go through the rigid process of questioning and investigation from something that happened to them years, if not decades ago.

The supposed Obama era policy was in 2011 and how many cases have there been of some dude's life being ruined? Did the instances increase?

I imagine this point is creating significant confusion among many people, not just ourselves.  >I've repeatedly said the opposite, even in my previous reply.   The way I understood your previous post was two groups may need help but one group needs it more due to racism. I'm saying racism isn't the only thing that might make a group need more help. So we should provide a method that will help everyone, no matter the cause of what brought them down.     Your point was we can't help everyone the same because some people need more help than others, but you solely focus on people who experienced racism as the people who need more help. My reply is I am not ignoring the facts of the problem, I am taking a broader look at everyone who is struggling, recognizing many people need more help, and seeking an opportunity to help everyone, instead of using race is the distinguisher of who receives that extra help. It shouldn't say if you are a POC you receive X help. It should say if you are a person who needs X help you get X help up to what is possible to provide. The opportunity should be available to everyone who needs it.  Unfortunately I have to dip for the day.

50ri22f4	Looking for love in all the wrong places? The loves in my life snuck up on me, when I was looking to other objectives. Like getting involved with new activities, volunteering, learning new skills.  The people I met then/there weren't looking for love, specifically, either. Just new interests, expansion of existing ones, a good time, a wider circle of friends, pay-forwarding, you get the picture.  A couple weren't even primary contacts, but friends of new friends that were introduced to me by them. Because they saw the value I brought or was trying to achieve, and thought maybe we'd be a good match.  Examples include library and museum volunteering groups, music open mic nights, participatory dance groups, recreational poker nights at sports bars and fraternal organizations, and makerspaces - where crafts are taught, tools shared, mentoring is encouraged, and new ideas cross-pollinate.  None of these may interest you, but putting yourself 'out there' is the key, and a non-dating scenario takes the pressure off as well as widening the pool of possibilities.

3s4ve8nm	This is true, and what the writer and director were definitely going for. But again, it's highly unlikely a popular and affluent girl is going to kiss a "bad boy," who she's NOT in any type of relationship with, after he sexually assaults her. I knew lots of girls, sheltered and rich, to hood chicks, and none of them would let some random "bad boy" do that to her without some serious repercussions. And for sure, they're not going to gush afterwards, *Awww, you're just misunderstood sweetheart. ::tongue kiss::*  Stuff like that is written by Hollywood nerds who are unlikely to have had any real experiences in situations like this so they churn out romanticized, on-the-outside-looking-in interpretations of what they *think* bad boys and hoodlums are like. And what makes it bad is that kids growing up watching these fictionalized, unrealistic scenarios grow up thinking it's normal and "authentic" to act that way. It also conditions viewers to think be subjected to abuse and smile.   *Yeah, he sexually assaulted me, but I don't know what's going on with his home life to really judge, and maybe that's his way of trying to connect with someone emotionally. And he's rugged and handsome so it's okay.*   I love '80s teen movies but it's rare when they approach anything close to reality.	1644196797.0	hvvx9lq	t3_si6omb	t1_hvvmmk5	/r/changemyview/comments/si6omb/cmv_this_decision_behindthescenes_of_the/hvvx9lq/

If you’d read my post, I acknowledge that is pretty much slavery, while also realizing that slavery never left the United States and exists in the form of prison labor today, which disproportionately affects Black people.

gw1wn61a	> Like what even defines a rape if it has nothing to do with whether the parties consent?  Of course, it isn't rape if the parties consented. Consent has absolutely nothing to do with whether the two parties are married, in a relationship, or two strangers hooking up in a bar bathroom.  >Are you saying that any alcohol involved in sex whatsoever is always rape?   No, that would be nonsensical. Think of it this way. There's some BAC threshold at which you can't give consent. It's rape if either person is above that BAC, whether they are married or not. It's not rape is everyone is below that BAC, even if they met 15 minutes ago in the club.   >Even if both people feel like they gave consent? Like what is giving consent If it's not believing that you gave consent?  Believing you gave consent and actually giving consent are entirely different things.	1644202512.0	hvw9iqx	t3_sme8kj	t1_hvw8ksg	/r/changemyview/comments/sme8kj/cmv_i_disagree_with_the_notion_that_drunk_consent/hvw9iqx/

That being said, if you're seriously proposing a return to slavery as *the* viable solution to modern socio-economic inequities, then I think you're somewhat remiss in not realizing that revolt is also "a way out."  Granted, of course, that between the dichotomy of slavery and revolution I think there are actually a number of rational and peaceful options that could be employed to address modern problems, and that should be tried immediately. However, if the primary thesis of your argument is that slavery is the *only* way out of a mess such as this, I think the fact that there is at least one other option goes a way to disproving your argument.	1644202576.0	hvw9nsy	t3_smf5mb	t3_smf5mb	/r/changemyview/comments/smf5mb/cmv_an_avenue_for_being_lifelong_indentured/hvw9nsy/

This does not change my stance that not getting vaccinated is objectively dumb and if there were a new variant-based vaccine they would very likely reduce the risk of transmission from a vaccinated person by reducing the viral load but those are not available yet.

33j1loqr	So there’s two cases to this  One is that you’ve truly moved on from her romantically. In this case, bringing up how much you wanted to be with her just isn’t necessary, because she might take it as still having feelings for her deep down. If you truly just wanna just be friends, telling her makes things kinda weird.  Two is that you still kinda have feelings for her deep down. In that case, stop it. You aren’t friends, you’re being friendZONED. Not a healthy situation to be in for you. If you’re only being friends so you can wait out the relationship and take a stab at it down the road if the opportunity comes up, that just isn’t good man. Better off just being kinda-friends and seeing what happens with her relationship, but you don’t wanna affect her relationship or put all your eggs in that basket.  I’m gonna assume the first case is true based on post (you just wanna be friends). There’s nothing wrong with keeping your (former) love for her to yourself, as it just makes things awkward if you say something imho, especially because you are relatively new friends. She already knows you’re attracted to her cause you asked her out on a date, no need to go into detail about it. It’s not having an “untrue” friendship unless you are hiding something you are “currently” feeling.	1644212284.0	hvwstaw	t3_smgwk4	t3_smgwk4	/r/changemyview/comments/smgwk4/cmv_if_i_have_to_intentionally_hide_a_true_fact/hvwstaw/
2kk65iot	Always on board with trying to be specific as possible about the numbers at issue, costs, downsides, etc. My priors are that mandatory vaccinations would, more likely than not, save a few hundred of thousand lives in North America over the next year or two. First to admit that I am not an expert though.  But, by the way, ‘loss of autonomy’ seems less amenable to precise quantification than some projected number of lives saved. Trade-offs exist here, no doubt. But it’s not quite fair to object to imprecision in one value/rationale (saving lives) and accept it another (autonomy and the loss thereof). How many lives saved equals one unit of autonomy lost?   And, based on the supposedly outrageous examples you list, part of your aversion to a mandate seems to be that you object to paternalistic policies. But we do already demand that people wear seat belts, helmets, abstain from certain recreational drugs, etc. And, as I mentioned indirectly earlier, this is not just about paternalism. Once our actions start harming others, then Mill’s harm principle comes into play and something like this principle already underwrites a massive amount of legislation which serves to regulate our activity.	1644213694.0	hvwv6rs	t3_sm8kwd	t1_hvwqcrk	/r/changemyview/comments/sm8kwd/cmv_vaccination_is_a_patriotic_duty/hvwv6rs/

33j1loqr	Ok, the way I see it is that right and left are useful terms to describe singular ideologies (pro-life/choice, healthcare, etc.) THIS is generally the only accurate use of the term in politics, so it would suggest that they do have some meaning.  This becomes muddied when we describe PEOPLE as right- or left-wing, as holding people to a static nature is an ignorant thing to do. Think of how many times you change your mind on the simplest of things and try to say that people or groups are always going to following the same alignment.  In truth, right and left are relative indications to where a country is at politically, as our right and left might not perfectly align with standpoints from other countries. Hell, people call Biden a socialist and he’s generally seen as left leaning, yet in some other countries he’d be closer to center-right.  Based on what I’ve said, you’d think I’d argue these terms are just as meaningless as you do. Here is where I find meaning. I’ll assume you live in America just for ease of example. Comparing what we think of as “right” and “left” policies is a good measuring stick to compare where we are at politically with the rest of the world on particular issues. It is generally a “fine” way to separate singular ideologies, but when we begin to make blanket statements, we have to realize, like with anything, there are nuances. Don’t take these terms as defining the absolute. Rather, take them as a way to measure the relativity of the world, as most things we come to know, we only know in relation of other things, and not as absolutes (IMO).  If you really wanna break it down, any way to describe anything is relative. Think something is good? Good relative to what? Losing an arm is probably good compared to dying for most people, but it’s bad compared to having two working arms. Using left and right in similar ways creates some meaning. We don’t always use them as we should.  That might’ve been a slight tangent lol. Don’t know if I changed your mind, but hope I gave you a different way to think about some things.	1644214526.0	hvwwjuw	t3_smgb80	t3_smgb80	/r/changemyview/comments/smgb80/cmv_right_and_left_are_meaningless_terms_in/hvwwjuw/

You aren’t hiding the truth, she knew you were attracted when you shot your shot. Bringing up how you used to be in love makes it low key seem like you still wanna be with her like that bro, which if you wanna be friends above all else, that might mess it up.

Which very, very many people including the op believe to be a irrefutable fact, which leads to all sorts of behavior that I find annoying at best, irresponsible at worst. While the op seems to have it in his head that the unvaccinated are some sort of threat to his health and the country at large when that is very clearly not the case, but its a narrative being run through the media in counter to the other side of vaccines being some conspiracy about the gobbermint injecting you with 5g and the only way to stop it is to eat horse paste or whatever the latest absolute nonsense is.	1644220874.0	hvx5sp0	t3_sm8kwd	t1_hvw7x9v	/r/changemyview/comments/sm8kwd/cmv_vaccination_is_a_patriotic_duty/hvx5sp0/

1nd4vsce	I can relate to an extent. I know very little about black carribean culture. My black parent died when I was 10 and they had also been in the UK since childhood. I lost touch with their half of the family. I have been raised by a white family, in a predominately white area in the UK for my entire life.  Due to my appearance, I will never be perceived as white no matter how much my experience matched that of a white person.   I used to have the same thoughts and feelings that I didn't need to explore my black 'side' because it meant nothing to me other than being a superficial diference that set me apart from the white people. In many ways it's a path to resentment and self hatred because you begin to feel like the physical attributes passed down to you by your ancesters are a barrier to acceptance.  The older I get, the more I realise that this way of thinking was incredibly damaging. Most people yearn for acceptance, but there is this tendancy among mixed race people to feel like we have to pick a side and a culture, force ourselves to fit into a box that wasn't made for us.   One example of this that I can give as a woman is hair care. I would try and make products work for me which were intended for women with straighter European hair, I used to shampoo every other day because, as far as I was concerned that was what i was supposed to do. My hair was dry and breaking off. I felt terrible because I was not measuring up to a white beauty standard. I felt ugly for a large portion of my teen years because of this and I felt depressed that I was physically more curvaceous with wider hips and bigger breasts and bottom. I was into post hard-core, punk and metal as a teen and I didn't see anyone who looked like me in those spaces but I still tried to pull off the clothes and hairstyles and frankly, I looked ridiculous because I wasn't adapting this style to suit my individual bod and colouring, I was trying to change myself to fit an aesthetic that had been adopted by white people for white people.   Now i'm older and have taken the time to learn about and understand the different needs for black hair, I am shampooing once 1 per week.and using specialist products for my hair type, my hair is soft and healthy and no longer breaking off. I now feel beautiful in my own hair because I understand my individual needs were different.  Refusing to take time to learn about my black side feels strange to me now. It's almost like I have been avoiding learning about my self on purpose because I was scared that I would be seen as a failure or an imposter and (i'm ashamed to admit) but i was worried that white people would look down on me for enjoying anyrhing that was considered stereotypically black.  but by keeping that door closed you may be  ignoring your own needs and making life more difficult than it needs to be. Trying to downplay your physical differences instead of embracing them and keeping your head down to fit in istead of feeling free to explore other identities is just internalised racism and it's taken me a long time to recognise it and overcome it.	1644234849.0	hvxnnge	t3_rw8zgb	t3_rw8zgb	/r/changemyview/comments/rw8zgb/cmv_as_a_mixed_race_person_i_dont_need_to_connect/hvxnnge/

htnpbfml	I wager we say swear like a sailor and not swear like a minister because sailors of all backgrounds and types work in a staff room as you described, but it’s called a ship, in the middle of nowhere, in close quarters with each other, in the military working hard on duty under guard, for months at a time. Like when the Navy was entirely Irish then blacks were introduced during the civil war. They hated each other until they had to bond at sea for extended periods, then went back to hating each other on shore.   Meanwhile swear like a noncommissioned officer isn’t a term, because officers set an example for the commissioned sailors and marines, like a minister is an example for his flock.  Few call naval or merchant marine officers and priests the privileged few or the monied elite or whatever you’re babbling about, except stupid crass morons that are edgy but too scared to say the word retard even in their rant about censorship.

ggw5fsyd	mate, the only reason US became a hub of manufacturing was because industry across the globe was decimated. That's not even debatable among historians.   US was able to flood products across the globe precisely because of that advantage.  also, productivity increase doesn't mean shit if consumption doesn't increase proportionally. is there crony capitalism, sure but to claim that labor unions weren't an absolute nightmare for growth is absolutely idiotic.  i am from a nation that literally came to brink of bankruptcy because of socialism and the excess of worker unions.

ggw5fsyd	you're circling back to it because you're try to looking into something that's not there.  take for example the word retarded. it's a common phrase people used and still use to this day to show their frustration with someone. If you come along and tell them that they shouldn't say it, some may agree it to and some won't. the problem arise when you start labelling those who won't as the enemy and categorize them as some embodiment of evil (say Nazi).  there's no solidarity to be achieved once you start labelling people as embodiment of evil because they'll do the same and it will quickly become an us vs them.   You can't put high barriers of ideological purity if you want a lot of people under your umbrella. we've seen that happened to Lenin and Stalin's Russia where Ideological purity resulted in people being thrown into Gulags or killed because of wrong thought.	1644241758.0	hvxzrov	t3_smocw0	t1_hvxwv5w	/r/changemyview/comments/smocw0/cmv_online_leftists_are_absolute_morons_when_it/hvxzrov/
ggw5fsyd	mate, you really need to read things about how things work.  US doesn't need industrialization because it's already industrialised. US still makes things mate, just some of it's sectors have shifted to a service based model. the infrastructure is still laid out for efficiency.  i never claimed US had a bad economy, i said that US economy blossomed after the war because it was left untouched in the war( pearl harbour doesn't really count). the cities in Europe were decimated, Tokyo and it's industry was levelled and every other manufacturing hub was severely affected. that created the hole for US produced goods and hence the industry grew.  mate really, Switzerland is you example. do you understand a concept called scalability? if you do, then please explain how the Swiss or Dutch model can even function in large countries like US.  yeah, you were. there's a concept called limiting factor. when labor is scarce, it becomes a limiting factor and value of labor is prominent. When labor is cheap and abundant, that value goes down. In 60s, commercial pilots were treated like royalty because air travel was expensive and a luxury but now it's not.	1644242734.0	hvy1scp	t3_smocw0	t1_hvxxs2p	/r/changemyview/comments/smocw0/cmv_online_leftists_are_absolute_morons_when_it/hvy1scp/

ggw5fsyd	mate, then we just go into the no true Scotsman fallacy.  let me tell you why i don't really like socialism or socialist. I come from Indian and we were doing the dance of socialism up until 1992, when we were months from declaring Bankruptcy.  socialist can claim all the nonsense of "workers owning means of production", but reality is that when you have a big country like India, government is defacto owner of means of production in a socialist model. that leads to nonsense like red tapism, extreme rot of bureaucracy and a whole lot of nationalistic bullshit.  we have many recognised leftists parties like CPI and all they destroyed the states that they ruled from within (see CPI in west Bengal).  they too call for all this speech curtailment that you witness on social media in US and this ideological purity only alienates people. to support my claim, i would point to the downfall of Leftism in India because of the whole pander politics.  so yeah, i agree that "don't call people Nazis if you wanna convince them" as obvious knowledge, it seems like a good chunk of Leftists don't get it. why is that? fixation on ideological purity is the only answer i can come up with.	1644243613.0	hvy3o4p	t3_smocw0	t1_hvy0e3e	/r/changemyview/comments/smocw0/cmv_online_leftists_are_absolute_morons_when_it/hvy3o4p/

2kk65iot	Causality in particular cases can be hard to trace, no doubt. But the idea that there is no proof that being unvaccinated imposes risks on others in general is also ‘patently absurd’. Being unvaccinated increases risk of infection and likelihood of transmission. And we already regulate many actions that impose similar, and often lesser, risks on others in general— we regulate smoking in public places, the dumping of harmful chemicals into streams and lakes, the use of certain pesticides, what can go into a burn pile and so on. In general, many think it’s bad to needlessly increase others’ risk of death even when lines of causality are hard to trace in particular cases.  Next point—you said a bit more what you mean by loss of autonomy. That’s not quantification or coming up with a kind of exchange rate that allows us to weigh trade-offs. In fact, you just said that bodily ownership is absolutely inviolable so, on your view, no amount of lives saved would be worth forcing the vaccination or even (apparently) quarantining just a single person. And that’s the probably the place where we part ways, right at the start.	1644244608.0	hvy5vvf	t3_sm8kwd	t1_hvx8603	/r/changemyview/comments/sm8kwd/cmv_vaccination_is_a_patriotic_duty/hvy5vvf/

ggw5fsyd	it's not my position, it's the leftist position. why else would you repeatedly label anyone who voted for Trump as a Nazi and a racist?  i am saying if anyone who voted for Trump is a racist (because Trump is a racist), Transphobic (because Trump is transphobic) and ableist (because Trump mocked a disabled person), then yes...those people outnumber all the minorities in US combined.	1644245217.0	hvy79vm	t3_smocw0	t1_hvy60dg	/r/changemyview/comments/smocw0/cmv_online_leftists_are_absolute_morons_when_it/hvy79vm/

That's my point, nothing has really changed. Except that now we need to discredit him, so out comes the racism accusation.  Wouldn't it be better to focus anti-racist efforts on people who matter, who have real power, than using the accusation as a delegitimization tactic against those who are saying things we don't like, despite the fact that they have nothing to do with the aims of reducing racial discrimination in society?

erv2n9u5	I'm saying, accusing someone of racism as a way to delegitimize an unrelated point they are trying to make is USING a cause of which many of these people have no personal experience with to maintain their control of the narrative. On the backs of the historical suffering of minority groups. It is maintaining power and control (hence supremacy) by undermining the causes of underprivileged groups.	1644245948.0	hvy8ytl	t3_smqtia	t1_hvy1h8s	/r/changemyview/comments/smqtia/cmv_anyone_out_there_in_the_public_eye_using_the/hvy8ytl/
ggw5fsyd	because things have been tried and failed. In Business, when you try to implement a strategy, you do it by assessing the situation.   Here's an example - in Japan, kids are encouraged to clean their classrooms and even toilets from a young age because it's an ingrained value in their culture. You can try that in US and parents will sue the school very next day. that's because of cultural difference.  similarly, there are a number of variables like geography, economic structure (no other country can replicate the Panama model because no other nation has Panama canal), language difference, social and political differences (Switzerland being a direct democracy) etc.  implementing Swiss model would literally mean restructuring everything in US. an example would be restructuring the cities. Swiss cities are very compact and packed while US cities spread out. it's easy to implement a robust public transport in Zurich because of that but do that for Los Angeles and it will decimate LA's budget.  again, read the history of why things are the way they are and you'll understand why Swiss or Dutch model isn't scalable to large nations. compare the tax rates, direct and indirect taxes and you'll see why Dutch are able to do it but US can't.	1644246164.0	hvy9h23	t3_smocw0	t1_hvy5ahk	/r/changemyview/comments/smocw0/cmv_online_leftists_are_absolute_morons_when_it/hvy9h23/
erv2n9u5	I don't care if people like Joe Rogan or not.  I care that people are using the battle cry of historically disadvantaged groups to delegitimize an unrelated argument that they don't like, to make it go away, rather than argue against it with relevant responses.  It's like arguing that an anti-war activist can't make a point about why we shouldn't bomb people overseas because they happen to believe the moon landing was faked.  Both stances might be problematic in your view, but they have nothing to do with each other.	1644246347.0	hvy9wjd	t3_smqtia	t1_hvy1s0w	/r/changemyview/comments/smqtia/cmv_anyone_out_there_in_the_public_eye_using_the/hvy9wjd/

erv2n9u5	Why would you quote something I didn't say? My point is that USING that disingenuously to delegitimize a completely unrelated point is a racist thing to do.    Let's say the government was about to implement a surveillance state, in which they were going to put a camera in every home and car so that they would know what we were up to all the time, and let's say people went to protest that idea, and let's a podcaster was railing against it. Would you be ok with those protestors and that podcast suddenly being called racist repeatedly by officials and in the media? Wouldn't you see that as absolutely exploitative of all races who have ever been discriminated against in the past? Well, that's how I see this.	1644246886.0	hvyb6n7	t3_smqtia	t1_hvy2kq9	/r/changemyview/comments/smqtia/cmv_anyone_out_there_in_the_public_eye_using_the/hvyb6n7/

ggw5fsyd	Yes, and?   democracy and capitalism both proved that they're tangible ideas that can sustain internal and external factor because they have some level of robustness. compare that Lenin's and Stalin's Russia and you immediately see a difference. People often point that faliure of USSR was because of USA's interference. USSR was also trying to interfere but they failed and imploded, because their Ideology wasn't robust.    sure, but who exactly those economic principles serve in reality when all you have is bread lines and people working in Gulags because of those principles. Paris Hilton inherited money, she didn't make money. I will be more than happy to learn how to scale a hotel Empire from Conrad Hilton though, but unfortunately he's dead.   Yeah, i don't really think restricting speech and forcing pronouns is "representing the interest of working class".   sure, it can be about all type of workers in all different types of jobs but that still doesn't change the fact that there's a clear majority and a clear minority between them. if the agenda of one minority group takes more space and priority over the general representation of interests of working class, then people from that working class will look towards other options.  that's exactly why Leftists parties are rendered irrelevant in India, where they once were major stakeholders.

In none of that have I ever seen a Nazi flag being waved.  I have seen one image of one Nazi flag being waved by one guy.

Yes, a drunk person signs a contract to sell a cow and then legally rescinds it the next day, big whoop.

Unlike with a contract, a third party can report the sex to authorities which may result in someone going to jail. You keep bringing up contractual rules but the stakes are so much different. Yes, a drunk person signs a contract to sell a cow and then legally rescinds it the next day, big whoop. Two drunk people willingly have sex and, as you say, if one person wakes up the next day and decides that it wasn't consensual the other party is going to prison. So should the officers, upon finding out that both parties were drunk, arrest the reporting party?	1644255586.0	hvyx0sz	t3_sme8kj	t1_hvya2d6	/r/changemyview/comments/sme8kj/cmv_i_disagree_with_the_notion_that_drunk_consent/hvyx0sz/

aaqpyyp	Because a lot of the people you so carelessly label as nazis and white supremacists don’t have criminal records and are legally allowed to defend themselves. In states that allow concealed carry or open carry, this could easily lead to a situation where a group of self-proclaimed anti-nazis attack an individual. By law in many jurisdictions that person is allowed to defend themselves with lethal force if they’re being attacked and pursued.   By punching a nazi, or someone you claim to be a nazi, you may very well be consenting to getting shot.	1644256344.0	hvyz0op	t3_smb4z1	t1_hvxs9id	/r/changemyview/comments/smb4z1/cmv_we_shouldnt_normalize_attacking_racists_such/hvyz0op/

That said, they do not perform the work of a person. A handicap man in a wheelchair doesn’t perform the work of half a person. And as a hypothetical, one teacher grades papers while one counts attendance at the same time.   A person is a conscious mind. This is why we allow the brain dead to expire: they’re not conscious and never will be, vegetables.   And the point about unions is laughable. If you can tell us union rules are a problem, then there should be no problem whatsoever with how the entire world treats personhood like a coma patient with a liquified brain.	1644256432.0	hvyz93n	t3_smw3fe	t3_smw3fe	/r/changemyview/comments/smw3fe/cmv_the_conjoined_hensel_twins_deserve_a_single/hvyz93n/
a4i64	I mostly agree with your take but you're overstating the effect of dark humor.  >if you did laugh there’s some level of prejudice there, even if its tiny, even if you tell yourself that you don’t really mean it. He’s reminded you that each of us has the potential to reenact the worst parts of history. And that the underlying impulses that cause these atrocities is ever-present in our psyche.  That's way too strong. For every group of people, every demographic, when taken as a whole, there are likable and unlikable qualities. It's not fair to attach stereotypes to every individual, but stereotypes exist for a reason. They're rooted in truth. Pointing them out or alluding to them, or laughing at jokes based on them, does not indicate some latent inner evil. If a Jew makes fun of Jewish people in a mean way, nobody cares. If a black person makes black jokes, if a gay person makes gay jokes, it's all well and good. The content is truthful. The main "sin" Carr committed was telling a gypsy joke despite not being a gypsy. He "punched down", to use that dumb phrase.	1644256624.0	hvyzr8o	t3_smvtbc	t3_smvtbc	/r/changemyview/comments/smvtbc/cmv_comedians_should_not_be_canceled/hvyzr8o/

You’re going to be the tyrannical king that kills his jester because you don’t like what he reveals about you.  Dude comedians aren't these great minds you think they are. Comedians are some of the dumbest people you will ever meet and uninformed on a lot of topics.  But do you think all edgy comedy is worthwhile and not up to being cancelled?   Like would a comedian whose bit is to talk about how he raped a child worth a netflix special? Or how about a bit where the comedian passes out child porn to the audience and says he's going to call the cops?   I find the cancel culture thing is people whining like little bitches that other people are mad. Comedians have one of the easiest jobs in the world. I don't care if somebody online wants them gone. We've had people for decades face "cancellation" for their stand up, it hasn't led to any problems.   Comedians are dumbasses and most of them have nothing insightful to say compared to people with actual life experience. I can laugh at someone like Bill Burr and think he's got a point, but really if I am taking my world view from a comedian I should rethink my life.   Stand up comedy is bigger than it ever has been and is oversaturated with a lot of comedians who aren't funny yet getting a Netflix special. Netflix is a company looking to profit, if people don't like the content they can voice their opinion.   You aren't entitled to make a living saying dumb shit. You aren't entitled to a Netflix special. But the fact that Netflix continues to give or have specials where comedians say edgy shit and people get mad is proof comedians as a whole are not getting cancelled.	1644257592.0	hvz28ma	t3_smvtbc	t3_smvtbc	/r/changemyview/comments/smvtbc/cmv_comedians_should_not_be_canceled/hvz28ma/

Naturalizing these people would mean higher wages for them which means more taxes.*  No, that depends on the supply and demand curves for their labor. If their wages go up by becoming legal, then there will be less demand for them at higher wages. So even though each such immigrant is paid more, there are fewer employed, so the total amount of taxes paid by them may or may not in fact go up.  Second point. Economic actions should be evaluated on whether they are good for the economy, not whether they are good for the government.   *> The windfall of tax revenue would increase our GDP and also reduce our federal deficit.*  First of all, as explained earlier, there might not be such a windfall.

Hospice care and therapy can help give people the joy they need for seeing their children or grandchildren one more time. Resignation can be legitimate, and for those people a ban on euthanasia is unfortunate, but many other times it's rooted in despair, which is a mental health crisis rather than an informed decision.   3) It's a slippery slope into psychiatric euthanasia, because many of these arguments also apply to psychiatric euthanasia. In the Netherlands these arguments were made to justify euthanizing a father because of his alcoholism and allowing a teenager to starve herself to death because of her rape trauma.

4bqi5cfb	>Thanks for your comment. A few things: > >1) A majority of countries don’t have SSM, but (I think) a majority don’t have laws mandating gays be jailed  Go back even just 20 years and this isn't true. Homosexuality was barely removed from the DSM as amentall illness in 1973.  Ignoring this, just because a majority of *countries* dont have laws mandating discrimination doesn't meant they dont have significant religious populations trying to do just that. The US has the GoP, a party majorly made up of believers and ran by a grouo of religious fundamentalists that constantly try to repeal any LGBT laws we can get. Poland is massively anti-LGBT, in part due to their immense Catholic presence.   Ignoring that, there's implicit discrimination that doesnt rely on explicit racism, ie how only married couples can get certain tax breaks, but oops gays cant get married so i guess they cant get these tax breaks. Or they can't adopt. Or they cant get loans. Which means they cant buy that house they've been wanting to, or buy a car. Which means they cant work long distance jobs, which means they're stuck in their immediate vicinities, etcetcetc.  Discrimination isn't explicit in the West because it became so engrained it doesnt need to be anymore. The systems in place uphold oppression just fine. That's why its *systemic* oppression. And it's very much real, for all minority groups.	1645054527.0	hx8ndio	t3_stwkkf	t1_hx6aejd	/r/changemyview/comments/stwkkf/cmv_political_islam_is_the_most_antilgbt_force_on/hx8ndio/

I hate to say it, but you're really making the rest of us on the left look bad. You are a validation of everything their echo chambers tell them about us. If you're not going to be part of the solution, at least stop being part of the problem and posting stuff like this.	1645058960.0	hx8xf3z	t3_sub2ru	t1_hx8wsgx	/r/changemyview/comments/sub2ru/cmv_republicans_have_no_place_in_modern_society/hx8xf3z/
32yhjj1g	I can only speak to my own disability and affirmative action related to it. My place of work actively seeks to hire BIPIC/disabled folks. I have a disability (I am white/female). I have a lot of talent but my disability has caused me not to be able to get employed in a way that truly makes use of it due to assumptions. I'm thriving in my current role due to their affirmative action towards disabilities.   For me, this doesn't make me feel I'm not talented or that I'm a pity hire. It makes me   1) relieved to finally have a job that sees my whole self, without the stereotypes of my disability  2) pleased to contribute my talents  3) happy to continue to support the inclusion of other disabled folks  4) not really worrying what people think of me outside of the people I serve in my job; if people judge me, whatever, I know my worth.  5) I will bring my unique skills to a job that I was qualified to do and so were others, but I know I'm awesome so I will never assume it was only because of my disability - it was because of my talent and my disability  I have no idea how any one black woman hired in this role will feel, but my guess is that she'll be pleased to serve and inspire other black women, and focus more on her job than worrying what people think of her. When you have a visual minority/disability and have felt prejudice throughout your life, at a certain point you start to not give a shit about other people's opinions and simply be pleased to use your talents in whatever way you can.	1645062444.0	hx95537	t3_stkq6y	t3_stkq6y	/r/changemyview/comments/stkq6y/cmv_if_joe_biden_wanted_to_pick_a_black_woman_as/hx95537/
41rx32y8	First, I wanna correct my self. We are making predictions, but only for the next century or so. So 150 years of climate measurements are enough for that. Especially when you consider that even without these we have other evidence to show that the temperatures will likely keep rising. We are not saying they will rise just because they have risen so far for 150 years.  The basis is actually that green house gases (CO2, methane and many more) trap heat from the sun, thus making the earth warmer. That’s why they are called green house gases.   Your argument makes a couple of assumptions:  a) Plant life will increase as CO2 in the atmosphere increase.  b) It will be able to reach a high enough number to absorb enough CO2 to maintain the current climate.   c) It will increase at a high enough rate to absorb CO2 fast enough to maintain the current climate.  a) and c) are currently not happening, while you have not supported b).	1645066412.0	hx9dzo9	t3_sucil5	t1_hx9b3vi	/r/changemyview/comments/sucil5/cmv_there_isnt_enough_evidence_to_say_climate/hx9dzo9/

ghsz1	“76 patients were included, hereof 35 outpatients with mild disease and 41 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Sixteen patients had critical disease requiring mechanical ventilation, 25 patients had moderate–severe disease.”  Wow, a bunch of people who get hospitalized with covid (a respiratory disease), of which 20%  were so critical they needed ventilators, had pulmonary inflammation. That is very relevant to me, who am in my twenties and had no symptoms.	1645074791.0	hx9t6ty	t3_su9ahj	t1_hx9sfjx	/r/changemyview/comments/su9ahj/cmv_i_dont_think_i_need_the_vaccine_and_im_not/hx9t6ty/
6drqavrz	Most news subreddits are trash. And very echoey with no real discussion. I want to talk to reasonable humans who won't automatically assume I am the spawn of the devil.  What I like is:  1. Mods that are not incredibly incompetent. 2. Peple from a divers crowd so its not all people from one side agreeing with eachouter. This one is the most inportint. Without this one there is no real discussion. 3. Nice people.  There are not many subs like this. So I care deeply about all of them.

jlklk2mm	This is pretty disappointing, if I'm being honest. I answered your question because you said you'd clarify your earlier statements, and instead you're just nitpicking my answer and asking further questions.  I won't be engaging further.	1645076451.0	hx9vyvm	t3_sud1gy	t1_hx9veis	/r/changemyview/comments/sud1gy/cmv_the_abuse_of_reddits_revamped_block_feature/hx9vyvm/
jlklk2mm	Excuse my earlier, ruder response to this, if you happened to see it. I've deleted it already, it's counter-productive.  Before going further down the road of discussing whether this measure is effective or not, could you clarify your claim that being prevented from responding to certain comments is a kind of bullying?	1645076772.0	hx9whzx	t3_sud1gy	t1_hx9veis	/r/changemyview/comments/sud1gy/cmv_the_abuse_of_reddits_revamped_block_feature/hx9whzx/
jbhm0	I'm not sure if you bothered to fully read my comment at all.   >Islam is the main force that manipulates the culture in the Middle East.  Inversely, culture is the main force that manipulates the enforcement of scripture, and enforcement is all that matters. Feel free to read my next answer.  >Because they're very religious and their religion says homosexuality is punishable by death.   Did you completely skip over the part with belly dancers and alcohol?   ---  >I used to be one of those backwards people before I became an exmuslim.  Ahh, I see where the trouble is. From my experience, exmuslims who refer to themselves as such tend to be freshly out of the religion, but mostly always have strong contempt towards the religion rooted in personal traumatic experiences that they fail to look at anything mentioning Islam objectively.   And seeing as you have over 7k karma but no comments, you're a serial deleter, so I doubt this conversation will go far.   **My two cents to you:**  You will never truly be free of Islam until you no longer feel the need to use a label pertaining to the religion to describe yourself. Your cognitive bias has already been established just by using that term to describe yourself.	1645080648.0	hxa2di5	t3_stwkkf	t1_hx9rqps	/r/changemyview/comments/stwkkf/cmv_political_islam_is_the_most_antilgbt_force_on/hxa2di5/
jbhm0	You are asserting a claim regarding my argument that I never made. I never argued that it's okay for anti-LGBT forces to exist "because there's history from the West."  OP simply said "Political Islam is the biggest anti-LGBT force," implying that Islam has a role in it. My argument is shaped to prove to him that Political Islam does not exist, and that current pseudo-Islamic anti-LGBT forces find their roots in culture, as opposed to religion.	1645081095.0	hxa2zvn	t3_stwkkf	t1_hx9valf	/r/changemyview/comments/stwkkf/cmv_political_islam_is_the_most_antilgbt_force_on/hxa2zvn/
