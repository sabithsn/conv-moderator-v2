6j55dguk	It’s really annoying to me how my coworker keeps jamming it down my throat forcefully. Like we’re going to talk about this and “ARENT THEY CUTE???” with regard to my nieces? Like I mustn’t disagree or must forcefully acknowledge it.	1640865834.0	hqjcswy	t3_rr88l6	t1_hqh334s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rr88l6/forced_female_bonding_over_kids_though_childfree/hqjcswy/

4qrd1k4w	Yeah. I have an HV dad, and hope to have a child on my own when I turn 35. I really worry about this, but it's true.  My ex also had a lovely mom and a cheating scrote dad that abandoned their family for his mistress. He ended up treating me spectacularly poorly for the last hear of the relationship, and then it came to light he was cheating. He mirrored his LVM dad *exactly*.  Most of the women I know from difficult backgrounds have done *so* much work and are some of the kindest, most mature people. Men handle it differently - they can project their anger out at those around them for years without seeing a therapist. The fact that there's a gendered response to trauma has also been documented in the research community.  It's really tough though; I've known really good men from some very difficult backgrounds (one of the best grew up raised by his father, because his mother had Huntington's). I've also seen some men turn out well after being raised by a single mother and surrounded by sisters. But mine treated me well for 5 years, and then flipped as soon as there was some adversity in his life.   I think it's fair for us to want to discuss these patterns with one another here on FDS and make decisions accordingly - it's one of the only places we can speak freely.	1640880576.0	hqk5x5v	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjlg3p	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqk5x5v/

h57msag5	I confidently and unapologetically advocate an FDS viewpoint among my friends and acquintances. Sometimes, I can hear the *click* of a mindset shift in others. So my solution is similar to the FDS forum: empower eachother. In my experience, people are most receptive to the message when they are themselves anxiously attached, or in a situationship with an avoidant, and being OUTSIDE of a group setting helps the most. Otherwise everyone will just start parroting the dominant hook-up culture dogma again.  Example: recently I had a private conservation with a friend who is pining over a man with multiple women chasing him. She had had sex with him once and he told her he found it moderately enjoyable. I let her vent and when she finished, I looked her dead in the eye and said:  "Or you could have standards. Why would you chase some manslut around who is obviously using you for sex, and says he didn't even like the sex? Why are you accepting this disrespect? This cannot be good for your self-esteem and this will reflect very badly on you in the dating pool. If you chase him you'll just be the next desperately available pvssy in his harem" ...and went on for another good three minutes non-stop throwing arguments for my case. Al she could exclaim was: "You're right. You're absolutely right."  I thought I had a breakthrough. 10 minutes later, she slipped back into hook-up culture mode and made excuses again. But, a seed has been planted.  **tl;dr: I try to contribute to a culture shift by being unapologetic, vocal, and ruthlessly advocating for FDS school of thought. I've noticed the most influence in one-on-one conversations with anxious attached individuals.**  DISCLAIMER: If someone is in a situationship with an avoidant, and they're extremely defensive about your message, let it go. Some people are too far gone in denial and will burn every bridge before they ditch their LV partners.	1640886612.0	hqklmxr	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqkfqdn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqklmxr/
h57msag5	Love your point on ignoring agency in relationships. Every action is a choice. Not taking any action, is a choice as well. Indeed like not course-correcting.  I feel like ""you can't force it" started as genuinely well-meant advice for people who'd obsessively throw themselves at their love interests. So a warning to PickMe behaviour.  Now it has been weaponised: "You have to accept low-value behaviour, otherwise you're a high maintenance b1tch who is forcing it". Not getting a text back for 24 hours-- Life happens!  Not seeing eachother for two weeks-- So busy! Not in a relationship but you've been dating for 6 months-- Oh well, I'm fine with the way things are. She never cums-- Can't force it!	1640887586.0	hqko85k	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqkfsp8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqko85k/

However, you seem to have some serious anger issues, if you are indeed a female which i doubt. I would recommend therapy and not in an edgy insulting way, but honestly. Even if i was the worst pickme on the planet, your tone in wholely inappropriate and seeping with rage. Keep that rage for males.

caxkcnil	Exactly. Their sons are going to be alright. It’s not because a some of us on FDS choose not to date them that they’ll be single forever.   This is still a man’s world and the vast majority women don’t vet/aren’t as ruthless as we are here on FDS.  I truly don’t understand why so many single mothers took this post personally, this isn’t an attack on them, and it’s not on their sons either, if they’re so sure they raised high-value men and have a healthy relationship with them, they shouldn’t be worried at all.  It’s weird to see women invalidate our experiences and downvote you to oblivion. If they don’t want to participate to this discussion, that’s fine, but don’t try to silence other women.   This isn’t about you, put your feelings aside, and let women find ways to protect themselves from low-value men who come from dysfunctional families.	1640897227.0	hqld5tj	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjq8z3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqld5tj/
h57msag5	Pre-FDS I thought Gordon Ramsey was an abrasive cocky arsehole. But now, he seems quite HV to me. He always treats the staff with respect, and his critique is fair. The shouting only begins in confrontations with LV people, and again, is always based and fair.  When asked to leave, he leaves. Don't want my help? Fine. Done. Bye.

You literally SAID that asking someone on a walk date signals disinterest to you. You gave him a Red Flag on a silver platter to dodge. He knowingly caused his own demise.

h57msag5	There is a deep sadness and internal turmoil within insecurely attached people...  My Avoidant LVW ex had an expectation of abandonment and was very closed off from day 1, putting me in the position that I had to 'open her up'. She was so closed off that she fulfilled her own prophecy: "Why be vulnerable? Everybody leaves" and I left hurt and frustrated, after trying to get her to open up for 4 months. I got crumbs for my effort and she triggered my Anxious attachment style by her scarce and unpredictable affection.    If you don't mind me asking, how long would you say you test people's investment/commitment, without showing vulnerability in return?  On the flip side, as a recovering Anxious, my deepest fear is "You don't really love me, do you?" so my gut instinct is to merge and smother. Earn their love, and have them prove they love me by constantly providing affection. This behaviour is also very toxic in its own way: the perpetual chaser leaves no room to be desired, is usually the first to compromise their wants and needs, and may be controlling to calm their anxiety.	1640904297.0	hqlv0a5	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqlqvto	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlv0a5/
j2z76	I remember my dad said he was happy to retire a senior manager.  I told him he can’t, I already told my friends he was on his way to become VP.  a little push and he did retire as company VP. LOL.   Mom told him in no uncertain terms are they buying a house with less than two garages for the future cars this was in the 90s when they only owned one which was second hand.  Fast forward today, 5 cars and two homes.   What can sound demanding to one can be a motivation for the other.  In our family, everyone is pushed to “level up”. Not gonna lie it can be stressful but it has it’s own rewards. It also gave us a mindset, “if others can, I can. And if I can, others can too”. And it was a great way to weed out mediocrity	1640913153.0	hqmg9g3	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqmg9g3/

h57msag5	Shocked that this is such a common scrote trope.  The absolute kicker in my case was the projection: he'd left me in charge of my own bedtime by the age of 12, so I could *"learn to self-manage and that my choices have consequences"*, fully expecting me to abuse this privilege and start sleeping in class. Instead, I demonstrated to him that a 12-year old has more discipline than his middle-aged ass.  Ofcourse he never held himself to the same standards as he did a literal CHILD 💩 Behold, the superior sex!	1641123490.0	hqxazzu	t3_rsih6h	t1_hqorfpq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqxazzu/

I noted it but never brought it up until about 4 months later when I suspected he had lied about working in that field. Little did he know that I had been obsessing and nerding out over that discipline for years.  One day I was bored, so I called him and asked if he'd entertain me with some of the neat stories I'm sure he had from his career. There was a sudden, uncharacteristic silence on his end of the line.  "Who told you I had [cool job] stories?" he finally asked.  I grinned as I sensed the low-level panic in his voice. "You did."

44zon0wk	When I was 21, I went on a date with a 33 year old man. He kept trying to touch my leg and I was visibly uncomfortable and pulled away but he kept trying. He told me he thought I was intelligent and mature for my age and wanted to get to know me more. We hardly had anything in common but he didn’t seem to care. He creeped me out even though he seemed nice, thankfully my gut feeling was a strong one and I decided not to see him again. A man in his 30s who is HV would not be interested in a woman who just graduated high school a couple years ago	1641178512.0	hr0ulde	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr0ulde/
44zon0wk	If they’re not doing anything to improve their mental health and not actively working on it, that’s a red flag. I have had anxiety since I was a kid but I went through therapy and am taking medications for it. Also have a counselor I can talk to which helps me work through some stuff. I’ve fallen into the trap of trying to “fix” someone who needs real professional help and is not at a good place in life to be dating. It’s very exhausting and takes a toll on you, and there are men out there with mental health issues who will use their condition as a free pass to gaslight and abuse you. With your date, you dodged a bullet and months of heartache. Count yourself lucky he showed his true colors from the very beginning and the trash took itself out	1641179386.0	hr0wlox	t3_rukyak	t1_hr06sz1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hr0wlox/
44zon0wk	Reading the book “Attached” helped me notice some red flags that I’ve experienced with avoidant men in the past. One thing is that they may mention a woman they met in the past that they were really into at first but then found some flaw that turned them off. I had an avoidant ex mention that he always found something wrong with the women he dated by the third date but with me I was still amazing and perfect then so I should be proud I made it the farthest. I was only 20 when I dated him and looking back I was able to tell he had an avoidant attachment style from the very beginning. They’ll put distance between those close to them including family members. The same ex would speak highly of his mother but also mention a weakness of hers he doesn’t like. He also would talk about one of his close friends but bring up a flaw of theirs. If a man says negative things about other people, he’s probably also going to say something bad about you to others.	1641180454.0	hr0z0ya	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr0z0ya/
f1bnc5re	Don't be so hard on yourself. We are human and we have moments of weakness.

caxkcnil	Our grandpas protected their wives, and took care of them financially. Young women married for security and a bit of “freedom” away from their families.  Today, scrotes want a barely legal bang maid, who he will emotionally abuse and hit in bed, on top of making her pay the bills for him. If she doesn’t she’s a GoLd digger, and she’s told he’s not heR faThEr.   These men are predatory youth diggers. They should be ashamed of themselves. There’s nothing to gain from dating them. Most of them won’t even fulfill their girlfriends emotional needs.

f1bnc5re	It's alright, I have a much healthier understanding of relationships now so nothing like what he put me through will happen to me again.  But yeah, not interacting with your posts is a red flag, and even more of a red flag is him not posting you. I don't mean that he has to post a pic of your date nights every week because in my opinion that's too much. But every once in a while is fine, or tagging you in stuff, mentioning you, etc. depending on how often you're both on the platform.  As contradictory as this sounds, don't even let your guard down then. Him posting you could be for a myriad of reasons, from insecurity to appeasing you to lovebombing to showing off for his buddies. That doesn't mean he's still not a whore 🙃  Also, keep a throwaway/blank account on standby so you can look at his stuff and potentially see all the things he's hiding from you.	1641185275.0	hr19f8j	t3_ruskk4	t1_hr186pq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruskk4/what_classifies_as_social_media_red_flags/hr19f8j/
8w9ask4b	In other words, one can infer that when he's around women irl, he's a mansplainer.   He didn't realize that he's a mansplainer until he was arguing online (, which is something that most people (I think) with the ability to control their impulses and the wisdom to know that their precious time is better invested elsewhere, don't do).  Now that he realizes that he's misogynistic, he may tell women (and maybe men, depending on the circumstances) irl that he now knows that misogyny is real.   That's all that I gained from his post.   I wonder if he'll ever catch himself mansplaining irl.	1641185559.0	hr19ze2	t3_rssu7e	t3_rssu7e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hr19ze2/

2tfkr8e	Truthfully, with children, it is still really shitty if you do things traditionally. It is *so much work* and lack of freedom. Even if your partner *actually* did half.  My husband actually does half including emotional labor (like, my child has a small growth and he went to two primary care appointment and has been coordinating with the dermatologist and urologist to have it taken care of). It still is emotionally crushing. You're taking your free weekend time and splitting it amongst 3-4 people instead on 1 person. You spend your time on home maintenance or scheduling home maintenance, soccer practice, more stressed at restaurants because children are still learning turn-taking in conversations. Like, my child loves the neighborhood children, and the neighbor are uninspired and no one I would consciously hang out with. But that's what I did yesterday because she's a person too and me drinking to stem boredom and meaninglessness in the interaction was a kindness to her. And yes, you could just not have you children participate in society socially, but that's a pretty shitty thing to do to someone you've created.  TLDR: married life with children is still not joyous, even if you have a contributing partner. Unless: you have lots of money to mitigate the time obligation of children OR children are going to Grandma's one weekend a month OR you opt out of truly considering your child's emotional-social needs as a person.	1641192262.0	hr1lm3f	t3_ruqx4w	t1_hr136ca	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1lm3f/

c9exsear	Post like these make me question everything I believe about the concept of marriage. It pokes at a hidden part of myself; a true dichotomy I live with.  I’m so torn about marriage. Is it a wonderful part of life; something to desire and hold and cherish? Or is it a trap of some sort, like having your leg caught in an iron toothed snare?  I use to work with a gal years ago who was just about exclusively attracted to married men. She bragged about her days as a dental hygienist. She ended up having a full blown affair with the dentist she worked for, who was married and had kids. Their marriage blew up and his wife left him. After all of this, she moved cities…and kind of started her quest over again. She never expressed an ounce of remorse for what happened in that marriage, she would actually talk about that dentist and how much she missed him.  She had a system for seducing married man. And, it wasn’t complicated. All she did was employ specific tactics; flatter/compliment, make herself sound better than the wife and/or have qualities and attributes the wife didn’t, signal interest, and laugh at everything he says.  There’s no wondering why married men have so much opportunity to cheat, when women like her exist.   I honestly believe all married men will cheat given the right opportunity/circumstances. But a part of me doesn’t want to believe that because if I did, I could never congratulate anyone on an engagement.   So complicated for me.	1642530895.0	ht7jtnb	t3_s6mv67	t3_s6mv67	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht7jtnb/

I don’t expect people to side with their daughter in law, even if it’s the right thing to do, they always seem to side with their family/sons. Despite what people say a daughter in a law is most of the time seen as a stranger, she’s not blood. Other subs have proven this to me.   The mother in this post probably wasn’t supportive of her, like ever. She probably disliked her since day 1.

Blocked and deleted.   - triangulating me with an ex or a dream girl that exists only in his mind “I’m looking for a woman who is like this and who does that” when no one asked in the first place  - word salad, gaslighting, instead of apologizing. The man is emotionally immature and has a fragile ego. If you’re an adult and you can’t self reflect and apologize for something you did or said, I don’t want you in my space.   - if he apologizes only to get something from me. You don’t apologize to people because you want their attention back, but because you know you made them feel bad and you regret it. If you don’t understand that, you lack empathy  - if he waits for me  to reach for my purse instead of immediately taking care of the bill.

3bii2bnm	Erm  I do meet some Pickmeisha’s with a similar bitter mindset tbh  They’re the type who take pleasure in tearing attractive women down or anyone they’re envious of   Maybe cos one bullied them in school  Most grow out of it…but some do not  They’re still the same at 55, the severe ones   As in they have too much internalised misogyny   But I think women are more capable of levelling up and getting a grip than men are  Men hold grudges against the entire female sex bc ONE woman they liked politely rejected them in school  Or they had one bad experience  It’s always ppl with fragile egos   They get stuck in a fixed mindset   Rather than a growth mindset  Healthy ppl can process shame & embarrassment & learn from it. Basically they can take an L  Fragile people cannot, they chronically avoid facing themselves & take it out on others subconsciously   This is why therapy wouldn’t work on a covert narcissist   They’d just use it as a way to get sympathy & not change   When most women have suffered multiple and still find it in them to give men a fair chance   Honestly the older I get the more I realise peoples limitations   Contrary to what we’re told…some ppl will never change. They will go to the grave as problematic   And by trying to ‘fix’ them too long you can become an enabler or end up collateral damage   I think some will always end up ‘stuck’ on a certain level  Bc they’ve been snowballing so long it’s second nature- & they can’t take harsh truths.   They’re almost resistant to anything except admiration, no matter how rude they get.   If they can’t even keep it real with themselves   How can they with you?

When my high school bf (we dated for a long time, but I wish we hadn't because he ended up being...well...a POS) found out I was a virgin and wanted to wait a while before losing my virginity (he lost his at THIRTEEN), he looked surprised, then irritated.  I'm pretty sure that having a large chest has effected how men see me in in relationships, too. Before meeting my fiancé (I live abroad in an Asian country) it was SO hard to find someone who wanted to settle down with me. They were all literally just looking at my tits and going, "Easy foreigner".

I know it is temporary and the effect withers away, that's why it's considered something minor and with little to no consequences in the future.

One time a woman was particularly enthralled with my dad and had her daughter calling him dad. Next visit, new woman. If a man wanted to bring his daughter on a first date, I’d probably just block. The only exception I’m making is for men I’ve known for 20 years (since high school) I’ve pretty much seen their children grow up on social media, I feel invested lol.

c2houkih	>I had my first period when I was 9 years old. My mother barely explained what it was  Same and same! I thought I was bleeding out of my asshole when I saw it, since I had no idea that periods were a thing. I got absurdly tall, darker, hairy, and got massive hips after that and was bullied by this short asian girl who hadn't hit puberty yet but was a year older than me that everyone had a crush on. I know the stereotype is that when you hit puberty early you become more sexual looking and everyone's into you but I think that whole 'all men are pedophiles' thing is probably true and generally found me less attractive after I hit it. It also thrust me rather abruptly and early into all the absurd rituals women go through to look like they didn't hit puberty (e.g. body hair removal, weight loss stuff to avoid the curvy fat distribution exacerbated by hip bone growth that happens during puberty etc.). I think I got sick of body hair removal, makeup, basically any attempts to actively look feminine because I was thrust into looking masculine (i.e. being tall and hairy) at a relatively younger age than basically everyone else and had to deal with its consequences, as a woman, so much earlier.	1643171739.0	hu95ue6	t3_scg0vi	t3_scg0vi	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scg0vi/we_need_to_talk_about_being_overly_visible_then/hu95ue6/

eccrgoa1	I got my period at 12 after my guy friend punched me in my stomach. My mom was nice to educate me and show me how to use pads, my father also bough them for me, bo problem there.I grew up athletic and tomboyish in an upper middle class neighborhood, but my mother was obsessed with buying me dresses and showing me off to her rich friends. I constantly got dirty and ruined said clothes which got me grounded. She always told me that I have the looks to marry up so I slowly came to the every feminine thing that existed. Then I got into modeling school during high school and have witnessed some girls being sold to rich men, harassed, touched, drugged. After finishing hs and decided to live by myself and worked side jobs where I have been reputedly preyed on by men in any situation. I worked on hotel reception, grocery store, bars clubs and art galleries and had loads of creepy men following me around or attempting to put something in my drink. Men who had any power over me (bosses, supervisors)always tried to take advantage of me but I managed to fake ignorance and they took pity. Then I got into good college by myself , not asking my parents of any help. Other girls constantly backstabbed me and gossiped to the point that I didn’t bother telling them anything personal. Men in college made bets on who sleeps with me first. I was critically underweight and stressed out. Men always, absolutely always tried to take advantage of me and lie to me and then pretend they didn’t do or say anything, so I never drank at parties and didn’t go anywhere alone.I hoped this will end once I go into workforce but so far, even when I try to be professional, the moment I smile too much or chat too long, men take that as a sign of interest. They try to help me out too much. When I dress down and don’t wear makeup they don’t recognize me. It’s really frustrating, especially when I just want to be seen as a person, not an object of attraction.	1643181130.0	hu9loly	t3_scg0vi	t3_scg0vi	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scg0vi/we_need_to_talk_about_being_overly_visible_then/hu9loly/

61vs699a	Don't give up! There are men out there who love their wives. They're rare as all hell, but they exist. It's not often that I look around a crowded room, see a man with his partner, and think, "He'd never cheat on her." But they are out there! My dentist, for example, has photos of his wife and children  EVERYWHERE, and even though it's sexist he basically ignored me when I was speaking to him. Not in a way that minimized my needs, but he would answer my small talk by acknowledging me and then glancing at the (female) radiologist or looking at my husband. This, to me, showed that he was not interested in being friends- he was there to do a job. He was kind, professional, thorough, but aloof. It honestly made me feel a million times better to know I didn't HAVE to entertain this man.    I will admit that my husband has never rented a carriage. However the other night when he forgot to make my "sleep milk" I got mad over it and he went out the next day while I was still in bed to buy flowers and sweets, and drew a handwritten notecard to top it all off.    I normally dismiss stories like this as total BS, but you don't have to believe. Some bakery sweets and grocery store flowers don't make for a tall tale- what impressed me was the thought he put into it, and his desire to do better. And he's not perfect! We still fight! But he's invested. And this, for anyone who is reading, is (above all) how I know that if men WANT to, they WILL. And love DOES exist, but here's the thing: men are simple creatures, capable of complex thought, but they're not used to having to think critically because they live life on "easy mode" (little flipped PUA humor for yall :). It's not your job to coddle them into acting decent- it's our job to make it very fucking clear what we expect, and hold them to that standard. And if they don't perform?

Unfortunately I was *completely unable* to process what she was saying to me. It was literally as if she was speaking in riddles.

f4fr272a	For as long as mothers and fathers have different roles in society, and take up different degrees of a family's burden, refusing to date single dads will never be equivalent to refusing to date single moms.  A single mother won't go out of her way to date men to get someone to babysit her kids, change their diapers, take them to school, make them food and become their second mommy who takes a primary parenting role.  On the contrary, single fathers constantly try to get unsuspecting women to become mothers to children they don't know or necessarily want to be the primary patent for. It's one thing if a family naturally forms this way and it's a mutual desire from both parties who contribute equally, rather than done through coercion and guilt-tripping, but many women who've dated single fathers have had different experiences.	1643202295.0	huaes66	t3_sd475z	t3_sd475z	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sd475z/eve_doesnt_date_single_fathers_or_cultural/huaes66/

7j04w333	The funny thing is I’m incredibly emotionally intelligent when it comes to sensing what people think, their motives, how they’re likely to behave etc. I could give a *good* psychological read on people. But I’m always dismissed as almost being socially and “not understanding” people because I don’t seek people out or prefer to be around them. I’ve even had men who were wayyyy below my league and out my age range feel the need to tell me this, while also thinking they could get in my pants. Which is outrageously socially gauche and fucking stupid.  People don’t realize even charisma does not relate to emotional intelligence of understanding how people feel and where they’re coming from. Some of the most charismatic men I’ve met have also been some of the most emotionally unintelligent and stunted and unable to see what others feel that I’ve met.  I feel it’s usually the go-to when anyone feels they need a point to make me feel less than or show I’m not so perfect, when they can’t compete with me on any other point	1643207573.0	huapzu5	t3_scz4ya	t1_huabyu7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scz4ya/when_they_tell_you_to_settle_for_the_guys/huapzu5/

Most women are brainwashed by patriarchy  and have lots of shallow reasons of why they don't like you, I wish there were more FDS groups but the reality is that female groups are mostly toxic.  I found self-exclusion and (yes, I know it's bad) floating with men group and suffer from lack of support and harassment much easier than trying to deal with a pack of hyenas that were female clicks .  And I was accepted by men mostly because I was valuable and good at what I was doing. I hope FDS queendom will make this world better.	1643307940.0	hugzcai	t3_sd10zu	t3_sd10zu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sd10zu/the_female_dating_strategy_podcast_ep_47_catfight/hugzcai/
5eak10lg	Your best friend and my “best friend” should be best friends! I’m literally in the same predicament as you. My best friend has been a hoe since high school. I never cared because it never affected me until it just did about two weeks ago. She doesn’t respect any type of relationships. She just does what she wants. I found her Twitter where she’s talking shit about me on the most random things, even tweeted on my birthday that she doesn’t care about other people’s birthdays. She’s doing some type of situationship with her nasty ex who she cheated on pretty much the whole 5 years they were together. They were abusive too each other, him being the main abuser. She called the police on him which got him a felony. After ALL of this he gets her name tatted. They deserve each other and I’m honestly happy they are back together. It’s gonna be another shit show but this time I won’t be around to rescue her. I wish I trusted my instinct to fall back when she was putting me in the middle of their toxic relationship, but anytime I tried to she told me I’m a bad friend who doesn’t love her unconditionally. My plan is to slowly go no contact. It’s going to be hard because we are roommates, but as soon as I get a new job I’m breaking my lease. They way your friends treat their SO and other people is a big sign on how they will treat you.	1643317319.0	huhp0fx	t3_se5ddo	t3_se5ddo	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/se5ddo/thinking_of_dropping_my_lvf_friend_because_of_her/huhp0fx/

9ezhzdju	I went on a date with this guy once who wasn’t super forward with his intentions but like it was obvious from the way he flirted he wanted to hook up. I ignored it because I was like ok nothing new. After the date ends, I go home, get ready for bed and he FaceTimes me. I answered and he was like insinuating wanting to have facetime sex which honestly made me laugh, I was thinking is he 14?? Anyways, I tell him that I have a high sex drive too but that I will not have sex with him or anyone until I have commitment. And he goes what you want commitment on the 2nd date??? And I was like you wanted sex on the first!! We never hung out again but he somehow keeps finding me on Hinge and reaching out. I’ve reported him 11 times already.	1643336707.0	huj12nt	t3_sdyarp	t1_hufztfq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sdyarp/the_bar_is_in_hell/huj12nt/

bpbux1pi	So I work in a male-dominated industry at a Fortune 100 company. The leadership roles are overwhelmingly occupied by overweight, balding, greasy looking white men in their 50s and up. All of them have wives who either stayed at home or worked part time and they're blissfully unaware of how her sacrifice catapulted them into careers well beyond their competency level. Men aren't born leaders, they're standing on the shoulders of the women around them.  Without a woman around, modern men are out here with their "demons" aka addictions and mental health issues and broken dicks in hand asking for a seat at our tables.	1643350469.0	hujt4fj	t3_sej43k	t3_sej43k	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sej43k/the_male_visceral_reaction_to_women_not_wanting/hujt4fj/
3bii2bnm	What I was thinking  The brain only stops developing at 25  And amazingly you see through a lot of BS after 25 - that you didn’t b4  A young girl should have it drilled in their head - older men are predators, from the day they are born.   It was drilled in my head at a young age and it didn’t stop old creeps trying me.   I never saw them in a sexual way tho.  Just creepy & predatory.   Even 18 year olds preying on me at 15, could not be trusted & had a massive leverage. Let alone older.   Maybe the parents did warn & she rebelled  Or maybe they’re ‘cool parents’ & let her do what she wants at 18   An 18 yr old and 35 yr old men are not level in life experience at all   There’s a huge difference between a 22 yr old and a 28 yr old.   If anything men still single past 30 get extremely insecure, controlling & desperate .   They will start going younger once they’ve been spat out too many time’s & realised women their own age won’t tolerate them	1643366785.0	hukfni4	t3_scpruu	t1_hucajqo	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scpruu/scrotes_dont_know_what_they_want/hukfni4/
25rwu06r	If you are sexually attractive to men, you can get away with a lot with men focused on their lust. They either bear in the hopes of still getting some pussy at the end. Or they simply don‘t take it seriously and are not threatened at all. Most men, especially those who know how much damage they could do physically are not intimidated by women’s threats in this scenario.	1643367777.0	hukgzhd	t3_semlve	t3_semlve	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/semlve/i_just_learned_how_to_be_mean_to_men_diary_of_a/hukgzhd/
h57msag5	OP I'm WLW so I would like to provide you with a perspective on normal courting behaviour when interested in a woman:  I'd been dating LVX for **a month** when her birthday came round. She insisted I needn't feel obligated do get her anything. I adamantly insisted that it would be my pleasure to treat her on her special day.  I made dinner reservations (even bought myself a new suit for the occasion) AND gave her a thoughtful gift AND ended the evening in my candle-lit home WITHOUT having sex. She was my Queen and I wanted her to feel pampered and cared for.  A box of cookies that do not fit your dietary wishes ... wow. Neither thoughtful nor high-effort.

c2houkih	The funny thing is I'd imagine that your appearance factored into his decision to date you and that you look relatively better as a result of how you eat. It's funny because men like the *results* of healthy eating in women, yet they completely disregard how much effort, discipline, and restriction it takes. The only time my weight has skyrocketed has been in the early stage of dating with a man when they convince me to basically stop compulsively calorie counting and constantly order takeout. The only time I've struggled to lose weight has been when I had to juggle extremely low calorie days with the reckless binge eating days encouraged by men. It's so much easier maintaining a healthy weight or sticking to a diet alone.	1643381421.0	hul6hpa	t3_seg6ai	t3_seg6ai	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/seg6ai/i_dumped_the_guy_i_was_vetting_over_the_birthday/hul6hpa/

f019v	There was a question like this posed on one of the women centric subs not long ago. The woman was either extremely unwell, or had just recovered, and wanted to hire a male sex worker to make herself feel desirable again.  Almost unanimously, all of the commenters told her not to do it, that she’d probably just end up feeling worse and that most male SW are used to male clients, so may not be technically proficient, either.  She went anyway and posted an update - the guy tricked her and stole her money. He asked for the money upfront, then just left whilst she was getting undressed.

3x7ttzui	My worst. After 4 years of off and on drama; physical altercations; multiple times catching him cheating; STDs; his sister trying to publicly fight me; etc. I was done and he knew it.   This fool shows up to my house unannounced and I ofc refuse to let him in because it’s over. He then proceeds to call the cops to my house saying I left my (not his) daughter alone in the house when I was right next door at my neighbors saying hi. And these were tiny NYC apartments so I mean RIGHT next door. I heard the cops knock so I came out. Of course they yelled POLICE like crazy people so she hid (they heard her running through the apartment I guess).  They tried very hard to make it all my fault even after I told them their time had actually been wasted by a disgruntled fool, not me. But ultimately they realized they didn’t have a leg to stand on and left.  So cheating, diseased, dysfunctional family scrote can’t get his way so he tries to get my daughter taken away by the state. I always knew he was capable of such nonsense and that’s why I terminated the pregnancies that resulted from him forcing unprotected sex on me and am living happily free of his nonsense to this day.   He went on to get married to one of the people he cheated on me with (he actually went so far as to tell me she was his cousin and have me send her money on his behalf). Impregnate her. Impregnate another woman around the same time. Their babies were born around the same time. Wife finds out about baby via an STD I believe. Wife eventually leaves him and takes herself daughter back to home country. Side piece rejects promotion to main dish. Side piece then decides their son is better off with him. He’s now a single dad lamenting how hard it is 😂 He has a total of 4 kids by 4 different women and none of them want to be with him. 😂😂😂  Didn’t completely dodge that bullet but dodged the worst of it - being part of his baby producer harem.	1643385570.0	hulha2u	t3_sern3y	t3_sern3y	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sern3y/if_you_wanna_see_a_mans_true_character_break_up/hulha2u/

The only way for her to experience an awakening would be if finally got the urge to do something for her self, like going back to school. But it sounds like she's even given up on that, if all she can muster is tell her daughter not to repeat her mistakes.   Sidenote: Telling your kids to not repeat your mistakes rarely works. Showing your kids by breaking the cycle yourself has far more powerful impact.	1643397231.0	humcrqw	t3_se9sr8	t3_se9sr8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/se9sr8/this_made_me_so_sad_this_woman_has_to_watch_her/humcrqw/
