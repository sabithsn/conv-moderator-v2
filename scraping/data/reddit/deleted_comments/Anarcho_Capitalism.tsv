gvy0s	I did not talk about government mandates. I am very against them. I talked about getting mad a private company made their own mandate. That's the opposite of anarcho capitalism. We are not a socialist government democrats and Republicans are capitalists who socialize the success of capitalism. I will agree we're a corpocracy. A lot of democrats probably lined their pockets from the pharmacy companies. I don't believe in a federal government in the first place but vaccines work and mRNA vaccines work. Can we talk about property laws?	1642707843.0	hti0r89	t3_s8md7y	t1_hthycs1	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8md7y/carhartt_fuck_this_private_business/hti0r89/
gxe1v27t	You’re clumping a bunch of things that don’t really have much in common with one another. Those who were rioting and looting would identify themselves as being on the far left end of the spectrum. Those who support tax increases and ‘socialised healthcare’ would identity as centre-left.  Now, I’m not a upper-middle/lower-upper class white liberal who makes $200k-400k a year but I can say confidently that being wealthy does not exclude you from progressive politics. You can be wealthy and also want to see those from lower classes have access to healthcare or have more funding for public schools. Not everyone has the mindset of ‘I’ll only vote for what benefits me’, I personally vote for what will better my country, because rarely do political parties have policies that’ll directly benefit me.   New York in particular has always been more progressive than most places in the U.S. It’s acted as a hub for internationalism, progressivism and diversity for decades, and whilst there are divides amongst different parts of New York, wealthy liberals *do* exist and don’t mind having to pay more tax if it means better funded public schools or public services.   I remember reading about 100 millionaires who wanted the government to tax them more to help distribute wealth better and provide for the working-class. Rich people wanting to help the less fortunate isn’t a myth, albeit it isn’t as common as I’d like it to be.	1642710862.0	hti7pmp	t3_s8s1vo	t3_s8s1vo	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8s1vo/what_do_affluent_white_liberals_get_out_of/hti7pmp/
gvy0s	Not at all, I honestly don't see much of a difference between the left and right. They're both trying to get power in their own way, but one side literally just tried to overthrow our democracy. You can complain about it but I don't see what it has to do with anarcho capitalism.	1642710870.0	hti7qfj	t3_s8md7y	t1_hti6glu	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8md7y/carhartt_fuck_this_private_business/hti7qfj/

When we had a corporate tax rate in the 90s, society had a fucking explosion of benefits.   I do think government is corrupt, the only problem is most anarcho libertarians have no problem holding their nose and voting for a republican statist - while most anarcho communists hate dems and repubs equally and refuse to vote for them. So who is really practicing what they preach? You guys are mostly republicans that want to smoke weed and pay less taxes. Guess what? That's just a young republican, not an anarchist of any kind.	1642741035.0	htk5zqe	t3_s78bxb	t1_htk4ctt	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s78bxb/when_antiwork_finally_gets_a_job_only_to_have/htk5zqe/

a42h7iy9	Yup, a lot of conservatives poke around here thinking workers joining to bargain together = COMMuNISM  The argument that government regulations make this somehow against anarchism is wrong as there is a helluva lot more partnership and power between industry and government than there is government laws legislating rights of workers. And people banding together to collectively make an influence, is more in the spirit of anarchism and decentralization of power than some industry titans who have already benefited by government legislation butting heads over who gets the bigger end of the pie the government cuts for them (ie, who is the better pet....its actually sad to see the power that certain companies could have but they just waste it...often citing they do so out of responsibility to their "employees" that in other circumstance theyd lay off to preserve the company).   Giving a shit about working class does not = communism.  That's caring about most of the people on earth whose labour provides most of the things we call ESSENTIAL, and yes, it's undervalued compared to someone who sits in a boardroom. Theres lots of shit that goes on to keep the average person out of genuinely competing in the free market. There aint no free market right now.	1642743190.0	htka1dy	t3_s8vmrr	t3_s8vmrr	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8vmrr/i_think_this_sub_is_full_of_people_who_dont/htka1dy/

I guess the question is… how come I have to reconcile the fact that I wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for slavery. My great grandfather was born a slave in Columbus MS, the product of a rape by my great great grandfather against my great great grand mother his Slave.  All you are doing is supposition. Teddy Roosevelt has had his Time in front of one of America’s great institutions, sitting on a horse towering over two Natives, taming these “Brutes” and lording over the land stolen from them and destroying their nations and utilizing the land to populate it with Enslaved Africans to build an economy from free labor.   Black people have had to reconcile hundreds of years of this atrocity-the privilege and legacy of white folks frees them of having any reason to observe or honor to the past by knowing it should never happen again. Teddy going to a new museum somewhere is fine.  Decolonizing our public spaces is mindful and empathetic. and making way for new voices and a vision for the future with knowledge and respect for the past and how it benefits many and terrorize many others.	1642761524.0	htkzw9a	t3_s8zs1c	t1_htkckwq	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8zs1c/without_the_government_how_can_we_erase_history/htkzw9a/

fpbeozg2	How is this different than **"that's not real communism"** that I hear about all the time?  It seems hypocritical to mock the other side for dismissing their flaws with the no true Scotsman defense, and then using the same defense when someone sees a problem in a capitalist country.  Capitalism allows for high inequality.  High inequality leads to the rich and corporations buying politicians to get biased regulations, large subsidies, and free use of state violence.	1642865259.0	htr2vhd	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htp4j9g	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htr2vhd/

fpbeozg2	How does that relate to what I said?  Even if capitalism works good at first, the winners can change the system to give themselves free stuff.  If communists need to be responsible for what their system evolves into, so should capitalists.

fpbeozg2	I understand you're making a distinction, my whole point is that communists are mocked for making this exact same argument.  You understand the problem with communists dismissing corruption in the Soviet union as "not real communism", right?  Yet when a capitalist state evolves into cronyism, you use the same line.  So far you've changed the topic to individualism (which isn't the topic) and now you're just repeating the original thing you said while ignoring the point I made.	1642866135.0	htr4xih	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htr47j0	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htr4xih/
3vtyyfca	This is you but instead of “cops” it’s “black people”  Nah dude, I made other points too. But when I specifically said "my respect" it's because those”black people” that did nice things for people, I don't know them, I don't know of those events, so I can't have an opinion on those “black people”, I don't even know they exist. I can only base my opinion on a “black person” I have interacted with. And upon instigation of an interaction with a black person, at that point he has done nothing to deserve my respect. If he does something nice for me like these other black people you're talking about and he earns my respect, then I'll respect him. But not because he's a cop, in spite of it.  People keep saying cops deserve respect. No one deserves respect. Respect is earned.  And if those motherfuckers stripped me naked and made me take a cold ass metal prison shower I wouldn't be out here talking about respect.  Bro, about the shower part, it’s so they ensure you’re not a harm to urself or others… and if you’d knew that you wouldn’t be spending your time getting made about it you’d be accepting the mistakes you made to end up there (bc it was my own mistakes that led me there).	1642866750.0	htr6eim	t3_sa168t	t1_htr51fb	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sa168t/a_classic_you_probably_seen_before_had_to_post/htr6eim/

fpbeozg2	It's not false equivalence, both are example of the "no true Scotsman" fallacy.  Wealthy interests have tried, and succeeded in buying political power for their own gain in capitalist countries many times over.  Dismissing that is the same as communists who dismiss workers councils consolidating power for themselves.  >Communism has been attempted multiple times before. It failed to deliver on strong welfare, or it’s high ideals of utopian collectivism. It’s ended in famine, financial collapse, genocide, and dictatorships.   This is another double-standard.  Yes, the communists had genocides, so did capitalist countries.  If you think communists need to take responsibility for Holodomor but capitalists have nothing to do with the Trail of Tears or the Trans-Atlantic slave trade then you're being a hypocrite.  This isn't complicated at all, you're setting a standard and only applying it to one side.  You aren't even trying to apply these consistently.	1642868087.0	htr9lsc	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htr8opq	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htr9lsc/

fpbeozg2	You can't see the link between buying people to increase a private businesses profits, and capitalism?    Trying to call it "mercantilism" is like splitting hairs between socialism and communism.  It wasn't mercantilism, by the way.  Mercantilism is a policy of reducing imports and increasing exports.  These slaves were brought over to serve the interests of private interests who owned plantations.  It was not a national policy designed to improve trade balances, so I'd really like to know what you think "mercantilism" means.  As for forced collectivization, that increased Soviet agricultural output.  Ukraine s famine was artificial, it was closer to an ethnic conflict than an actual lack of food.  Even the CIA claimed the Soviets we're eating just as well as Americans overall.	1642871575.0	htriepk	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htreuox	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htriepk/

bxkwye1i	This seems like an own-goal. It establishes that a duty of care begins at conception, and it's not so far from that to a pro-life stance.   Once born, most people believe the parents are duty-bound to care for the child or keep it safe until they can hand care to somebody else. In other words, the baby has a claim to use their parents' bodies in a certain way.   Using a part of the body that evolved to care for the fetus is not the same as being a parasite or having an organ forcibly extracted (two common pro-choice arguments).   This could also be extended to people who smoke, drink or abuse drugs during pregnancy.   For what it's worth, I am a fence-sitter. To me, whether abortion should be legal depends on when that duty of care begins. I don't know when that should be.	1642941400.0	htvgh1q	t3_saktm1	t3_saktm1	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saktm1/what_do_you_think_of_this/htvgh1q/

54kvp	> You guys are all idiots if you think Trump was good.  Point me to the post in this thread where someone said that. Oh that's right, you can't, because you're arguing with a straw man.  > Go ahead and hate Biden, but acknowledge what an absolute train wreck Trump was or you have zero credibility.  Why would such a thing have to be acknowledged in a thread **specifically about Biden and no one else**? Really, explain that to me. Are you of the mistaken belief that a majority of people here supported Trump? If that's the case I'm sorry to inform you you're dead fucking wrong on that front, so unfortunately your go-to tactic of using a whataboutism "argument" in response to any Biden critique with "yeah, but what about Trump doing this and this..." doesn't work on us. The majority of us didn't vote for Biden. The majority of us didn't vote for Trump. Maybe this garbage logically fallacious argument tactic of yours works on a lot of the voting public, but not on a group of people who mostly votes either third-party or not at all.  Over 80 million people eligible to vote didn't vote. Nearly 3 million people voted for someone not named Biden or Trump. Combined, that's ~35% of eligible voters (and 2020 was an incredibly high turnout election; the non-voter percentage is normally much higher than that). It would do you well to remember that next time it enters your head to make a moronic whataboutism, straw man, assumptive "argument"...especially when speaking to a radical ideological group which you have very little understanding of.	1642992357.0	htyvf9c	t3_sb4eb5	t1_htyal5r	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sb4eb5/how_the_fuck_did_this_guy_become_president/htyvf9c/

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

14883j	Correct, to a degree.  Innovation in pharmaceuticals can certainly be driven by profit motive. Mostly for common, chronic, treatable diseases and disorders.  Other things, like cancer treatments, antibiotics, rare disease drugs, and curative treatments don't carry a good investment-to-return ratio. Investment is high, and potential volume is low. ROI would have to be seen over multiple lifetimes, rather than a few years or a decade.  The best framing to encourage that innovation would be PR rather than straight profit.	1642707937.0	hti10ik	t3_s8k63t	t1_hthecnw	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8k63t/common_critique_of_anarcho_captilism/hti10ik/

kovob	I was simply summarizing the rates they pay. Not getting into details of negotiated rates. That’s a whole different topic. The laws congress passes have direct implications on how medicare pays out. For example the 2011 2% rate cut really pissed off providers.  > Private insurers paid nearly double Medicare rates for all hospital services (199% of Medicare rates, on average), ranging from 141% to 259% of Medicare rates across the reviewed studies. The difference between private and Medicare rates was greater for outpatient than inpatient hospital services, which averaged 264% and 189% of Medicare rates overall, respectively. For physician services, private insurance paid 143% of Medicare rates, on average, ranging from 118% to 179% of Medicare rates across studies.	1642712508.0	htic7vt	t3_s88ink	t1_hti7usv	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s88ink/insurance_companies_can_suck_it/htic7vt/

346wd1yh	Man, this is infuriating. Thinking about how they prioritized the old and sick vs the young and healthy was disturbing enough but to hear a voice that echoes millions of others is especially rough. Seen in the light of people on reddit who have zero empathy in order to morally make a choice that is clearly right adds insult to injury.   They claim we live in a cult and call us selfish, but trying to make them see otherwise is a hopeless endeavor, ironically. I understand that their poor life choices has made them more susceptible to most illnesses, but how can they not see it being selfish to sacrifice the health of others for their own benefit.   It must be a combination of their IQ being at a level where they are smart enough to believe they could be intelligent, but just way too low to actually be considered intelligent by anyone with an IQ 10 points higher than a primate. Oh, and having an abysmally low EQ to top it off, probably just high enough to cry at a sad movie where the dog dies, in order for them to believe they couldn\`t possibly be sociopathic.	1642793675.0	htn0j53	t3_s99rhc	t3_s99rhc	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s99rhc/british_student_explains_how_terrible_mask/htn0j53/

Look at r/libertarian for fucks’ sakes. Place has been completely overrun by auth leftists, and is unrecognizable compared to what it was two years ago.   You guys are the ones doing this. Calls for censorship and blatantly obvious attempts to brigade subs are going to lead to fleeing to other sites and gatekeeping the very few subreddits that aren’t leftist echo chambers.

14883j	>George Floyd was a serial drug addict/dealer, abuser, alcoholic, and career criminal who had a lethal amount of fentanyl in his system at time of death, and was not compliant with police and there is video evidence of the whole thing.  Hey cosplayer.  I am a certified trainer in the use of physical restraint.  The restraint used in the execution of George Floyd was 100% the cause of his death, any intoxication and/or health problems were *contributing factors,* not causative factors.   Additionally, while much attention was given to the officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, which restricted airflow to the Ling and blood flow to the brain, there were an additional 2 officers restraining him, one of which was kneeling in the middle of his back. That *also* restricted his breathing by preventing full expansion of the lungs.  Lastly, the stress of the situation elevates catecholamine, which can also contribute to death, even after restraint has ended.   But, the real issue here is that you are a statist, this is evidenced by your first paragraph attempting to justify the execution of a private citizen by agents of the state.

What's more important IMO is a culture of liberty. Look at how certain US states responded to COVID restrictions versus a place like Australia.

aaqpyyp	Why was Ray Epps, a man who was on video multiple times clearly telling people they needed to breach the capitol building, taken off the FBI's wanted list and never charged with anything? The dude was on video talking to the individual who breached the first barricade seconds before the guy attacked the barricade.      The case against him is all on video viewable to the public. Yet the FBI didn't arrest him, and instead tried to make him disappear from their website.      When we combine this with the fact that over half the conspirators in the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot were FBI CIs or agents, and the history of the FBI creating plots where none existed, we have every fucking reason to question what role the FBI played on January 6th. All we can say for certain right now is that they did not play the role of a law enforcement agency trying to prevent violence or crime....which is part of their goddamn job.	1643143497.0	hu79x9s	t3_scgkta	t1_hu750b2	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/scgkta/how_many_more_years_are_we_going_to_have_an/hu79x9s/

Now no the company doesn’t need to give gifts but in 2022, a little Swiss Army knife, that might be considered a deadly weapon where you might need a permit to carry legally.

aaqpyyp	It would be easier to sympathize with the antiwork people if more of them had some identifiable skills or had a history of doing hard work.      Retail and fast food are tedious jobs that kind of suck, but they're not skilled jobs. And it seems like most of the antiwork people come from those type of professional backgrounds. They're not yokel or hoodrat level of uneducated. They could probably graduate college if they had the commitment.      And that's kind of the problem. They view themselves as smart, productive people but they refuse to develop the skills for a white collar job, and they think too highly of themselves to work a blue collar job or skilled trade.      Judging by the person in this video, a lot of them also suffer from the fact that their toxic personality and ideology is what really holds them back. HR departments see a sad loser with a bad attitude and they're not going to hire them at the smiley face everyone needs to pretend they're happy corporate office job.	1643207719.0	huaqc8n	t3_sd5wh0	t3_sd5wh0	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sd5wh0/they_found_a_mod_of_rantiwork_a_30_year_old_non/huaqc8n/
aaqpyyp	I kicked around at a couple of dead-end office jobs for 4 years after college. Eventually I just admitted that it wasn't working because my superiors liked having me in the production position I was in and had zero incentive to elevate me.      Instead of whining, I went out and got a teaching certification and did that for three years. I leveraged my experience as an English teacher to get a copywriting job, and that gave me the doorway into a career in marketing that's paid pretty well so far.	1643207957.0	huaqwik	t3_sd5wh0	t1_huanjyu	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sd5wh0/they_found_a_mod_of_rantiwork_a_30_year_old_non/huaqwik/
aaqpyyp	They're dumb. Their biggest commie-style argument they could make is one they aren't making. I'll demonstrate what they could be arguing rather than just demanding arbitrary wage increases.      They could advocate for mandatory stock sharing with employees for publicly traded companies.   Everyone knows Amazon would be crippled if all those delivery drivers went on strike tomorrow. Those drivers and warehouse workers are the people who really built Amazon, but all the financial awards went to Jeff Bezos, investors, and top management.      Imagine if Amazon had to give stock to employees as part of the compensation package. The bigger the company gets, the less percentage owned by the founder. This is actually pretty fair. Once a company reaches a certain size, it's continued success is largely dependent on the workers executing all the tasks they're given. It requires a lot of intelligence in executive strategy and management, naturally, but those people are already rewarded quite well for their contributions. Sharing stocks with employees would also benefit the entire middle-management and the lower-level office workers as well at the company. They get paid better than delivery drivers, but they're not seeing record-shattering wealth increases like the investors and company ownership are.	1643208499.0	huas78y	t3_sd5wh0	t1_huap50k	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sd5wh0/they_found_a_mod_of_rantiwork_a_30_year_old_non/huas78y/

Look at how the white house press corps reacted to Biden calling a Fox News reporter a stupid son of a bitch. They absolutely didn't care because they don't consider Doocy to be a peer worth protecting.

aaqpyyp	I always feel conflicted because I'm sort of left on a variety of social issues, but as an Army veteran from a working-class household, I feel like I've had to work hard to get where I am. No uncles or friends of the family opened any doors for me. I paid my way through college with zero parental assistance.      Basically, I don't feel guilty to be a straight white guy. I've worked with enough black people, Hispanics, and other races to feel like I personally don't owe them anything. I was working the same jobs as them, which means we had the same opportunity to end up in the same position.

aaqpyyp	Yep. Three days after my 16th birthday was my first evening stocking grocery store shelves. Also worked fast food and at a movie theater during high school. It wasn't just the work that convinced me to try and do better, it was the older people I met.      When you're 16, a 24 year old seems old to you. I guess they kind of are since they have 50% more life experience than you and have been a legal adult longer than you've been a teenager. When they're slinging pizzas at pizza hut making the same wage as you, you realize that you absolutely don't want to be in their position when you're 24.	1643210881.0	huay71v	t3_sd5wh0	t1_huatl80	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sd5wh0/they_found_a_mod_of_rantiwork_a_30_year_old_non/huay71v/

1i5iflj9	I think they prey on lonely people in general, and autists are often lonely.  I've noticed there are a lot of new trans people who work from home (like programmers). If they come out as trans in real life, most people will think it's weird. However, when they come out as trans online, their mind is on a constant rush of dopamine and validation from other people online who suddenly become your friends.  I've also noticed that lots of trans women online don't even make the effort to try to look like real women. They just change their pronouns in bio and let their hair grow. Imo this is because they don't even want to look like a woman, they just want to reap the "benefits" of being trans online.	1643218973.0	hubkke9	t3_sctsux	t1_hubafg1	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sctsux/genuinely_surprising_how_much_media_coverage/hubkke9/

wqutd	Idk. I went to the court to file for my divorce. They told me to bring three notarized copies. The guy took one copy and very slowly and deliberately flipped through each page. Picking it up and setting it aside then reversing the process so they would remain in order. You know, instead of flipping each page as he went. Then he walked it to a scanner 10 feet behind him and made three copies. Then proceeded to stamp the top of every page of both the original and the copy. The. Write the number and date on each of the stamps where there was a spot for it. I asked why he didn’t mark the document before making copies and he looked at me like that was the greatest idea he had ever heard. Two of the original notarized copies and one of the scanned copies was given back to me. They kept one notarized copy for the court.	1643221576.0	hubrxyx	t3_sd6v8w	t3_sd6v8w	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sd6v8w/must_be_the_government_at_work_all_that_paper_not/hubrxyx/

aaqpyyp	Imagine if federal and state bureaucracies were committed to modernizing their processes so that they could reduce expenditures and streamline services?      I don't just mean implementing self-service website interfaces. (Those are really great, btw)     I mean actually reducing the number of state and federal employees. So many of those fucking jobs are jokes but they refuse to lay off useless people. They've put up with lazy mopes for so long that they've lost the ability to create efficient programs. So rather than try to be efficient, they just lobby for even more positions to be created. And every damn one they create comes with decades of salary, benefits, and eventually pension payouts to burden the taxpayers with.      We need to stop the practice of government jobs, particularly federal government jobs, being "from hire till retire" positions. We need to have 3rd party auditors coming in, like every damn large company does, to evaluate where waste or unnecessary processes can be trimmed to cut down on overhead.	1643226758.0	huc6hav	t3_sdaq0g	t3_sdaq0g	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sdaq0g/but_what_about_roads_out_of_the_trillions_of/huc6hav/

Nor did their pace of work indicate that they were particularly interested in speeding it up.      I imagine that, being the IRS, they were aware that they could fuck up my paperwork and potentially cost me thousands of dollars if I didn't sit there and keep a lid on my growing anger.      It took less than 15 minutes once they finally called me back to one of the agents to provide them with additional information they had requested but that I didn't feel comfortable mailing to them (Wife's passport her first year in the U.S.)	1643227696.0	huc94to	t3_sdaq0g	t1_huc6wdf	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sdaq0g/but_what_about_roads_out_of_the_trillions_of/huc94to/

Since factories are “forcing the vaccine or you can’t work” ( which is part of our problem) then the factory is less productive aka not enough supply vs demand because nobody can/is working. (Which makes things cost more by the way).I think the forcing of mandates are a good start to stop, but who is forcing those mandates, your butt buddy Biden, but you don’t know that.	1643334721.0	huiwh4g	t3_sec47j	t1_huivsgq	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sec47j/we_warned_them_about_executive_order_under_trump/huiwh4g/

Does job require you to make a split second decision over your life or theirs if they possibly show intent to end yours based on there current mood? I doubt it. How about try their job for 1 week simce yours is so sweet. Why is it so hard to do what they ask so they are not forced to make those tough decisions. How many decisions did you make that you found out after the fact that you were wrong. Good thing that decision didn’t cost a life.

aaqpyyp	While it's blatantly racist to say he's definitely only considering a black woman, we have to look at the political calculation.      Without black people, particularly black women, Biden wouldn't have won the Democratic primary, and thus would not be president. So he owes them big time and a year into his administration has effectively delivered no signature wins for them. With what is shaping up to potentially be an epic congressional and senatorial bloodbath for Democrats in the 2022 midterms, he's unlikely to deliver any kind of big racist legislative win before he dies or doesn't run in 2024.      Essentially, he HAS to pick a black woman because this is going to be one of his only chances to deliver a win, and it's going to cost him nothing to do so. The donors and insiders he obeys don't actually give a shit who replaces Breyer as long as it's an extremely reliable/predictable center left judge with a nice authoritarian streak. They don't give a shit if she's an SJW or whatever, as long as she's pro-corporate, anti-gun, and has completely forgotten what the 1st, 2nd, and 4th amendments are supposed to mean.      The smart thing to do for Senate Republicans would be to put some token resistance but just let it happen. They can't really stop it, and Manchin and Sinema likely give zero fucks about who replaces Breyer as long as their donors are happy, which paves the way for 50 votes +1 smary cunt of a VP casting the tie-breaker in a made for TV moment. Hell, if the Republicans want to be really smart, they'll largely vote yes to whoever Biden's pick is just to suck all the oxygen out of the room for all the liberals looking for something, anything to show how Republicans hate "strong black women." It will cost the Republicans nothing to do this, because I don't think their voters are going to care much since they'll still have a 6-3 majority since McConnell and crew delivered ACB at the end of Trump's term thanks to RGB's timely expiration.	1643402076.0	humpkq6	t3_set0ah	t3_set0ah	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/set0ah/demanding_the_next_scotus_be_a_black_woman_is_the/humpkq6/
