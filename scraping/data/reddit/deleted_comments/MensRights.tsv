3nm0yp7g	There were posters like this in the boys toilets at my old school only telling young men that they’re abusers waiting to happen and in the girls toilets there were only posters warning them about men and as an ex victim of emotional abuse, the abuser being a woman, I find things like this awful. Anyone and everyone can be an abuser, it’s has nothing to do with gender or sex but it has everything to do with the quality of a person’s character and that is what we need to teach children not that every man is a danger nor that every woman is either, we need to teach children that everyone can be a danger but anyone can also be amazing.	1640881437.0	hqk82kv	t3_rryzhe	t3_rryzhe	/r/MensRights/comments/rryzhe/what_about_him/hqk82kv/

i36af5fg	I had a legal case against my crazy ex-wife and I've experienced every possible shitty thing.  It's been going on since years due to serious neglect and endangerment of the children (they'd be dead without me).  All of these things I've been told by officials, judges and people at court:  * If she marries a violent refugee after one month of knowing him and sitting beside him when he threatens to beat the children then she is a victim because she couldn't know that he would also be capable of beating her to a pulp at some point * We do not know how he was able to convince her to marry him so quickly (every excuse is made to not admit that she is unstable) * If I would officially report that she abused me when we were married then I'd get charged because I let the children witness me being abused (I was seriously told this) * If I would have called the police when she abused me I would have gotten arrested because police would never side with a man * If I'd show the video records I made of her abusing me and how out of nothing she turns bat-shit-crazy then I'd get charged because I wasn't allowed to have a camera running when she attacked me * When I reported that she neglected for years the children with proof from teachers and school directors (when we had shared custody) then they asked her if it is true, which she obviously denied. It was noted that I made this up * When I proved that she lies with nearly EVERY statement then the judge dismissed my proof. "she can't believe my employment records" and rather took the anectode of her how she was victim of a husband who refused to work and didn't help with the kids * My report of her neglecting the children is against her kind nature (according to the court psychologist who spoke with her for 2 hours and ignored every single proof I had of her unstable nature) * The court psychologist replied to me that it doesn't matter if the mother lies or not, it won't change the glowing report of how she is the best possible mother (and that I am just after money) * The judge attacked me angrily because I dared to report that I have to pay 100% of medical and school invoices, while having 100% of responsibility. Out of over 20 teacher parent meetings the mother attended 0. The mother was never asked to assist paying the bills. * It was noted that the mother is fully capable of handling school and medical matters, even if I had tons of proof that this wasn't the case and that she never even once did * When I begged child protection services to get involved because I needed someone neutral to be involved in the case and to confirm what I've been reporting with schools, they told me that they would help and that they will get in touch shortly before the court appointment.   Three days earlier they told me that they were wrong and that they are not allowed to get involved in ongoing court cases unless asked by the judge. * The judged started shouting at me at court how I dared trying to get CPS involved in the court case * I was requested to pay afternoon care for a jobless mother so the kids would also do homework at her place when I proofed that the mother in the middle of summer had no idea that her daughter failed class and had to repeat the school year. * I was blamed in not involving the mother enough in school matters. The women is fucking never responible for her own actions. Even if months earlier I brought tons of proof how the mother never ever cooperates or cares about school. The judge said that I "used my children" to get my point across for court and that I should have made a learning plan with the mother.    * Because these fucked up people believe that a narcisstic mother who not even once asked the kids their final exam results or helped them learn would suddenly care. * She doesn't even stand up in the morning or prepare lunch. I have photos how the kids went to school with fully moudly lunch boxes after spending some days with her (she never empties the lunch I prepared) * Nothing a woman ever does has any consequence * I was requested to pay an expensive course so she could learn to have more responsibility with the kids (instead of sending her to therapy and diagnose her personality disorder which could have helped the children) * She still ends up being painted being a woman who only has her children in mind * I had to attend and pay for myself a course where I had to make up her positive sides because I dared to report all the shit she's been doing. A mother who would skip cooking meals and let the kids hungry. She is a fucking bat-shit-crazy narcisst who fucking added her cheating sugar daddy to our daughter's phone so he can chat with her. * She was praised for having a more positive opinion about me. Because I fucking do and pay EVERYTHING for the kids while she goes 6 times a year on 3 week vacations with her sugar daddy. * It was dismissed as unimportant when I showed them proof how I have the kids 70% of the time when it was supposed to be equal. * The mother in the last lesson of fucking parenting course I paid her decided that she doesn't want shared custody any more. She went home, told the kids that they won't be spending as much time with her, sold their toys and clothes and moved to a different city. * Even if she only had the kids a few days during the summer, she dissapeared during one night. The kids locked themselves out of the appartment while searching for her and had to wait for her until 1 am on the building floor. * This had zero consequences for her even if the kids made an official statement for court that this happened * Now during the final court case the judge decided that every second week I HAVE to fucking drive the kids to their mom and pick them up. For no fucking reason at all except me being a man.   I know many divorced women and no one has to drive the kids to the father. * The mother has to pay zero alimony.  I could go on and write a full book about the shit I've experienced.  I fucking hate this fucked up piece of shit world.	1640901066.0	hqlmxk8	t3_rrwpon	t1_hqked7j	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwpon/be_wary_of_those_downplaying_the_crimes_of/hqlmxk8/

e5j1koem	From my experience in dating, if you ask what happened the man will always blame the woman instead of taking responsibility. 20/20 will say it's the woman's fault no matter who broke it off. Even if it's not marriage, just break up, if you ask what happened it's her fault no matter what. And when I asked one time 'and what did you do wrong' because I wanted to see some introspection and was fed up always hearing that all women are evil, the guy got upset. He started telling me that when women are raped you're not supposed to ask them what they were wearing so How Dare I ask what he might have done wrong when he was the victim and I found it very off-putting somehow.   I think it's not a red flag to ask what did you do wrong, I think it's just very poorly worded. I try to ask what they learned from their past relationships and tell about what I try to work on / improve.	1640945719.0	hqo0jd5	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqndnev	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqo0jd5/

A fucking police officer claiming self-deffense and "instant react time".   How is it possible for someone to even consider that fucking video self deffense? And he is a fucking police officer, bringing a gun to a dispute between 2 other people, annoying the already pissed dad, laughing at this face, and getting 2 meters appart and shooting him (thrice i think?) in the fucking chest.  "Split a second reaction".   The trained police officer who went with a gun and laughter at the disturbed father who was refused his own child had to make a "split a second reaction" to kill him in the chest when he approached.   Wow, the training did really payed off.   The woman is the only one to gain anything from this, but at least this time its not her fault. You can't control how motherfucker a police officer can be.	1640979838.0	hqpw5q0	t3_rsl1se	t3_rsl1se	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqpw5q0/

3610v2xw	Not necessarily discrimination more so saying that those communities are more at risk in a scientific sense because their environments are typically ones leading to the diseases that are most dangerous when you have covid. High blood pressure, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases that are products of the environment where fast food is more available that organic items. Or where medical facilities are overbooked because the population of three inner city blocks, where the main demographic is black or Hispanic, is already five to ten times more than an entire town or village in the suburbs.  This is just risk calculation and prioritizing based off of who’s the least likely to survive. It’s no coincidence that black women die more giving birth than other women by ratio, or high blood pressure being the highest in minority communities. I see your take but in this case, the science and stats say that much like someone in a immunocompromised position, they’re at a higher chance of dying. That’s just how it is. We should fix these environments if we want everyone to get an “equal” shot at treatment.	1640983190.0	hqq43o1	t3_rt2ify	t3_rt2ify	/r/MensRights/comments/rt2ify/new_york_state_denies_covid_antivirals_to_white/hqq43o1/

b0ukzw	That's pretty much what I said.  It does explore the reasons people do things, which is both interesting and relevant; painting bad people as bad for no reason does not help us understand our fellow humans.

In the very broadest sense I understand what you're saying and I *suspect* you're right, though I wouldn't have worded it like that. I'd have said "I wouldn't be surprised if..."  We can hold our suspicions, but it's not a great idea to say "I can assure you..." because, in the end, you can't. We can't build an argument that holds any logical water about articles *not* written.

Anyways people shouldn’t be telling you I hope you get raped, that’s just an awful thing to say to anyone. Also where did you receive these comments? Because stay away from Twitter, my advice to anyone, its a fucking shit storm. Finally, how do I stop getting notifs from this community, I’ll admit most people here have a better head on their shoulders than radical twitters but that’s not much, and I dislike the way they ignore crucial facts to distort evidence and make their points.  Yes, men may be more likely to be killed when they are in a physically abusive relationships, but women are still four times more likely to die in a physically abusive relationship, because men are that much more likely to physically abuse their partners! So if it’s a competition, you really don’t have the upper hand. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/warning-signs-intimate-partner-homicide-1.6269761 Sorry, I just don’t wanna receive notifs from this community anymore- and to OP, stay away from Twitter lol, and prolly tumblr as well, actually if you are twelve just stay away from the internet in general.

dkyx3t5s	In my opinion and experience, a ton of women do not count emotional support from a close male friend to be cheating. A lot of women do not count talking to another guy to get their emotional fill to be cheating at all. There’s supposed to be reciprocity in a relationship for men and women. If the man is not giving a woman enough emotional support and or “listening” to her enough, then she will go out and get it from someone who will. Often times that leads to a physical need being met eventually. That’s why when a man cheats it’s never ever complicated like that. Dude has an itch to scratch and goes and gets it scratched and still continues to love his woman with all his heart. Woman goes out and gets an itch scratched? It means she’s lost all respect for that dude and there’s no coming back from that.	1641136699.0	hqxwe57	t3_ru7o4z	t3_ru7o4z	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7o4z/why_do_women_cheat_and_blame_men_for_being/hqxwe57/

30ymvhrd	I read the same page. The headline says 40% are girls.   The actual text says up to 40% may be girls which isn’t the same thing.    Digging back further:  “associated with armed groups and forces totalled 893 in the 2018 report; four times more than the 216 recorded in 2017.  However, as girls are largely used in ‘support’ roles and kept away from frontlines,” (1)  Clearly they are counting non combatants as soldiers to create a misleading picture.  Just because someone supports the military effort in some distant way doesn’t make them a soldier.    Digging back even further this number is cherry picked from a single region of the world, and is not representative of global conflict as a whole. (2)    I see two related issues here:  1.  The UN once again focusing on females despite the fact far more boys are recruited to fight in combat.    2.  We should be concerned about any child being forced or coerced to fight.  Why make it a gender issue at all?   1.   https://reliefweb.int/report/world/child-soldier-levels-doubled-2012-and-girls-exploitation-rising    So, the 40% girl soldier headline comes from multiplying  at least 3 biases on top of each other.   First cherry picking one region of the world.   Second, counting girls not involved in combat as soldiers  Third.  Relabeling “as much as 40%” as being 40%.	1641144140.0	hqyedul	t3_ru8pxp	t1_hqyaw8w	/r/MensRights/comments/ru8pxp/i_stumbled_on_a_un_page_on_a_claim_that_40_of_all/hqyedul/

qus0l	You can't kick a woman so her ovaries ruptures and makes her infertile.  But a kick to the balls can, and therefore it's worse to kick a man down there.  Equality would be:  bust the nuts = break the ovaries.  Break/cut off the dick = Slice out the vagina and sew it up.   That's equality, but society hasn't learned to understand that yet, so they claim that this way of seeing it is unfair, brutal and misogyny, and thus proving they know shit about equality.  If you destroy a mans reproductive organ, you shall destroy a womans too.  If you destroy the tool that is used for the reproduction, you shall do the same to women.  If you're reading this while digging through post history, you're that re'tard that lost an argument and can't cope with **EQUAL** equality.	1641153135.0	hqz2rjx	t3_ru5stu	t3_ru5stu	/r/MensRights/comments/ru5stu/it_just_hit_me_that_society_doesnt_bat_an_eye_to/hqz2rjx/

dnvfuw21	I am late to this. I am a woman and my boyfriend has suffered so much because a jealous ex of his falsely accused him … over a year after they last slept together. She was jealous of his relationship with me and made stuff up. It caused me (an actual rape victim) so much harm — let alone the psychological damage it inflicted on my boyfriend, himself. I supported him through it and gently suggested therapy. He’s doing a lot better but I still get very panicked and twisty when I think about what she did.  What happened to you is not that rare. You were not just unlucky, you were a victim, and you were hurt. You will move through this, but give yourself plenty of time to process what happened to you. Your friends who turned on you do not deserve the privilege of knowing you.  You are strong and more resilient than you know. And it’s totally understandable that you don’t feel like that now.

1kcc8jns	I agree with you, but in an opposite sense on that last point.  Women distrusting men or people because of past experiences, is the same as a man doing it.  I would argue the real problem here is that women are allowed (In society, just generally speaking) to have this type of response, but if a Man has it?  He's an asshole and misogynistic?  So I agree, but I think being weary or distrustful based on experiences is arguably a good thing, and different from hating them, which I would disagree on, you shouldn't hate anyone based on a previous persons actions.  I just agree in general with your statement, because Men should also be given support and encouragement when they have the same issues women do.  As for the top 3, those are really more broad I think, but still fall under the same idea.    Your personal experience with being robbed should be given support and encouragement, color of skin shouldn't even be a part of the discussion per se, as it has no bearing or meaning to what actually occurred, you were mugged at knifepoint by a person.  It would be completely normal reaction for you to fear being mugged again, and this one I'd say hating it is valid even too.    You lost a person due to terrorism, which comes in many forms and from many religions depending on your perspective, distrusting terrorism is what you're doing, not a religion.  (Don't get me wrong, some people do translate this into straight bigotry, I'm just saying you don't have to, we're better than that)  Most importantly, you're a survivor of domestic abuse, it is not bigoted to distrust women, hate yes, but being a bit more careful is always going to be in the back of your mind.  The same could go if you were Bi-sexual, you could lose trust in men AND women.  It doesn't mean you should hate them, just learn from the experience, and get support and encouragement where needed.  Equal rights is about equal rights across the board, instead of thinking it as their bigotry is valid, it's not.  It should be about the support and encouragement you get for being wronged by whatever happened.  Distrust follows afterwards as a defense mechanism in my opinion, and is a valid response, hatred not so much (Depending on context, we all hate terrorism is a great example)	1641190196.0	hr1ibx2	t3_ruqxir	t3_ruqxir	/r/MensRights/comments/ruqxir/the_im_allowed_to_distrusthate_men_because_of_my/hr1ibx2/

bcqa7	Not to take away from anything you feel (because it is valid and well reasoned). Here it isn't too common for guys to have the snip unless they need it, but lots of kids have it done later in preteens without a problem.  I ended up having mine done for medical reason as a teenager. What they don't tell you is that if you have it done after puberty has started the pain you stuffer after the procedure for weeks is insane. I have a condition that causes me constant pain but I was not prepared for the suffering I went through. All I can say is that I truly wish I wasn't given the choice as a preventative measure.  Your view point is perfectly valid but some of the guys I have met who are upset about it don't know about these kinds of outcomes.  PS. Curse that nurse in the hospital who straight after the operation said I wasn't in pain I just had a pride issue. I hope it was ignorance on her part that she didn't realise that puberty complicated the procedure greatly.	1641169124.0	hr081xe	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hr081xe/
41hd9	No time for yourself? That may have been true in the 1800s when everything was done manually.  There is plenty of time for yourself during the day as a stay at home parent. Obviously the age(s) of the child(ren) matters... But for the most part, it's literally one of the easiest things a person can do.  "Keeping house" takes like 60min max of work a day. Pleasing someone else (especially someone you love) isn't a chore, it's not work. It's fucking easy. You can easily get 4 hours to yourself, every day, if you want. The time increases if you have any sort of support as well in terms of family, or child care opportunities.	1641173038.0	hr0hho4	t3_rua0p0	t1_hqzb8t0	/r/MensRights/comments/rua0p0/house_husband_makes_a_fool_out_of_insecure_tradcon/hr0hho4/

Getting 4 hours to yourself per day, even with children, is fucking easy. Grow up, and understand that parenting isn't difficult. Nothing a stay at home parent does, is difficult.

57q1g8td	I remembered going on a date with a woman, I did pay for everything, the second time she asked me to go on a date with her, without hesitation I did went on the date, unfortunately, we had an issue about paying for the meals since she refused too. She blatantly told me no she isn't gonna pay for the dinner and this will be our last time seeing each other. I told her I don't have a problem with that then I asked the waiter for the bill, I put my half with a tip then I told the waiter that she will pay for the other half and I instantly left without a word.	1642532841.0	ht7p3io	t3_s74yg7	t3_s74yg7	/r/MensRights/comments/s74yg7/she_went_on_a_first_date_with_an_older_guy_who/ht7p3io/
2mmrzff1	Fun fact: You can turn all of what you said around and it affects men way more.  "Men can't get raped", Women get default custody,  Most act of violence are comitted against men, Men in the USA do not have their right to vote by default unlike women, Economic difference has been rebuked countless of times. They didnt compare women and men doing the same jobs, they calculated all women vs all men. Men are more likely to do the dangerous and physical demanding jobs compared to women, thats why they earn more. Mens gentials get mutilated by default in the USA.  I dont even know...	1641157774.0	hqzfpqa	t3_rtycby	t1_hqzaj6n	/r/MensRights/comments/rtycby/in_2022_i_want_to_see_men_holding_women/hqzfpqa/
2mmrzff1	> Women can grape men  Not how society nor the law of many countries see it. In England rape is defined by unconsensual pentration with a penis. In Switzerland it's unconsensual penetration of a vagina.  > Most acts of violence are towards women from men as well as men on men violence.  And that changes what? Men face more physical violence. Why should women be... above men?  > unless you were a white man you’ve never had to worry about voting or being heard  White as in Anglo Saxons. So about 10% of the USA. Germans, Spanish, Portguese, French, Swiss, Italian, Greek, basically all Scandinavians but a few on the coast were **all not white**. In most countries the common men could not vote until around 100 years before women could. That means that for over 2000 years, men couldn't vote either.  > There are plenty of women in college and training right now to dominate those ‘hard labor fields of work’… my generation of females work just as hard as men  No they don't and they can't. Most women do not have the physical capacity of the average men. And all those jobs are still heavily dominated by men.  > And yes unfortunately men do get mutilated at birth, which should be changed and honestly is declining as new generations are born  No, they are not. Hospitals also do it by default and sometimes even when requested not to.	1641166705.0	hr021mk	t3_rtycby	t1_hqzh1mx	/r/MensRights/comments/rtycby/in_2022_i_want_to_see_men_holding_women/hr021mk/

f153moet	The breakdown of the extended family, and the resulting concentration of pressure on the shrunken nuclear family,  has arguably led to the breakdown of marriage. The breakdown of the extended family comes from the need and desire to move away from family for economic and other reasons,  and the far reduced birth rate. These are not replaced by other strong support networks,  as parents are too tired and stressed from constant work to fully connect with their surrounding communities,  and few genuine community facilities where people can meet, chat etc.	1642701886.0	hthkka0	t3_s8bbyd	t3_s8bbyd	/r/MensRights/comments/s8bbyd/i_feel_like_misandry_is_starting_to_become_a/hthkka0/

1effwhsq	I never saw the OP but your reply was hardly misogynistic, unless criticizing something a woman does is now misogyny.  The OP refused to engage in any sort of discussion with you and other posters who were asking where the misogyny and toxicity were in your post.   All her replies to you and others were merely ad hominem attacks that did nothing to move the discussion forward. Usually the person who resorts to personal insults is the one who feels they cannot defend their ideas or behavior.   This is how a small, yet vocal segment of a certain extreme ideology debate now. They use the same few buzzwords like toxic, gaslighting, abusive, narcissistic, sociopath, etc, to shut down any healthy debate and silence criticism.   They redefine these words to suit their agenda and use them as a cudgel to beat anyone who questions them into silence.  They don't want their beliefs questioned and they definitely don't want to have to defend them.   This is wrong on so many levels because there can be no real learning without debate and exploring one's own beliefs. Actively exploring and examining your beliefs is a basic tenet of learning.   It also minimizes the actaul trauma, abuse, narcissism and sociopathy that people are subjected to and are affected by in exchange for scoring some cheap points in a debate that is circular and never-ending.	1642728376.0	htje0fr	t3_ar0wyp	t3_ar0wyp	/r/MensRights/comments/ar0wyp/posted_a_reply_to_a_guy_on_ramitheasshole_whos/htje0fr/

People stranded on the side of a road get priority over someone at home that needs a jump start.  Obviously standing on the side of a freeway is dangerous versus sitting in your house with a dead battery or at the mall with a key locked in the car.     Saw it once with AAA here in the states.

dd74pbs3	This is a line of thinking that deserves more recognition.   When is it acceptable to use statistics to inform our behavior?  To protect a child? For years men were not allowed to sit next to unaccompanied minors on airplanes. Not sure if this is still the case. Most pedophiles are men.  To protect yourself? Is it ok to cross the street when you see someone you deem a physical threat? A man? A black man?  Most liberals / leftists have inconsistent answers. They think it’s ok for women to cross the street because “some men rape” but would criticize a man for crossing the street when he sees a black man with a “thug” appearance (“urban” dress).   In reality, we all know a middle aged guy of any race or color, wearing a polo and khakis walking down a suburban street is extremely unlikely to assault another man. Clothing communicates socioeconomic class. It’s not a rule, but it is informative.   What about a 20-25 year old, “thug” looking man, wearing urban type clothing? What if he is black or Hispanic? Statistically, that’s More likely a risk to another man.   The truth is that prejudice is sometimes unfounded, but it’s also sometimes based on facts.   The fact that women feel entitled to denigrate all men, or treat all men as a potential threat - but men aren’t entitled to do the same about anyone else, is the true hypocrisy of leftist women and narratives.   Either we are all allowed to speak in generalizations, and to act on them to protect ourselves, or not. Make up your mind.  The narrative on police shootings is a natural segue here, but I’ll leave that for later.	1643140753.0	hu72kts	t3_scbga4	t1_hu5mq96	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu72kts/

dd74pbs3	I think your logic is a bit flawed. I posted a comment in a similar vein and I believe my comment captures it better.   Blonde women are not any dumber than other women, on average. Are they? Gay men are no more likely to be pedophiles. These are stereotypes that are not based on facts.  Being gay in the military is a totally different question, I don’t see how that’s related at all.  You’re picking examples to highlight an argument, but the examples you’ve picked are not good ones because they represent inaccurate stereotypes.	1643145897.0	hu7gc6g	t3_scbga4	t1_hu5mq96	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu7gc6g/
