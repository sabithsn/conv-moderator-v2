14cz12	It's a little like when Julia Roberts went shopping in Pretty Woman and no one would help her. But instead of going home and getting backup and some self-respect, she just stole everything she thought was cute and put it all together in a blender and Bam! It's Kyrsten Smoothie.   She's wearing a bunch of pieces she obviously perceives to be high fashion. But that monstrosity of an outfit is wearing *her.*   The coat could be going for a Jackie Kennedy vibe. On its own, this is a very pretty piece. But there's no harmony here. The competition between the hemlines with the coat vs the busy dress peeking out is so distracting I almost missed the statement shoes with the giant decals on them. How, I don't know, because you can probably see those shoe decals from the moon. And I think Miss Kyrsten dropped/left her tiara somewhere, because that's the only reason any 5 year-old girl would get dressed up like this and skip the tiara.  And what the hell is with that bag? The big buttons on the coat are too close in scale to the dots on the bag, not to match perfectly. Are there puppies in that purse?! It certainly looks like some sort of mammal is being held captive. Does she actually want us to start calling her ~~Cruella~~ KKKyruella	1642705717.0	hthv2il	t3_s8nto0	t1_hthdg9c	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8nto0/kkkryrsten/hthv2il/

The whole Democratic party calling for him to fall on the sword and end his career over a single photo and some credible accusations is politics at its worst.

Im not denying Mitch's subtle racism, i cannot deny that. What i can tell you is that he OBVIOUSLY meant black americans vote at the same rate as Americas average as a whole.  Its honestly weird to see this sub get so angry at a statement like this while it simultaneously defends biden to death when he made comments about how Obama was the first main stream black american who is "articulate and bright", or if you vote for Trump that "you ain't black."	1642711660.0	hti9vir	t3_s8pkg0	t1_hthz7wz	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8pkg0/the_unspoken_part/hti9vir/

7b9bj	It would be 3 or 4%... do you really think the number has to be exactly the same to say "just as high"? Even if if he was 6% of, is that such a massive difference that black voters are now insignifiant to politicians? His entire point was that black voters are NOT staying at home in the polls. At this point yall are grasping at straws, it is quite obvious what he meant.   60% and 63% are essentially the same rate. That is like saying a porche doesnt go at a high speed because it hits 192 instead of 200 lol.   You can say im defending him, I am just telling you the facts. If facts defend him than so be it.

3vwjnuw2	No. Wrong. Nothing at all at the time regarded rural states. Just smaller ones.  The Senate is there to give each state equal voting power in the Legislative Branch. It was introduced because smaller and less populated states feared they'd be entirely strongarmed by large and more populated states.   It is there for the purpose of checks and balances and to encourage bipartisanship.  "On the final vote, the five states in favor of equal apportionment in the Senate—Connecticut, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware—only represented one-third of the nation's population."  Sauce: [Wikipedia History of the United States Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate)  It was northern, less populated states that wanted it.

Or the unelected, powerless parliamentarian would say 'nope' and Biden would roll over and say "oops! Guess we can't!" despite being entirely able to.  They aren't trying to help working people. They will promise a committee to discuss not letting millions of more die from covid/having a living wage/not killing brown people indiscriminately/not allowing corporations to run the economy etc but they won't take action. You defend them because they aren't the Republicans. They know they don't have to do anything because what are you going to do about it? Vote Republican?

1713up	That’s your opinion that it made sense 200 years ago and not today. I’m stating a fact that it was designed to operate that way. It is in fact, despite your dislike, “correct” that it was formed as a collection of states.  No level of frustration does not make that less true and it’s why the senate exists the way it does. In fact, the senators were originally appointed directly by the states themselves and not through a public vote. Because the senate represented the states and their rights and the house represented the people.   Maybe if you get more passionate about your alternate facts being correct that will make it magically come true 😂	1642785893.0	htmffbg	t3_s9agk7	t1_htm9dxp	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htmffbg/

8isfruvf	>maybe a bunch of white  You really don't have to say white people, you could just say slave owners but you have to make it inflammatory. Yes, the slave owners in America were mostly European. It is exhausting how much people blame "white people", regardless of involvement, hundreds of years later. Rich Americans were doing the exact same thing every "race" was doing around the world. Every single "race" was affiliated at the time, and "white people" were also enslaved. Poor "white people" didn't enslave people; people in power did. But hypocritical woke racists cannot help blaming everyone for the actions of a few. I promise you, my Irish ancestors had nothing to do with enslaving people while they were starving in a ditch.   Seriously. [Right now](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/regional-analysis/overview/), there are 10 million slaves in Africa and 25 million slaves in Asia today.

7mugovoj	For the Republic and its avenues of Democracy to survive, having the seat of the federal government to be within a state is not also extremely dangerous to every single institution, but it will also lead to the threat of infringing on everyone else's democratic rights across the country. I think it's wrong to even suggest to make the District a state. In fact, it's pure stupidity and it's even more ironic that people saying bUt My DeMoCrAcY  are the ones pushing a system that would actually see their democracy threatened. Unfortunate your home is in a federal district, but sorry, your feelings don't supersede the security of our elections, government, and institutions.

7mugovoj	You are correct, but you're missing the other half of it. Read the Federalist Papers at least once in your life.  "It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators by the state legislatures. . . . It is recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select appointment, and of giving to the state governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government. . . .  The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion. . . ."

Giving the power to a governor and state government to not only surround the enclave, but to be in control of the airport is extremely dangerous. Not only that, the prospective statehood pushes almost every single consulate and federal department outside of the federal zone. Statehood is a political ploy to upend deadlocks for one political party over the other.	1642800105.0	htnidz3	t3_s9agk7	t1_htneq7k	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htnidz3/

And now there are people who are calling for the extermination of white people, and are racist towards them.   Dont you know that the vast majority of whites that came over and settled in appalacia did so to escape and live freely. Hamilton, Washington, and the like ended that with taxation. Those scotch-irish whites didnt come on fancy ships. They came on cattle boats. Many lived as slaves.   Here the oligarchs have done it again. First with the jews to steal their family legacies of hard work and frugal sacrifice, now it is happening again. This time with whites. It is sad to see they have us fighting each other, and it is terrifying. All we truly need to do is be honest with ourselves about our life experiences with people of all kinds.

I've been there, I've worked there. The problems of DC aren't because of lack of representation in the federal government, it's because of the culture of those there. A few extra Congressmen won't change anything and the District will still have the same issues whether or not it is a state. All it will become as heavily in debt because it will carry the same policies (while fixing nothing) like Maryland, California, NY, etc. As well as adding layer upon layer of government and laws to further push those issues off. DC will just be used as a pawn by a political party. Preventing housing for government employees, etc. At some point, the national guard will most likely even be used to hinder the operations of the federal government over some political BS. This whole rose-tinted glasses notion qnd not seeing the future implications of such actions is so dangerous.   Only place that deserves statehood at this point is Puerto Rico.

So, Virginia’s percentage of the free US population was less than twice Virginia’s Senatorial representation.  Today, 12% of the population lives in California, but they only have 2% of the Senators. Six times the population compared to Senatorial representation.

b44xhpqh	Let’s slow this down before it gets spread too far by the people who got the idea to abolish the senate from Steven Colbert (really look it up). The US legislative branch or congress is bicameral, meaning it is made up of two bodies, the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate is made up of two representatives from each state regardless of population. The House is made up of a number of representatives from each state based on the population of each state. The Senate allows states to have an equal amount of representation regardless of size in order to prevent large states from controlling everything and the House makes sure that doesn’t go too far by allowing large states to have more control there. This was a compromise in the making of our government. A good example of balance would be in the picture above, California has a population of 40 million people, and every other state’s population when added together equals 40 million people. They are all equal in the Senate, but California as a state has much more representatives in the House because of their much higher population. Not to mention how many electoral votes that one state gets in the presidential elections.	1642868744.0	htrb82n	t3_s9agk7	t3_s9agk7	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htrb82n/

As a welder I have to buy a $400 pair of boots every 6 months at least, new shirts monthly and a pair of carhartt coveralls at $200 a pair only lasts about 3-4 months. For myself alone I spend thousands on work gear a year and there are guys who buy way more than I do. Compile that and Carhartt will definitely be taking a hit unfortunately.	1642897177.0	htta734	t3_sa6ppt	t3_sa6ppt	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sa6ppt/all_the_way_to_the_bank/htta734/

4e0nh	>The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  >Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  >But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  >This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.  -― Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms: The Play	1642916594.0	htuhvgm	t3_sa6ppt	t1_hts3jlq	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sa6ppt/all_the_way_to_the_bank/htuhvgm/

jj37y	One specific point- the house no longer does this. It has an arbitrary headcount limit of 435 reps, which means that the actual population representation is very heavily skewed. That's just objectively true, it's not politics or party bias, right now the House is completely non-representative of the actual spread of population throughout most of the country. The fact that that's the case means that the Senate still being "two per state no matter what" gives an overall massively disproportionate power push to low pop rural states. I don't want the Senate to be deleted and I personally haven't seen that suggested all that often, but either it needs a SERIOUS rework and/or the House needs that representative limit to be abolished entirely.	1642921522.0	htuq4gl	t3_safz85	t1_htunlez	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/safz85/blue_states_make_while_the_red_states_take/htuq4gl/

gvfdv7vx	Haha, that's fucked up, but it made me laugh. I'm not sure if I buy his, "I'm allergic to the Pfizer and Morderna vaccines, and I just don't want to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine" spill. It might be true he can't take some of the vaccines, but I think he talked to Joe Rogan, and they had similar views on the vaccines and alternate treatments.   I'm just glad I don't have to hear his smug ass talking about how he won the game for the Packers on his weekly appearances on the Pat McAfee show. I don't think he's going to continue making appearances. I would be shocked if he did. On the downside, I have to hear all the "What is A-Aron going to do?" segments the next few months as he leaks information to fuel the sports media's need for content.   My wife is a Packers fan, so I can only talk so much shit. I don't root for professional sports teams, but I do root against some players/teams for various reasons. His swarmy, I'm smarter than everyone else because you all are morons and sheep, and I'm not, attitude grinds my gears.	1642931584.0	htv3hkx	t3_sakybh	t3_sakybh	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sakybh/pro_vaccine_people_watching_aaron_rogers_lose_to/htv3hkx/

Those 600+ billionaires aren't spreading antivaxxer lies, nor are they bombing Planned Parenthood buildings, nor claiming the COVID shot is the mark of the beast, nor are they condemning gay marriage or trans people. Those billionaires mostly could care less who has control of Jerusalem or the West Bank and aren't willing to drone anyone over it.  The church love it when there's trouble though.

9qiib	The part of CA he’s from is redneck as fuck. His hometown specifically is a university town, but outside of that small bubble around campus it’s middle-of-nowhere farmland. I have met people who were born and raised in that area who, no joke, speak with slight southern accents because they are so committed to the whole “country” persona. Obviously this isn’t true of everyone there by any stretch, but there are LOTS of people who are just caricatures.

xmbq4	I don’t have to “conflate” anything, in order to associate Bernie Sanders with progressivism. He ran on a progressive platform and, unlike Warren, didn’t take PAC money and completely abandon core tenets of progressivism.  There’s a cool interview with a colleague/professor of Warren’s, from her days at the University of Pennsylvania. At the time, the university had a very progressive law program. She recalls Warren as a “right-wing Reaganite,” who once opined in class that “there is no more ridiculous an idea than national healthcare.” Warren then helped spearhead a right-wing takeover of the curriculum. This, of course, before moving to Massachusetts and becoming a democrat.  Her professor concludes by saying “there is no more relentless, ruthless nihilist, that I have ever met in my entire life, than Elizabeth Warren.  People criticized Warren because she was dishonest, violated progressive ideals by accepting corporate money, and seemed to be concerned more with her own political gain than with the good of society.	1642994328.0	htz0ik5	t3_sb0qgj	t1_htxw695	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb0qgj/wooderson/htz0ik5/

"good" people, regardless of their political beliefs, religion, and socioeconomic status do not have bad reputations. Even when considered by those who do not agree with them.

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

What many of you are failing to realize is that many of these “antivaxxers” that are in the hospital with covid is because they are elderly or in a vulnerable group. More than likely they aren’t even antivaxxers and are just people who for whatever reason haven’t gotten the vaccine yet. I’m as liberal as they come and vaccinated as well, but at least I have some goddamn human compassion and try to understand the situation before villianizing people who are hospitalized with covid.	1643063140.0	hu2vfhm	t3_sbt81g	t3_sbt81g	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbt81g/its_crazy_how_unvaxxed_covid_patients_are_being/hu2vfhm/

They've elected shadow representatives to be put in place should they ever achieve statehood, even. They hold elections for people that will, in all likelyhood, never actually exercise control of office.  DC is like...98% blue tho, so conservatives dislike the idea of it becoming a state. PR is more purple, tho that may have shifted in recent years after they got fisted by the Government and had rolls of paper towels thrown at them.

hvmlv7gp	>...you and I both know we would support Trump over Biden, Kamala, or Hillary.   I certainly wouldn't support Trump over Biden. I find them both equally problematic individuals although I am not surprised Biden won after four years of Trump's insanity.  Just like I wouldn't be surprised if Trump won the next election because of Biden's Presidency.  This is what happens when you keep trying to field geriatric, populist incompetents as Presidential candidates.  >He's the reason why we have the vaccines in the first place.

97bmzxph	So Obama, when he became President he took control of the DNC and banned all corporate donations. As soon as Hillary took control as the DNC's choice, she re-instated corporate money. The DNC did everything but shoot Bernie in the head on public TV in order to put "their" candidate. You just don't get it, when you compare one party against the other to see who's the better. It's like comparing Jeffery Dahmer against Ted Bundy as to who was the nicer guy. If I could just get your side to agree with me that "BOTH" sides are evil then we could win. But as long as they have you drinking the Kool-Aid of "we are the good guys", you will never see the light of truth. And personally, I cannot deal with people who cannot see their own faults within their own tribe. So, if you do not want to reply with "yes you are right, we need to destroy both parties and start over". I'd appreciate you just not responding, it's disingenuous at a minimum.	1643049411.0	hu1v6s4	t3_sb00t2	t1_hu1u65t	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb00t2/and_it_doesnt_even_feel_good/hu1v6s4/

97bmzxph	Wow, you really need to dig deeper. Clinton was in charge of the DNC when they assigned an IT guy to Sanders team for data access to the DNC servers. that same guy then went into the servers using admin passwords supplied to him by the DNC to make it look as if he accessed other candidates donor lists and then turned around and banned Sanders team from access to their own donors. In addition, Clinton had signed a secret memo with the DNC that she would have control of the donation rules and debate schedules in exchange for a secret loan the Clinton campaign gave the DNC. So please, the left took what it was fed and believed it all. Here's VOX's own news article.

37qkwk9p	Yes, let’s look at the timeline:  > After graduating from law school in 1996, Biden accepted a position at the bank holding company MBNA, a major contributor to his father's political campaigns.[6] By 1998, Biden had risen to the rank of executive vice president.[6][14] He then left to serve at the United States Department of Commerce until 2001, focusing on ecommerce policy for President Bill Clinton's administration.[15] Biden then became a lobbyist, co-founding the firm of Oldaker, Biden & Belair.  > Hunter Biden was appointed to a five-year term on the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush in 2006.[17] Biden was the board's vice chairman from July 2006 until 2009; he was replaced as Vice Chairman in January[18] and resigned from the board in February,[19] shortly after his father became vice president. Biden said during his father's vice-presidential campaign that it was time for his lobbying activities to end.[6]  > In 2006, Biden and his uncle James Biden purchased international hedge fund Paradigm Global Advisors; Hunter was interim CEO of the fund[20] for five years, until 2011.[21]  > In September 2008, Biden launched a consultancy company named Seneca Global Advisors that offered to help companies expand into foreign markets.[22] Biden, Devon Archer, and Christopher Heinz founded the investment and advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners in 2009.[16] He also co-founded venture capital firm Eudora Global.[13]  Which leads to:  > From 2013 to 2020, Biden served as a member of the board of the China-based private equity fund BHR Partners, of which he acquired a 10% stake in 2017 at a discount.[29][26]  > Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings owned by Ukrainian oligarch and former politician Mykola Zlochevsky, who was facing a money laundering investigation just after the Ukrainian revolution, in April 2014.[6][44][45][46] Biden was hired to help Burisma with corporate governance best practices, while still an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner, and a consulting firm in which Biden is a partner was also retained by Burisma.[47][48][49] Christopher Heinz, John Kerry's stepson, opposed his partners Devon Archer and Hunter Biden joining the board in 2014 due to the reputational risk.[45]	1643055745.0	hu2bxrc	t3_sboprz	t1_hu1i1jc	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sboprz/the_same_kids_who_he_put_in_office_that_are_being/hu2bxrc/

The Kim regime enslaves the people of NK for their own benefit. Those high up in the DPRK government live a lavish lifestyle while 70% of the country is food insecure. Even the slightest suspicion of almost anything can get someone tortured or killed (extending to their family members) even though DPRK officials can do those very same things. An average NK citizen caught listening to a SK song is a death sentence despite DPRK officials being the ones that supply such things *in state-sanctioned black markets that exist all over the country.	1643157871.0	hu8a2os	t3_scixko	t1_hu6tkfd	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/scixko/the_most_tremendous_leader/hu8a2os/
f8x87	Hi there,  I am growing very concerned over rumors I hear coming from the Chantilly School District.   I hear there is a secret cabal of teachers and substitute teachers that steal children away from bus lines when school gets out to teach them of ancient racial self-stimulation rituals. Some confiscated group chat rooms call this fad “race bating”, whereby they get off to the reactions of their peers from one’s own egregious statements. Also, Atkins isn’t even just meat.   How many guns will it take to ungay my dog?  I demand Virginia require fat dabs as a prerequisite for hire at reputable strip clubs.   But ultimately, the problem lies with allowing teachers the right to open their mouths while on school property. This is a god-given privilege that teachers may get to bestow the admonishments of Christ unto our blessed kids. I hope you can find it in your heart to declare schools an emergency that requires FEMA intervention. Thank you.

I mean this is a political humor sub making fun of politicians in general is at most a diversion from all the scary shit that you hear about on the regular.   And I don't think most politicians have empathy. So I really don't think showing them empathy is going to make any strides into a better world.  As far as the importance of truth and facts I don't think it can over state it because without a strong foundation (truth and facts) people can not make informed decisions. So, no. I'm not going to have empathy for people who ignore truth and facts for some nebulous idea like "building connections through empathy".	1643162840.0	hu8lweu	t3_sbufmo	t1_hu6riki	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbufmo/sarah_sanders_former_press_secretary_and/hu8lweu/

None of the first 38 commanders in chief did it. And some of those dudes had some serious military experience. Eisenhower? Grant? I mean, Teddy Roosevelt was a war hero.

awjqc	\> you didnt even see it did you?  Making assumptions, aren't you? (yes. i saw it)  \> He didn't DO anything.  He said "dumb son of a bitch" in front of a mic attached to the podium that he knew a mic was attached to. (yes, I know the guy he was talking to \*is\* a dumb son of a bitch)  \> What he said was caught on a mic he didn't know was on. The way you put it he said it on mic on purpose.  I believe you misunderstood me, then. I think it was a typical hot mic moment. He didn't think he was gonna be heard, and he was. It was a careless mistake, yes. But a mistake nonetheless. As for "the way I put it", I said I was really disappointed. That's not a very harsh thing to say. And I was even very apologetic in how I said it, quickly adding an edit (well before your reply) that said I wasn't equating Trump and Biden. As you said, and I totally agree, they are not the same at all. Biden does try to speak eloquently, Trump never did. But still, I was disappointed by the hot mic moment, as he should've waited until he left the room first, and vented to a friend.  \> You're not ok with a genuine response to a STUPID fuck asking a stupidly loaded question being caught accidentally on a hot mic?  Making more assumptions. Yes, I'm 100% okay with a genuine response to a stupid fuck asking a stupid and loaded question. But the curse words and name calling should have waited until he was away from the podium. It was a careless mistake that really disappointed me.  \> That's a pretty brave and thoughtful position you've taken...or maybe its just complete bad faith HORSE SHIT and virtue signaling.  Another assumption, and you're wrong. To be fair, my wording wasn't explicit enough, so I can see why you made that assumption though. But no, I wasn't virtue signaling.	1643220482.0	hubovs0	t3_sd44q2	t1_huaxbl2	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sd44q2/the_lets_go_brandon_crowd_is_all_upset_over_some/hubovs0/

They might see the socialists as useful for being made angry with the democratic party, but russia is clearly backing right wing populists.  Russia likely wants populists in general, but they have been using right wing populists lately.   There is probably some truth to it being hard to snap out of once effectively utilized though. Look at how many people insisted on believing a conman who lives in a gold spray painted apartment, who lies to an almost comical degree, as being the truthful source and not the news media.

90vsl	To say that Pragmatism is inherently leftist is pretty dumb, FDR was the most successful democratic president and no one would argue that he was overly pragmatic. Pragmatism is also often the problem though, especially with new and unique problems. Progressivism is often pragmatic but often people tend to dismiss when pointing to other countries that have successfully implemented policies that overwhelmingly had positive impact. (That won't work in America we're different/people who have a very limited understanding of economics will explain how prices will increase/we're the innovators and that's why we can't have M4A etc) Further backsliding is very unlikely to happen here as most of the institutions can already be manipulated in one way or another(gerrymandering/filibuster). People will continue to reject ideas that would fundamentally help them because rich people can spend an exorbitant amount of money on very effective propaganda, I mean even California voted for prop 22 which is literally one of the most dangerous initiatives in American history from a democratic standpoint as it requires a 7/8th majority to amend.	1643239080.0	hud45g9	t3_sdbymj	t1_huczpxu	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sdbymj/boring/hud45g9/

Because Fauci once said "it's not necessary for everyone in the country to wear masks at this time" at a time when we were desperately short on masks and infections in the US were mostly limited to 3-4 cities, they think that Fauci lied or that he said masks don't work then "changed his mind".

If the vaccine stopped transmission of the virus, then you wouldn't be able to pass it on to anyone else. The way pandemics happen is if a sick person spreads it to more than 1 other on average, shown as the R number. If R>1 the amount of infections goes up, but if no-one could transmit it (R=0) then the virus would die out, and be no longer a problem when the last person has recovered.

He has the right to discuss and question any topics he wants with any guest he chooses to have. To suggest anything otherwise is to censor free speech.

I'm Australian, I have no dog in your fight, but it's hilarious hypocrisy that people think they're better than people who follow another political party because there's evidence those people were systematically fooled at some point in time, as though Democrat votes haven't been systematically fooled at some point in time, too.  I get it, the Republican party is probably worse than the Democrats, we have the same dichotomy in Australia where the Australian Labor Party is objectively better in every provable way than the Liberal National Coalition, but people still default like reactionaries to trusting the men who look like real estate agents.

13di87	You're the one obsessed with something I already admitted I was wrong about or purposefully arguing in bad faith. Your first paragraph is a moot point as of about 5 posts ago when I admitted I was wrong. I don't know why you are still so fixated on this point. You're getting worked up about something that we both agreed on. I really have no idea why you keep bringing up this acquitted shit since we are both in agreement the charges were dropped and and not acquitted which you even acknowledged in your last post.   Your post verbatim "Gun charge was thrown out (ie, could have been convicted of such, but let go on a technicality). Very different from acquitted."  I'm not moving goalposts at all by asking you to simply answer what was the technicality that you now say is irrelevant, but was very relevant to that post for you to include it. And what evidence there was to convict him since you stated that he would be convicted if it wasn't for that technicality.   You could back up the statement you made with facts or you could admit your wrong and it wasn't a technicality and that the charges were dropped because there was no evidence he broke that gun law.	1643335950.0	huizbmc	t3_sdjx1h	t1_huixi57	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sdjx1h/hes_got_the_cred_and_hes_fought_in_the_streets/huizbmc/

I'm asking you whether Kyles political views are what's causing your bias.	1643347561.0	hujo2z2	t3_sdjx1h	t1_hujmyhk	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sdjx1h/hes_got_the_cred_and_hes_fought_in_the_streets/hujo2z2/

bqgiiu9i	First, I don't share similar political views with Kyle Rittenhouse. His case was just interesting as the media put him on full blast. If you read my other replies in this thread, you can fill in the blanks from there. Second, I'm merely replying to people who think Kyle shouldn't have been there or he was guilty, etc. If there's anything else you're confused about, just ask.	1643348571.0	hujpw47	t3_sdjx1h	t1_hujozlh	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sdjx1h/hes_got_the_cred_and_hes_fought_in_the_streets/hujpw47/
bqgiiu9i	It's good we're being honest here. At least we now know you do have a bias even when the system worked. Again with the victims. Let's go with that hypothesis that Kyle was killed after failing to reach his gun in time  Because everything is on camera, we would see that 3 people attacked Kyle which resulted in his death. The system would process it and they'd be found guilty. But let's go back to reality. Did you know one of the 3 men who survived that night admitted in court that he attacked Kyle first? Yeah. Doesn't do well for the prosecution.	1643348762.0	hujq84o	t3_sdjx1h	t1_hujph96	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sdjx1h/hes_got_the_cred_and_hes_fought_in_the_streets/hujq84o/

3g8b6n4h	I’m an elder millennial.  - First year of college (in New York), 9/11. Ended up leaving college and joining the military. Soon after ended up in Iraq.  - Bought my first home during the bubble in my 20s (2006), lost a ton of equity the first couple of years.  - Got laid off in 2011, couldn’t find work, lost my home when Chase schemed to foreclose on thousands of veterans to collect the gov backed insurance on the homes that were no longer worth what they were insured for.  - Spent a few months homeless in 2011 while I got my business off the ground.  Here we are in 2022 and I’m 39. I Decided I couldn’t bring children into this world, likely because if all the uncertainly I’ve personally experienced.  Many of our stories are similar, just on a slightly different timeline of very important years of our lives.

That was followed by being severely wounded in WWII. Two of their kids died in Viet Nam, the other (my dad) was spared thanks to childhood Polio.   Every generation has shit stories of trauma. If you’re black or brown or an immigrant, the stories are far worse.   We’re not the only generation with trauma from 9/11 or the Great Recession or coronavirus. Everyone who lived through these events was impacted in some ways.   I’m pretty tired of being called a snowflake. Can we please stop posting stuff like this? We’re not special.

5ta1c	Well to be honest, if he just picked a black woman there still would have been an uproar because the default argument on the right would be that he still picked them as a diversity pick. It's not that people don't understand it's just that it doesn't matter. This would have always been made an issue. This may be a communications issue in a more neutral world but there was always going to be some level of manufactured bullshit. Hell just look at some of the attack against Sotomayor when she was picked.  As long as the candidate Biden picks is well qualified for the job, then it doesn't matter. This will blow over in time. You can claim a "legitimacy issue" but the truth is surprme court picks have been fairly controversial for a while now and that hasn't stopped jack shit. In time, any hatred for the justices will be more overshadowed by their opinions than the overly political nature of their pick.	1643369408.0	hukjaka	t3_see58r	t1_hujvyoe	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/see58r/the_rule_used_to_be_only_white_males_allowed_on/hukjaka/
5ta1c	See I get that and I think a lot of people do get that. I just feel like it's unimportant and manufactured outrage.  The surprme court pick was always going to be important and a lot of people were looking towards Breyer to retire given his age. It would be naive to think a president doesn't think about supreme court picks until a seat is open. It's a legacy that pretty much every president gets to pick at least once.  I don't think predetermining a black female pick is all that bad. It's clearly not very limiting given that there  are multiple candidates that are well qualified for the job (and several that were already in Biden's mind).	1643370044.0	hukk7sd	t3_see58r	t1_huj9xek	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/see58r/the_rule_used_to_be_only_white_males_allowed_on/hukk7sd/

Furthermore why do bad financial decisions made by so called ‟college educated” people, become a burden on the taxpayer?

You need to learn to abandon your childish obsitenance and learn that judt because you believe something doesn't make it true.   Affirmative action is racist. Period. This isn't difficult to understand. No matter what the ridiculous motivation behind the racist doesn't fix the fact that it is racist.   You are choosing or not choosing someone based solely upon a physical attribute of theirs. This is the very nature of racism.	1643385055.0	hulfvr8	t3_se925h	t1_hul9p4b	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/se925h/child_prodigy_cassidy_bertrand_will_be_bidens/hulfvr8/

Your returns must be great if that’s the case… Seriously no one pays that much in taxes unless they are wealthy and choose not to see an accountant and a tax lawyer.  So like thanks for being a good due paying member of society I guess. Seems like you aren’t taking advantage of any of the tax breaks your conservative friends put in place for you.

5rlsyrnn	I don't want an award, I'll end up deleting this before the end of the day anyway.  I predict by mid March, the entire stock market will decline 50-70% from where it's at now.   Inflation will never get a chance to be put under control and rhe dollar value will be destroyed.   Gallon of gas in the US....7-9 dollars.  Cup of tea.....4.   Commodities like water corn and soy will go through the roof and poverty will explode.  Unemployment is false low because people are voluntarily leaving the workforce in droves, so when the economy tanks, and drags companies with it, Unemployment....real Unemployment,  will be all time highs by December 2022.  That's just a nutshell of what I'd expect if the narrative around the markets that I've heard, come anywhere near true.  And here's where I REALLY lose you and come across like a doomsday nutjob.......shares of gamestop trading above 100k by end of February.    That's me.....that's my warning to the few randoms who might see it.  I absolutely hope I've been tricked, and I'm wrong.
