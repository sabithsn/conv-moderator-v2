11iyz1	just to be clear, I'm not defending Biden. I think he's pretty shit too. My point is even if he was more strict with his anti-covid Protocol it wouldn't  Make a difference as so many people choose to ignore what he had put in place in the past and yet still want to blame him for doing 'nothing'.

41zh15ba	If they want to kill the remaining value of public education, this is probably the way to do it.   Conversely, I teach regular ed classes. I don‚Äôt grade homework and I accept work basically all quarter because I have realized that way too many students won‚Äôt do the assignment on time due to more factors than I care to go into and they won‚Äôt learn it if they won‚Äôt do the work. This is just the population I teach. It isn‚Äôt ideal. It is just what I am working with. The kids need to pass the class and their end of the year test to graduate, so I try to make as many opportunities available to them as I can so they can do that.  I absolutely would not teach an honors, elective, or advanced class with this many accommodations. Many still would argue I shouldn‚Äôt. I do have good pass rates, and I know my students learn the material and are prepared for the next level. I don‚Äôt know if I am doing them more of a disservice by accepting late work and not requiring homework or not. I do know I am doing them a disservice if they don‚Äôt pass that test. If they haven‚Äôt learned to turn in work on time yet, I don‚Äôt know that creating harsh penalties in my class would do it.   If my school required a late policy, I would abide, and if the school took a harder stance overall about commitments, I would be on board.  As it stands, all the powers that be only want to know what it will take to get them to the next level. Fortunately, I have a test where I can say, they need to do the work to understand and pass.   This is the benefit of standardized testing. I think we should have less of it, but we need it. ESPECIALLY, if as a system we are going to start letting kids every life circumstance dictate every teaching decision.	1640900775.0	hqlm6vj	t3_rsc4sc	t3_rsc4sc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsc4sc/in_the_name_of_equity_virginia_county_wants_to/hqlm6vj/

But...As a white, Jewish, 49yo heterosexual male who only has been married to one woman, i feel like I epitomize everything that is wrong with this world from Omar's point of view.   As a former refugee and now an American citizen i am eternally grateful to a country that gave me and my family a chance for a prosperous future. A chance that my wife and i eagerly took. I worked a few jobs while in college, she worked a few jobs and graduated law school. I think we did ok for ourselves and now our oldest is about to graduate law school so believe our kids will be ok too. Omar also did great for herself, by doing what she did (whatever the fck it was) and becoming a member of the House. So why do we see the US so differently? Why do we see it as a country that didn't have to do anything for us and yet gave us so much and she looks at it as a cow that should be milked for more and more benefits without a shred of loyalty on her part?

I couldn't imagine being that obsessed with another country, and I generally do not randomly encounter people complaining about other countries here in the states.  Apart from, you know, the internet.  As for the superiority thing, I do often get that feeling from coworkers in Canada--especially some of the French Canadians I have worked with.  It can be a little frustrating when their insecurity gets in the way of working effectively.  On the other hand, I have had exactly the opposite experience with Canadians here in the US.

1dy1hbqx	In order to turn this all around the country really needs to come together. Hand in hand.   We are all in this together.   Vaccines needs to be mandated. For everyone just like measles. Babies born should be given vaccines for COVID just like they do for Polio.   Kids under 18 that don‚Äôt get vaccinated should be barred from returning to school. We need to get this pandemic under control. The spread is literally a straight arrow up.   Vaccines really should be mandated for every adult. With fines and/or imprisonment if they do not comply. Annual boosters need to be included if it doesn‚Äôt go away.   I also think we are far too relaxed on masking. Masking needs to be required in every public space for all ages. N95 mask quality if you are not inside your home.   All the money we wasted on the vaccine development is going to waste. We need to start making masks. Making them free. Making them required.   If we did that in under 5 years this would all be history. Eradicated.   People need to just be responsible. Accept the next 5 years will be hard but worth it.   With possible monthly stimulus checks such as the $2000 a month for every American until it‚Äôs over ‚Äî that would also really make it easier for families who are struggling.   The Biden administration has had so many curve balls thrown at them it‚Äôs aweful.   I believe if he can step up, put his foot down, get vaxed or go to jail, mask up or be arrested, and provide a full income for every American we will be out of this nightmare by the next election.

Its not like he only reads and speaks Mandarin or something, then the English words on signs would be indecipherable.	1640958846.0	hqoj8sj	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqns2xk	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqoj8sj/

The nomenclature behind the two political parties shifted some time back, but the geopolitical breakdown of the US has hardly budged. If you look at the electoral map of today, it's pretty consistent with the political distribution at the time of the civil war.   The idea that Abraham Lincoln would have aligned with the Republican party of today is silly. He was overwhelmingly in favor of centralizing and strengthening the federal government, and was even called by many noted conservatives of the time a tyrant.   To be clear, I'm a conservative.

They (democrats) are repeatedly on the wrong side of it, however, over time they change the narrative with revisionist history (see racism). The problem is through their control of 24/7 media and social media, they are able to do this almost instantaneously now. I guarantee in 10 years, when kids learn about the covid response of 2020/21 the narrative will be a 180 to what it is now. I mean, look at when the virus first came out, the narrative was lockdowns are racist, vaccines are racist and rushed and cant be trusted, and that is almost 100% forgotten by the general public after a year, because they realized they could use the virus to their advantage.  As we learn more about how useless and detrimental their policies were, they will start changing the narrative, and its slowly but surely happening now, like clock work.	1640975883.0	hqpmjpr	t3_rsze7q	t1_hqpitrx	/r/Conservative/comments/rsze7q/welcome_to_reality_ben_shapiros_thread_on_what/hqpmjpr/

High cost of everything,  can't save, fuel killig me, rent killing me, now can't afford a home, company can't find employees, low margins, it's just brutal, and all a direct result of liberal policies and specifically Bidens policies.	1640976166.0	hqpn8u5	t3_rsia11	t3_rsia11	/r/Conservative/comments/rsia11/cnn_host_perplexed_by_bidens_low_approval_number/hqpn8u5/

Simmons, who at the time was working as a registered nurse, said she started using drugs following the death of her father in 2010. To support her habit, Simmons said, she resorted to stealing and selling drugs.        After her release from prison, during which time she went through a drug treatment program, Simmons was admitted to Seattle University School of Law and graduated magna cum laude in 2017. But when she applied to sit for the bar exam, the Washington State Bar Association voted 6-3 against admitting her.        With the help of another convicted-felon-turned-lawyer, Shon Hopwood, who served time for bank robbery and now teaches at Georgetown Law, Simmons successfully challenged that decision before the Washington Supreme Court. She took the bar exam in February 2018 and was sworn in as an attorney in June of that year.	1640976497.0	hqpo1u1	t3_rsd9yr	t3_rsd9yr	/r/Conservative/comments/rsd9yr/washington_state_looks_to_reduce_sentences_for/hqpo1u1/

84phe6s5	The thing is, I know the sub isn't always the biggest fan of Mitt Romney, but we know where his wealth came from(mostly). He's a venture capitalist. And he has taken a lot of flack from the liberal elites over it. But damn, he didn't make his money sitting in congress for 35 years.  Her net worth is reported somewhere between $106 million last year and maybe $114 million this year. If someone were to make what a congressperson has made(not counting extra for being speaker of the house) and invested 25% of their gross(because they are a high earner) and gotten 10%(historic S&P500 growth) then they would have about $9.42 million. That's midnight back of the napkin math. But it just gives an idea of how much extra her position of power has provided for her.

bedrcj7u	Hi Medical Laboratory Scientist here.  You are absolutely correct. There are also multiplex assays that test for common cold pathogens.  This has been a big season in my lab for RSV and Rhinovirus as well.  Thank you for trying to spread accurate information.  There's a lot of COVID misinformation here, "They don't test for flu!", "The PCR cycles are too high!", "The tests can't tell the difference!"  It's like people just make this shit up. I am trying my fucking hardest in the lab to provide rapid, accurate results to help people.  COVID is still the big one, we hit 25% positivity this week.    Everybody--please get vaccinated.  The vaccines do work.  They reduce severity of disease, shorten viral shedding duration by over half, lower viral load, and reduce transmission. Running 100+ PCR tests/day on top of my normal workflow is ruining us.  Morale is at an all-time low.  We had mandatory overtime and cancelled holiday leave.  People are calling out sick just to lay in bed and decompress so they can come back to work the next day which is putting even more strain on us.	1641042754.0	hqsw7mm	t3_rq5ik8	t1_hqc3e6y	/r/Conservative/comments/rq5ik8/flu_is_making_a_comeback_in_us_after_an_unusual/hqsw7mm/

So there may be minor inaccuracies here or there, but overall it's a "for the people by the people" type of operation. Arguing that Wikipedia is *propaganda* starts to sound like a delusional person arguing that reality is propaganda?  I'm curious if people here feel that Wikipedia has a bias?

I can't speak on her behalf, but I would guess someone with with Liz Cheney's perspective would argue that at some point what happened January 6th stopped being a peaceful protest and became dangerous (to law enforcement, others in the capital, and the democratic process). I think she would argue that the crowds respected and would listen to Trump, and if Trump had publicly asked them to leave they would have. Her "evidence" seems to show that Sean Hannity, Kevin McCarthy, and others texted Trump asking him to please do this, which he did not do for hours. The fact that he chose not to take action for several hours put law enforcement, etc., in more danger than they needed to be in.

af9ts	Naomi Oreskes March 22, 2019 Presented by: The Baker-Nord Center for the Humanities  https://youtu.be/Gc7RNrh8i-A  See around the 50 minute mark      Many people have forgotten if we think about times in US history where there have been gigantic violations of civil rights personal rights human rights often they've been associated with disease and contagion or with the articulation of a threat as a form of disease and contagion. So, if we think about forced sterilization of American citizens during the eugenics period, much of that argument was made based on the idea that eugenics was a medical threat, or I should say, eugenics was a response to a medical threat. And we know that over 30,000 people in California alone were sterilized without their consent during that period, and many more in other states. We know more about California because they kept better records, but we know that many of people in other states were similarly affected so this theme that the disasters that climate change will bring are the sorts of things that will justify or seemingly even necessitate the loss of individual liberty.	1642538196.0	ht83mh8	t3_s73xmv	t3_s73xmv	/r/Conservative/comments/s73xmv/the_virus_were_dealing_with_is_not_just_covid_its/ht83mh8/

3z1knao4	Patience, persistence, and getting me to understand that this is a stepping stone to greater knowledge.    As an actuary, he somehow got me to see that math doesn't always get you the answer; it's there as a tool to put you in the ballpark and then from there you have to use your other tools.  Looking back, he blew my mind.  For me it was incomprehensible that finding the answer to an equation isn't necessarily the end of the line.  That there was an entire world beyond and I had no idea what that world was.   He was the toughest man I've ever met.  His son operated on a completely higher level.  They're both dead now; I carry their stories with me and do my best to honor their memory by carrying on their teachings to other people I come into contact with.    In a very straight-laced environment, he was the "straightest".

4pip92r5	TX has indeed gotten bluer over the last two decades but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs imminently going to flip. I‚Äôm not super informed on the data, but many residents from states like CA are moving there to escape Dem policies, and as such they‚Äôll vote Rep. And the rightward shift in Hispanic voters also benefits the Reps.   Personally I‚Äôm way more concerned about GA. It‚Äôs been pretty Rep since the 1960s but prior to that it NEVER voted red. We‚Äôre seeing trends that are eerily reminiscent of what happened with VA. This year‚Äôs governor and senate races will be very telling of GA‚Äôs political future.   If TX does flip blue during a presidential election, it would be disastrous for Reps. They would need to keep their 2020 map, sweep the rust belt 2016-style, carry AZ and GA, and pick off NV or NH for a narrow win.	1642530756.0	ht7jg3b	t3_s71ll1	t1_ht75cxc	/r/Conservative/comments/s71ll1/beto_orourke_raises_7m_in_first_6_weeks_of_bid/ht7jg3b/

hkq1nxmz	Jerome Powell and the Dems gave liberal Wall Street elites the gift of free money. His policy of stimulus and quantitative easing enriched his liberal friends on Wall Street to the deficit of hard working Americans.  We needed Wall Street to invest in American jobs. Instead, Wall St took the money (and even borrowed more money at historically low interest rates) to perform stock buybacks at the same time shuttering US manufacturing and off-shoring jobs to China and India.  In addition, Powell used your tax dollars to buy up risky junk bonds furthering the idea of "moral hazard." If issuers of junk bonds (and those who invest in them) think that the Fed is just going to open up the taxpayer's pocketbook every time one of their risky bets fails, they'll just keep making more and more risky bets.  Once Biden stole the White House, Jerome was emboldened to continue his morally bankrupt plans to enrich his liberal elite friends while gutting the American economy.  Call me crazy, but I don't trust any Fed Chairman that vacations with the Clintons.	1642577420.0	htahu64	t3_s7jx2q	t3_s7jx2q	/r/Conservative/comments/s7jx2q/cnn_has_a_great_plan_to_curb_inflationand_its/htahu64/
hkr3zra	Why do "conservatives" hate white people?  JFK and Lincoln were two of our worst presidents. MLK Jr was an anti-Christian communist. Jim Crow and Segregation were ethnic groups asserting that their own society served them first and outsiders second. The Confederacy was the right to dissolving bonds with a federal entity that oppressed them.  Yeah, random lynchings are immoral (even if many were guilty and had activists judges free clearly guilty parties for political posturing), interment camps were discrimination with no real national security benefit, and the second and third Klans were just Freemason exercises... but in-group is the only moral position. "Conservatives" expect white people to hate themselves just as much as liberals do, but "conservatives" are just "classical liberals", and classical stupidity is still stupidity.	1642577964.0	htaild5	t3_s766uk	t3_s766uk	/r/Conservative/comments/s766uk/who_did_it/htaild5/

3zrsxvci	Gotta love the chumps who talk out Thier ass and compare RFID to long range, one way signals.  "Cutting the wire" on either side of the RFID system would keep your car from starting, the intended purpose of the RFID system. Any from of input signal can be stopped.   All forms of radiation can be stopped and all are if there is a tunnel, a mountain blocking the signal, a faraday cage (metal garages), sufficient rain, or even volcanic dust.  So, a "heartbeat detection" type system will fail and frequently due to nature alone.  The only thing they could try is an active check type of system, a shit ton of laws around disabling it, and having cops pull over anyone who's car doesn't respond to a 'ping' type check either actively from the police car or through a passive system like the ones they use in many Tollways.  Which leaves it all open for tampering.

There is likely an unconsciois revenge motive on their part that feels the scales are evened when non-minority status plebs die due to their "soft on crime" policies that only prioritize fewer POC prosecutions and incarcerations.	1642618871.0	htcqx8n	t3_s7snh3	t3_s7snh3	/r/Conservative/comments/s7snh3/la_da_ripped_for_being_soft_on_crime_after_deaths/htcqx8n/

464io8c3	Things can be racist by either intent (ie. I am doing X in order to discriminate), or by outcome (ie. I will enact X, I don‚Äôt intend to discriminate, but if enacted it will end up discriminating).  A voter ID law, in principle, is good! Added election security. However, if it‚Äôs enacted right now, it‚Äôs racist, because rather than improving election security (actual election fraud is extraordinarily rare), it will instead act as another barrier that will disproportionately affect minorities, primarily black voters.  And, it‚Äôs racist for BOTH reasons. The politicians are intending to block black people from voting because they know that black people disproportionately vote democrat, and it‚Äôs racist by outcome since it removes more black representation.  If, instead, you FIRST made it easy and free for people to get a state ID, waited some time for everyone to acquire one, then enacted voter ID laws, then it would probably make more sense. But as of right now, the time and cost puts off primarily black people.  See what Ontario, Canada does instead with their health card. Since there is socialized health care, the government allows citizens to get a free health card that doubles as an official government ID. In that system, voter ID laws are far more rational and less discriminatory since there are fewer barriers for the extremely poor to get an ID.  There‚Äôs way more to discuss about this issue, but it is more complicated than just ‚ÄúID makes elections more secure‚Äù.	1642700921.0	hthhw5r	t3_s8iczg	t1_htgeebq	/r/Conservative/comments/s8iczg/biden_claims_2022_elections_wont_be_legit_fouled/hthhw5r/

Their first patent filing specifically recognizing the S-protein as the immunologic target for vaccines was filed on November 14, 1990 (U.S. Patent 6,372,224). With a focus on swine and canine gastroenteritis, these efforts showed little commercial promise and the patent was abandoned in April of 2000.   During the same period, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) under the vaccine obsession of Dr. Anthony Fauci, funded Professor Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. This program designed to commercially weaponize a naturally occurring toxin is the beginning of the criminal conspiracy and violates 18    USC ¬ß 175, 15 USC ¬ß 1-3, and 15 USC ¬ß 8) Dr. Baric‚Äôs expertise was understanding how to modify components of the coronavirus associated with cardiomyopathy. NIAID Grants AI 23946 and GM63228 (leading to patent U.S. 7,279,327 ‚ÄúMethods for Producing Recombinant Coronavirus‚Äù) was the NIH‚Äôs first Gain-of-Function (GOF) project in which Dr. Baric created an ‚Äúinfectious, replication defective‚Äù clone of recombinant coronavirus.   This work clearly defined a means of making a natural pathogen more harmful to humans by manipulating the Spike Protein and other receptor targets. A year after filing a patent on this GOF CoV, the world experienced the first outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).    Under the guise of responding to a public health emergency, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) filed a patent application on the genome of SARS CoV on April 25, 2003. Accessing and manipulating the genomic data (which came from China making an ‚Äúinvention‚Äù claim by a U.S. entity illegal violating 35 USC ¬ß101, 103), Dr. Baric, Dr. Fauci, and the CDC violated 18 USC ¬ß 175 (a felony).   One year earlier, Dr. Baric and his team had already filed a patent which clearly the pathogen CDC claimed as novel in 2003. Three days after filing a patent on the genome, NIH-funded Sequoia Pharmaceuticals filed a patent for the vaccine on the virus invented a mere three days earlier.    At the same time, in violation of 15 USC ¬ß 19 Dr. Fauci was appointed to a board position with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (a competitor in vaccine manufacturing) thereby beginning the interlocking directorate anti-trust crime.  In 2005, the DARPA and MITRE hosted a conference in which the intentions of the U.S. Department of Defense was explicit. In a presentation focused on ‚ÄúSynthetic Coronaviruses Biohacking: Biological Warfare Enabling Technologies‚Äù, Dr. Baric presented the malleability of CoV as a biological warfare agent. Violating 18 USC ¬ß 175 and inducing the non-competitive market allocation (violating 15 USC ¬ß 8) for years to follow, Dr. Baric and the    U.S. Department of Defense spent over $45 million in amplifying the toxicity of CoV and its chimeric derivatives.    From 2011 until the alleged COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Fauci has routinely lamented about the inadequacy of public funding for his vaccine programs and the public‚Äôs general unwillingness to succumb to his insistence that everyone MUST be vaccinated against influenza. Despite repeated appropriations to advance vaccine dependency, his efforts have been largely unsuccessful.    NIAID ‚Äì under Dr. Fauci‚Äôs direct authorization ‚Äì encouraged UNC Chapel Hill and Dr. Baric‚Äôs lab to ignore the GoF moratorium in a letter dated October 21, 2014.    At that time, Drs. Fauci, Baric and EcoHealthAlliance‚Äôs Peter Daszak were in possession of an extremely dangerous Chinese pathogen identified a year earlier in Wuhan.        While many illegal acts were committed by the conspirators leading up to 2015, the domestic terrorism program (in violation of 18 USC ¬ß 2339) was announced by NIAID-funded Daszak at the National Academy of Sciences. Here, he announced what was to become the domestic and global terrorism event branded COVID-19.	1642742287.0	htk8da9	t3_s92ugb	t3_s92ugb	/r/Conservative/comments/s92ugb/the_nuremberg_code_1947_will_anyone_be_charged/htk8da9/

She‚Äôs no different than an uneducated redditor spouting off and making assumptions.   The only difference here is that she has the backing of a ‚Äúnews‚Äù organization.

What she did was a federal offense punishable by up to a $37k fine, jail time, and a permanent flight ban from all airlines.  She's a moron for making that choice.

Because of my legal, cultural, ethical & moral stance on the issue of an individual to bear arms.       > Why are all the other amendments up for debate?      I never said any of the amendments were up for debat. They're not. The Constituion is the cultural agreement we have to each other and the government. The Bill of Rights sets out broad boundries on the government. I see the breaking of the rules set out in the contract between the people and the government as just that, acting outside the law. The law being the set of rules we all, indirectly at times, agree to.       > Why do conservatives hold the 2nd so dearly?     This will probably get my slammed into downvote oblivion: I considered myself mostly on the left for most of my life. The idea of considering myself a conservative is a fairly new part of my life and did not set in easy. I was raised in Oregon, so a PNW version of left. I was not raised around firearms and had never actually seen one until I was 17. A .22 revolver. I had never shot a weapon until basic training at Ft. Gordon, GA. I never had an interest in firearm ownership until I had learned that I was really good at accurately shooting difficult targets. I've still valued the US Constitution as early as around my teen years. I had felt the right for citizens to own weapons is a just right.      > No ones taking your guns.

dzfv9a7y	I have maybe three hours to talk on this subject, but I‚Äôll keep it brief.  Beatles changed the entire industry, in the form as we know it today. Executives and producers realized at that time, that actual money could be made on music. A LOT OF MONEY. Before The Beatles, this wasn‚Äôt really a thing. Of course you had your regional artists on the radio, etc, but almost never anything nationwide.  Okay so fast forward. Once we realized money could be made we‚Äôve capitalized with every fucking ‚Äúhook‚Äù ring-dinger bullshit. The ‚Äúhook‚Äù is all that is. After money became involved, we‚Äôve lost all touch with the true greats, in my opinion.

Before that distinction is muddied its Venn diagram time: all vaccines are countermeasures, not all countermeasures are vaccines. What this means is in the rare case a covid shot hurts you, it falls under the CICP framework rather than the VICP legal framework which is substantially worse for victims:  https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/cicp-vicp  We've administered 200M+ doses, had two large pieces of covid legislation last year and multiple executive orders.

What matters is the specific situation that led to her death and the specific people involved. No one was thinking of the rand Paul or kavanaugh hearings when it happened. There‚Äôs no tit for tat score in this situation that the cop had to factor in before pulling the trigger. Don‚Äôt be a liberal idiot and see every instance as a systemic problem. She fucked up trying to jump through a window during a riot (not an insurrection like the libs wish it was) in the capital which armed guards were behind.

I can tell you first hand that every law or regulation about government requirements such as competitive bidding can be circumvented.  Also if you didn‚Äôt know, government entities are known to spend frivolously at the end of their fiscal year because if they have money on the books then they get less funding next year since they didn‚Äôt need it all.  This is why your government over spends and is always broke.  Schools are the worst for this.  My experience?  20 years working for school districts as a network admin contractor, and 15 years construction.

57g1vzpi	I'm honestly impressed that you bothered to go back far enough to figure that out I'm from Connecticut. Thank you. I don't think I mentioned that for awhile. I'm also not going to pretend that I actually have any idea how "bless your heart" is normally used. Being from Connecticut I've mostly heard it used as a passive aggressive insult. If you're legitimately from the South then I'm sure you're right. I apologize. That being said, since it came up, I would also like to point out that not all Democrats are from California or live in the inner city. We do not provide our pronouns when we meet new people as that would be dumb. If somebody tells me that they would like to be called be something else then I'd be happy to oblige. It's not my business and makes no difference to me. If it makes them happy and makes no difference to me then sure, whatever. New England doesn't generally attract much attention, but it's statistically the most functional part of the country by most measures. Often California Democrats annoy us as well. We are not the same. We've recently been reducing our prison population to the point that we're actually closing prisons and our credit rating has improved by dealing with the dumb pension issues that were created in the 70's. Most of our issues can be summarized as "mind your own damn business and fuck off". Recently marijuana has been legalized here, but the systems to provide it are still in development so we have to make a short trip to Massachusetts to legally by weed. It recently also became possible to engage in sports betting online. Most people don't know who the governor of Connecticut is. He's boring as hell and we're fine with that. He doesn't think his position is about  making dumb political statements like Desantis , Abbott, or more recently Youngkin. If Lamont were elected president he'd be the guy you only heard about when election came up and we'd be fine with that. Our policies can be summarized as "don't be a dick".	1643046100.0	hu1m7fg	t3_sbl7op	t1_hu1eoiz	/r/Conservative/comments/sbl7op/trump_if_pelosi_had_not_turned_down_soldiers/hu1m7fg/

m23d1	The issue is that we can't have systems that blindly acknowledge white people and Asian people succeed on merit. We cannot have that, it flies in the face of every systemic racism claim and the DIE cottage industry that has been propped up as a result. So it has to be something else.   Because if you look too closely at white and asian people, you'll find stable nuclear families...and then another branch from the leftist tree is pruned. We can't have people thinking heterosexual couples that stay together and produce children to whom they have a vested interest and are involved in their education is what's responsible for their continued success. We simply can't have that.	1643163162.0	hu8mo1j	t3_scml7e	t1_hu8i1r2	/r/Conservative/comments/scml7e/attorney_supreme_court_has_historic_opportunity/hu8mo1j/

It can't go the other way and these are our best candidates for now so 12 years of trump/DeSantis seems better than only 8 of DeSantis followed by someone unknown yet.  Let trump fix bidens mess then let DeSantis thrive and fix trumps issues. No need for trump and DeSantis to step on each others toes, and Florida needs as much DeSantis as they can get right now.   I'm all in on DeSantis, but trump first would be the best outcome long term imo and I'm not even a big trump fan.	1643166622.0	hu8us29	t3_scoq8c	t1_hu83dji	/r/Conservative/comments/scoq8c/2024_primary_poll_trump_leads_desantis_by_45/hu8us29/

aqfy3	I remember staying up watching the NYT predictor needle thing like I did in 2016, but it was completely useless, so I switched to watching betting odds of winning, since that seemed like the best indicator I could find. I don't remember precisely, but Trump got to like -800 or something to win, which if you know sports betting, is almost a lock. Then while everyone was asleep, the light switched, and slowly Biden creeped and creeped and won the exact counties in the exact swing states he needed.  Then you read this Time article: [The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election](https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/)   It basically says the quiet part out loud -- in short, what we would call election fraud, they call election "fortification," and brag about it -- seriously, if you haven't, read it. Fast forward to the Georgia runoffs, where ofc D's win (Trump didn't help w/ the runoffs if we're being fair) and what is the first bill on the docket for D's new House of Reps? [HR1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text), the "voting rights" bill that thank god was just struck down despite D's ongoing attempt to end the filibuster in order to get it rammed through. Why? So they could federalize elections and put to rest the "conspiracies" over the [statistical oddities](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2020/11/statistical_anomalies_in_the_2020_presidential_election.html), e.g. the truth.	1643174169.0	hu9ahjj	t3_scmdxg	t1_hu7jycs	/r/Conservative/comments/scmdxg/breaking_georgia_officials_tampered_with_and/hu9ahjj/
xkqxb	That's horse shit given that you've let your party get overrun by crazy christian fanatics who vote with such fervor your politicians literally lie about being christian to get their votes. If ya'll stopped wasting so much time on moral domination you might actually achieve something, though it seems like most of your politicans really aren't looking to achieve anything for the nation if it doesn't pay them out.   A HUGE chunk of the conservative voterbase are voting for single issues, namely abortion, immigration and "industry" (as trump crippled the steel industry ironically enough). Conservatives aren't happy to be left alone, at least not the loud ones that are getting the most attention. They're only happy if their idea of morality is made law and executed regardless of how the contrary might or might not affect them. Things like gay marriage and abortion don't affect anyone but the people involved in it directly....and yet millions of americans (who are vastly outnumbered) manage to have even a small chance of exacting their judgement over tens of millions of other americans. Until ya'll ditch the god bullshit you're not going to be able to focus the base beyond electing a leader that'll say the right things to them.	1643174291.0	hu9appi	t3_sco39o	t1_hu8vfl1	/r/Conservative/comments/sco39o/limit_the_spread_of_covid_misinformation_bidens/hu9appi/

j3qch	There are a lot of shitty jobs with shitty management. I did a summer working for RGIS, they do inventory for various retail locations, I found the job strangely relaxing and they are so desperate for workers that they hire at the interview. I also worked a second job as a home care CNA. RGIS paid better slightly, but the CNA was work experience for nursing school.  RGIS would consistently schedule me for when I said I was unavailable for work. After I complained a few times they stopped scheduling me at all. My brother worked for them as well, he frequently was scheduled for the shifts I would have been available for.  I do think anti-work is dumb, and I've really not been to the sub. But I do think it's entirely reasonable for people who work necessary but low level jobs to receive some consideration in scheduling and maybe more money. The CNA job was better, but pay was a joke.	1643205806.0	hualysu	t3_sd49mz	t1_huakwxe	/r/Conservative/comments/sd49mz/as_if_these_people_were_even_hirable/hualysu/

11ys7q	McConnell has nobody to blame but himself here since he shoved Trump's last Supreme Court nominee through less then a month before the 2020 election.  He set the precedent to consider Supreme Court nominees being considered during an election year.  So now, he has to deal with the fallout.   Oh, and he also changed the filibuster rules to where a simple majority is required for a Supreme Court nominee to be appointed.  Yeah, this is all on McConnell.   He got his victories in the past, but failed to see the bigger picture once the Democrats were in charge and could take advantage of his past actions.  Sorry Mitch, you'll have to drink a dose of your own medicine here.	1643223338.0	hubwvri	t3_sdcgvf	t3_sdcgvf	/r/Conservative/comments/sdcgvf/mcconnell_says_senate_should_not_confirm_new/hubwvri/

wg3yodq	"Joe"'s empathy or lack thereof, and the minimum wage earner's lack of will has no bearing on whether or not getting paid more for not having skills.  Sorry, but it's the hard truth.  Companies will pay what the market will bear.  In my neck of the woods, Walmart and McDonald's are starting $2 above my state's minimum wage, which is $4 above federal minimum wage.  And that's in my small town in Missouri.   My son, in highschool, works part time at the state's minimum wage, but could easily walk in anywhere and make $2 more - since that is what the market is bearing.  At 17, he's not of age to do some of the stuff he wants to do - welding, building, etc... but he has the skills to do so - and the drive.   If you're 30, 40 or 50 years old and still making minimum wage.  That's a you problem, not a minimum wage problem.	1643223543.0	hubxgpc	t3_sd49mz	t1_hubmth7	/r/Conservative/comments/sd49mz/as_if_these_people_were_even_hirable/hubxgpc/

2fmw89or	Shareholders are not part of nonprofits.  You and I are talking past each other.  The point of my concern is that PBS and NPR generate enough money in programming to pay for their own programming without tax money.  If they did that, then the annual bitching by the conservatives that PBS and NPR are basically propaganda arms of the democrats would be moot.  If you pay for your programming and then compete in the marketplace of ideas and win, then good on you.  But if the left gets half a billion dollars to use to advance their agenda and a lot of that money comes from people who aren't leftists, a fair point of concern can be made that forcing people at point of legal pressure to fund POVs that they find incoherent with their reality is wrong and should not be allowed to continue.	1643227695.0	huc94rp	t3_sd5an3	t1_huc1jzv	/r/Conservative/comments/sd5an3/end_taxpayer_funding_for_npr_pbs/huc94rp/

These ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù have reasonable concerns regarding a relatively new style of vaccine that hasn‚Äôt seen wide spread use prior to this one, and has been pushed out quickly with a lot of political bullshit behind it.

a1q8p	I mean look at what this country is becoming... If you're white and your ancestors have been here for hundreds of years you:   A, can't be proud of your people's history. Even if your ancestors founded the nation that is the shining star of freedom for every oppressed person in the world. Even if your ancestors made sacrifices and risked their lives so others can be free.  B, you can't be proud of your culture and traditions, otherwise that somehow makes you a bigot.  C, you can't expect the government to honor its citizens and are supposed to like it when they import people from other cultures en masse. If you oppose that, you're a bigot.  D, you have to be permanently ashamed of the nation's racial past as if you personally committed those injustices, even if your family immigrated recently, fought for the Union, intermarried with Indians, whatever, doesn't matter. If not, you're a bigot.  E, if you think any minority's culture or religion is backwards, destructive or incompatible with American society for any reason, regardless of justification, you are automatically a bigot.  F, if you don't sit there and seal clap like a frigging moron when national leaders explicitly appoint hand-picked minorities to gain brownie points, their qualifications being secondary, you're somehow a hater.  Like they tell me I'm supposed to bend over backwards celebrating *other* people and their way of life, culture and religion, but mine which this nation was founded upon is something I'm supposed to be fucking ashamed of? Just fuck off.   I lick *no one's* boots. If your culture and your communities are jacked up, I'm gonna say so. If your religion is degenerate and dehumanizing, I'm gonna say so. If you think you're going to just bum rush our border, work under the table and soak up benefits courtesy of the taxpayer I'm going to say your ass needs to get deported. I'm proud to be an American, I know the pillars of Western civilization (which is the pinnacle of the entire world) were carved by my ancestors and I'm proud of that. Doesn't make me a hater towards *anyone*, and if you think so you can go suck a fat one.	1643406525.0	hun1295	t3_setna0	t3_setna0	/r/Conservative/comments/setna0/reports_us_society_grows_more_divided_amid/hun1295/
10a6bs	To be fair to these people the actual Marxists nations the tried to implement this stuff were not communist but it wasn't intentional. Communism as an idea simply cannot work on a national scale and the Marxists ruling these nations eventually knew this. It can work in small communes or communities but on national scale it is illogical. Ironically Marxist nations throughout history eventually all turned into quasi red fascist states to varying degrees to state in power. So Mussolini wasn't wrong in stating the only form of socialism that can work is one that embraces the nation and the state.	1643407225.0	hun2uja	t3_sew3uy	t1_humnsb1	/r/Conservative/comments/sew3uy/i_told_you_yesterday/hun2uja/

bbx23	This is true. Even at my wife‚Äôs globally prestigious hospital thar she‚Äôs an ICU nurse at.  Nurses are split 50/50 on the vaxx and there is a massive nurse shortage mid-pandemic, and there is massive pressure on the university to get all staff vaccinated.  So they‚Äôve applied what leverage they have and the union informed the nursing staff that vaccination would soon be required to keep working.   But this hospital is in a multicultural hub with many muslims, christians, hindis, jews etc- All with segmented and varied views on the situation.   And as soon as they surveyed, and realized they‚Äôd lose a massive share of poker-faced nurses-  They softened on it. Even if the mandate passes you can still just file for a religious exemption and they will accept it.	1642538023.0	ht8359h	t3_s6wnb7	t1_ht68sfx	/r/Conservative/comments/s6wnb7/carhartt_moves_forward_with_vaccine_mandate/ht8359h/

b5qc1plh	I got a notice once because a neighbor sicced the city inspector on me because my grass was too long.  I had just spent a whole bunch of money dethatching and re-seeding it because it had giant bare spots where the previous owner had let sweet gum balls accumulate over the course of a decade.  To let the new grass take root, I had to leave it alone for a while, which meant the sparse existing grass got a little long.  Anyone who took three seconds to look at it could see the marks from the slit-seeder, and later, the new grass coming up.  If this neighbor had their way, half the yard would have remained a mud pit.  But at least the grass on the other side would have been short!	1642542707.0	ht8fz6o	t3_s6vh6k	t1_ht7pmw2	/r/Conservative/comments/s6vh6k/michigan_judge_berates_cancer_patient_over/ht8fz6o/

The Republicans last held a five-point advantage in party identification and leaning in early 1995  Now that's impressive.  That's almost thirty years ago.  The world has changed significantly in that time.  If you looked at the voting patterns of the electorate over the past 20 years, you wouldn't think this was possible.

b5qc1plh	The "no shoplifting charges for theft under $900" is truly insane.  I don't know how anyone who lives there can rationalize that, unless they don't even believe in private property rights.  Even an idiot who spends three seconds thinking through the incentives the policy creates can see that it's going to bankrupt any place that sells anything valued under $900.  And the "free-for-all" atmosphere and culture of lawlessness it has created in LA County no doubt emboldened Brianna Kupfer's murderer, for example.    I don't think Gascon is stupid.  Incompetence can't explain what he's doing.  I have to chalk it up to depravity.

6gq5biap	>No, that is a statement of fact. To frame it as the person simply wanting to anger another person is not only disingenuous, it is something you couldn't know.

I'm not saying that to make you mad.  Again, the wording is to anger someone. By that logic, it's okay to say "You're delusional if you think asians can blend in with the rest of society."  >That isn't a personal belief, it is an observation of reality, and it is true.       Sex and gender are often considered the same thing in this subreddit, so I often use sex when I mean gender. I'm censoring my speech to please a certain crowd.

My backspace wohn't  work because I copy and pasted, so ignore nay spelling mistakes.  >I don't know what you mean by "respect them as a person" or "only attack their opinions." If someone is demanding that I lie, I will not respect them at all. It isn't an "opinion" that a person is a man or woman, and it isn't "harassment" to properly gender them.      You can respect someone as a person even if you don't agree with it. It isn't hard.  You can attack their opinion that tranms is real woithout demeaning them , dehumanizing them, insulting them, or rilinhg them up. I don't agfree with muslims, yet I don't do any of those things. I just respectfully say what I want to beabout their opinions.   >It isn't respectful to lie to someone. It also isn't respectful to expect or demand that someone lie to you. It's worse than disrespectful.  This shows your biases. You control people  's speech because you disagree with it, but when someone else controls your speech it's wrong.

6gq5biap	That's why I said most right wingers in general >in real life< will respect us even if they disagree. It's not the majority who hate us and the loudest are on the internet because you can hide behind a profile picture and fake name without any worries about being attacked over it.   >What I don't agree with is the whole munchusan by proxy thing where liberal women are saying my son likes to play with dolls he must really be a girl and I am going to help him transition now! Aren't I progressive? It's scary to think where these children will be when they grow up.  God I hate that shit.   >Preaching transgender as a normal thing is another sore spot.  I agree with that. But it depends on your opinion on what transgender means. It can be normal if it's as little as GNC, which is what it is now (due to nonbinary taking over transsexualism). If it's people with gender dysphoria with a desire to medically transition to be more like the opposite sex, then just say transsexualism.  >we can accept their transition but they are still a separate and distinct population from biological women and should not expect to be treated as if they were for some things like sports etc.  This. I'm not the same as a cissex man. But I'm not truly the same as a woman either even if I was born one. The only similarity is socially and mentally.

hhkxv	Exactly, Trump's policies with a more presidential and level head would be perfect. Trump's personality was a huge crutch. His platform and was actually exceptionally good and effective. America was in a better place by virtually every metric under Trump than ever before, until covid hit. Economy was at a record high, unemployment at record lows, stock market doing great, housing was still super affordable, crime was down, illegal immigration down... I mean, wtf more can you ask for? Of course combination of covid and Biden presidency reversing all of Trump's policies basically erased all the gains he made, but I honestly can't remember any point in my life where the country was just succeeding by so many metrics as it was in Trump's first 3 years (pre-covid).   The only reason trump lost in the first place is because of covid. People always think the grass is greener on the other side and assumed Biden would handle covid better, which in 2020 of course was the foremost election issue. Turns out people were wrong and in fact Biden has managed it far worse than Trump ever did.	1643160722.0	hu8gwtx	t3_scoq8c	t1_hu7ljaq	/r/Conservative/comments/scoq8c/2024_primary_poll_trump_leads_desantis_by_45/hu8gwtx/

The thought never crosses their mind that "red flag law", to the non-gun-owning layman who isn't obsessed with pointing out constitutional violations, sounds like a reasonable idea.  And screaming at such people isn't persuasive.  They don't understand that Crenshaw was proposing that conservatives take the initiative, hijack the term "red flag law" to refer to solutions which *don't* violate due process, and thereby achieve some sort of palatable compromise that satisfies the moderates.	1643163549.0	hu8nl98	t3_sciv25	t1_hu8200n	/r/Conservative/comments/sciv25/dan_crenshaws_stock_trading_yielded_the_fifth/hu8nl98/

b5qc1plh	No, there's just too many people who deal exclusively in knee-jerk reactions and firmly held opinions based only on soundbites and headlines.    This is one of the problems I've had with a large segment of the Trump era Republican base - this sort of hyper-tribalism based on very low resolution info.  And it didn't start with Trump.  It was going on a decade ago with the Tea Party, too.  People seeing a headline or 30 second clip and then *damning* people over it.  Sometimes, the headline is accurate.  Sometimes, the clip needs no context.  But I've seen many, many instances of people getting it completely wrong.  And when you show them evidence after that, it falls on deaf ears.  They've already made up their mind, and attached very strong emotions to it.

dc91w	What people don't understand is SS has two mutually exclusive goals: individual equity and social adequacy. Social Security may be the most effective anti-poverty program in the world. Without SS about half of retirees would live in poverty; with SS it's only about 10%.  You don't lift 40% of the elderly out of poverty without subsidies. A scheme to allow individual investing would couldn't let you invest 100% of contributions since a very big chunk go to subsidizing the poor. I'm not sure it could allow you to invest your half and only use your employer match for subsidies.	1643211471.0	huazqu1	t3_sd7dt9	t1_huauf6g	/r/Conservative/comments/sd7dt9/social_security_has_quietly_crossed_yet_another/huazqu1/
b5qc1plh	> You can't discuss red flag laws that don't violate due process rights  Yes, you can.  And its a winning strategy.    The left wants rights-violating "red flag laws".  Their whole game is to sell gun confiscation without due process to the non-gun-owning public under the name "red flag law" because the non-gun-owning public thinks "red flag law" refers to the general idea of "hey, let's do something about that clearly violent nutjob before he shoots up a school" and they think it sounds pretty reasonable.  That's what the general public associates with the term.  They aren't thinking about due process.  You are not going to win by simply digging your heels in and saying "NO! NO RED FLAG LAWS EVER!"  It's not a winning strategy.  Simply being opposed to things isn't going to win over gun-ignorant people.  You have to propose alternatives.  Crenshaw specifically mentioned this, that conservatives can't just sit on the sidelines while Democrats propose and pass this legislation.  He talked about how conservatives need to be proactive in proposing solutions that *don't* violate peoples' due process rights.    It's a genius move to hijack the term and apply it to conservative solutions that don't violate rights.  Because it beats the left at their own semantic game.	1643211558.0	huazz0o	t3_sciv25	t1_hu9eis0	/r/Conservative/comments/sciv25/dan_crenshaws_stock_trading_yielded_the_fifth/huazz0o/
dc91w	A program sold through politician's lies; who would have guessed. The fact of the matter is SS is primarily an anti-poverty program. Without SS about 50% of retirees would live in poverty. With SS it's only about 10%. The subsidies are disguised as investment returns. Poor people get about 15% return on their taxes while rich people get about 0% - 1% return on their taxes. Rich black people get a negative return because of shorter life expectancies.	1643211645.0	hub07bd	t3_sd7dt9	t1_huaxtjf	/r/Conservative/comments/sd7dt9/social_security_has_quietly_crossed_yet_another/hub07bd/

Rich love government handouts, bailouts.    In the west you don't have real capitalist, you have hunter-scavenger profiteers.

No, that's not what it means. If SS vanished today, 50% of the retirees would live in poverty (assuming nothing replaced it.) SS payments remove 40% of the elderly from poverty. That means 50% don't live in poverty because of pensions and 401(k)s and 40% don't live in poverty because of SS payments (after tax).   The fact that 40% are removed from poverty is proof SS works very, very, very well.

The only thing that changes is whether it is worth it for any given individual person.	1643319012.0	huhtm5o	t3_sdwx6n	t3_sdwx6n	/r/Conservative/comments/sdwx6n/dr_peter_mccullough_weve_had_21000_cases_of/huhtm5o/
b5qc1plh	It's worth noting that the risk level of each is different.    In aggregate, the risk of death from the vaccine is much, much lower than the risk of death from the virus.  But this doesn't necessarily hold true for individuals.  The relative risk between virus and vaccine changes with various factors.  For some, the risk of the vaccine is in the ballpark of the risk from the virus (healthy teens, for example).  For others, the risk of the vaccine is orders of magnitude lower than the risk from the virus (85 year olds).  It also depends on which strain we're talking about, too.  Getting vaccinated to improve your odds against Delta may be worth it, but against Omicron it may not.	1643319337.0	huhuhpp	t3_sdwx6n	t1_huhpy5y	/r/Conservative/comments/sdwx6n/dr_peter_mccullough_weve_had_21000_cases_of/huhuhpp/

The sore throat I got from Omicron didn't hurt that bad generally, but it was excruciating to swallow.    I've also never gotten nightly chills, a fever, or muscle aches from the cold.

4b5hsuxd	How has RGB gone against the constitution? Give one concrete example of her flagrantly disregarding it. The founding fathers were split on whether the constitution should be strictly followed or if it should be a living document that can be adjusted as the needs of the country change. The job of the supreme court is to interpret the constitution and apply their rulings as they see fit within the frame of it.  &#x200B;  And if you want to bring the constitution into it, someone with such entrenched religious beliefs as ACB should have no spot on the court. How can someone argue their side objectively when they believe the creator of the universe would see things differently?   In the original draft of the constitution, separation of church and state was tantamount to the founding of this nation, and putting people in the court who won't be able to separate their religious beliefs from policy shouldn't be there. They can say the won't allow religion to influence their decision, but if you actually believe in god, who believes are you gonna hold sacred? The constitution or literally the creator of everything?	1643391787.0	huly42x	t3_seo8je	t1_hultc0i	/r/Conservative/comments/seo8je/elizabeth_warren_calls_for_courtpacking_after/huly42x/

4b5hsuxd	Fair on the religious point, I will admit I am wrong there, though I still believe they should have picked someone with more judicial experience than ACB.  &#x200B;  But on the topic of the supreme court, I firmly believe that it is there job to interpret the constitution. The constitution lays out that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the law, and that the Court is charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law, thereby, also functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution. The constitution isn't necessarily going to spell out every detail and mention "it is the supreme courts job to interpret this" and justices one both sides of the aisle would agree with that statement, and I think they have a bit more knowledge on the constitution than you or I.   Society changes greatly over time, which the founders were aware of, so being the final say in law grants them the ability to interpret it in the frame o the constitution.   &#x200B;  Also I think you should provide an example of RGB blatantly going against the constitution, the document is very vague in many parts, reason being that it needs to cover a broad range of many topic over time. They couldn't possibly account for every scenario challenged against the document.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Buuuut we can go back and forth all day.

b5qc1plh	Stupid thing is, hierarchies are integral to existence.  Without hierarchies, you literally can't make a single decision.  You can't even know what to pay attention to.  There are hierarchies built into our very biology.    The answer to the question "What should I do now?" is always answered based on a hierarchy of values.  Are you hungry?  Are you cold?  Are you tired?  Are you in pain?  Are you all of the above?  These things all fit into a hierarchy.    Even the question "What should I look at?" (which isn't even a conscious decision) is based on a hierarchy of values.  Why do we look at the thing that makes noise rather than the nearest wall?  Why do we look at faces rather than feet?  Because of how those things are arranged in a hierarchy of values within our minds.  Our brains even filter information based on innate hierarchies.  Our very perceptions are filtered through hierarchies.    So, its impossible to eliminate hierarchies.  But let's cut them some slack and say that they're *only* interested in eliminating material inequality, rather than take them at their word that they want a society without hierarchies.  There has never been any society on earth throughout human history where material inequality was eliminated.  Not one.  There has never been a *tribe* without material inequality.  Material inequality is such a fundamental quality of groups of humans that it predates civilization.  It's a fundamental quality of groups of *organisms*, even.  Anywhere you find organisms, you find unequal distribution of resources.    So what makes these people think it's even possible to create the conditions for material equality among a group of humans of any size, let alone at a scale of millions?  Communism has always had inequality - Party members (the "top 1%") live luxurious lives compared to the grinding poverty of the masses.  Every scheme ever devised for organizing human beings has still allowed material inequality to exist.  It is impossible to eliminate material inequality.  And attempts to do so necessarily require violence and destruction.	1643406359.0	hun0n9b	t3_sew3uy	t1_hums6po	/r/Conservative/comments/sew3uy/i_told_you_yesterday/hun0n9b/

Being able to start your draw out of view from the attacker (like you would be able to do while seated in a car) can help, too.  Compliance is risky, too.

2301ee0o	This is because their political ideology has become an unholy religion to them. It is the secular system that has jumped into the void left by their abandonment of the deep religious tradition of Western civilization.   In trying to "wake up" or convince a Leftist, you're essentially trying to get a cult member to question and/or reject their cult.  It's virtually impossible to do, especially as they remain fully immersed in the cult support structure while you're doing it. You would need to get them away from all cult contacts (basically, pull them out of the entire culture and away from toxic friends and family) and then seriously start deprogramming them. Given the pervasiveness of the Leftist ideology in the culture, and the fact that you can't literally pull them away from those people, it is true that there's virtually nothing you can do.  What needs to be done is to work on the *next* generations while politically defeating the Leftists and prying their claws off the levers of institutional and social power. The current generations of adults are a lost cause.  They didn't come to dominate things by convincing the conservatives. They spent 100 years worming their way into positions of influence and power and grasping control of the institutions (education and entertainment) that would shape future generations. The road back to sanity is exactly the same as the road it took to get here. We're deluding ourselves (and being ineffective) if we try to tell ourselves otherwise.	1643407655.0	hun3xvs	t3_sf0bw6	t3_sf0bw6	/r/Conservative/comments/sf0bw6/no_amount_of_information_will_wake_up_leftists/hun3xvs/

2301ee0o	>Your first four paragraphs apply equally to folk on the right.  It ***can***, sure, but "folks on the right" tend to be more religious. They get their religion itch scratched at church rather than in the voting booth or in the classroom. Thus it is, that while there are certainly people "on both sides" who behave that way, in practice, it's like 95% of the left but 15% of the right.  This is part of why the Leftists are so much better as voting in lock-step or why they react so violently when they encounter someone who dissents from their way of thinking.  &#x200B;  >Politics is largely a construct of the leadership class designed to keep everyone else entrapped in an ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù war while the leaders control things.  I do agree that most of the conflict is "class" based, but not rich/poor as Marx would have it, but leadership vs plebeian.  However, one of the hallmarks of the right/left divide is that the right wants to shrink government power and empower the individual to do as they wish, while the left wants to grow centralized power and institute collectivism. Thus, the vast, vast majority of the leadership class are Leftists (even those on the right...which is why conservatives are so often disappointed in the people who promised to fight for them).   The only difference between "left" and "right" in the leadership class is the degree and flavor of the leftism they espouse.  &#x200B;  >Look at Trump, he‚Äôs changed his political affiliation five times since 1987 and only went republican in 2012.

7d81jt8g	It's also kind of like the how the party controlling Germany in the late 30s treated millions of people before commiting mass genocide later on.   I'm only comparing the present to the actions taken at the onset of what would come to be the greatest most tragic genocide in modern history. Labeling and singling out of people, denial of essential services, shut down of commerce, and segregation - what came after that long ago has no comparison, and only an ignorant person would draw comparisons to the mass murder committed during this time.  You could liken the sentiment going on today to countless periods of time where great suffering followed.  The Biden administration gets a D- grade for vaccine roll out due to their divisive rhetoric that contributed to the politicization of the vaccine.   They get an F grade on mitigation efforts as their federal mandates only served to throw a few glasses of water on a raging forest fire while causing unnecessary pain and suffering to nearly every segment of our population, some far greater than others.	1643828536.0	hvb9x8u	t3_sh9x24	t1_hv1xofa	/r/Conservative/comments/sh9x24/you_see_a_fot_behind_the_fin_cash_register_neil/hvb9x8u/

Sinema, in the other hand, will get primary'd in the next election. Arizona is a swing state but the democratic primary voters are largely not the moderates and independents who support Sinema's position and would vote for her reelection. They are the card-carrying loyalists and progressives who see Sinema's stance as a betrayal to the cause. I think Sinema would remain popular and competitive in a general election, but won't make it that far because she will get crushed in the democratic primaries.	1643829725.0	hvbd4bz	t3_sivqfb	t3_sivqfb	/r/Conservative/comments/sivqfb/kyrsten_sinema_joe_manchin_garner_massive/hvbd4bz/

When I looked it up, in his entire career he had 2 billboard top 10 and 0 top singles. Mitchell is even less heard: 1-0.

Turns out this is the first real use case for that legislation and now Conservatives are acting like the Liberals came up with it. Just absolute fucking gold to watch in real time.  I hate the subreddit but this is truly a Leopards Ate My Face moment.

Unfortunately, that‚Äôs no longer the case.    The left have taken on the literal Marxist tactic of ruining the livelihoods of anyone they disagree with.   Sitting on the sidelines and saying ‚ÄúwE cAn‚ÄôT sToOp tO tHeiR LeVeL‚Äù is only allowing them to get more of a foothold in their awful tactics.

Your way (with your supposed principle that you‚Äôve declared yourself to have) has not only gotten us nowhere, but it‚Äôs actually further enabled the left to push cancel culture even more.   The only way to showcase to them that cancel culture is abhorrent, is for them to feel it too.      Think of it like this: nobody likes nukes.  But we have them because the enemy has them.  If we announced that we are going to decommission all of our nuclear weapons, do you think Russia and China will say ‚Äúgee wiz, that‚Äôs a good idea, we‚Äôre gonna get rid of ours too‚Äù?

eba5v3b2	While I agree with the sentiment that Democrat rule has ruined our cities, these educational outcomes are not necessarily a reflection on the school system or the local government, but the culture in which these poor souls exist. Education is something that isn‚Äôt seen as cool, or worthwhile even‚Äîto kids in the inner cities. Until attitudes are corrected by parents who give a damn, nothing will change. In fact, until that happens, nothing CAN change.   I went to a high school school with a bunch of rich kids and poor kids. The poor kids, who were largely black (though not exclusively) performed far worse than their peers not because of racism, or underfunding, but because they didn‚Äôt give a rats behind about school. While we were in class, they were messing around in the hallways or skipping school. It‚Äôs not the teachers fault that some kids refuse to learn.

Commies burned books because they peaked when they had control over sunrise to sunset white male manual laborers.  Ever since literacy increased, they have a hard time brainwashing macho men.  Remember the big, buff slavs of the Red Army?   Red Army peaked when they couldn't read and spent the whole day farming potatoes.  These dudes became vulnerable to Western propaganda when they were taught to read.

NYPost: Chances are high the infrastructure bill‚Äôs hodgepodge of anti-white discrimination will be struck down by federal courts. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution bars government from trying to even the score by discriminating against whites and in favor of minorities. The justices warned against creating ‚Äúa patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations‚Äù to correct past injustices.

But there's a difference between firebombing during a world war and stopping an Empire that was slaughtering everything in it's path and the intended removal / extinction of an ethnic group. That's why no one equates the nassive number of Russians killed in combat during WW2 with the targeted extinction of Jews that saw 6 million of them die.

dc91w	Staunch conservative here.  First, the only reason you are hearing about this is because it is one of the worst results in the entire nation. This is not "typical" of Dems or teachers or of Biden's education department or what happens when you focus on CRT, etc. You can't use this example to generalize about teachers or Democrats or schools in general. This example is in the tail of all results and doesn't tell you anything about the average or about how US policy needs to change. There is always going to be a worst results that is appalling.   Second, yes this is sad, but you can't really blame the teachers. And you can't blame the parents for being bad parents because that's not the primary drivers of the result; you can only blame them for giving their kids dumb genes (since IQ is between 50% and 70% heritable.) People of average intelligence learn to read easily. Income is highly correlated with IQ. When you get a strong concentration of low income individuals, you're going to have a concentration of below average IQ people which produce, on average, below average IQ children.   They call Economics the dismal science but the study of IQ truly deserve the moniker of the dismal science because it's tragic and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.	1643915568.0	hvgigtx	t3_sjl4yw	t3_sjl4yw	/r/Conservative/comments/sjl4yw/77_baltimore_high_schoolers_test_at_elementary/hvgigtx/

When people look at other people they cannot see beyond their own understand of themselves. If you were to look at a person who is a pedophile you can only imagine that they are as bad as the worst part of yourself or maybe the worst person you have come to know personally... which is not enough to fully understand their darkness.  Literally the worst person that you could possibly imagine is probably pretty good compared to them... who would even want to understand the depth of such selfishness and evil? The only reason that I know is because I have read books about human psychology and serial killers and true crime and stuff which I find fascinating but most people would find sickening and disgusting and disturbing.  Pedophiles are the lowest of the low and the fact that Democrats are courting them and trying to make them into a new accepted class of protected people is very bad. It means that Democrat politicians need to go.

Lets say with lockdowns you're able to delay the one million infections to occurring in 3 years vs 1 year, you'd still have 10,000 deaths but spread over 3 years. How lives are actually "saved" is by delaying deaths until a vaccine is made so now the remaining people who get infected won't die.	1643931273.0	hvhn5np	t3_sjgpq1	t1_hvgfcle	/r/Conservative/comments/sjgpq1/johns_hopkins_university_report_lockdowns_did_not/hvhn5np/

They mention the son of Chris Chelios who is playing for China because he's been playing hockey for 3 years there despite his entire youth being spent developed in the US, by US coaches. Hell his dad is a USA hockey icon.  The only famous case I can think of where this didn't happen was back in the 80's there was a player named Peter Stastny who was born in Czechoslovakia and had to escape his country to play in the NHL. On the international stage he couldn't go back and represent his home country as he would've been held political prisoner so he played for team Canada instead.	1643932021.0	hvhoywq	t3_sjwj0p	t1_hvhfd6o	/r/Conservative/comments/sjwj0p/seven_americans_to_play_against_usa_on_chinas/hvhoywq/

It's pretty soft-hand stuff-- but she's at least taking the responsibility off the athletes to mention that there is genocide being committed by the party.       Plus, last thing we need is for our country's strongest/fastest/most coordinated to get "re-educated" or have their family members disappeared (which, again, as she implied, is likely to happen if they speak out against this regime which is committing genocide & eradicating any voices they don't allow).	1643940081.0	hvi7kz8	t3_sjw7f5	t3_sjw7f5	/r/Conservative/comments/sjw7f5/pelosi_instructs_us_athletes_to_not_speak_out/hvi7kz8/

b54vw	Well I took a course called Data in Social Context (easy elective) which I thought would be GIS mapping electoral regions and learning about polling, data's history etc. But it was a full blown social studies class. I forget the books were supposed to read but I looked up summaries and bullshit assignments because they were trash. All the material somehow linked back to racism and racial biasing etc. My capstone was the same. It still was a senior project but we also had books were supposed to read one of which is Weapons of Math Destruction (credit scores are racist, investment trading algorithms are racist etc. look the book up it's trash lol). Discussions in class were about racism in data, how natural language processing can be used to fight misinformation about covid on twitter, and more I don't remember because I didn't pay attention by the end.   BLM, Jan 6 and the election was hilarious. All summer we got emails about racism, standing with the BLM movement, America's evil past, support for George Floyd. Election happens, my professors and the schools emails are talking about our democracy being at risk. Jan 6 happens and the emails sound like CNN talking heads haha. They were denouncing it as a violent riot that sought to overthrow America. Keep in mind I didn't see a single word about the destruction BLM did all summer.   The main takeaway is the school was always woke and had the typical bullshit (they supported what I called a fake rape walk because I girl claimed she was raped and her rapist had no consequences but texts came out showing she was psycho and abusive), all the title 9 bullshit, safe spaces etc. But come summer of 2020 and campaigns to fight covid disinformation and they went all out.

Every time I had to do them I found it hilarious because I would explain most of the questions asked for the task in the context of racism, discrimination, biased behavior etc.   I will at least say that because I was in a STEM field I largely ignored this crap but what you hear about colleges being woke and brainwashing institutions is largely true. To be fair most STEM courses are just that: math, stats, physics etc. and that's it. No other bullshit. But the administration, tons of the students, and many  professors are very woke. Tons of the social sciences courses are jokes from what I've heard, but I mainly avoided those electives fortunately.	1643950753.0	hviuft3	t3_sjg6e6	t1_hvijm23	/r/Conservative/comments/sjg6e6/virginias_largest_public_universities_drop_vax/hviuft3/

8hxpgqe0	You want scary?  Remember the incident where the Native American banged a drum in front of a high schoolers face? In Washington DC?  Remember how the MSM narrative went "Trump kid smirks at Native" and they screamed death threats, wanted him pulled from school, etc?  Turned out the Native was the one harassing the kid, but the entire thing was instigated by...  Black Hebrew Israelites.   Which if you don't know much about them, here's a quick read:   https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/us/hebrew-black-israelites-jersey-city/index.html  So, first the white kid is a demon, racist, Trumper, and vilified across the nation. A KID (who btw won millions of dollars suing MSM for this representation).  Then they turned, ever so slightly, against the Native dude, who from what was read about, wasn't a very cool dude at all.  But absolute dead silence about the ones that instigated the entire scenario, and took the pictures that started the entire thing.  Basically, they hate all "white jews", consider them fake jews and that the black people are the true Israelites. They do a lot of confrontational and aggressive 'street preaching'.    Absolute silence, because it did not meet MSM agenda of starting a race war in this country.	1643983479.0	hvk8kn3	t3_sk9ydr	t1_hvk2y0j	/r/Conservative/comments/sk9ydr/abc_slammed_for_suspending_whoopi_goldberg_for/hvk8kn3/

It's sickening to think they are pushing so hard to show the good in the top picture and trying every angle to show the bad in the bottom. When it's literally violence and destruction to get their point across, yet the bottom picture is literally the definition of mostly peaceful.   I cannot fathom a world where any of this gets better. There's no more unity to be found. We're all divided and it's rapidly getting worse. This is what the government wants, it's an assbackwards country right now and I'm completly ashamed to be living in it. Where do we go from here?

duehikt9	Leftists and conservatives oppose police for different reasons.  Conservatives oppose the police when they are enforcing bad or illegal mandates.  When unconstitutional laws or illegal mandates are enacted, they become bad agents.  However, when they are enforcing just laws, the police are just agents.  The institution of police itself is good, albeit corrupt at different periods.  Leftists oppose the police more fundamentally as an institution top to bottom and want to remove it completely.  They‚Äôd rather throw the baby out with the bath water than actually make the police better.  They will call perfectly good cops ‚Äúbastards‚Äù and ‚Äúpigs‚Äù even when they are doing the right thing.  They‚Äôll lie and smear if they have to (see the Bryant shooting, or Michael Brown).  The scumbag ‚Äúteacher‚Äù is content with smearing all cops, including the father and stepmom of the kid he is yelling at.

fm0vjxmt	Where has anyone stated covid is not a problem ?   The better question is why isn't Big pharma working to get vaccines more readily to 3rd world countries like Africa. Since they have a huge vaccine inequality source:   https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/tackling-vaccine-inequity-africa and Omicron more than likely came from Africa  and since they have such a low vaccination rate (11.3%) of total population source https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/ the virus is more likely to continue to mutate from regions such as this.   But instead we'd rather force restrictions on a country that has a damn near 79% source https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/	1643997554.0	hvl93og	t3_skfzx2	t1_hvkz6li	/r/Conservative/comments/skfzx2/freedom_convoy_lawyers_demand_gofundme_release/hvl93og/

ibf4x	Cable boxes are connected to stations that definitely can track which channels a box is watching. For digital cable, the connection is essentially a network connection back to the provider. Each box is individually authorized and monitored.   For DirecTV I'm actually not completely sure, but satellite communication definitely allows for two way communication. In fact, I'm fairly certain they would require some type of two way handshaking between the box and the service to confirm you are an active customer. All their data is digital and encrypted and I have to imagine they have some type of authorization taking place. So while I can't be sure, there's no technical reason they can't figure out who's watching what at all times. That's most likely how their service is set up.	1644003152.0	hvlo4zc	t3_skdwea	t1_hvljcbq	/r/Conservative/comments/skdwea/no_rights_no_games_boycott_beijing_2022_olympics/hvlo4zc/

bihrsebv	Leftist here, I swing by this sub every now and again for the sake of understanding and comparison, and  wanted to chime in that this whole Spotify/Joe Rogan thing is a bunch of hilariously overblown junk.  I've had pretty minimal exposure to Joe Rogan's podcast, but the few times I have, he's pretty much spending more time saying that he's voicing his opinions and he says that his views are his views very explicitly.  Regarding Spotify, I would appreciate if they paid artists a little more per stream, but going on 4 years now on premium, Spotify is one of the most valuable subscriptions conceivable.  It's $10 a month for unlimited, ad free, downloadable music and podcasts for offline listening. It's absolutely amazing.   I imagine saying at the top that anyone reading this may be surprised at my views on this, but hot damn, we leftists seriously need to chill out and focus on the real issue here, that Joe Rogan's show is meant to entertain and introduce topics for the listener to research and explore on their own, and there's nothing wrong with that, in fact, there's lots of value in that, left or right.	1644004270.0	hvlr3qx	t3_skdmey	t3_skdmey	/r/Conservative/comments/skdmey/spotify_ceo_defends_joe_rogan_to_staff_were_not/hvlr3qx/

9wv07	After watching the video they seemed justified in the shooting after he picked up the gun and would have likely shot back being in a daze with intruding police. What's wrong is not having a knock warrant unless this guy was a highly dangerous suspect which was revealed it was a homicide investigation. They did announce their presence multiple times though but he was likely in a deep sleep. There's a brief moment at :39 where you get an idea of what the officers truly see beyond these low quality videos where he starts pulling the gun toward him and aiming towards the officers. Officers were investigating a warrant of a homicidal individual. I don't think I could've done anything different at that point. Though I have my opinion after this, it's best to understand all sides before saying any party was guilty and let the Jury decide with all evidence and the officers testimony. Due process and justice above all else. This case probably means the no-knock warrants should be reconsidered and the law changed. I think at night people should have a right to knock warrants.	1644006129.0	hvlw1gm	t3_ski9zx	t3_ski9zx	/r/Conservative/comments/ski9zx/video_minneapolis_police_under_fire_for_killing/hvlw1gm/
2rft6plk	This is a good take. First, the cops carrying out the warrant had nothing to do with the no-knock nature. The prosecutor and judge are the ones responsible for the details of the warrant.  I have a general suspicion there is more to this story, but will wait for all the evidence to come out before I jump to any conclusions.   The victim was sleeping at the house of a homicide suspect with a FN 5.7 under his pillow. The 5.7 is known as the ‚Äúcop killer‚Äù round due to its ability to penetrate soft body armor. I‚Äôm an avid gun enthusiast and frequent a number of gun-related subreddits, forums and Facebook pages.

9wv07	5.7 or not it has no bearing on being at fault and would/should be dismissed. The cops weren't at fault for the no-knock but the issue is the system itself putting the cops in a bad position. I see this similar to the Rittenhouse case of being chased and cornered except in this case someone is awake for 1-2 seconds with intruders and has to act quickly. Both the cops and the individual are in identical react situations. The question is how do you stop this situation from happening? Is no-knock valid? I can't see anyone in the cops position of chasing a dangerous suspect and seeing a gun being pulled on them to not defend themselves which is also the defenses case. Therefore, the fault doesn't lay with either individual but the greater issue(law and how to proceed on this matter properly) of what caused this catastrophe. Maybe night time searches aren't a good idea. This guy had the right to react the way he did and officers had the right to respond in the way they did. Obviously a bad situation to put the officers and individual in so it needs to be changed.

bau2vsta	Very few people are true leftists. Most are indifferent. Out of the total population it‚Äôs probable less than 15%. The problem is that they are so loud and authoritarian, that most people would rather just ‚Äúgo along.‚Äù Most people are too nice, or have been too conditioned to criticize someone‚Äôs belief system or even ‚Äúhurt their feelings‚Äù. It‚Äôs not that people agree with it, it‚Äôs that they would rather not rock the boat.  Further, as for the media. I think it‚Äôs the same. But the media likes to focus on the most divisive issues so everyone clicks on it. Since the loudest and most active internet users are also leftists, it‚Äôs natural to play to that audience, because their opponents will also click.  No one is going to read or watch something titled, ‚ÄúMost people actually get along and raps to each other, and at the end of the day basically want the same thing: freedom and safety.‚Äù But that is the reality.	1644170469.0	hvu65c5	t3_slyedp	t3_slyedp	/r/Conservative/comments/slyedp/why_does_it_seem_like_the_ceos_of_all_major/hvu65c5/

This is coming from someone with 6-figures of student loan debt(actually my wife‚Äôs debt not mine).  She was smart enough to get a degree in a field that had jobs that could pay well.  Yeah, it‚Äôs unfortunate she developed a medical issue and can‚Äôt work much anymore, but we structured our entire finances around the possibility one of us lost our job.	1644171215.0	hvu82if	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvu0i2f	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvu82if/

fes8z9r6	I agree loans should at best cover in-state tuition.  But there‚Äôs two things.  First, what if you‚Äôre going for something like computer science, but live in Mississippi.  We all agree that‚Äôs one of the good degrees, but the best schools for that are on the West Coast and some tech schools in the NorthEast.  Going out of state may net you better career opportunities that would help negate the cost of going out of state anyway.  On the other hand, even in state, people needlessly live on campus when they could commute.  In California, I had dozens of options for 4-year Universities, so why should I get extra loans to pay for housing at UCLA, when I could commute to UCR, both of which are UC schools with good academic programs, just different reputations based on the student body.	1644171514.0	hvu8tv9	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvtpaqn	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvu8tv9/
fes8z9r6	Colleges lie all the time about job prospects.  One trick I often see is the average salary trick.  They‚Äôll list majors in the handbook and alongside each major list an average salary.  So you‚Äôll see something like Computer Science with an average salary of $90k and then Theater with an average salary of $56k.  The trick is they only report salaries of graduates who have gotten salaried jobs related to their field several years into their career, and that‚Äôs just people who reported it anyway.  So for Computer Science that makes sense because most people will get jobs and they‚Äôll be salaried, but most Theater people won‚Äôt get salaried positions, or if they do, It‚Äôs a teaching job or something related to the business side of Theater, not necessarily performance	1644171901.0	hvu9t4r	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvu4pzw	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvu9t4r/
cb0gf	It both is and isn't. I have noticed that a common talking point on here surrounding this is the "75 years" of document releases. This is due to there being 300k+ pages that need to be sanitized before their release, and a team of I believe 10 individuals at the FDA responsible for processing almost 400 FOIA requests, including this one.   And another common talking point to counter this need for "sanitation" of the documents is, "why would they need to sanitize anything? what are they hiding?". This perception is a bit misleading because it implies that the documents can just be released as-is -- which is definitely not how the USGov has ever done things. Each page of the 329k documents has to be manually read to determine if there is any sensitive/proprietary information to include trade secrets/personally identifiable information (PII), etc.   The FDA never said they won't release the records, they just said that in the current situation it's going to take a long time for the reasons mentioned above.	1644172064.0	hvua7qi	t3_sltgdy	t1_hvsqnk7	/r/Conservative/comments/sltgdy/the_fda_received_a_court_order_to_declassify/hvua7qi/

Mine built a massive $20million extension onto the gym so they could have a pool.

cb0gf	That's just not feasible. That is not how the US government has operated, nor will it ever.   As I mentioned in the original reply, documents containing trade secrets, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. have to be sanitized for obvious reasons. The U.S. government cannot just willingly release trade secrets of private companies just because someone made a FOIA request regarding that company's records pertaining to their relationship with the USGov.   Think of the implications of that. We are a capitalist society, right? Competition breeds innovation. Now what were to happen if some competitor (in any industry) just submitted a FOIA request to the US government regarding records of their competing company's product and the US gov just released EVERYTHING they had, completely unsanitized? That trade secret is not much of a trade secret anymore.

How does a government payoff of a $100k underwater basket weaving degree benefit society. This policy does not benefit society since in a capitalist economy, good investments are those that generally offer a benefit to society, and by doing so generate a return on the investment. Hence the people who are able to pay off their student loans, or made alternative choices such as business investments, are benefitting society the most but are the most harmed and least helped by such a policy.	1644178023.0	hvup3c2	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvu0i2f	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvup3c2/

Just in the last couple weeks all of the new GOP gerrymandered maps have been struck down as illegal, while the gerrymandered DNC maps all get rubber stamped with no issues. Nobody seems to be taking this seriously, and that is a mistake. People need to sound the alarm on this shit and do something about it.

430h9ujt	Vanguard is a publicly owned non-profit company.  Their handlers are the people and institutions in the Anglosphere who buy shares in their index funds.   Vanguard owns significant shares of Blockrock because Blackrock is an S&P 500 company and Vanguard's most popular products are index funds that track the S&P 500 or the overall US Stock Market.  Vanguard has to buy significant shares in Blackrock.  I don't like Blackrock at all and I think ESG will be bad for investors long term, but we can't put Vanguard on the same level as Blackrock.  Vanguard made Wallstreet accessible to the average person when they first burst onto the scene in the 1970s with their low cost index funds.

If I get a god damn warning label on every medication with a list of 100 side effects ranging from headaches, to anal bleeding, how am I supposed to take the claim seriously that this rushed, and understudied vaccine, just magically has no side effects?

6e3hd	Just ask yourself how one would actually come to the conclusion that the vaccine reduces symptoms? Every single person is entirely different. You can't unvaccinated someone to find out how they would have handled it.  The vaccine reduces viral load, so does having had Covid and having natural immunity. Omicron is fast spreading, but very non-lethal. It's basically the best way to get natural immunity with the lowest risk.   If you base it purely on ICU numbers, it is not accurate. What is more important are what are their co-morbidities? Did the person who was admitted have Covid in the past and have natural immunity or was this the first time they got it? Are they fat as fuck?   In most situations I could replace "unvaccinated" with person more likely to eat a fried Oreo and the sentence would still be as accurate.	1644286528.0	hw11azv	t3_sn4k80	t1_hw10kkh	/r/Conservative/comments/sn4k80/the_demonizing_of_the_trucker_convoy_isnt_about/hw11azv/

Your initial comment was definitely very centered, I apologize.    My main gripes with this vaccine and the entire political culture surrounding it, are the things you touched on. It's the mandating it, it's the censorship surrounding alternative views, the fact you're labeled some far-right nut job if you don't want the vaccine. Like bruh, I had Covid my dude. I'm not interested in getting some shot to help line your pockets. Covid was less bad than the Flu was for me a few years ago before the flu just disappeared lol. The fact that no one wants to talk about the fact this shit was created in a fucking lab. Upended people's lives and killed a fuck ton of people. We're supposed to just pretend that didn't happen. It was Xenophobic, and Trump was a racist, blah blah. The left has gotten damn near everything wrong the past 5 years and there's never an apology, it's just one smear campaign after the next.

590xokia	Shouldn't have said that. They shouldn't be speaking of each other period imo. Trump is still seen as the Devil to a lot of people (thanks to left wing media) and if DeSantis is to run in 2024, the last person he needs to be associated with is Trump. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but its the truth. Even though Trump would stand a good chance at winning, DeSantis could get an all but guaranteed victory if he ran and was seen as a 'rival' to Trump.  My ideal 2024 election is for Trump and DeSantis to run against each other (along with whatever left wing puppet gets up there) and during the entire election, both Trump and DeSantis make it known (without bashing or smearing each other) that they dislike and disagree with each other. I think that alone would be enough for the swing voters and even some of the soft leaning left to vote for DeSantis, mainly because A. He isn't Trump, and B. After the absolute disaster that is the Biden Administration the swing voters at the very least would probably be pretty reluctant to vote Blue again. Of course this is all hypothetical and would require Trump to suppress his ego and swallow his pride.	1644337169.0	hw3j40r	t3_snnip5	t3_snnip5	/r/Conservative/comments/snnip5/desantis_insists_narrative_of_trump_rivalry_is/hw3j40r/

mqe2jg2	Cocaine doesn't have to be illegal to be enticing.  Cocaine makes a poor man feel like a millionaire.  For a little while.  I can only assume the millionaires who smoke crack, feel like gods for a little while.  All the more so, because they get away with it.  Which the poor man does not.   When the high goes away, which happens quickly, dopamine plummets and the result is depression.  It is already utterly depressing to be poor, normal depression plus chemically induced depression is the perfect storm. Cocaine of any kind is the sort of thing that is dangerous to anybody (I can list you a bunch of local businesses that were snorted up their owner's nose) but absolutely demonic to someone who is poor and desperate.        The CIA facilitated cocaine trafficking to the inner cities.  Absolute matter of historical record.  Dealers pre-converted the powdered hydrochloride to the smokable freebase form (crack) which could be sold in tiny single dose lots.    This made it popular for two reasons.  First, freebase could be smoked, which was quick and resulted in a fast, intense high.  But also, pre-converting it meant that tiny one-dose quantities of freebase cocaine could be practically handled and sold, too small to be practically cooked-up from powder by users.   A tiny crack rock could be bought for a few dollars, where an equivalent dose of hydrochloride powder would be impossible to handle without losing most of it.  This made crack a pocket-money drug.       It is also a matter of historical record that the government feared the rise of black liberation groups in the years prior to the crack surge, and that the CIA was attempting to infiltrate and control these groups.  I recommend Wilford's THE MIGHTY WURLITZER if you want to read a bit about this in easily digestible form.        There are not many dots to connect between this, and the CIA-fueled rise of crack in the inner city.  And the results can be seen by anyone who remembers what the inner city was like in the 1980s.	1644439785.0	hw9wbct	t3_sohwey	t1_hw9f0vy	/r/Conservative/comments/sohwey/its_a_progamer_move/hw9wbct/

It's really just "political theatre" and there is no obligation to answer a question directly. You think, "how can anyone get away with not answering a direct question?", but that's the point. It's all for show; the opposition asks questions to make their opponents look bad and they, in turn, "answer" in ways they think make them look good, which is never an answer to the question itself.  As to why the MPs don't call out Trudeau as a liar, it's against the rules of the "show" to flat out call someone a liar.	1644459934.0	hwbaeas	t3_soq2tl	t3_soq2tl	/r/Conservative/comments/soq2tl/lets_talk_about_canadian_parliament_for_a_moment/hwbaeas/

Should this language be signed into law, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) would begin to:  * work with local law enforcement to launch criminal investigations into each NICS denial‚Äîwhich 9 out of 10 times is a false-positive denial of a law-abiding citizen; and  * deputize local law enforcement and attorneys to act as agents of the ATF.   Johnston continued:    >‚ÄúCriminal penalties for trying to buy a gun and deputizing local ATF agents have nothing to do with stopping violence against women and everything to do with penalizing gun ownership.   >**‚ÄúAs the only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington DC, GOA will only stand down when all the anti-gun provisions are deleted or the whole bill crashes and burns.‚Äù**  Gun Owners of America is calling on all gun owners to [contact the Senate and demand the remaining gun control be struck from the final bill](https://www.gunowners.org/na02092022/).	1644494890.0	hwcvco0	t3_sp559y	t3_sp559y	/r/Conservative/comments/sp559y/take_action_antigun_senators_strike_final_deal_to/hwcvco0/

[‚Äì]Devil-sAdvocate 12 points 48 minutes ago   > Does Michael Flynn still have enough brain cells left for this? He was a donor.  I bet Putin told him how and when to plan it.

Flynn should be immediately charged for inciting an insurrection.  ----  No one caught the sarcasm. I got zero pushback. They think Russia is behind it.

Thousands of children are going to have lasting issues because Leftists went full psycho, disregarding all science, logic, and reason and demanded children cover their faces to avoid a disease that doesn't threaten them in the slightest.

807a8	Did you read the book? What were your thoughts on it? Just taking a quick look at it on Amazon, it seems to line up with what I'm driving at in all but one area: the assumption that any white person interested in having a racial sense of identity is inherently a white supremacist.   Ask yourself this: Are we all equal? Then ask yourself, are all African Americans who have a racial sense of identity supremacists? Native Americans? Hispanic Americans? Because if you said "yes" to the first part and "no" to the second, then the law of inductive reasoning states...  Indeed, I would argue that the suggestion that white people who come to desire a sense of racial identity like other groups are inherently bigoted is a self fulfilling prophecy. Just as JFK once said that "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable", I would argue that those who refuse a moderate alternative force that alternative to the fringe.  Think about it: if you've got a bunch of people trying to define themselves, and both the mainstream right and left reject them, the only place let for them to go will be to the extremists. If, however, we allow for open debate and moderate voices to develop, however, we can avoid the bullshit.  I honestly think this is what the alt-Right started out as- a combination of people who were legitimately searching for a voice, and the bad actors that latched onto them. If they had been handled differently while that movement was still young, who knows?	1645077923.0	hx9yc35	t3_sucdrj	t1_hx9o1tq	/r/Conservative/comments/sucdrj/a_student_sleuth_found_evidence_that_our/hx9yc35/

8za5a	I actually don't talk about it much. If we were to talk in person, I think you would be able to see that I am more open minded than certain. There were too many suspicious happenings in the 2018 midterms and then the 2020 presidential election to forget about.    It seems like you want me to actually believe, wholeheartedly, that the 2020 election was not tampered with. After the suspicoous things that went down on and after election night, witch hunts against Trump in the govt and media, blatant, BLATANT media misinformation and propaganda on a variety of topics, the ignoring of blatant crimes committed by politically connected people, I'm going to be mistrustful of any official story.    When the govt asks for nearly 100 years to comply with a freedom on information act request, your suspicions that things aren't up to par should rise.    Pointing these things out isn't some crackpot conspiracy , it's being done right out in the open, and the honest thing to do is to call it out.    You talk of honesty, but it would be insincere for me to say "it's okay guys, there's nothing going on..."	1645088526.0	hxacife	t3_stvd2o	t1_hx9z9u7	/r/Conservative/comments/stvd2o/biden_admin_begs_court_not_to_release_expert/hxacife/
