8wwjsfel	I've heard numerous places that open air fires, with maybe a hole in the roof or a door opened, and chimnerias were used quite often *indoors* until relatively recently. This seems astonishing seeing my friends and family can barely sit around a camp fire without coughing up a lung when the smoke goes our way.  Were previous generations simply "used to it", or was suffocation and lung cancer just like super common?

6o00bi9p	King Song Myong of Paekche, a kingdom in the Korean Peninsula, officially introduced Buddhism in Japan. Sometime between 538-552 AD (sources are differing about the timeline), he sent some sutras and monks along with a Buddha image.   According to _Nihon Shoki_, Soga no Umako (belonging to the influential Soga family) who was presented with the aforementioned image,  after building a temple to house this image, he commissioned a former priest to train three women as nuns. These nuns went to Paekche to study more about Buddhism, returning to Japan in 590AD. And _Nihon Shoki_ states this exchange as the beginning of Buddhism in Japan.   After its official introduction, Prince Shōtoku, nephew of Empress Suiko, the first empress in Japan and also a Buddhist, promoted Buddhism. He played an important role in establishing Buddhism in Japan, erecting two temples, one in Nara and one in Osaka, that are still standing tall today.   A little shy of a century later, Emperor Shōmu's government encouraged people to convert,  they built more temples and preached Buddhism.   There are no records of any Hindu missionaries in Japan. It is said that the renditions of Hindu culture that we see in Japan spread through slow immigration or through  travellers visiting India or other parts of Asia(where Hinduism spread) who took elements of this culture back home, which is how Japan has so many Indian deities and you'll find a harmonious blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. However, there was never any active preaching and converting involved.

brj23ud1	It seems like this conversation has strayed quite far from the original point into debating specific cases that were only intended as possible examples, which is unfortunate because it's an excellent conversation otherwise.   It began with this quote, which I think is fairly uncontroversial  > how teaching a too simplified version of the history of science might actually be detrimental to emerging scientists.  And you said this, which relevant baseball seems to have mostly agreed with  > I think this is what the previous comment referred to as the "march of winners", not in the sense of winners and losers as people, but rather ideas that "won" because they better explained the facts. Because the scientist isn't really interested in the people, they are just convenient names to hang ideas on. Instead, the "history" is just an account of how our understanding of some phenomenon proceeded from A to B, via steps X, Y and Z in between.  > This kind of account absolutely does not replace history, but it's not meant to. It's just a consequence of the division of labor between scientist and historian, with the scientist providing an account of the evolution of an idea, and the historian providing the context surrounding the idea.  This seems to me like the real crux of the problem, before getting into the definition of "shitty papers", "politicization of science" and the details of Morgan's Canon. Because the ideas that better explained the facts may not have been accepted by the wider scientific community at the time, or they may not better explain the facts compared to more modern ideas/theories. The division between scientist and historian is a valid description of the two fields, but that doesn't justify enforcing the division or preclude attempts to bridge the gap. The context surrounding an idea is an important part of how that idea came to be discovered, and even more important to how it came to be accepted by the community at large.   Many modern discoveries and new areas of scientific study come from the combination and overlap of distinct disciplines, occasionally even ones that might be considered outside the realm of hard science. Specialization is understandable and even necessary as the wealth of scientific knowledge increases, but enforcing or relying on strict delineations between disciplines doesn't seem beneficial to Science at large.   Teaching that (theory x) was developed by (some guy) who happened to be obsessed (weird thing) doesn't undermine (some guy)'s achievement. It just leaves the door open for some curious future scientist to get the idea "hey what if (unanswered question) is answered by something (some guy) missed because of his obsession?"  The recent example that lives rent-free in my mind is the airborne particle misunderstanding that we all learned of during the pandemic. The [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/) describes physicists and aerosol scientists trying to convince WHO advisers - scientists themselves! - of the actual danger of airborne particles:  > Morawska had spent more than two decades advising a different branch of the WHO on the impacts of air pollution. When it came to flecks of soot and ash belched out by smokestacks and tailpipes, the organization readily accepted the physics she was describing—that particles of many sizes can hang aloft, travel far, and be inhaled. Now, though, the WHO’s advisers seemed to be saying those same laws didn’t apply to virus-laced respiratory particles. To them, the word airborne only applied to particles smaller than 5 microns. Trapped in their group-specific jargon, the two camps on Zoom literally couldn’t understand one another.  This [NYT column](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-airborne-transmission.html) mentions the case of John Snow discovering how cholera spreads and not being believed for over a decade. So the point of trying to contextualize the "march of winners" approach isn't about politicizing science or trying to make scientists into historians. It's about reminding them the core idea of science - that we should continue to question our assumptions, that there is always more knowledge to be gained. And another idea, that what "science knows" is only what has been accepted and widely disseminated, which is not always the totality of discoveries. Even uncontroversial discoveries take time to be disseminated, validated, and accepted. Making that knowledge a more core part of scientific education seems like a great way to improve the quality and pace of scientific research at the broadest level.	1642800637.0	htnjvbq	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htm2lm3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htnjvbq/

My boss worked with a man who was with patton who was one of the ones who picked up stuff off the German capital building (can’t spell it) floor after the soviets took the metal filing  cabinets but not the documents. He picked stuff off the floor and took it home with him  His stuff went to my library (where I worked) and then onto the smithsonian affiliate. He was an am ambassador who married a Rich women (money family) their kids knew the stuff was important so it went to where scholars can research their lives.

brj23ud1	> Returning to the topic, as I said, I am totally in favor of teaching the history of science. The question addressed the narrower point of teaching it in science classes.  I was addressing the narrower point as well, specifically why a small amount of science history as context around those lessons could be very helpful.  > Perhaps the issue had been politicized already, as the WHO was at many points during COVID  The Wired article I linked is a good read. It answers this question and all of your hypotheticals. Specifically, it's about a woman who was already researching the 100 micron misconception a decade before COVID and her difficulties in convincing other scientists. In other words - mid-pandemic politicization had nothing to do with it. I brought it up because a scientist with a good idea that gets ignored by other scientists is a trend that seems common through history, and if scientists had been taught in the way being discussed - that added context of these major discoveries being ignored or rejected - could have potentially saved many lives. When I talked about dissemination of scientific ideas, I didn't mean to the public. I meant from the scientists making discoveries, to the other scientists ignoring them.	1642818641.0	htot94m	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htoqr0x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htot94m/

That he spoke it with an accent, sure (and even then, accent change with time and Napeolon surely didn't speak with the same corsican accent after 20 years surrounded by people who had other accents), but given that most aristocrats in Europe and especially in Corsica had their children learn French from a young age, and that Napoleon spent many years in immersion in France starting in 1779 when he was just 10 years old, I'm pretty certain that he was fluent at least by the time the French Revolution began.	1642850755.0	htqclli	t3_s9r5do	t3_s9r5do	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9r5do/what_languages_did_people_in_france_speak_before/htqclli/

h8ny3uyr	I can’t speak about what the internal Church discussions about the excommunication were, hopefully someone else can.  I can add some and some information however:   The Catholic Church did do some excommunicating for being a Nazi leader, but it doesn’t appear as if Goebbels was specifically excommunicated for only that.   First, a some background:   Church excommunications of Nazis began in September 1930, when the bishop of Mainz excommunicated every Catholic member of the Nazi party in his diocese, banned uniformed groups from entering churches, and forbade Nazis from taking part in services and ceremonies.   In February 1931, the German bishops had their annual conferences and and decided to support the bishop of Mainz, but limited excommunications to Nazi leaders and activists, and exemptions “followers” who might have supported the Nazi Party for specific policies and without understanding the Nazis’ ultimate goals regarding religion.   In December 1931, Goebbels married. This was the time of his excommunication. While he had considering becoming a priest while younger, by this point he was already quite anti-Christianity, especially against the Catholic Church.   The Church eased its restrictions on Nazi party membership in 1933, at first to accommodate a law requiring all civil employees and union members to be party members, and then as part of maneuvers with the Nazis; cumulating in some public assurances by Hitler and the Reichsconcordant, an agreement signed in July 1933 between the Catholic Church and the German government ostensibly preserving the rights of the Church in Germany (note: Hitler became chancellor in January 1933, and seized full power in 1934). Some Catholics even helped Hitler take power, most prominently Franz von Papen.   With all of this in mind, while his own anti-Church rhetoric and string Nazis ties may well have been preexisting “strikes” that attracted Church attention, I do not believe they were the only reason Goebbels was excommunicated and here is why:  1. His excommunication was not during the general “we excommunicate Nazis leaders as a whole” time of February 1931. His excommunication occurred in at the time of his marriage, in December 1931,. It wasn’t explicitly lifted with the general ban in 1933 either, not even when the Church wasn’t excommunicating Catholics like van Papen for enabling the Nazis to take total power.   2. Geobbels wrote in his diary that he was excommunicated for his marriage, at the time of his marriage. He published an edited version that diary in 1933 before the Nazis took power and when they still the Catholic Church could have been a strong opponent, and then later had all of his diaries processed for posterity, so it is possible that he lied to maintain the fiction that a good Catholic could be a Nazi, but the original, handwritten versions remained, and were published in 2004. They say the same thing.   3. No other major Nazi leaders were excommunicated by name, not even Hitler. Some argue he doesn’t count as he had already made himself an apostate years before so the Church considered him not to be a member, but no one else was excommunicated by name either. If the only reason Geobbels was excommunicated was his Nazi leadership, then why weren’t other Nazis treated similarly?   4. His marriage was going to cause trouble. Catholic canon law from 1917-1983, specifically canon 2319 ​​§1, 1°, said that marrying, baptizing a child, or teaching a child in a belief other than Catholicism was cause for automatic excommunication.    Goebbels married a divorced Protestant, who was only a Protestant herself because she was a Catholic apostate who converted to Protestantism to marry her now ex-husband, in a civil ceremony filled with the leaders of an anti Catholic party, but no priests. This was enough for automatic excommunication, and the high profile of the wedding meant that the Church was sure to know about it.   So why didn’t the Church excommunicated more Nazis?  It is very late for me, and this is in an entire question itself, but the extremely brief answer is that there are two ways to be excommunicated.   The fast way is the automatic way (latae sententiae) that Goebbels did it. Break the wrong church rule, and you get automatic excommunication the moment that you do it. Perhaps there may be some paperwork, but that is all that it is. You are out.  The other is by trail (sententiae ferendae). This is rare, and the existing canon law didn’t apply perfectly to what the Nazis were doing.   Of course it could have been done in some form, as the 1930/31 decisions showed, but the ultimately failed efforts to maintain Church independence in Germany and some ambivalence about some Nazi policies by some in the Church made it not Really Worth It until it was way too late.  Then, the war was on, oppression was already great, Hitler’s ally Mussolini was also a strong church supporter at home in Italy and couldn’t be pushed too far, and then after that, the war was over.

iovlhi6b	Good question, and I agree that it's a "chicken and egg" one.  Germans emigrated to many parts of the world during the 19th century, but particularly to the U.S. and Canada.  There, they became part of a transnational German culture, which had frequent exchanges and contacts with Germans "back home."  German-language press in North America reported on white settlement and conflicts with Indigenous cultures, and these reports were sometimes reprinted in Germany.  Using their contacts in German-American communities, German artists and authors sometimes came to North America and met with Indigenous peoples; after they went home, they published travel literature, novels, gave lectures, and sold art based on their observations of the West and its peoples; Rudolf Cronau is a good example of someone with this type of career.  There was a clear audience for this type of travel literature or fiction, since many Germans had grown up reading James Fenimore Cooper's *Leatherstocking Tales* (very popular in 19th century Germany), along with popular German author of Westerns like Friedrich Gerstaecker and Balduin Moellhausen.  For more on the transnational cultural exchanges between Germans around the West and its peoples, I'd recommend H. Glenn Penny's *Kindred by Choice*.	1642957016.0	htwdfn8	t3_savz63	t1_htw1se0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwdfn8/

Idk much about Muscovy, it was originally populated by many fino-ugric peoples (Merya, Murom, Meshchera, Mordvinians). I think the apropriate question would be when people of Muscovy became assimilated by Slavic people.	1642971714.0	htxfhb6	t3_sb37w1	t3_sb37w1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb37w1/when_did_the_east_slavs_divide_themselves_into/htxfhb6/

96gqp	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643043615.0	hu1fg9r	t3_sbpztw	t3_sbpztw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbpztw/what_are_many_ways_classical_greek_civilization/hu1fg9r/

7t081j24	answer : Systemic racism prevented white consumers from accepting black art. Black music labels and black acts have always had to in a sense “white wash” themselves to appeal to the mainstream. Combine that with the fact that early classic rock n roll acts had to limit their excitability to appeal to the mainstream, its safe to say that US society effectively suppressed black music and rock n roll music in general.    It’s speculation but I believe if the world had a better understanding of race relations during this time, there would have been more black artists in radio circulation, larger white acts would have been able to include more black musicians in their collaborative work, labels would be able to sell more black music etc.  That being said, i’m sure others could view this differently. This is all speculative.	1643145110.0	hu7e8ox	t3_scn87b	t1_hu7dy2a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scn87b/if_america_desegregated_earlier_would_america_be/hu7e8ox/

4zro2	I recently read a pretty good book, [Blood Work](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Work-Medicine-Scientific-Revolution/dp/0393342239/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=EOrdI&pf_rd_p=29505bbf-38bd-47ef-8224-a5dd0cda2bae&pf_rd_r=PJFJXR0N52PGKX85KD3F&pd_rd_r=ee0d9692-caed-4e71-9afd-c4a76b790375&pd_rd_wg=xJ7g3&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m) by Holly Tucker about the first blood transfusion. You may think of transfusion as a relatively recent development dating roughly to roughly the first decade of the 20th century. But actually Tucker points out that the first known transfusion of blood occurred in 1667 when a French doctor by the name of Jean Denis built a contraption of wood and tubing to transfer the blood of a calf into the arm of a (probably) schizophrenic man. All this was made possible by the discovery in the early 17th century of the basic circulation of blood around the body and by extensive and brutal testing on both animal and human patients. Yet in Denis' case, the death of his subject Antoine Mauroy put a public end to his experimentation. Blood transfusions stopped entirely as a practice until 1901 when Karl Landsteiner accidentally discovered the existence of blood types, and at the same time that blood of the wrong type would cause a reaction which could kill the patient as it had Mauroy. I'm not sure if he was familiar with Denis' work or not, but the accidental nature of Landsteiner's vital discovery suggests that most doctors at this time were not actively working to build on Denis' long forgotten studies. Holly Tucker also points out that even had Denis cleared the first hurdle and, through some feat of random guessing, had transferred compatible blood from on patient into another without killing them, there were still larger problems which would have to be addressed before blood transfusions would have been adopted into the world of 17th century medicine, let alone before they were employed for anything which blood transfusions today are good for. For example, while the medical community had come round to the idea that blood circulated around the body, its exact role in human health was still mysterious. Without microscopes cell theory, there was no way for them that blood was filled with cells that carried food, oxygen, white blood cells (immune response), and other vital things around the body. The Galenic model of the human body suggested that blood was digested food, which traveled from the stomach to the heart to be burnt in the 'body's furnace,' the exhaust of which was breath. This framework was beingly slowly challenged thanks to new discoveries including the wider circulation of blood, BUT! its important to note that there wasn't anything better waiting in the wings to take over. 17th century Europeans just lacked the philosophical and intellectual framework required to build on the potential of Denis' discovery. Removing blood to balance the body's humors, another popular idea at the time and the one which would inevitably lead to George Washington's premature demise, also sat uncomfortably with the idea of transfusion. Many of the illnesses which stem from a """"lack"""" of blood would be, in modern terms, psychological and not physiological. So what would be the benefit of a transfusion? Meanwhile many ailments which were physical or bacterial/viral in nature were attributed to an *excess* of blood, and so removal, not transfusion, was the preferred solution. In this medical worldview its hard to see where transfusions, even if they were successful, would find a place. I think this also explains why Denis' discovery wasn't replicated until the early 20th century. Its about then, or perhaps just a few decades prior, when discoveries about the human body finally replaced Galenic and Humoristic theories with something more concrete.   I write all this not because I think you, or anyone else, are interested in blood. But you should check the book out, its pretty good. I use it instead first give OP an example of a technology which was "unlocked" in video game terminology, but which was not used until it was "reunlocked" later on. But really I'd actually like to use this story to highlight the idea that technological innovation isn't at all linear. If we think of technology as a branching tree at all, and there is much to think that that is a wrongheaded way to look at the world, then societies are like squirrels, running up and down the boughs jumping wildly from one major branch to another. Sometimes falling out, sometimes getting to the top, but always acting chaotically. Technological innovation is in and of itself not the be-all, end-all of human existence. It is also not something that really progresses in this linear tech tree way the way something like Civilization portrays it. You dont unlock 'circulation of blood' tech, then move on to 'transfusion' tech, then get +5 to your pops lifespan and unlock other techs. People discover things all the time, things which may connect back to the dark mysteries of the universe. But they then filter it through their biases and their worldview (and yes, even scientists have those!) to connect the discovery with what they think they know is true. We know the body has blood, I've discovered it flows all around the body. Neat. Why? Answering that question is often more important than just proving you can do a thing. And that build on a whole field's worth of discoveries, it builds on a scientist's own knowledge of that field, and it builds on ideas popular in that society at the time. Take another scientist, Samuel George Morton. A Philadelphia man, he measured historical skulls collected for him around the world to an exacting degree. His calculations of the interior volume of his collection were over 90% accurate according to more modern measurements, and Morton drew from this a very accurate understanding of the interior volume of the brains of ancient Egyptian, Amero-Indian, Greek, South African, and other peoples. From this correct science he concluded that the Greeks, who had the biggest skulls, were the descendants of Adam whereas all the other non-white people were created by god to be separate and different lesser lifeforms. Accurate science, inaccurate philosophy.   So much plays into a scientific discovery. You need the discoverer and their own personal background and training, some basic technologies, and recent discoveries to build on. Or a lucky accident. But then for something like that to catch on and enter a much narrower body of 'applied' discovery, you need a philosophical framework to incorporate the discovery, explain why its useful, and why people should do or use the thing being discovered. It needs a governmental and society structure flexible enough in this area to incorporate the new idea (Denis' transfusion of a calf's blood into a human was widely decried at his trial as being unnatural and ungodly). You may need other roughly contemporary discoveries to recontextualize the initial finding into something useful. You may need a crisis, or the lack of a crisis, to move public attention where it needs to be. Money to fund initial or follow up experiments, exposure to publicize successes or hide failures. SO much goes into "unlocked" a technology, if thats even the right way to look at it (its not) that its impossible, IMO, to accept the linear civilization model. I would instead suggests a fundamentally chaotic, random, model in which people just figure things out and either it puts other knowledge into better context or it doesnt and is forgotten until one day new knowledge fills in the gaps of old. But my random model of technology wouldn't make for a good game I think.	1643205691.0	hualpyj	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hualpyj/

In schools and universities we had civil defense classes where we made cotton gauze bandage, learned ho to determine the type of attack, how to perform a first aid, put on gas masks for speed (each establishment in the country had stock of them, constantly maintained). Also, the food reserve storage were maintained.
