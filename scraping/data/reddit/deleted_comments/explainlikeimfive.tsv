cmht5eup	Cyan/Magneta/Yellow is the set of subtractive primary colors (suitable for inks and paints).  Red/Blue/Green is the set of additive primary colors (suitable for lighting or illuminated displays like computer screens).  &#x200B;  Blue/red/yellow is not a set of primary colors. This is used as a simplified version of cyan/magneta/yellow for teaching school children, because it's close enough for school painting class, and it saves having to teach what "cyan" and "magenta" are.	1642706665.0	hthxld0	t3_s8imhu	t1_htge3un	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8imhu/eli5_can_a_pure_blue_be_created_using_cmyk/hthxld0/
cmht5eup	In very basic theory, CMYK should be able to produce a pure blue by mixing cyan and magneta. The basic theory states that there are 3 primary colors of light detected by the eye - red, green and blue. Cyan reflects green and blue. Magenta reflects red and blue. Mixing cyan and magenta should therefore reflect only blue.  The problem is that things in real life are not so simple. For a start, the eye's color sensors (the cones) have overlapping sensitivities, which means that the simple theory of primary colors (red, green and blue additive, or CMY subtractive) together doesn't work as accurately as you might think.   The other issue is generating wavelengths of light that try to activate just one type of the eye's cones. This is reasonably practical with colored LEDs, for example you can get deep blue LEDs which produce a small range of wavelengths in the deep blue region, which has very little effect on the eye's green and red cones, giving a very deep and pure blue sensation.  But while we can do this with LEDs, it is more of a problem with inks. Practical cyan inks, for example, do not generally reflect deep blue (indigo) wavelengths - but mainly reflect the "royal blue", cyan and green wavelengths.   This means that if you actually did the cyan/magneta mix, you would find that because the cyan blocks the deep blue wavelengths, what you get would actually be less saturated and slightly greener than the expected pure blue.	1642707932.0	hti0zxh	t3_s8imhu	t3_s8imhu	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8imhu/eli5_can_a_pure_blue_be_created_using_cmyk/hti0zxh/

gb4h3	They're talking about getting into a 6 point harness. I encourage you to try getting strapped in while wearing a HANS device, helmet, and fireproof gloves. You physically can't see or feel (because of the gloves) what you're doing, so you're probably going to mess up the order of straps on the camlock and lose your submarine strap under the seat if you try. Nor can you get enough leverage to tighten the shoulder straps all the way. Never mind if you're racing an open cockpit and therefore have to have arm restraints. In every level of racing I've done beyond autocross you have a buddy strap you in.

vhxas	Portfolio margin (borrowing against your stocks) is not like a mortgage -- you don't have a schedule or deadline to pay it back. It's more like credit card debt except the interest is way way way lower and the line of credit limit is really high and keeps going up. If you don't pay it off, the interest charge just gets added to what you owe. You don't have to repay it to borrow more. You just keep borrowing more.  You can lever up to 2x in most margin brokerage accounts. So that means you only need $500k in your brokerage margin account to own $1m in stocks. So you can withdraw the other $500k cash. (In practice though you don't want to be at the limit, because then you risk a margin call if the value of your stocks goes down.)  So lets say you have $10million in stocks, need $200k per year for living expenses, assume stock increases in value 10% per year and that the margin interest rate is 2%:  |after x years|portfolio value|total owed| |:-|:-|:-| |1|$11m|$204k| |2|$12.1m|$412k| |3|$13.31m|$624k| |4|$14.64m|$841k| |5|$16.11m|$1.06m| |6|$17.72m|$1.29m| |7|$19.49m|$1.52m| |8|$21.44m|$1.75m|  After 8 years, despite borrowing more and more, your net worth (what you have minus what you owe) has just about doubled. There's no reason to ever pay it back. Your wealth grows faster if you don't.	1642732429.0	htjncfg	t3_s8rnk6	t3_s8rnk6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8rnk6/eli5_how_do_the_rich_borrow_against_their_wealth/htjncfg/

wyemd	Ukraine, Georgia, and several other countries were part of the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia lost about half its GDP as newly independent states broke away. Putin has repeatedly called the collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest catastrophe in history.  Putin is seeking to rebuild the Soviet empire and has stoked nationalism at home by doing so. He's invaded parts of Georgia, Crimea, and put down Chechnya's rebels with violence. Those actions have hurt Russia economically, but to keep his iron grip on power, he needs to keep expanding Russia's borders to suppress discontent at home.  Ukraine is the most developed, most wealthy, and most industrialized of the former Soviet republics. In  2004, a popular uprising against Ukraine's corrupt and Putin-aligned government resulted in democratic elections in which the country aligned itself more with the west, signing free trade agreements with the EU. If Russia invades Ukraine, it gets the economic benefits of the spoils of war -- Ukraine's GDP would be siphoned off to Russia and democratic elections would be a thing of the past.  Because it knows this, Ukraine is rapidly building up its own defenses, so if Russia is to invade, it must do so soon. Time isn't on Russia's side because while Ukraine is relatively weak now, it's only getting stronger. Putin presumably believes the benefits of invading Ukraine are greater than the costs.	1642733412.0	htjpmo3	t3_s8zgyy	t3_s8zgyy	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8zgyy/eli5_why_does_russia_want_to_take_over_ukraine_so/htjpmo3/

ycvtv	We can't say for certain, because Renaissance Technologies keeps all of their methods very, very secret.  But he probably applied what comes down to advanced statistical methods to model the market as a semi-random system. I'll try and ELI5 it for you.  Imagine that you're waiting for an Uber. You ordered it from far away, so it's taking a while to get to you. How fast it's traveling at any point in time is not the same, since differences in traffic levels, traffic lights, speed limits, etc. affect the precise amount it travels every minute. But over 15 minutes, you notice that it moved 3.2 miles in the first 5 minutes, 2.7 miles in the second 5 minutes, and 3.1 miles in the third 5 minutes, so you conclude that it moves about 3 miles every 5 minutes. There's 4.5 miles left to get to you, so you estimate it will take roughly 7.5 minutes to get to you.  The longer you record data, the more accurate your prediction - and most critically, you can put a number on that accuracy. Say that you track that particular Uber over the course of three full days driving in identical conditions (yeah, I know, that doesn't happen, but let's pretend). You notice that the average speed is 3 miles in 5 minutes. 68% of the time, it goes between 2.7 and 3.3 miles, 95% of the time it goes between 2.4 and 3.6, and 99.7 percent of the time it goes between 2.1 and 3.9. So now you can predict how far the Uber will go in an hour, with a full range of possible speeds and likelihoods.  Let's go a little further and say that you're going to make a betting with your friends about the distance the car travels in an hour. You have developed this model, which means you have detailed predictions about the odds of various outcomes. You can now consider all of the bet offers that people give, and only accept the ones that you think you'll win. You won't be right every time, but if you did your work well, you'll be right more often than you'll be wrong, and you'll end up making money. Get a thousand friends in this betting pool, and you can make a lot of money. Get on the open stock market and you can make billions.  The actual models used are almost certainly more complex than average and standard deviation (which is what I described above), but the idea is the same: consider past performance, try to fit a mathematical model to allow you to make predictions, and then make the bets that you think you'll win.	1642746984.0	htkgilb	t3_s93a8f	t3_s93a8f	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s93a8f/eli5_what_mathematics_did_jim_simons_use_to_crack/htkgilb/

du4inlze	There are 20 balls in a basket. We bring 4 more baskets. Now we divide the 20 balls equally to each basket. So if dividing means asking how many balls each basket has, the answer is 4.

Then we ask the same question: how many balls each basket has, and the answer is 20.

3ajn7	If every man woman and child was given $50000 cash you still wouldn't reach the level of nation debt we're at now.   Current student debt is around $2 trillion. That could be paid off with current tax revenue rates in 4 years just by taking a bite out of *deficit* defense spending. The federal government budgets about $300 billion to cover military wages, benefits, housing, veterans affairs, etc AND defense maintenance and expansion, and yet every year the actual spend after adding handouts to giants like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman on extremely overpriced contracts for current and new fluff R&D projects is close to $1 trillion.  With the defense deficit spending money, we could end homelessness, revitalize education, have universal healthcare for all,  free education up through post-secondary, you name it.   But Republicans and Democrats alike in congress who are in it for the greased palms and stock options (i.e. money in politics) will never touch that money not effect real, positive social welfare reform.  So yeah that's why we "can't afford" to cancel student debt, like like we "can't afford" to clothe, feed, and shelter the homeless, and "can't afford" universal heathcare; congress flips back and forth between two parties of politicians who either have a vested interest in not fixing the budget, or are afraid to.	1642778473.0	htlvl03	t3_s9bqg4	t3_s9bqg4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9bqg4/eli5_how_would_we_cancel_student_loan_debt/htlvl03/

7djifol7	When light passes through a hole, the distance from the object being observed, the hole, and the surface that image is reflect upon are very important.  If the hole (aperture), is too big, it will let in too much light, and this reflects on the surface (the back of your eye / retina) as very fuzzy.  If the aperture is too small, it won't let in enough light, and this doesnt reflect enough on the back of your retina to discern any meaningful shape.  There is a range of aperture sizes that is useful to you. Since the distance from your eyes lens to your retina is largely the same, the primary drivers of your aperture size is distance from yourself and the object, and the amount of light available.  Your body provides feedback based on your senses; you consciously know if what you're looking at is sharply focused or fuzzy. You have control over this (try unfocusing your vision on your phone, zoning out, and everything gets blurry).  But your brain has a baseline of, "yeah, this is focused" and tends to apply that to objects you see day to day.	1642782745.0	htm6ubg	t3_s9c2vq	t3_s9c2vq	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9c2vq/eli5_how_come_our_sight_increase_and_decrease/htm6ubg/

gyahvs1j	Provided you set up your credit card to be fully paid off every month you won’t owe any interest on it.  One advantage of credit cards, particularly for online purchases, is that there are a lot more protections for you when you buy stuff - for example in a dispute over whether goods were delivered, or arrived as described and the seller won’t process a return you can request a “Chargeback” that the card issuer should handle provided they don’t think you’re committing fraud. With Debit Cards this option isn’t on the table.  Another is that they help build a credit rating **if used responsibly** that will be useful when buying things like cars or applying for a mortgage.   If you are concerned about spending getting out of hand or starting to clock up a debt that rolls over each month and accrues rather a lot of interest you can get a pre-paid credit card where you put the money on in advance but then it functions like a regular credit card for purposes of consumer protections and credit rating building.	1642786200.0	htmg9nb	t3_s9ftyv	t3_s9ftyv	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9ftyv/eli5_credit_cards_in_general/htmg9nb/

1276s7	ALMOST, and you're along the right path so kudos. Dry drowning occurs due to negative pressure pulmonary edema and irritant pneumonitis.   When that valve (the epiglottis) closes, people still try to take a deep breath in; this results in them pulling a lot of pressure into their chest but, because that valve is closed, no air comes in and the 'negative' pressure reaches levels that can damage tissue. This leads to damage to the small blood vessels in the lung, which leads to leakage of fluid INTO the lung air sacs (the alveoli). This fluid accumulates in the lungs and is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema inhibits oxygen absorption, which can lead to respiratory failure.  The other component to it is that the small amounts of water inhaled into the lungs can cause inflammation and damage to small blood vessels (pneumonitis), which causes leakage of even more fluid into the lungs. This contributes to MORE pulmonary edema.  The combined effects can lead to severe pulmonary edema and, potentially, respiratory distress or failure.  This is why dry drowning can occur hours and hours after people have gotten out of the water and think they're fine. Many may die in their sleep overnight as the fluid accumulates. Thats why you have to be very careful to monitor kids after any near drowning event.    **Also, to answer the main question: when you don't swallow correctly, the muscle contraction of the esophagus (the swallowing tube) is uncoordinated and leads to disorganized, high-pressure contractions called esophageal spasm (which is very painful, similarly to overcontracting one of your skeletal muscles like your biceps). In fact, some people with esophageal spasm are mistaken as having a heart attack and sent for emergency angiography, which may come back totally clean.  You always read about this scenario in med school but I never believed it; however, that exact thing ended up happening to my uncle a few years ago (a very healthy guy with almost no risk factors for heart disease). Angiography was completely normal but his esophagus was as disorganized as an outlet mall on black Friday.

gyahvs1j	It can, provided you get to it before it metastasizes.  What is metastasis you ask?  When a tumor grows it sheds other cancerous cells - these spread through your body, exact mechanism depends on the tumor and location. Once in a while one of these cells will get a foothold somewhere away from the cancer site. It might sit there doing nothing, it might grow slowly, it might grow quickly.  These are called secondary tumors. While small they might be virtually impossible to detect. They’re also the same cancer as the original tumor - eg if a lung cancer secondary starts growing in your liver you have lung cancer in your liver. As I’m sure you’re guessing - this is very bad news for the patient.  If you get to a tumor before it has done this, and it’s not inoperable due to some technical difficulties as it’s wrapped around an artery or something, then removing the tumor has a great prognosis for the patient.  If you get to it afterwards… removal material not be worth it or might not solve the most critical issues, and the recovery from major surgery could shorten their life more than dealing with the tumors via other means.  But why can’t you remove the secondaries?  Well, these often end up everywhere, with multiple tumors, many of which may not be detectable, some of which may not be operable. You could maybe try, but then you’re playing wack-a-mole with each removal presenting a severe recovery that could weaken the patients ability to survive the rest of the tumors, or you know more secondaries are gonna activate soon enough anyway.	1642801591.0	htnmiop	t3_s9lc8i	t3_s9lc8i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9lc8i/eli5_why_cant_cancer_just_be_cut_out/htnmiop/

Kind of like stretching a rubber band, the sides closest and furthest from the moon go out further, which is what we know as a high tide. A high tide can’t just come from nowhere, the high tides pull water from other places, causing the low tides in the middle.  Where phases come in is just in that if the sun and moon are in line (full moon) the sun’s gravitational pull also comes into play, creating the same high and low tides but to a higher degree. The suns gravitational pull is less than half of the moon’s though, so if they aren’t in line the sun’s pull somewhat cancels the moon’s out, creating the same high and low tides, but to a lesser degree.	1642804768.0	htnv3c2	t3_s9mu7i	t3_s9mu7i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9mu7i/eli5_how_can_the_moon_phases_affect_the_tides/htnv3c2/

gyahvs1j	Why would they?  Cities end up mostly being built where it makes sense to have a city.  You’ll note that in the UAE the cities are mostly on or near the coast, similar to Australia. Saudi is somewhat more varied, but the locations of cities are still very much a product of resources and history.  There is very little reason to build a large city in most of WA, NT or SA - due to limited resources, and even where there is potential for development it’s difficult to attract people to live there due to a fairly limited lifestyle available 1000km from any major population center.  So… not many people want to move there because there’s not much there, and there’s not much reason to put anything there for people to move to.  Its not like the place is cramped with the currently populated areas around the coast either - the most densely populated state, of which most is habitable, has a population density of about 30 per sq.km, on par with Vermont, or slightly more dense than Arizona. The next most densely populated state, again a lot of it is habitable, has fewer than 10/sq.km. In other words -  or only isn’t there much reason for people to move *to* the center, there’s not exactly a drastic shortage of space in the populated areas to push people *from* the existing populated areas.	1642810499.0	hto9oho	t3_s9oq6d	t3_s9oq6d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9oq6d/eli5_why_isnt_australia_able_to_build_anything_on/hto9oho/

The LHC (all particle accelerators actually), look at what happens when we force collisions of microscopic particles.  In both cases, the object of the test is to cause damage: with a dummy, we analyze the results to minimize hypothetical damage to people. Particle accelerators like LHC cause collisions of particles to see what happens, and to try to break particles into their smallest particles and sub-particles that we can observe.	1642823568.0	htp4q0n	t3_s9sqdj	t3_s9sqdj	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9sqdj/eli5_large_hadron_collider/htp4q0n/

But when I was interested in Civil War re-enacting, I found a pair of period-correct frames and had lenses made for them. Those frames were designed to sit much closer to your eyes. The lenses were much thinner, because they didn't have to bend the light as far as my modern glasses do. It took some time for me to get used to glasses where the lenses were so close.	1642824759.0	htp7bdp	t3_s9ngcv	t1_htp2kfz	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9ngcv/eli5_how_come_were_able_to_make_paperthin_contact/htp7bdp/

3jfs15fp	Not a lawyer. But my layman's understanding is:.      In the American system, anything you give to the police can be used against you but not for you.   I believe the legal term for evidence in your favor is"exculpatory" ie it's evidence to prove you were not culpable.    It's kinda messed up, it means if you are indicted then the fact you gave your alibi to the police isn't something the court can consider in your favor. The prosecutor also isn't required to put that in front of the jury. B Don't know if that makes it easier to land more plea bargains.       In the British system, your alibi you give the police must be included in the brief of evidence. This means the police have to prove your alibi false and include that in the evidence as well.   The court can consider anything in the evidence eg an alibi given to police as being in your favor, not just used against you.   This probably works as a counterbalance to the fact plea deals are far less common.	1642831613.0	htpkm36	t3_s9rlsm	t3_s9rlsm	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9rlsm/eli5_the_police_caution_after_being_arrested_in/htpkm36/

bx4g9	Admissions by silence can also happen in America.  "The non-denial of a statement made in the presence of the party charged which tends to establish his liability may amount to an admission of its truth, if, as it appears in this case, the statement was heard and understood by the party and he had knowledge of the facts stated; was not physically disabled from answering; had a motive for denying it and would naturally do so if he does not intend to admit it, and was at liberty to make a reply... \[T\]his silence \[is\] admissible evidence from which an admission of its truth may be inferred, the inference to be drawn being left to the jury."

fkz68	1 wasn't an assault rifle, 2 killed people in self defense. You really should google it as the person you replied to was purposefully vague and used incorrect definitions to paint Rittenhouse in a bad light.   Dude was at a protest providing first aid to all protestors and cleaning graffiti. He has family in town and works there only recently moving about 15-30 minutes from town to a sub rural area just over the state border where Kenosha is the closest metro area to. Later in the night rioters show up and he is asked by the local car dealership to act as armed security there (armed security guards are a thing in all of the u.s. states and common with at most a proof of ability to shoot accurately as requirement to get the job.) His friend gave him an ar15 he bought with Rittenhouse's money. Rittenhouse that night put out a fire being pushed into a gas station by a Mr. Rosenbaum. Mr. Rosenbaum at that time proceeded to threaten to kill anyone in Rittenhouse's group if he found them alone.   Later that night when Rittenhouse was walking between dealership lots offering first aid (after the police blockaded the road that lead to one of the lots) Mr. Rosenbaum spotted Rittenhouse and hid behind a car with an accomplice. When Kyle passed the parked car Mr. Rosenbaum gave chase yelling "fuck you" while his accomplice fired a gun in the air or at Rittenhouse (this has not been determined) Rittenhouse turned around after hearing the shot and saw Rosenbaum lunging for him and Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum 3 times as Rosenbaum grabbed his barrel (this is corroborated by burn marks from the barrel on Rosenbaum's hand).   At this point Rittenhouse saw a mob forming and started running to the police line. As he did Mr. Grosskreutz on Grosskreutz's own livestream asked Rittenhouse what he was doing. Kyle said "going to the police" Which Grosskreutz said he misheard as "I'm with the police" in his testimony. Someone yelled get him.   At this time Mr. Huber can be seen chasing Rittenhouse and a rock can be seen thrown and hitting Rittenhouse causing him to fall. When he falls Huber gets on top of him and hits him with a skateboard to the head. Rittenhouse shoots and kills him, Grosskreutz (then also chasing Rittenhouse) feigns friendliness by putting his hands up and decides to aim at Rittenhouse when Rittenhouse lowers his weapon. Rittenhouse re raises his gun and shoots Grosskreutz's bicep and while Grosskreutz tends to his wound Rittenhouse runs to the police who yell at him to go home and drive off when he tries to turn himself in. He does so and drives 15-30 minutes to his house and then goes to the local police station to turn himself in for questioning. There was a fourth man involved that assaulted Rittenhouse but narrowly avoided being shot and ran off.   I left out the background of everyone involved just as the court did. I only referenced the distance Rittenhouse drove to give proper context to it before someone tries to use it as a demerit when it isn't one like some think. These are all facts from the trial and the reason he was found not guilty which due to the presumption of "Innocent until proven guilty" means his innocence was not stripped from him as he was not found guilty. Transitive property and all that. Everything I stated is straight from the trial with no opinion added just what the witnesses stated and video corroborated. At no point was Kyle found to be the aggressor.   You can judge his decision to be there but if you do you must give the same scrutiny to everyone that decided to be there, You can judge the being armed but must also do the same for everyone else that had a gun there (many gun shots besides Rittenhouse's and Rosenbaum's accomplice's that night.)	1642843342.0	htq2frx	t3_s9rlsm	t1_htpvxfx	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9rlsm/eli5_the_police_caution_after_being_arrested_in/htq2frx/

This is called adverse inference. While you don't have to say anything, if you don't answer a question and then in court you do answer that question and it provides you with a defence, then the court has a right to think "well why wouldn't you just say that when they asked in the first place?" and MAY draw adverse inference, as it suggests that you have changed your story now you've had time to think up an excuse.  - Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

hrmslmk8	But turning around in court and saying it was the passenger is exactly what you're saying to do.  If you raise the defence of duress in court then the police will investigate this defence and find evidence to disprove it so as to eliminate the possibility of there being reasonable doubt in court. So if it's actually the truth then they will not find anything that disproves it and will have to disclose that to the court.  By not mentioning it beforehand you allow the court to draw adverse inference.  If you are genuinely innocent, it is not better whatsoever to not say anything. It's best to speak to a lawyer and do what they tell you to do. Which if you're innocent is usually to give an honest account.	1642848216.0	htq92f6	t3_s9rlsm	t1_htptyd3	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9rlsm/eli5_the_police_caution_after_being_arrested_in/htq92f6/

When I interview an innocent person who has a lawyer in the room and has had legal advice beforehand, they also answer all my questions as they have been advised to by a lawyer.

elf2o4lj	Your question is really about cultural conventions that differ from place to place. It is not possible to answer without a historical and geographical context. You are asking something like: "Why are people in place X busy categorizing people from place Y to be of type Z". The label "asians" refers to people living on an enormous continent, and the group comprise more than half the world population and they look very different. What the label "white" means and the importance attached to it is also cultural and likely to vary from place to place.	1642850283.0	htqbxsu	t3_s9zxs4	t3_s9zxs4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9zxs4/eli5_why_arent_asians_considered_white_when/htqbxsu/

1udvgyz4	It feels like most of reddit is either adhd or autistic. Why is that? Look at my post history. I stopped reddit 2 years ago sometime and I only logged in because I was bored on holiday.   You're taking a stimulatant medication. It improves focus as prescribed but you also need to rid yourself of unnecessary distractions. The worst distractions are those of instant gratification (social media, memes, pointless arguing online).   The biggest lesson I've learned is to not be cheap with time. I know how much I get distracted so I know this is hard for a lot to hear, and it sounds obvious, but if you know it takes you longer to get a task done then you should give yourself more time.  My point: 1. allow yourself some distractions but stay away from instant gratification. 2. Plan your life to give yourself more time to complete tasks. You're better off just trying 20min a day for something rather than 4 hours in one go.	1642856908.0	htqm18i	t3_s9ze9r	t3_s9ze9r	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9ze9r/eli5_why_is_it_so_hard_to_study_if_you_have_adhd/htqm18i/

6qr5t	"woman" is a name we gave to a person who embodies the "feminine" and "femininity" is a human idea.   Cold is a relative term. Ice is hot compared to liquid nitrogen, or deep space.  Night is only dark to us because we can't see well  in it. To an animal adapted to hunting at night, or my camera set to long exposure, you can see just fine.  Feminine only makes sense when defined against masculinity.

It was just normal for the streetlight to illuminate the side of the house including my window. Then one night a couple of years back I had an almost completely dark bedroom (unrelated to power outages etc). It was AWESOME. Even better, the streets don't look sickly yellow anymore.

We know roughly how strong this effect is relative to how much mass there is. We know the effect of this is inversely proportional to the distance away from a mass.

du45b	Most people would say the exact opposite, that LED streetlights feel *brighter* than older incandescent technologies, and that’s due to the color spectrum of LEDs overlapping more with human vision. Humans are more sensitive to blue light while sodium lamps tend to put out a very reddish/yellowish light that seems dimmer even if the measured brightness is higher.  To answer your specific question about why they wouldn’t seem as bright I can only assume it’s because your municipality didn’t do the proper research on what kind of LEDs would work best for their needs, or maybe they went with the lowest bidder who couldn’t deliver what they really needed.	1642898507.0	httdif1	t3_sa1jul	t3_sa1jul	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sa1jul/eli5_why_does_led_not_illuminate_areas_well/httdif1/

They don't just lie -- they craft lies and create narratives specifically to mess with a person's head and take away their agency. It's emotional abuse and psychological manipulation.   What you're describing is someone who simply lies and refuses to own up to their lies. That's different.	1642901707.0	httkvqc	t3_sah6xj	t1_htthh1w	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sah6xj/eli5_gaslighting/httkvqc/
134ae4	There is a very important theorem in probability theory called the "central limit theorem". What it says is that if you repeat a random event a large number of times and take the average of the outcomes, the average will always approach a specific distribution-- which we call the "normal distribution".  An example:  The outcome of a fair six-sided die roll is **not** normally distributed. Each outcome is equally likely, which in statistics we call a "uniform distribution".   Suppose you performed an "experiment", where each run of that experiment consists of rolling the die twice and recording the results. After plotting the results from many runs, you would find that some numbers come up a lot more often than others -- for example, rolling a 7 happens about six times as often as rolling a 12. If you increased the size of the experiment, e.g. rolling 10, 100, 1000, etc. times before averaging and recording, the plotted results would gradually approach a bell-shaped curve: the normal distribution.  Amazingly, this actually holds true even for unfair dice. A die could be weighted to land on 5 99% of the time, but if you roll it enough times, the average of the results will still be approximately normal.  On to how this is useful. In statistics, we commonly want to answer questions like "how plausible is it that an observed effect is a fluke" or "how likely is it that the real value of something differs from an estimated value by more than a certain amount". Methods for calculating such things are called "statistical hypothesis tests", and the most powerful such tests all rely on prior knowledge of the distribution of results.  For example, let's say you're testing a new drug to treat the common cold. You sample 1000 people with the cold, give 500 of them the drug and leave the other 500 as a control. At the end of your experiment, you find that members of the group given the drug recovered in 5 days on average, while members of the control group took an average of 8 days. Is this effect real, or the result of random chance?   A naive way to answer this question is to run the experiment again, a lot of times. You go out and sample another group of 1000, and then another, and then another, until you've repeated the whole experiment a million times. You find that the group given the drug recovers faster than the control group 97% of the time, and conclude that the effect is probably not a fluke.  Obviously, repeating an experiment a million times is not feasible in real life. Fortunately, it isn't necessary. The central limit theorem tells us what *would* happen if we ran the experiment  a million times: the means of the two groups would be normally distributed with a certain mean and variance. We can then apply something called a Z-test, which makes use of the mathematical properties of the normal distribution to calculate exactly how likely it is that the observed effects of our single experiment were the result of chance.	1642903536.0	http6l4	t3_sagpfu	t3_sagpfu	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sagpfu/eli5what_does_normal_distribution_mean/http6l4/

gyahvs1j	During their rise to power they engaged heavily with the working class and campaigned on a populist platform - I.e. socialist messaging to appeal to the working classes. This was in addition to other platform positions - white supremacy, anti-semitism, immigrant blaming, Christian-nationalism and law and order.  The Brownshirts were their street force before taking power, and were heavily socialist leaning, and their leadership wanted to continue those policies after the Nazis took power. At this point they’d outlived their usefulness to the rest of the Nazi power structure, so Hitler had the entire leadership rounded up and murdered - several hundred people - over the course of a few days. This ended any remaining “socialist” bent in favor of a turn to full on fascism, with the Blackshirts recruited from more middle-class backgrounds filling the role previously held by the Brownshirts.  /note - this is not meant to imply the brownshirts weren’t raging shitheads either or that the Nazi brand of socialism ever had a Kum-bah-yah-everybody-holding-hands-in-unity vision for the world.	1642910178.0	htu4ayp	t3_sajuw6	t3_sajuw6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htu4ayp/

4adwc	Monopolies are illegal since they are bad for humanities.  An exception for a time is made to this since in the form of patents since that can also be bad as the investor can cost recover although market lead should enable this anyway.  So patents run contrary to the idea of capitalist competition and the overarching illegality of monopolies beyond Government based coercive monopolies (eg Utilities where all the population must be supplied even at subsidy and not just the highly profitable niches)  The thing that is often forgotten that operating a business is not a right. It's a boon in exchance for taxes and FULL complicance with the laws of the entity granting the boon. Even the legal personhood of companies is just another boon. A pretence of personhood in order to serve a limited purpose (ownership, able to be sued, etc.)  If not for the corruptness of many people in Government lots of these companies would not only have their artifical monopoly exemption removed but they would be de-registered and loose their artifical deeming of personhood.	1642915939.0	htugob5	t3_saftzs	t1_httvr5d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/saftzs/eli5_united_states_why_are_drug_retail_prices/htugob5/

16nebso4	A few years after the second world war, George Orwel--a famous socialist--wrote 1984, about a guy working in the ministery of truth, activiely revising history and manipulating language to keep IngSoc--a socialist party--in power. It is not a story for a five year old, but make sure you read it one day.  History is written by the winners. The nazis lost. Their enemies got to reconsider whether the nazis were socialist after the war. Socialists among the winners didn't want to be in the same group as the losers regardless of how much they belonged together, and so nazis were excluded from socialism from that time on. If the nazis had won, however, then this question would probably have been about communists.	1642926981.0	htuxmbp	t3_sajuw6	t3_sajuw6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuxmbp/

drnctn0w	The conservatives are the ones that actively decided to cede power to the social democrats. Then the social democrats had to take the blame for the Versailles treaty. They then made a deal with the devil (the military) to go against the communists. From there, Hitler rose to power.   So it wasn't the communists, but the social democrats in alliance with the military that allowed his rise.	1642927660.0	htuyhti	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuxda3	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuyhti/

2oqsh0fn	You're getting a lot of complex answers, and a not insignificant amount of propaganda, but the short and sweet answer is that Hitler was smart enough to know that appealing to the working class was only going to help him, so he let the preexisting name, and quasi-left wing rhetoric, of the party stay after he took over even though he personally detested the types of socialism that were popular at the time because they didn't align with his cultural and racial supremacist views.

krmgd	> Flight director Chris Kraft rejected several unsafe interventions, including using a rifle to shoot holes in the booster's propellant tanks to depressurize them. He eventually took the advice of one of the test engineers to simply wait out the battery discharge and let the oxidizer boil off. This early test failure and subsequent panic led Kraft to declare "That is the first rule of flight control. If you don't know what to do, don't do anything." Technicians therefore waited until the next morning, when the flight batteries in the rocket and capsule had run down and the Redstone's liquid oxygen had boiled off, before they could work on the rocket and render it safe.	1642715063.0	htijckt	t3_s8j0w3	t1_htgg1gv	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8j0w3/eli5_why_do_space_rockets_have_all_the_cables/htijckt/

Beef and dairy cattle generate similar amounts of greenhouse gases.”*  3: Reduces risks of cholesterol. * Cholesterol is only found in foods that come from animals, there is no cholesterol in foods that come from plants.

3hiwzfiy	Yes. But they don’t sign a legal agreement to get cancer. People agree, in writing to take out student loans and agree in writing to pay them back.   The people who chose not to take out student loans or chose not to go to college will be paying for this loan forgiveness. People who graduate college will on average make more money in their lifetimes than people who don’t. And you’re asking these people who make less money to financially support people who make more money.   Look, there’s a real problem with the cost of college in this country and with the amount of student loan debt. But the debt, in my opinion, takes such a backseat to the problem of the cost of education that it’s not even worth discussing until the costs are under control.   And, no, on this problem, I don’t think we can do all and chew gum at the same time. These are big problems. Let’s focus on the more important one.	1642787321.0	htmjcdp	t3_s9bqg4	t1_htmf75t	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9bqg4/eli5_how_would_we_cancel_student_loan_debt/htmjcdp/
ukkrw	It benefits those in an already financially superior position. Those going to college have much higher average earning potential than those unable to. But, those unable to will be part of paying for that debt forgiveness. Multitude of other issues that go along that line too.  It also sets up a bad precedent where predatory behaviour is rewarded. No reason not to amp it up. College price increase more, and students have no reason not to choose being ripped off.  Also it follows the trickle down economy philosophy.	1642787481.0	htmjsk2	t3_s9bqg4	t1_htme9co	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9bqg4/eli5_how_would_we_cancel_student_loan_debt/htmjsk2/
3hiwzfiy	We bailed out banks with the understanding that they would pay back the money with interest. Some didn’t, but that was the agreement.   Maybe a student loan bailout could take a similar approach. Your federal loans are forgiven, with the agreement that you’ll pay, I don’t know, 20% higher federal taxes than you would have otherwise, until your amount is repaid. That way, the burden doesn’t fall on the people who — at age 17 or 18 — chose not to go to college and will make less money in their lifetimes than their peers who went to college.   Or, going forward, would your suggestion be that student loans not be available until a student is 25?	1642790894.0	htmt19k	t3_s9bqg4	t1_htmpgzz	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9bqg4/eli5_how_would_we_cancel_student_loan_debt/htmt19k/

When the hot water vapour coming off the toast hits the cool plate, it quickly condenses back to liquid.  Two things I have found that help: One is just putting a piece of paper towel under the toast. This provides a little insulation and also absorbs some of the moisture. The other is heating up the plate. The warmer the plate, the less condensation forms.	1642792258.0	htmwndx	t3_s9i4ao	t3_s9i4ao	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9i4ao/eli5_what_causes_moisture_on_the_plate_underneath/htmwndx/

f37th	I might be wrong but I has a lot to do with wavelengths and how they refract and reflect on matter.   Long wavelenght light like Orange, red or infrared (the one used by remote controllers) can bounce on surfaces and 'turn' corners, thus reaching more places. This is why you can turn your tv not pointing your remote to the tv or even with a lot of obstacles in line.  I live in Spain and street lights used to be orange. They scattered light better and you could see better, and did not 'hurt' your eyes at night. Now, they are been changed to white LEDs and I totally hate it. They project shadows everywhere, don't illuminate and lighten up as much as orange ones did, and they feel unnatural at night. To much blue wavelength on them don't letting one's eyes rest.  Ultraviolet light, on the opposite side of the spectrum, has a short wavelength. So it doesn't bounce that much and doesn't illuminate like Orange does.  If you have a colour changing light bulb, set it in a completely dark room, turn it red and then blue, you will see how much they change visibility.    Excuse my English and terminology used. English is not my mother tongue and I am no expert on the field.	1642870105.0	htreluz	t3_sa1jul	t3_sa1jul	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sa1jul/eli5_why_does_led_not_illuminate_areas_well/htreluz/
gyahvs1j	Depends on camera and film.  A cheap lens, small aperture or high ISO film (much over ISO 100) will all result in degraded image vs what you’d expect from a modern digital camera, similarly whether the scene is sufficiently in focus may also make scanning to 4K pointless.  When they use film to shoot movies they’re using high quality lenses, a huge aperture compared to your point-and-click camera and high quality film because the whole experience is intended to be projected onto a big screen.  The lens quality affects image quality, focus, distortions, etc.  A small aperture impacts resolution, but it also affects the speed of film. If you have a huge lens you are gathering a ton of light so can get a better picture from a short exposure of a lower ISO film.  ISO - with film this was a trade off between light sensitivity vs quality. ISO 400 could be more easily used indoors, because it needed shorter exposure, but was grainier than ISO 100 because of how it achieved that sensitivity.	1642897483.0	httaxwh	t3_safwex	t3_safwex	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/safwex/eli5_if_35mm_film_can_be_scanned_up_to_4k_does/httaxwh/
gyahvs1j	Hard to say.  My *guess* is that you’d probably get somewhere between 720 and 1080. 720 is just shy of 1 megapixel, I had a 1.2 megapixel in the late 90’s - My impression was the quality was on par with, perhaps slightly worse, than point and click cameras but you weren’t constrained by running out of film or development cost.  I also recall around the same time seeing a 6MP digital photo (on par with 4K) printed with a good printer onto photo paper and remember noting it seemed to have higher resolution than you’d get with anything that wasn’t at least an “amateur-enthusiast” SLR with nice film.  /did photography in high school in the late 90s, using film id develop and print in a dark room, so this was all of contemporary interest to me at the time.	1642898974.0	httem49	t3_safwex	t1_httbk7m	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/safwex/eli5_if_35mm_film_can_be_scanned_up_to_4k_does/httem49/

ao458	Have yet to see what feels like a satisfactory answer, so I'll try;  You have three different materials here: tile, skin, and cloth.   Water on skin or cloth absorbs some, which means some water sinks into crevasses, ridges, or between fibers etc. Water likes to bond with other water molecules, and any excess water on the surface has something beneath it to grip on to, making it slide around less.  Water on tile doesn't absorb into the material, instead resting on the surface in a smooth puddle. Since it doesn't absorb, the water doesn't have anything to "grip", and slides around on the surface freely.  So, two absorbent materials will stick to one another, while any non absorbent materials will slide freely against anything wet. You can imagine water as a layer between whatever two materials, and it will have "spikes" on any side it can soak into, but remain smooth and flat on any side it can't.	1643156542.0	hu86w7e	t3_scox5c	t3_scox5c	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scox5c/eli5_why_does_water_increase_the_friction_between/hu86w7e/

So when you retire, you get paid out from your payments plus current workers also paying into the system. So if the job market is always expanding that works great, the expanded workforce pays for the people retiring while you work plus the effort your own generation paid in.   Doesnt work so great when the working class income declines.  Then you have workers paying into a system that has no guarantee or ability to keep the system flush with funds. They're paying for the recipients... but there aren't enough workers, wages, overall income, etc to fill the system back up. Thats what makes it a pyramid scheme.

In practice - Taiwan is independent, with fairly considerable backing for independence in the international community, but China doesn’t recognize this, but isn’t ready to go for an invasion, perhaps looking more for a soft transfer of power by fostering a PRC friendly takeover of the ROC government by making it worthwhile for the power brokers	1643167875.0	hu8xlwu	t3_scvv9o	t3_scvv9o	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scvv9o/eli5_who_does_taiwan_actually_belong_to_or_is_she/hu8xlwu/

1jjb0hd8	>Take an electron which has a negative electric charge. Nothing causes it to have that charge, it just does.  If things can exist and 'be a certain way' without cause, is there a good reason electrons could suddenly have a positive charge, without cause?  Electrons have negative charges without any reason right? They just do. This seems to be indistinguishable from magic. If things don't need a cause or reason to happen, it's remarkable that the result of that is so predictable, the way things are so unchanging, at the macro and micro level.  "Things exist without cause, and function without cause. Yet they exist, and they function in a fixed way that does not seem to change over time."   It's unintuitive, but it's a clean explanation. It's not just that we don't have the technology to find out more, but that at the fundamental level there is no more to discover. If this is the case things don't need a cause, and everything that exists could have spontaneously come to exist, without there being anything to make it happen. Taking this to the natural conclusion, even if there was something that existed before the big bang, go back far enough and there will be an absolute beginning, with nothing before that. The alternative is an infinite past, which runs into the infinite regression problem. An infinitely long past, with no beginning. What was before that? could always be asked, and everything that could happen would have happened, given an infinite past.  "Things exist without cause, and function without cause" would be the only alternative, to everything having an infinite number of other things causing them. Would you agree?  &#x200B;  I think the ELI5 is:  "Things just exist and work the way they do, with no cause or reason. We know this is true, because the only alternative is an impossible never ending series of causes."  &#x200B;  The thread's been locked because mods didn't think there was an objective explanation, but it turns out there is.  Isn't that wild, isn't that kind of exciting that things just work the way they do without cause (at the fundamental level)? Even if there is something that causes electrons to have a negative charge (might not be), at some point there is an end to further inner mechanisms or causes, and we hit bedrock. Something that exists, and functions without cause. The only cause being "It's X, and X functions like that. Why or how? because that's the way X functions. It just has these properties."      Does that makes sense?    If so, I think we can consider this ELI5 answered! That even if we're wrong about fundamental particles, fields, forces etc being fundamental, there must be something that is fundamental to all of this. And that has no cause for it existing or doing what it does.	1643169788.0	hu91t60	t3_sb7is0	t1_htyo9u5	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu91t60/

1jjb0hd8	> but the field itself just is  This is an answer in and of itself.  The field exists and functions the way it does without cause.   At the fundamental level, reality works the way it does without cause or reason. And yet it does exist, and it does work the way it does despite this not being intuitive.  Is it impossible that the field exists and functions because of something more fundamental? If so, this thing that is 'more fundamental' could itself have a cause etc. With no end.  Why do we think the field itself "just is" with nothing causing it to exist and function? e.g. Why do we think it's like a fundamental particle and not something like a molecule with smaller 'parts'/inner workings? using molecule as an example, I don't know what the equivalent would be for a field. "deeper laws of reality"?  There is no reason for thinking a field isn't just as it is with no cause or inner workings. It could be that way. Are we sure that the alternative is impossible?  I think one possible answer to the ELI5 of this is:  "At the fundamental level things just exist and work the way they do, without cause or reasons.We know this is true because the alternative is an impossible never ending series of causes."  Do you think that would be correct? The question of whether or not what we think is fundamental is actually fundamental, because at some level there must be something fundamental. Even though we were wrong in the past about the atom being fundamental, it didn't mean that there weren't  fundamental causes of everything else we experience. Things that just exist and don't themselves have a cause.	1643170524.0	hu93cj2	t3_sb7is0	t1_htyr0gp	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu93cj2/

1jjb0hd8	>Maybe quarks are the fundamental particles. Maybe there is one more layer. Or 100. But whether we’ve found the bottom of the chain or not you can’t conclude it will go on indefinitely.  It might i suppose, but it doesn’t have to.  Completely agree.   I was wanting to know which was more likely (or if one option was impossible).  Either there's an infinite regression of 'layers' to reality, and how it works. Or it's finite, and fundamentally there is something, or many things which cause things to happen in a particular way, but don't have a cause for doing so themselves.  I wonder which of the two is possible? If both are, are either of them more likely than the other?  Would an infinite number of layers to reality result in what we experience? At no point does it resolve. Just like "0.999..." represents it asymptomatically getting closer to 1 constantly, we define it as one, and yet it's not a resolved number. There is no finite number of 9's you can add after the 0 to get it to equal 1. For our purposes, we treat it as if it's 1. But it's similar to dividing a number, or distance infinitely. There's no point at which dividing it should reduce it to 0. Because just before that could happen, you have a finite number and you divide it. Dividing that tiny number should always leave you with a smaller number. There's no reason there would ever be an end to this division, because it keeps being divided as long as there's something left to divide.  It doesn't resolve to 0 because it never resolves. It never spits out a finite number, or 0, because the process doesn't end. That's how I think of infinite causes for things existing and functioning as they do, it might not result in the reality we observe. What do you think?  Alternatively, if at the fundamental level things 'just exist' and work that way, then it's clean. It's a like saying "things work by magic" because things exist and function without cause, but it's clean. It means we don't have to accept that infinity/infinite regression exists, in a physical way, not just as an idea.	1643172036.0	hu96f90	t3_sb7is0	t1_htzfl92	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu96f90/

afjuj	I teach English as a second language, so I can probably answer this. When we are in the process of learning a new language, we go through a receptive phase of language development before we achieve productive competence. Listening and reading are receptive skills, whereas speaking and writing are productive skills.  In ELI5 terms, you can read/understand a language without being able to fluently speak or write in that language. You can stop and think, focus on the words you do know, use context clues, or ask clarifying questions to give yourself time to think about meaning. When you are producing language, you have to organize your thoughts, translate what you want to say into the new language (vocabulary), figure out which verb tense to use, put the words into the correct order (grammar/syntax), and then either say or write it.	1643173157.0	hu98l9m	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hu98l9m/

h17zf	There are a lot of answers that are essentially repeating the same thing, but I'll try to offer a slightly different perspective. Language comprehension and language production are two different processes in the brain, and this is essentially true for other non-language related processes as well that fall into the categories of 'recall' and 'recognition'. Recall is an active process that requires more difficult engagement to remember and produce certain information, whereas recognition is somewhat passive, only relying on familiarity to arrive at the correct answer.  There are even psychometric tests that examine these processes, in both verbal and visual domains, and some that show even individuals suffering from brain trauma or dementia can perform reasonably well on tests of recognition while failing horribly at tests of recall.  So this is essentially how an individual can understand a certain language without having the ability to actively produce the necessary words - production is simply more difficult.	1643173842.0	hu99vry	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hu99vry/

If reality functions without cause at the fundamental level, then things just exist and happen without something else causing that to happen.	1643174735.0	hu9bivu	t3_sb7is0	t1_htzlbvz	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu9bivu/

jo2k1	I feel like I'm a bit of an extreme example. I understand French fluently because it was my language as a child. And by fluently I really mean fluently. I still can watch the fastest talking newscasters on French TV and not have a problem understanding it, and it feels entirely natural.  But at some time in the past decades I stopped speaking French, simply because I stopped going to France, and there was no real other opportunity to. And now I just... can't anymore. I try to say the simplest sentences and just can't find the words. They're just not there. Tell me the words I'm looking for and I remember them immediately.  It is so weird. I suspect if I was forced to live in France for a week or so I'd find my old language ability back, but as it is it freaks me out a tiny bit.	1643175314.0	hu9ck2g	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hu9ck2g/

1jjb0hd8	>The stuff you are talking about sounds more like waxing philosophical about the nature of reality rather than something grounded in sceince.  Science may be insufficient to answer the question, since it's something that is not observable, or measurable. And yet exists, and is a certain way.   It's a question with an answer, and relates to something that exists.  I wasn't making assumptions about the way it is, but listing possibilities. I wasn't assuming reality was infinitely layered in terms of causes, or that it was not. Just saying that these seem to be the only two possibilities for how it works, that was the assumption. Not that it was either one or the other.  Either things exist and function without cause on some level, or the alternative. That's what I was saying. Doesn't that make sense to you?  If that's energy, fields, strings etc it doesn't matter. Whatever it is, either has a cause for existing and working the way it does, or it does not and "just works".  The way it works could be inherent to it. "How does that work and why?" It's possible that there is no reason or explanation. Not just that we can't observe one at the moment, but that it literally just works that way.  Is there anything we've learned from science (or philosophy) that would let us know which of these possibilities would be more likely?  Other posters have said an infinite regression is impossible, and that would leave the alternative as "Whatever is fundamental to reality, it just works that way". Which is an ELI5(ish) answer.  What do you think of the "It just works that way at the fundamental level" possibility?	1643175873.0	hu9djam	t3_sb7is0	t1_htzlmuy	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu9djam/

1jjb0hd8	I was meaning that at some point, things just work the way they do.  That there is a cause for how the fundamental parts of the universe work, but that cause is "this is the way it works".  Otherwise you could ask, "How does that work?" and keep doing so forever.  &#x200B;  >"and keep assuming that there must be something else behind how things work"  I have just mentioned that as a possibility. It's also possible that there isn't something behind how things work. That's what's meant by 'no cause'. As in, "things work this way" and there's no deeper cause for it or any reason for it working this way. If something works a certain way, and there's nothing else behind it, then it has no cause. That's the end of the line.  I think you're misunderstanding me.  I'm not saying there's something behind the way things work, and there's something behind that etc. It's just one of two possibilities.  1. Infinite causes. "and how does that work? etc" You get the idea. 2. Causes stop at some point. What that is doesn't matter, at some point things just "work the way they do".  \#1 is someone asking "why does that happen?" repeatedly, and there always being another answer. Why do we not go through walls? because particles interact. Why do they interact? etc.   At some point the answer is "it just works that way, without a cause for it working that way". The alternative is that there is something else that makes it work that way, and it would be fair to ask how that things works the way it does.  &#x200B;  The ELI5 answer is probably either "we can't know", or "At the fundamental level, things just exist and work the way they do".   How is that different to what you're saying?	1643180295.0	hu9ki5a	t3_sb7is0	t1_hu9i8wh	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu9ki5a/

1jjb0hd8	>Well, i mean you literally asked multiple times what causes particles to interact, forces to exist, etc.  If I did and didn't make it clear that was just to illustrate a possibility then I miscommunicated.  You get the idea right? I'm not actually asking you why particles interact, just trying to make the idea of laws/energy/matter being governed by inner workings, and those inner workings doing hat they do because of more fundamental laws etc. I'm not presenting this as something that is true, but as a possibility in order to then eliminate that possibility, leaving the alternative as possible, or even the way things must be.  "Lets assume there's infinite regression" and "infinite regression is a possibility" are far from synonymous. The first is saying that the is infinite regression, the second is just bringing it up as an idea that may or may not be possible. I'm erring on the side of it not being possible.   I'm not saying infinite regress is necessary to explain anything. The opposite in fact. It's one of two explanation for how reality could work at the fundamental level, and other posters have ruled it out, because they think it's absurd.   &#x200B;  I'm assuming that there are two possibilities. There might be a third or more, but it seems unlikely.  Either there is a point at which there is no longer anything to discover (things just work as they do at that point), or there is an infinite number of things to discover about the universe (for everything that exists there's something else that make it work, and whatever that is has something within it, or affecting how it functions that makes it work etc).  &#x200B;  Either there is an infinite number of laws in the universe, each more fundamental than the last, or there isn't. That's all I've been saying and trying to get across.   Why do particles behave as they do? Either that's explained by an infinite series of causes, or a finite number of causes. That's all I mean.  So "because they interact like you would interact with a brick wall if you walk into it" is just option #2. It just happens like that, at some point that's what it comes down to. There is an explanation for it, but not a further explanation for that explanation. And that's ok.	1643182545.0	hu9nmy6	t3_sb7is0	t1_hu9lb8o	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu9nmy6/

1jjb0hd8	>The very concept of "before" becomes meaningless.  Completely agree, wasn't meaning to imply a before. But there could be an underlying 'way the pre universe works' that allows the big bang to exist and function in the first place. No events before the big bang, but the existence of laws.  Otherwise it truly is "something from absolute nothing" (no physical laws, no potential, no space, no time, no energy in any way, no existence), and even though that's not intuitive there's no good reason to think it's impossible for something to come from nothing.  When it comes to causes, I'm more interested in how things work currently, rather than how the universe began (because we can't see past the big bang). It's intuitive to think that things are made of smaller things, even the things we call physical laws, whatever it is we're observing when we say 'space/time, It's intuitive to think those have inner workings or reasons for them doing what they do. e.g. gravity, fields, energy, space/time, strong nuclear forces etc.  That's what I mean by 'infinite regression', that it's natural to think there will always be reasons for things happening, and reasons for those things happening and working like they do etc...  But there is an alternative, and that's also something I've been trying to communicate, and not doing a good job of. The alternative possibility is that at some point there's no smaller particles, or 'smaller'/more fundamental laws of reality. That fundamentally things just are what they are, once you get down to what reality is 'made of'. Whatever that is, it has properties and functions a certain way. It just works that way, without inner workings. That's the idea of "things just work that way".  &#x200B;  The first possibility is that there is always another cause for something happening, always another link in the chain of events or causality.   The second possibility assumes that this isn't necessary, that causality is a human invention and reality doesn't have to have it to work the way it does.  Reality doesn't care about what makes sense to us. Completely agree.	1643183602.0	hu9p2eu	t3_sb7is0	t1_hu9lxoz	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sb7is0/eli5_how_can_something_function_have_properties/hu9p2eu/
1jjb0hd8	>Q.e.d. you're assuming the possibility. and what's the possibility? I.e what are you assuming.  That there are two possible explanations for how things could work, and that I don't know which it is. I know there could be more, but these two are all I can think of.   One is that everything must have a cause, and the other possibility is that this isn't true, and that things can exist and function without having a cause.  I'm basically saying "these are the options I've thought of". I have no idea if either one of them is true.  When I say possible, I mean it's unknown if it's possible or impossible for that to be true.  &#x200B;  Things seem to be made of other things, and governed by physical laws.  Either that trend continues, or it doesn't. Is that an unreasonable assumption? that's the assumption I'm making. While also saying that it's possible there's a possibility I haven't thought of in addition to those two.  &#x200B;  I'm not assuming either of those options is the case.

j3hmb	Not the person you were speaking to, but I think you may have interpreted their comment backwards (or maybe I'm interpreting yours backwards...): That person wasn't saying the French words come from the fancy English words, but that the fancy English words come from the French. So, like, pre-1066ish, the English word for a domicile was "house," while the French (and Spanish, and other romance languages) word for the same thing was "maison."   Then the French invaded and basically took over England, and so words like "mansion", for a fancy, rich (and thus most likely French) house, or "arrest", for stopping someone using authority of the ruling class (i.e., the French), entered the French language.  You can also see this in the fact that words for a lot of farm animals---which would have been raised by English farmers---are things like "cow" and "sheep", but the words for their meat, which the nobles would see on their dinner tables, come from the French words for those animals: "boeuf" --> "beef", and "mouton" --> mutton.	1643184873.0	hu9qqmg	t3_scum5q	t1_hu9nqdv	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hu9qqmg/
baqbx7x	Language teacher here! (And former student of Chinese and Spanish)  As others have said: it’s similar to answering a multiple choice question vs short answer question.  The short answer is: the brain is better at recalling information that it’s being clued to remember (I.e. multiple choice, listening/reading) rather than summoning up terms with their meaning, pronunciation, and grammar (I.e. short answer, speaking, writing).   When learning new terms, you will most likely be given the word to read while the teacher exemplifies how to pronounce the word. Listening and reading are receptive skills, you only need to receive, so they are easier than producing the word yourself through speaking or writing. 謝謝you might be shown this character and hear “xie xie”. Let’s say you are given 9 other terms, you practice saying and writing them. The next day you may be able to remember that 謝謝 is matched with the pronunciation xie xie or that it is matched to the meaning “thank you” (or matching vice versa) but recalling how to write it is much harder. I’ve written that character hundreds of times on paper and electronically and I probably couldn’t recall how to write it right now because I haven’t needed to since I was a student, my brain has no reason to reason to produce it so it just keeps how to recognize it.  In a simple form- I’m sure there are words you don’t remember how to spell exactly but you recognize them when you see them.	1643184930.0	hu9qta3	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hu9qta3/
1jjb0hd8	>The first possibility is that we just aren't able to imagine or even conceptualize something outside our good old space-time coordonate system. That's also the only possibly here, as far as im concerned.  That's just option #2. That things just work, and our ideas about causes for it working that way or reasons for it doing so don't make sense. Things work the way they do right? And we don't know why, and can't know why. Not really. That's all option #2 is.  "there must be laws" I say that because I think of laws as "the way things work".  Whatever that is we're observing, there could be a reason why things work they way they do, and that thing I'd call a law.   How could  laws possibly work? There's a natural desire in us to want to know more. And so I ask this about the 'laws of reality'. The way things work.  But you're saying  "the way things work" defies logic. So even trying to come up with all the possible explanations could be doomed to failure. We'd have no way of knowing if our logic was worth a damn, because there's no way to verify if our conclusions are correct. Because everything about us is insufficient to understand.  I have said  in this thread that I know the possibilities I came up with could be just two of many. And that means both could be incorrect. At the same time, it seems to me that they're the only options. That's just my gut feeling though.  Peg that up to the limits of my mind. It seems to me they're the only options, but I'm well aware that they might not be.  &#x200B;  A problem with this question is the impossibility of verifying if the answer is true or not. But I felt like it was one of the options I came up with, even if I couldn't ever know which.  The possibility of other options apart from those two is awesome. It defies logic.

ss4im	Hi! I'm a native english speaker who does this with Icelandic.  The best way I can explain it is imagine you are taking a multiple choice test vs having to write a paper on a subject; when taking a multiple choice test, there are a lot of hints and clues, and you know that there is a right answer (for instance, if you just completed a checkout at the store and the cashier says "vilt þú kvitinn?" you know they are likely asking about something related to the purchase, like a bag or a receipt.)   With writing a paper, you are expected to not only recall all you know about the subject, but also put it into complete thoughts that can be followed and read by someone else (like if you are walking down the street and someone stops you while holding a map and says "goðan daginn, talar þú ensku?", they could be asking for directions, they could be asking if you dropped this, they could just be saying hello, they could have mistaken you for someone else, etc.)  When the context the language is being spoken in is clear, it both limits the number of things you have to think about so you can think about what they said, and it limits the number of things you have to think about to respond with; this is something you do without thinking in your native language, but when you are not very comfortable with a language, can make the seconds it takes you to translate the phrase into your native language, figure out what they are asking, figure out your response, and then translate it back into their language feel like an eternity.	1643190071.0	hu9x5ha	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hu9x5ha/

ni5zv	     I actually learned how to speak better by using a parrot technique( My own terminology). I always try to memorize or even write down words and phrases I like or never herd before, then look up and verify the definition to ensure that I know what those words/ phrases really mean.   For example, when I was a waiter, I used to say " Is everything O.K.?" when checking back on my guests. After I herd a waiter at Cheesecake Factory asked his guest "How was everything?" and thought it actually sound much better, I then change how I ask mine.      With that being said, I always want to improve my accent because I know it is pretty bad, but the foundation of my grammar is very weak and that's a large hill for me to climb. In my humble opinion, I also need to improve my vocabulary as well if I want to speak English properly, without any accent. The way my brain work is also different than other people.        PS.

115ayi	It is mostly related to what content each language is used for. I consume German through the news and work. So my German self is mostly professional, eloquent about current news and technically proficient, however it is not at all suited for small talk and more chilled contexts. This makes my German personality more uptight and less social, which itself leads to less practice and so goes the cycle. On the other hand all the movies and podcasts I listen to are in English. So my English personality is funny , chilled and well educated and can be used for anything. I feel at home in English contexts. I feel chilled and i need no effort at all to be fluent, unlike German. French was the language i was taught in   until highschool , and i consume it today when  I hear the news or read about politics. I use it quite rarely, it is quite chill and can discuss current french news.  And finally my first language was Tunisian, and with it my Tunisian personality was formed. Today i use it to communicate with family and to consume daily Tunisian news. These news have been for the last 10 years so grim and negative and in total contrast with the German news. Whereas Germany announces it made record gains, the same day i hear Tunisia is on the brick of bunkruptcy. So that accumulated and now my Tunisian personality is rather depressed and angry. I do notice the effect of language on my overall mood so try to regulate it by music and switching to a different language.	1643197216.0	hua6cq2	t3_scv77v	t3_scv77v	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scv77v/eli5_why_do_peoples_personalities_sometimes/hua6cq2/

5zbqbeok	If by text you mean “reading ability”, then it depends. For me I can read a lot of Latin based languages because I know Spanish. When you have languages of the same family, they all use the same root words. For instance in Spanish “Sol” is sun. I was able to figure that out because in English we have words like “Solar” or “Solstice” referring to the sun.	1643201685.0	huadnll	t3_scum5q	t1_hu9zawb	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/huadnll/

5zbqbeok	This is very interesting! I don’t know for sure but I can share my experience. To me it seems that finding it easier to speak that to understand had to do with how you have learned the language. Pure memorization of definitions is different than attaching a meaning to the new word.   For example: in Spanish tree = árbol. Now what comes to my mind when I hear árbol depends on how I learned the language. If I am still at the memorizing stage then árbol makes me think of the English word tree, then I picture a tree. But if you are able to make the mental image of a tree your first thought instead of translating to English, then you are on your way to becoming fluent.  So maybe you can translate your English thoughts to Spanish because you have memorized the words, but Spoken Spanish doesn’t come instantly bc your still learning a new way of thinking.  Either way, bravo to you for learning, that makes you unique already!	1643202595.0	huafce5	t3_scum5q	t1_huadf4v	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/huafce5/

gyahvs1j	Put in the recommended fuse.  The fuse is a safety cut-off.  Put in too high an amp fuse and it won’t cut the power until there’s too much current going through that could damage the circuit and possibly cause a fire or other dangerous situation.  Put in too low an amount fuse and it’s gonna blow very soon as the circuit needs, and is designed for, a higher current than the fuse is intended for. Maybe it’ll work for a bit, say the current is hovering at 9.5A vs the 10A the fuse is rated for, but soon enough you’ll get a modest spike and need a new fuse.	1643205229.0	huakpdv	t3_sd5ymo	t3_sd5ymo	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sd5ymo/eli5_when_changing_a_blown_fuse_in_a_car_why_can/huakpdv/

gyahvs1j	The queen evicts most of the hive and then maintains a small number of bees who all huddle around her and buzz to generate heat to keep the queen warm, using stored honey for fuel.  In the spring the queen will start laying eggs to bring her brood back up to size.

18ceo	Inflation is when your money buys less than it used to. It is a decline of purchasing power for a given currency.  The largest source of inflation is the central bank (or government bank) of your country and what it charges other banks to borrow money. When the central bank lowers its bank rate other banks pay less to borrow and that gets passed onto people.  This means mortgage rates are lower and business loans are lower. When rates of loans are lower, people will take out more money.  For example, instead of qualifying for a $300,000 mortgage, you now qualify for $350,000. That extra $50,000 can be used to buy a bigger house.  Unfortunately, everyone else also qualifies for a larger mortgage and they also want the same house as you. Now everyone has more “money”, but they are competing for the same houses. This competition increases the price, causing inflation.	1643207604.0	huaq2e1	t3_sd1mpd	t3_sd1mpd	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sd1mpd/eli5_what_exactly_is_inflation_and_how_is_it/huaq2e1/

This is why in autumn/fall you see a lot of wasps/hornets trying to come into houses but they’re super lethargic and aren’t aggressive - they often can’t even eat without the food being processed in the hive first, so are running on whatever energy reserves they had when they got locked out and all die fairly quickly.	1643207796.0	huaqit0	t3_sd69tj	t1_huapkle	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sd69tj/eli5how_bees_do_warm_themselves_in_winter/huaqit0/

I was looking for something more rooted in facts but thanks for trying, I appreciate it!  I'm sure there is a fringe group of racists with extreme views (as there are in any country and with any ethnicity) but I'm not really interested in what you speculate is their rational.  If population decline is happening then I want to know the actual reason (of which, there will be one) and if this is a pronounced issue in countries with "white" people, which you have inadvertently insinuated, then I would also like to know the reason behind this as well.

I grew up in the Midwest USA in proximity to 1st gen speakers of Polish and German.  As far as foreign language instruction, that was only middle school Spanish. I rely heavily on the fact that the English language has appropriated so many words and phrasings from Teutonic, Slavic and romance languages. All my abilities to decipher are lost when listening to rapid speech or words/phrases that are intentionally disguised with regional dialect.  My ex was fluent in Spanish and when she lived abroad used to disguise her conversations with other English speakers by using "pig" Latin. Personally, I'm bad with metaphors and idioms in English, so I easily get lost when listening to non-Americans speaking to each other.	1643216863.0	hubek7v	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hubek7v/

f37th	Think of listening and understanding a language as watching and enjoying s sport match; and speaking a language as playing that sport.  To watch a sport you only need eyes but to play it you need all the muscles involved in it as well as the 'muscular knowledge' you need to move the muscles. That is more complex and difficult. I am a native Spanish speaker and I speak English as a foreign language. In order to speak English with good accent I need to train my mouth, tongue, lips, etc. to move in those movements English has that Spanish has not. That is harder than training your hearing, because hearing only implies your brain to pay attention. Speaking involves muscles and movement as well.  Tip: a good exercise to improve speaking in a foreign language is to read out loud. That way you make the same movement you will have to do when speaking.	1643223347.0	hubwwud	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hubwwud/

That would mean a resistance for your body less than 100,000 ohms (which is generally the case) would allow a fatal shock. There's also the power that requires as another factor. That's current times voltage, so your 1 megavolt taser would need to provide 100kW of power to deliver that shock which I don't see a handheld device doing.  It's definitely possible to survive such a shock, but it's also plenty powerful enough to mess a person up. Even if it doesn't kill them outright it could send them into convulsions or heart arrhythmia.

Listening I can do but not as well because of regional dialects and what not, and each person has their own tone, some mumble, etc. I can listen to the news and slow talkers well.

pj8sq	The auditing firm has access to the company's internal financial records (the 'general ledger'), and typically will pull a sample from that transaction, say, 50 transactions, and review them.    The review is partially to make sure that the transaction is recorded correctly. (if you get an electricity bill, that should be listed as an Expense and a charge to Accounts Payable, for example)   It also means asking the company to provide supporting documentation for the transaction. (so, in this case, the electricity bill itself)   For transactions that involve outside parties, the auditors can ask those parties to verify that the transaction is real as well; auditors often contact the company's bank to have them verify things like "what was this company's checking account balance on 12/31?"   Auditors also review a company's *internal controls*, security measures meant to prevent theft, fraud, and other bad things. This might be stuff like "Is the person who is writing checks also authorized to sign the checks? Is the person who allowed to place orders with companies also the same person who approves payments to those companies? Because in both cases, the answer should be no"	1643236786.0	hucya42	t3_sdf8f0	t1_hucitrf	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sdf8f0/eli5_why_do_big_companies_get_their_accounting/hucya42/

pj8sq	The most common kind of accounting scandals aren't about forged data. (thought that does occur) It's usually about *misrepresenting* data, and the underlying activity.   One tool auditors use (and I mentioned this in another reply) is that the firm can contact associated 3rd parties and ask them to verify transactions. So if company A said they had a $6 million contract to provide services for company B, the auditors could send a letter to company B (with a signed authorization from Company A) asking to see a copy of that signed contract.   There were several scandals involving bad accounting in the early '00s. Enron, WorldCom, Sunbeam, Xerox and others all got caught doing shady accounting.	1643237245.0	huczgrh	t3_sdf8f0	t1_huclz4u	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sdf8f0/eli5_why_do_big_companies_get_their_accounting/huczgrh/

88o4dun0	Although true, work is still being done to hold up the dumbbell. But the reference frame is a different one.   Think of it this way, when you hold the dumbbell in its place, you are stopping it from falling, hence imparting equal and opposite acceleration compared to gravity. When you impart acceleration to something, it moves, so you did some work.   But in our case, the ammount it moves due to your acceleration is equal and opposite to what earth is moving it, and hence it is stationary.   Summarising, the total work done on the system of dumbell, human and ground is zero (dumbbell doesn't move). Total work done by you is non zero however, it is just equal to the work done by the earth.  It's all just a game of reference frames.	1643314064.0	huhg7vm	t3_sdwlyw	t1_hufgasp	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sdwlyw/eli5_how_can_i_use_energy_when_applying_force/huhg7vm/

1pkslnc9	I used to work at a BPO call center. I hated the job, and I just didn't care about the bonuses from efficient AHTs. I literally just wanted to be over with my 80 calls/day. Every time I have to talk to a customer I just did the fastest way I could end the call quickly, so I always tried to give them what they wanted as fast as possible.   Pulling up info from the system was a pain in the a***, they used this old database software which looked like a website from the early 2000s (picture a worse version of old reddit). It was very limited in terms of functionality, and everytime I made a mistake (like mis-clicking on the wrong name instead of yours) I'd have to go back to the homepage and restart the search query from the top. It was unbelievably shit, and I was surprised that a lot more organizations use systems such as these (We provided services to different countries w/ their own database systems). Really unbelievable considering this isn't some small time company.  So yes, I would say 2-5 minutes to pull up info is around the ballpark for the majority.	1643314190.0	huhgk1x	t3_se4r0i	t3_se4r0i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/se4r0i/eli5_does_it_really_take_customer_support_reps_25/huhgk1x/

Most of my reply’s are shortcuts that I create for FAQs/regular everyday scenarios. I really don’t need to buy time but I feel weird providing too much info too quickly.   Phones - I can only talk to one customer at a time. If you know your product/service this is easy. You will not get stalled unless the issue is above my pay grade/qualifications. In that case I will simply ask for you to wait a moment while I review. And I’ll reach out to a supervisor for confirmation.   Chats- my job allows us to have 3 different customers on a live chat at a time.

4mpgnqm2	Raising interest rates is the result of destroying currency (lowering rates is the creation of currency). When the Fed increases the benchmark rate, borrowing costs go up, borrowing falls, and less currency enters the economy.    The destruction of currency increases the value of the remaining currency and slows down price escalation/inflation, which is the result of currency losing its value/purchasing power.  There are a lot of steps I skipped, but these are basically the bookends of the cascade.	1643315619.0	huhkfct	t3_se6nza	t3_se6nza	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/se6nza/eli5_how_would_raising_interest_rates_reduce/huhkfct/

fgc9sky9	Worked in IT mostly over the phone for a large organization (20k active accounts at any given time) for years and depending on the system it can take some time. Parsing specific information from large databases can be time consuming and if the system also lets you make changes to the info it could be even more so because there are systems in place to maintain data integrity that can also slow down the results. That said sometimes you're also doing 6 other things at the same time and it's across multiple systems and it's easier to say wait while I pull up your account than explain every little thing you're doing.

At the start of a call, for sure we have to get into tons of accounts/tickets/kbs to get things started, so the delays at the start of the call are legit. In the middle of the call, they may also still be legit, buuuut I've told many Karens more than once that I had to go access some account or something just to silent hold them while I do something else entirely, *in peace*. Maybe not every time and maybe not every agent, but difficult customers will suffer additional wait times because we don't get paid enough to suffer through adversarial confrontations.

6co0c	> What points are you meant to choose?  Any three points on the circle (not on the disk but on the line). Two are fixed, and as you "slide" the third around, the angle between two lines drawn from the moving point to each of the fixed ones stays the same.  The proof comes from another circle theorem, the one that says that angles with the point in the center of the circle are twice as large as angles from a point on the circumference towards the same two points. If you have two fixed points, then the angle P1 - center - P2 is also fixed, and twice as large as any P1 - Q - P2 angle where Q is a point on the circle. So, since they are two times as large as a fixed angle, all of the must be the same angle!	1643319418.0	huhupkm	t3_se8njs	t3_se8njs	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/se8njs/eli5_the_circle_theorems/huhupkm/

o661p	Horses and cows, much like many herbivorous mammals, have eyes further apart from each other than we do on opposite sides of their heads. This gives them a much wider field of vision (all the better for seeing predators approach from many directions) but sacrifices stereoscopic vision. That is, they can’t look at the same object with both eyes from slightly different angles, so they have very little depth perception. There’s a funny video I’ve seen of a bunch of cows jumping over a line painted on the ground, but it’s because they literally can’t tell that it’s two dimensional. For all they know it’s a ledge or something they could trip over.  The other thing is that for a cow or a horse, a leg injury is most likely a death sentence. They are heavy creatures who stand most of the time, so a broken leg or ankle will never heal, making them easy prey. So they tend to be pretty particular about where they step. Survival for a creature like a horse is dependent on flat terrain, which lets them see threats from far away and run from them safely.  We’re much more familiar with animals like dogs and cats going up stairs because we keep them as pets, but they are both predator animals. Like humans they evolved with forward facing eyes that can see depth just fine, at the cost of only being able to see what’s in front of them. They also get to practice from a young age, as others have pointed out. Some dogs are also weirded out by stairs the first time they encounter them… I haven’t seen any cats acting the same way, but they are more natural climbers.   Something like a rhinoceros or a buffalo would almost certainly struggle with stairs just like a horse or a cow, maybe even something smaller like a deer. We just don’t tend see them in situations where they would encounter stairs because we’re not often transporting them around like we do with horses and cows.	1643324108.0	hui6zie	t3_sea5vo	t3_sea5vo	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sea5vo/eli5_why_cantwont_horses_and_cows_go_down_stairs/hui6zie/

i6y6e7u0	Sometimes inflation is a positive number. There's a set amount of money in a society, held by it's people, governments and banks. When a business owner gets an idea of how to make profit (usually through harnessing the environment's natural resources, e.g. oil rig, mineral mines, harvesting exotic foods) they would go to the bank to get a loan. They have to present the bank with enough solid information about the likelihood of profit to get the loan. If the bank thinks it's a sound business idea, they'll give the loan. Previously, the money the bank held to give the loan was taken out of circulation. It was just a sum in the bank's accounting book that wasn't being spent or used by anyone. If 10 years go by, and there's say $1000 in a bank's accounting book that doesn't get taken out, doesn't get given to anyone, and just stays there, then you can effectively say the $1000 almost doesn't exist because it's not circulating in the economy. When businesses then spend the money the bank gives them in the loan for their business, it brings it into circulation. This means people they pay can now spend the money again, and it circulates. This is considered a form of inflation ideologically because there's more money in the economy.   &#x200B;  This sort of inflation happens due to banks giving out loans. Banks usually give out loans precisely because there's more economically profitable opportunities ready to be exploited by businesses. Banks giving loans to many businesses is a sign the society is growing strongly as there's new sources of economic profit they are able to find and harness.   &#x200B;  So inflation is not always a bad thing. In this circumstance it reflects a growing society and it's fair to say that sometimes inflation means the economy is increasing. However, inflation due to reasons like the bank printing out paper money is negative and means the economy is actually shrinking.   &#x200B;  So yeah. In conclusion - inflation isn't always bad. If you hear statements about inflation increasing, it would signal the economy is rising. It's not always that it shrank.	1643340191.0	huj90lk	t3_sefm3q	t3_sefm3q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sefm3q/eli5_if_the_gdp_grew_69_last_year_but_inflation/huj90lk/

i6y6e7u0	Bonds and stocks are two ways for people to invest their savings. They're actually in competition with each other and at different periods of time a certain option may be more attractive due to the changing factors/conditions around them. So government bonds can draw savers away from stock markets, or repel them towards stock markets, depending on their profitability in relation to stocks at the current point in the economy. In short because they are in competition with each other. If there's no competition and everyone would invest in the same amount of bonds/stocks equally then there'd be no effect.	1643340810.0	hujaerf	t3_sedwjv	t3_sedwjv	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sedwjv/eli5_why_government_bonds_affect_the_equity_market/hujaerf/

If individuals have had different past experiences and lives than they may have more foundations for learning something than another person. so the new neurons built might be connected to their old ones etc. And people who don't have those experiences would have neurons build in a different place.

dgrx6xu2	Ultimately, whoever controls the hardware can control the code that runs on it.  In order for people to play a videogame, they download the game to their computer, which means that someone who can figure out how the code works would be able to change how it runs.  The only thing a banking app or website does on your own computer is show you information and allow you to send requests to the bank's servers in order to transfer money etc.  You actually can change your account balance (e.g. by using "Inspect element") but there would be no way of "telling" the bank that it has changed.  It's the bank who tells you what your balance is.  It would be possible for video games to do the same thing to a degree, but that would mean that most of the game would run on the developer/publisher's servers, and then your device just has to do UI.  That is quite inconvenient and would require a constant network connection, so instead they just try to make it hard to "crack" by requiring integration with the operating systems for things like authenticating purchases, or in the case of PC games to prevent cracking, drivers for the kernel.	1643341219.0	hujbbgv	t3_segy5p	t3_segy5p	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/segy5p/eli5_if_people_can_just_hack_any_game_app_with/hujbbgv/

i6y6e7u0	A segment can be anywhere in the circle as long as it's a line which touches the circumference of the circle at both ends. There's minor and major segments depending on which side of the line and circle you're looking at. A segment can be anywhere between 0% and 100% of a circle (but not actually 0% or 100% because then it'll just be the circumference and the minor segment would be the area outside of the circle and major segment the area of the circle if you had to label them at all) so they can.

gyahvs1j	Depends **very heavily** where you are. For example if you’re in a coastal area with prevailing winds coming in over the this flatly isn’t happening at all.  If sounds like you are in the US, or somewhere else where your climate is mostly “continental” with wind that can come from the north or south.  Continental climates have wildly varying seasonal temperatures - very cold winters, very hot summers, as they’re driven by land heat, and the land heads and cools quickly compared to the ocean.  In winter this means land in northern areas gets very cold while land in southern areas stays comparably warm (in northern hemisphere, though there aren’t any large continental masses in temperate zones in the Southern Hemisphere - only Australia. It it’s much closer to the equator and has an ocean to the south regulating winter temps). In summer even northern continental areas can get surprisingly warm, again because they land heats up very fast.  So in winter you have very cold land to the north and moderately cold/warm land to the south. So if the air is coming in from the north it’s gonna be very cold, if it comes in from the south it’s gonna be a lot warmer. If the air currents shift so one day you have air coming in from one direction and the next it’s coming from the other you’re going to se large swings in temperature.

These high pressure regions are generally caused by increased temperatures from the Sun. As temperature increases so does pressure. ( this is why you don’t put spray paint cans in a fire ). This increased pressure caused the air to move to a lower pressure region.

8qq9axh9	> An atom has a nucleus which carries the positive charge along with neutrons, which carry no charge and act more of an identifier/ binding agent to be able to assume the mass of the atom. they weigh just as much a proton and so this is why it doesn’t bind to electrons since electrons weigh 1/1830 the mass of a proton or neutron. This negative magnetic field is small but it is still there and the more electrons you have the more erratic or unstable the atom or isotope can be. So a neutron is a small particle the same size as a proton but can not hold a charge.  This isn’t really saying anything about charge. Admittedly, the only thing to say is that some particles have a positive or negative charge, it’s not really explainable beyond that. The stuff about atom stability is a bit muddled though and isn’t relevant. Electrons around an atom will try to get to their most stable arrangement, but the reactions that they take part in to do this are all chemical reactions, having no bearing on the stability of the constituent atoms themselves. Instability of indivisible atoms occurs due to an excess of neutrons; reactions which change the number of neutrons (and inevitably protons) are nuclear reactions, which are a whole different beast.   > Carbon dating is used this way since we know the rate at which carbon decays so anything organic( containing carbon) can be dated back to its origination like dinosaur bones, petrified wood, hand made tools and so on.  Carbon dating has nothing to do with electrons or electron configurations. The radioactive decay you mention is a nuclear process and has no bearing on the charge of things. Nuclear reactions are dictated by aspects of the strong and weak nuclear forces, which aren’t useful to introduce to the original question.   Like you say, carbon dating can only be used to date organic material so any hand made tools to be carbon dated would have to be made from wood or leather or something organic, it’s not possible to date hand made swords or flint nappes. Fossilised bones can’t be dated directly as they have been replaced with other minerals as part of the fossilisation process. There are rare occurrences when bones are preserved in a way more akin to mummification, like encased in a bog where original organic matter is preserved — that would work. In general though, fossils are dated by the rock or geological features surrounding them and even then not the exact rock encasing them (sedimentary rocks cannot be radiometrically dated) but by some other rock or layer immediately above or below the strata containing the fossils. Note that carbon dating is no good for fossils anyway unless they are *extremely* recent, seeing as carbon dating can only go back about 50,000 years. There are many other radiometric systems based upon the decay of other isotopes that scientists use to go back into the millions and even billions of years.	1643382559.0	hul9cig	t3_se93qt	t1_hujnbkm	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/se93qt/eli5_an_electron_has_a_negative_charge_and_a/hul9cig/

Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by **salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%).** Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake (<0.5% each).

gyahvs1j	A lot of this comes from information we get from earthquakes.  Earthquakes generate two main types of waves: Compression waves (longitudinal) and Shearing waves (transverse).  A compression wave can go through liquids, but a shearing wave can’t. The paths of both types though are affected by changes in density and phase transitions (from liquid to solid and back again).   So when an earthquake happens somewhere the waves can be detected all over the earth, except the shearing waves don’t show up in an area opposite the earth from the site of the earthquake - from this we can infer there is a liquid mass at the core and it’s approximate dimensions.  The path of the compression waves is affected by density and whether it’s going through liquids vs solids, so we can see where these end up vs where they should if they traveled in a straight line, and from this can deduce a model of the approximate density and liquid vs solid composition of the earth around the core.  Note: the waves you see at the ocean look a lot like shearing/transverse waves going up and down, but these are actually “surface” waves with the particles moving in a circular rather than transverse motion, enabling them to propagate through water.	1643398855.0	humh3y6	t3_seyblq	t3_seyblq	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/seyblq/eli5_how_do_we_know_whats_underneath_and_inside/humh3y6/

These companies are the ones doing the complaining, but they and by your question so do you, misunderstand, they don't have the right to have workers, they have to pay the market rate or go out of business.   There isn't a worker shortage there are companies offering jobs that are not financially viable for the current workforce.  They will role out a load of reasonable sounding arguments, about why should we pay someone $15 dollars to flip burgers, or serve fries.   The rebuttal is simple.  If you don't pay people what they want, they don't have to work for you, and you will go out of business. No more labour shortage.	1643410660.0	hunbcit	t3_sewvgj	t3_sewvgj	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sewvgj/eli5_the_accepted_solution_to_labor_shortages_if/hunbcit/

You press the generic call button, and get the elevator on its way to 10 and press 1, you have to wait for the elevator to go to 10 before going down to 1, and any stops called along the way.   Or  You press the down button and the elevator going to 10 ignores you, and you catch the one headed for 10.	1643411713.0	hundvic	t3_seuedy	t1_hun984b	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/seuedy/eli5_why_do_some_elevators_have_an_up_and_a_down/hundvic/

88bau	Taller chimneys do produce more draft.   The variable you are missing is the density of the gasses inside verses outside the column. The outside air simply weighs more. It's also important to remember when dealing with pressure that you are only considering the column of gas above and up to the edge of the atmosphere (the same way water pressure only depends on depth and not width)  The taller you replace that column with hotter (lower density, lighter) gas, the lighter you are making the overall virtual column to the edge of the atmosphere. If the column is lighter, then it is easier to lift, and the velocity increases.	1643412668.0	hung5b4	t3_sefb4s	t1_humq28z	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sefb4s/eli5_why_do_factories_require_such_high_chimneys/hung5b4/

mp7qe	I was referring more to our current-day social norms and values tbh. I know that rape was more acceptable in the past, which was a consequence of women being seen as closer to property than autonomous individuals. Under our current value system, we can find justifications for stealing, lying, hurting, or killing under certain circumstances. All of these things can be permissible in a war, for instance, but sexual crime during combat is a violation of the Geneva convention because we recognize that our current values have no justifiable place for it. Ofc that doesn't mean it doesn't happen tho	1643413933.0	hunj6py	t3_rt8zax	t1_hugxygb	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/rt8zax/eli5_what_does_it_mean_when_people_say_rape_is/hunj6py/

This also means it's one person per lift request (or plus maybe one if you have a visitor occasionally) which tidies up the numbers.	1643414053.0	hunjgnh	t3_seuedy	t1_humwf0a	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/seuedy/eli5_why_do_some_elevators_have_an_up_and_a_down/hunjgnh/
