ef6w3stt	That's what I've been doing. I've just been avoiding them all for the time being. I don't want to tell his wife but we are also  close friends and she's gone through so much.

eqallg3w	While I understand this, I agree with OP. As someone in a similar field (not exactly this) the comment that ‚Äúour work should be enough‚Äù is very harmful to healthcare workers and to patient health as a whole. Because of course I care about my patients and want them to be healthy and happy, but I also need to take care of my family. If healthcare workers aren‚Äôt paid enough, and are completely burnt out, they aren‚Äôt able to provide the quality of care that their patients/clients need. Also, covering up the problem of payment and saying that we should all be ok with it bc we ‚Äúwant to help people‚Äù tends to cause therapists to not complain/try to change other issues that are detrimental to patients. For example, not having access to certain curriculum, assessments, or other materials. Which aren‚Äôt provided by the workplace, and can‚Äôt be bought by the therapists because they don‚Äôt have money‚Ä¶  I know that this is slightly a tangent but I hope that it gets the point across and maybe is similar to what OP is expressing!	1642706421.0	hthwxmr	t3_s8q4dl	t1_htht571	/r/offmychest/comments/s8q4dl/mental_healthaddiction_counselors_and_therapists/hthwxmr/

Most ppl would provide jelly doughnuts and I don't like them lol. I pretty much will only eat plain doughnuts (no glaze/no powder) or crullers.  If we didn't eat them, then the next shift is like "awe shit!!

ef6w3stt	I agree with you to an extent.  I don't want to put myself in that position which is why I haven't said anything yet. But both girls are close friends of mine and the cheaters wife had suspicions and confronted him about them and he straight out told her she was crazy and making things up  so I just feel it's not fair to keep this from her but I don't want to be the one to tell her.

h9cdx	Kind of a dick thing to say to OP, not cool man. That being said... for anyone out there that hasn't tried a Kolache, it's a MUST, those things are incredibly delicious!!   They are ridiculously more expensive than a donut though, complaining your coworker got you a free donut instead of a Kolache is just very arrogant and entitled. For reference, I once bought 2 dozen kolaches for my coworkers using one buy 6 get 6 coupon (so only paid for 18) and the total was $80. I've never bought Krispy Kreme but I imagine $80 of donuts is at least 6 dozens	1642714266.0	htih45f	t3_s8ndv8	t1_hthpcxd	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ndv8/i_bought_donuts_for_everybody_at_work_and_im_the/htih45f/

w7kjo	Sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I know how you feel. I was in a car accident a couple years ago. Airbag caused jaw fractures and dental trauma. I lost a tooth, a couple broken teeth, and a few that were knocked out of place. Had over $25,000 worth of hospital bills alone and a totaled car. Not to mention more bills to cover restorative and cosmetic dental work.	1642749677.0	htkki26	t3_s89793	t3_s89793	/r/offmychest/comments/s89793/please_dont_take_your_teeth_for_granted/htkki26/

Don‚Äôt just learn to memorize, learn to think critically. Read constantly. Get into a vocational school right out of high school. You can go for free in some cases and even get financial aid for going. Become an LPN in 16 months and get out making $30 an hour. You can move out and never talk to them again.  Surround yourself with good hearted moral people and you will be happy. One day have your own family. Stay away from drugs and alcohol, workout to relieve stress. Slow and steady wins the race. This is what I wish I would‚Äôve heard when I was your age. Good luck	1642753070.0	htkp6bx	t3_s95iuh	t3_s95iuh	/r/offmychest/comments/s95iuh/i_just_want_someone_to_know_my_life/htkp6bx/

4ekglbdu	I used to, but I'm stronger now.  When my ex cheated on me, I cried so hard and felt so much anger and betrayal. He cheated on me when I was literally dying in the hospital.  When I lost our baby, I cried even harder. There was a lot of guilt and shame. I was alone. Funny how some men run when things get serious. I speak to my colleague about this, and it happened to her as well. She told me he disappeared as soon as she found she was pregnant.   When I felt like my first job post hospitalization was in jeopardy due to a performance review and I was going through chemo treatments (not for cancer, but blood transfusions to treat an autoimmune disease) those were some stressful times. I cried at night. I needed health insurance to cover those treatments..that were a 20k a pop, glad its over now. Ironically the "does not meet expectations" performance review was due to something that no one was trained on so her manager told her that. Even HR was questioning her actions.   Now it's like whatever. I didn't deserve the things that happened to me. The struggles I went through made me stronger. The actions of another person isn't a reflection on your worth. This is a great learning opportunity to screen people out since all the trauma is in such a compressed time frame.   With respect to that job, the girl who started after me quit, so there's 2 people left. The manager is new, and didn't want me to grow. I felt like she was intimidated by my credentials or me taking her job. Funny thing is, I never wanted her job, I just wanted to learn. I don't judge someone by how many degrees they have. The important thing is, are you a good person.. do you treat others with kindness? Can you complete tasks and take ownership and responsibilities? When I shifted departments I'm learning things that could have helped their office had they given me a chance, I'm working with people who are a much better fit, and my manager is super chill and thinks I'm doing an awesome job. When I want to learn more responsibilities, she sends someone to train me. I really appreciate that. And I know I can take these skills with me.	1642756858.0	htku4ck	t3_s96ivp	t3_s96ivp	/r/offmychest/comments/s96ivp/do_you_ever_cry_about_all_the_sad_things_that/htku4ck/

The people who invalidate men or assume "they're all the same" are just as bad as the people who made feminism necessary.

5tatll8	Better doesn't mean good, as I said in my post. It's awful what's still happening in terms of sexism, but it is a fact that it has improved since the past. You can't challenge that.  Women can vote, own property, be fully independent. The job market is more open for women, more assaults towards women are getting reported and taken far more seriously, the governments are actively seeking ways to reduce the danger women face. Women are allowed to study freely, they're able to gain quslifications and benefits, they're able to lead in parliament and run countries.  None of that could happen in the past. That's the improvement I was referring to. It isn't perfect by any means but please stop adding to the problem.	1642772369.0	htlh7x7	t3_s98lnd	t1_htlganz	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htlh7x7/
5tatll8	You aren't calling me out though, you're trying to argue against a fact. Everything you've tried to call me out for is just you taking my words wrongly.  What's adding to the problem is your assumption that because I'm male, sexism hasn't affected me. You're saying that sexism can't happen to other genders apart from females. And to top it all off, you're responding like you didn't even read or understand the post. I know there is still sexism and it's predominantly not towards males, but it doesn't make militant feminism (which is bordering on sexism itself) ok.   No matter what I say will change your opinion because it seems you came here purely to argue so I'll leave it there.	1642773054.0	htliozo	t3_s98lnd	t1_htli12g	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htliozo/
gvkl7unj	You WILL still encounter all the same behavior with men who aren‚Äôt white. I do think that whiteness is a contributing factor in increasing some aspects of toxic masculinity. But these features you‚Äôre describing define toxic masculinity which is pretty much globally pervasive. If you‚Äôre really looking for love and a genuine connection, don‚Äôt exclude an entire skin color, exclude all of the behaviors you‚Äôre describing and you‚Äôll be left with guys of many different skin tones.

I also don't understand your idea of an "unsupported sweeping announcement about sexism" because I'm literally referring to the fact that sexism overall has decreased and that was what I was saying by it getting "better". Maybe I worded that incorrectly.  I'd also disagree that I've benefitted from sexism but if you made that claim I'm glad to hear where you got that information about my personal life from.	1642774843.0	htlmo81	t3_s98lnd	t1_htlj43y	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htlmo81/

10rtib	I relate to the issues that you have with your father (which are really just his own issues that he needs to sort out). When I was 0-4, I was in a similar family dynamic to yours. My father is a violent alcoholic loser and I still remember what he subject my mum to. We got away, but unfortunately my mother got into another relationship with an even worse man 10 years later as well. I remember having the same fear that you mention when you think about having to move in with your mum and her new bf. The change when we moved in with my step-dad was absolutely terrifying because what if he turned out to be the same as my dad? In my case it turned out that he was even worse than my father, but you have to try to remember that there are so many more men that do turn out to be great father figures. The lack of trust towards guys kinda stays with me today, although I'm getting better at managing it. Hopefully you will be able to as well.  In regards to navigating your trauma alone and feeling fucked up, I want you to know that NOBODY is naturally equipped to handle these things alone. It's the situation, it isn't you. I know this doesn't fix your situation but I want you to know how much I respect you for sharing it. If you'd like to talk about anything, I'm open to that. I wish you the best and I hope you and your mum stay safe.	1642794627.0	htn36jj	t3_s9irco	t3_s9irco	/r/offmychest/comments/s9irco/i_have_to_move_in_with_my_mom_and_her_bf_to_get/htn36jj/

duql0z2l	Yeah that's super selfish. I have friends that are definitely against the vaccine and he has a government job too. The vaccine is required. My friend (his wife) was pissed when he decided he would get it to keep his job. He still hates it and hates that he had to get it. But he made the choice with his family and their future in mind. My friend sees that he made the choice for her and their kids.  It sucks that people are having to be forced into this. It really should be a choice and no one should have to decide to put something they don't trust into their body against their will basically. But here we are and some people have tough decisions.  I am for taking the vaccine if people want it but against the mandatory mandates for taking the vaccine.  I'm pro choice and everyone should have a right to their own body.  Sodenote: It's amazing to see the same people saying women should not have the right to their own body are the same people saying they should have rights to their own body against the masks and vaccine mandates.

58c9gafc	I think the only way we really get through it is by trusting in the governments are doing the right thing by giving us vaccines. Unfortunately the trust isn‚Äôt there by everyone which can be frustrating. While I do totally agree it should be a choice I do think they need to know the outcomes of that choice. We can‚Äôt live in a society where covid is such a killer virus. By lessening the effects it can be tolerable and we can carry on living as normal. The problem here is the way a lot of people have see it. The ‚Äúnot being entitled to the same as the vaccinated‚Äù or not being allowed in because of a mask. People who don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine should be thankful that others are to keep them safe. There‚Äôs lockdowns in some countries for unvaccinated people. There‚Äôs a divide happening I do agree but you do have to see sometimes it‚Äôs self inflicted. If you don‚Äôt want to be let go from a job because it requires a vaccine it‚Äôs up to you to find one that doesn‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt be going to a doctor that didn‚Äôt believe in washing their hands for instance.	1642800313.0	htniyqa	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnhfup	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htniyqa/

duql0z2l	Yep that's what I was seeing. Especially when Texas came out with their ruling. I called out a lot of people that I saw posting pro life/ anti abortion stuff a year prior. Then posting pro choice in regards to the mask mandates. The vaccine wasn't even a thing yet.  When Texas came out with their abortion law I asked them how can you support what Texas is doing but you were just posting my body my choice and saying the government should not control a person's body and what we do with it. IE not wearing masks and not taking the vaccine. One person did tell me they had changed their views on abortion becausethey did not belongthe vaccine should be forced.   People can be pro life and still support another person's right to have an abortion. But to completely say these are not comparable like others have said. It's the bottom line of "if you don't want the government making choices about what you do with your own body, it has to be overall not just to fit your agenda".	1642800857.0	htnkhd0	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htniiyr	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnkhd0/
duql0z2l	THIS IS FALSE. It has not stopped the spread. Most out breaks I have heard about were amongst the vaccinated spreading it to the vaccinated. There is an issue. This false information that the vaccinated are exempt from getting it and spreading it. They can get it just like an unvaccinated person and they can spread it just like an unvaccinated person.  The only thing they have found is that they spread it for shorter period of time but that doesn't stop the spread of they are seeing people and going into large gatherings without testing.	1642801080.0	htnl3z7	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnjiy3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnl3z7/

duql0z2l	What's the link, I would be interested in reading it?   I was just stating about people around me and my job. All my vaccinated friends have been getting it. They get it from another vaccinated person. Or they spread it to another vaccinated person.  At my job also the spread is amongst the vaccinated.   The reason being is that the vaccinated can go anywhere and just show their card or proof of vaccine and never be tested.

ieznpwxl	I'm still mad at him too, if i ever see him i'll smack the bullshit out of him. I have a problem with the people that inhabit this place, including him. How can someone be so worried about other shit to forget their son? Maybe that person shouldn't have been so worried about getting laid. The fatherless children rate is at an all-time high. And the mom's are just as much to blame, for picking a POS father for their child. Maybe they shouldn't have been so worried about getting laid too. This all comes back to having too much downtime. I don't understand why people are so blind, and have been so blind for so long. Multiple generations of people with their head in their ass, that's how we got where we are today. This country has been dog shit since it started, but the first president at least fought for what he believed in.	1642819249.0	htoup0x	t3_s9q6sh	t1_htoo7sp	/r/offmychest/comments/s9q6sh/us_needs_hard_times/htoup0x/

He had come into the vestibule of the dorm sometime either late at night or very early morning (I found him around 7:00a.m.) and passed away while leaning against a wall. I told the security guard inside the actual building, and he put his jacket over his head until people could get there.

c4fxufwn	Can we please have some sympathy for this man?  Your attitude is exactly what's creating the division that is responsible for 40% of our population being unvaccinated.  This guy was suddenly told in the past year by heavily biased scientists to take a vaccine known to cause allergic reactions and myocardititis or whatever it's called, that hasn't until recently been FDA approved, etc.  Yes, scientists are biased, I am one.  Maybe not as biased as individuals or the news but peer review is far from the perfect filter people hold it up to be.    Yes, he should get the vaccine.  But for God's sakes, have some respect for the fact that this guy is scared and angry.  Stop calling him an idiot.  People like you are the reason for COVID being as bad as it is.  If you'd approach vaccine hesitant people with understanding we'd have a lot fewer of them.  I am a scientist and have been triple vaccinated.  I also have a severe nut allergy and was extremely hesitant.

il1qxnb0	I was in the same situation in my senior year of high school - People in my class (who weren't even my friends) would ask me to text them the answers to the homework and stuff after class. At first I did because I felt like it was the nice thing to do, but they took advantage. It got annoying and when I vented about it to my close friends, they were angry on my behalf and told me I should set my foot down, so I finally did.  The next time those people asked for my homework, I said no and went on to explain that I don't exist to do the work for them, and honestly I was pretty pissed when I sent that message so I was pretty blunt. They were shocked but accepted it and never bothered me again, though they did act like I had "suddenly done a 180" and that I needed to "chill" but I didn't care. I was just relieved they stopped asking and guilt-tripping me into giving them my work. These people really sucked for other reasons (like cyberbullying, being patronizing to me all the time etc.) but I was so glad I finally set a boundary and told them off.  You may feel like a jerk/guilty when doing it but later on you really see that it was for the best and it's a confidence-booster honestly. So don't be afraid of saying no :) I used to say the small lies like "Oh I haven't done it yet" etc. but some people are dense or won't care and will still continue to bother you. Being blunt can be scary but from my experience (even after high school) it's been the best remedy to leeches lol.	1642861839.0	htqvca2	t3_s9krkg	t1_htoewu1	/r/offmychest/comments/s9krkg/i_love_to_make_people_feel_wanted_and_included_in/htqvca2/

cfo5wnze	It seems like he did it when I was drunk/drinking. The first time I was drinking  and I never had someone cum in me before so I didn‚Äôt know the feeling. With my first born I didn‚Äôt even know I was pregnant until 3 months later.  The most recent time, we were on a date so I was drinking as well. I don‚Äôt remember if there were other times.  All I remember was the first time and most recent.  To be honest I also wasn‚Äôt looking for signs that he was stealthing me (like condoms being on the floor) because  I believed this was someone I can trust.

5ujyzpev	The same thing happened to me. I'm a male(22yrs old), and used to be the athletic guy who used to go out with the hottest girls at high school and college. I have hypothyroidism and went through a depressive period, which caused me to gain a lot of weight. Though i'm overweight, i'm still rather fit, but now every single male person that knew me when i was athletic points out how fat i've become. I've avoided to meet people from college and highschool for that same reason. Girls have never pointed out my weight gain though.	1642864550.0	htr19bu	t3_s9xuta	t3_s9xuta	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xuta/im_a_former_hot_girl_who_gained_weight_due_to_a/htr19bu/

e56mj48m	Don't even think for a second this is your fault at all. You haven't done anything wrong by existing. Those people who crack jokes? They're all assholes who are projecting their own insecurities on others to make themselves feel better. Your husband? He's a cheater. He is a piece of shit for that, especially when you have been there for him.  You know, I am very happy for you getting out of there. But don't think of it as leaving for HIM or society. Fuck them both. You're leaving for you! Because you're a beautiful person who deserves all the happiness in the world. This is an opportunity for you to love yourself and eventually find someone who loves you for who you are (if you want). Your ex husband does not reflect how a man is supposed to treat the woman he loves. Not even close. a man who truly loves you would never think about cheating for a second. He'd defend you, tooth and nail, if someone was rude to you in such a ridiculous manner. Hell, a man who truly loves you would lay down his life for you if he had to. I'm sorry everyone has been horrible to you. Those people live miserable lives. If you ever need to vent, my pms are open.

Lying, infidelity,etc.  Regardless no one has the right to put their hands on another person but these situations can be avoided once some form of betrayal is made. Just leave.  If you did nothing you should have left the first time she was physical. As for her if she held some kind of resentment she should have left as well.	1642859151.0	htqq0xz	t3_s9wbyk	t1_htqpf3z	/r/offmychest/comments/s9wbyk/all_the_young_fellas_with_no_kids_be_careful_who/htqq0xz/

9xk3dmur	I am so sorry that you are struggling with being black. I'm white and so I know that I can't relate in the same way to the things you go through and feel, but may I share a few thoughts?   I think that being black is beautiful, personally. I lived in Queens/Brooklyn for quite awhile and in predominantly black neighborhoods and I absolutely loved it. When I was a child, I so desperately wanted "black hair" and all the beautifully amazing things that can be done with it. I am pale. Like translucent pale - I used to despise it. I always wanted my skin to have a nicer tone to it and I think that melanated skin is very pretty. But ... These are surface things at the end of the day.   What I loved most about living in Bed-Stuy (and similar neighborhoods) was the culture and community. I loved the neighborhood spirit - chilling on the stoop with family/friends, having cookouts, and that sense of "when you are here, you are family." I know there are stereotypes about black women, but I loved the boldness and spirit I saw. I am, by nature, somewhat shy/timid. But I looked up to the strong black women around me and wanted even a fraction of that strength. There is a joy and "life" (for lack of a better word) that I found in predominantly black communities that I have never seen when living in more white neighborhoods. I have some of the best memories from my time living there. I live in a very white neighborhood currently and I don't know a single neighbor. They keep to themselves and it feels like hostile undercurrent running through - and there is something missing (particularly having known something different).   I know that there is far more nuance to these things and I find myself struggling to express myself today, but ... I'm sad that you hate something that I see as so beautiful and powerful.	1643152544.0	hu7x5p6	t3_sccwjr	t3_sccwjr	/r/offmychest/comments/sccwjr/i_fucking_hate_being_black/hu7x5p6/

7ehcqibk	Time outs, they‚Äôd take away some of my privileges like my bicycle and my game consoles, they‚Äôd try to show me the difference between good behavior and bad behavior. They‚Äôd ground me if necessary.  They‚Äôd reinforce my good behavior and try to be patient with my bad behavior but point out that it‚Äôs wrong.   They honestly actively tried to avoid spanking me. They‚Äôd repeatedly try to not use any kind of physical discipline.   At one point though I stopped giving a crap about all those methods and that one-two spanks set me straight.   That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt regret anything. I respect the hell out of my folks and I‚Äôm grateful for that discipline. It taught me respect.   Like I said though there‚Äôs a big difference in lightly spanking a kid once or twice to get the message across and flat out hitting or slapping a kid in the face.	1643157081.0	hu8865k	t3_sc2ypf	t1_hu864fn	/r/offmychest/comments/sc2ypf/i_just_got_in_an_argument_with_my_gf_because_she/hu8865k/
6panl958	You're feeling this way after what your husband said about being obligated to stay together for the kids. I'd recommend listening to the others that suggested couples therapy. If your husband isn't open to that then you might want to consider divorce, but I really wouldn't recommend having a second life while you're still married to him. It will make the divorce infinitely more messy and probably ruin your reputation with your kids for life when they find out why things fell apart (keyword WHEN since a lot of women like to lie to their kids about such things but they always find out eventually).	1643157088.0	hu886r6	t3_scs4sm	t3_scs4sm	/r/offmychest/comments/scs4sm/i_want_to_live_a_double_life/hu886r6/

As a biracial woman who has always lived in predominantly white neighborhoods, I realize that:    ‚Ä¢ White men will date me but not marry me.   ‚Ä¢ I will never move up the corporate chain. I am always the one or two black women in the workplace.   ‚Ä¢ I will always be followed by security at the grocery stores, department stores, or any place to buy goods and services.  ‚Ä¢ I will be the sounding board for every white person complaining about how they are not racist.  ‚Ä¢ I will always be seated in the back of the restaurant or somewhere out of view of incoming patrons.  ‚Ä¢ When I ask for a refund or complain about service, I will have to defend my point of view or accept an inadequate resolution.  ‚Ä¢ I will always have to act in a passive manner at work no matter what injustice I suffer.  ‚Ä¢ I will have to hold my tongue and accept that white people will tell me that black people are not treated differently by the police.  ‚Ä¢ I have to accept the opinion of white people that speaking in very clear English is considered a compliment.  ‚Ä¢ I accept that white people will always assume that I grew up in the ghetto.     Thanks for letting me vent.	1643165316.0	hu8rrde	t3_sccwjr	t3_sccwjr	/r/offmychest/comments/sccwjr/i_fucking_hate_being_black/hu8rrde/

hmi863ho	I'm from India. We're both from hindu families but different castes. His caste is considered lower than mine in the hierarchy. Like most of the upper caste people, my parents are also casteist. The system is filthy.  He was very considerate before wedding, didn't show any signs. It's only after I'm truly trapped and enstranged from family, he showed his real interests. He forced me to engage in 'feminizing' him,  I've to act and dress like the dominant one, kept forcing me to learn make up for him, verbally abuse me if his make up is not on point, wear my underwear at home and outside without asking for my permission, stopped caring about pleasing me in bed etc. I hate all this.

ie0vm0cp	I don't really agree with you. Maybe I am a lucky bisexual woman, but from my experience I haven't really faced much discrimination for it, especially not from lesbians. I have gotten a few nasty comments from men, but that's it. Some of my bi friends have had encounters with biphobic lesbians but more often than not its been men who have been the worse about it, but I think it goes both way. I have heard some bisexuals be quite lesbiphobic. I feel like lesbophobia is super common too but swept under the rug more often because its so covert. Like people just assume every woman is a little bisexual, and don't believe a woman can be homosexual. And I think so many lesbians discomfort with literally just calling themselves what they are, Lesbians, kind of shows how prevalent it is.	1643174650.0	hu9bdcl	t3_scx3k2	t3_scx3k2	/r/offmychest/comments/scx3k2/i_really_think_bisexuals_face_more_discrimination/hu9bdcl/

ipvjzb1f	My favorite part is when gay and straight expect me to *plan* my relationships to make sure I get a good even 50/50 split alternating number of genders so I am a ‚Äútrue‚Äù bisexual. If you are in a long relationship (or have been in very few serious ones) with just one gender you‚Äôre obviously lying right?   Fuck all of this. Fuck straight unicorn hunter couples chasing bi girls, fuck straight men thinking bi women are just porn props for threesomes, fuck straight women who demean and humiliate bi men. Fuck all gay and straight people who think we‚Äôre some closet absolute or just attention seekers.   Way too many people are just too deeply insecure to be in relationships at all, always projecting their fears and insecurities. If you think bi ppl are more prone to cheat just because of opportunity you need therapy to discuss why you would assume cheating is only about opportunity. About math.   Sometimes I think this it as a bonus to weed out people who become life-sucking partners.	1643175123.0	hu9c7q8	t3_scx3k2	t3_scx3k2	/r/offmychest/comments/scx3k2/i_really_think_bisexuals_face_more_discrimination/hu9c7q8/

Then, when we tell her Happy Birthday out of politness, she gets very excited and smiles very big, as if we had planned a suprise birthday for her all along. It's really cute and it's nice to make someone feel good, even if they asked for it.   Basically, don't be afraid to tell people you want to matter, especially if its your birthday. Yeah, it would be nice if your own fucking parents remembered, but people are selfish as fuck. Don't expect them to remember but don't be shy about telling them either. People like to do nice things for others because then they get to feel good about themselves, so just tell them next time if they forget.

To walk in the door of a "woman's clinic" and expect to get misgendered, on top of not knowing how any doctor will react to my sensitivity because of my past. It's absolutely awful to me that you can't even message a gynocologist to see if they're trans friendly, sa friendly, or can make arrangements for you, without having to meet them for the appointment. And from what I've heard online, even if I told them this there would still be little they could do but continue the test. I saw stories about how gynocologists would continue just like you said when the patient said it was too far. Your story is like reading my absolute nightmare has happened to someone. I'm so sorry  I'm also very "tight" there and can't take penetration at all, and people suggest that I'm just not aroused enough and that it would be fine for sex, but I've always refused doing it that way.	1643185674.0	hu9rr2j	t3_scxzhf	t3_scxzhf	/r/offmychest/comments/scxzhf/i_feel_traumatized_from_my_pelvic_exam_today/hu9rr2j/

I couldn't imagine not wanting my partner to know, be involved and be without his support. Maybe she doesn't trust you, maybe she was advised to make the decision herself... But make ~~damn~~ sure to honor your feelings - they are perfectly understandable!

p9d93tm	nah thats bullshit. "they cant help it"? bullshit. of course they can fucking help it. its not like theyre being controled or forced jnto molesting children. sure, they might have inevitable thoughts about doing it (if thats what happens in a sick persons mind) but ACTUALLY DOING IT is all them. they do it cuz they want to. and thats unforgivable. besides, i dont give a fuck about these ppl, much less do i pity them. because i worry about the victim instead. "oh the pedophile is remorseful about what they did and regrets it all" dont give a fuck. that child is fucking traumatized forever, might develop anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, PTSD, you name it. and you pitty the molestor? cuz they cant help it? ffs	1643204235.0	huailq7	t3_sd5ir9	t3_sd5ir9	/r/offmychest/comments/sd5ir9/i_feel_like_i_have_an_unpopular_opinion_on/huailq7/
i0zwt	Sounds like a reasonable deal. But don't confront and accept it, because if you know and are ok-ish with it, she will feel less guilt. And that might translate to less BJs and worse ones. Seems like her performance is guilt fueled.  Either way this might permanently damage your relationship behond repair at some point. Enjoy it while it lasts and prepare for a potentional exit and do not commit in any way like marriage or kids.	1643205801.0	hualyg7	t3_sd0wra	t3_sd0wra	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0wra/my_girlfriends_been_cheating_on_me_and_relieving/hualyg7/
7g43f	I just ended things with my fiance over new years.  5 years.  The last fiance was also a 5 year. So at 38, I've spent the last decade right in the cusp of getting married.    I've never wanted kids.  I travel way too much and want to spend my money on other stuff.  I live in a house I bought. I can come and go anywhere I want,  anytime,  for any reason.     There are a lot of really awesome things about not being tied down.  But there are some drawbacks also.  As you get older your friends become more scattered and less frequent in your life.  It can be lonely sometimes,  especially today.  So having a partner could be nice. Travel is great,  but more memories are made with other people.  You will find yourself doing it alone more as your friends get married,  kids, move,  ect so be OK with that.    It's a choice.  You can do whatever you want.  Just be willing to accept the ups and downs of each decision	1643205870.0	huam3t7	t3_scvei4	t3_scvei4	/r/offmychest/comments/scvei4/do_i_have_to_get_married_have_kids/huam3t7/

2c46rlxj	Well this isn't what I needed to hear!! Just kidding, you make a lot of great points. As of now I'm not happy and I am hurt, you're right. It's going to take time to heal, but I've made the choice to stay with her and even being confronted with your very valid points I stand behind that decision. If it turns out to be a wrong one, I can live with that.  She had sex in the first month we started dating again, which hurt me, but I'll keep it real with you: if I had the chance to have sex with 10 people in those months I would have done it as well (and explained it away by her being vague and me being a guy). And I don't want to throw what we have now away over the 'kisses' that came after lol.   Still though, I will take some of your advice to heart. I will always put myself first and never base any decision that impacts my life based on whoever I'm dating, regardless of this situation.	1643215921.0	hubbwqz	t3_sd91zx	t1_hub9z3q	/r/offmychest/comments/sd91zx/i_forgave_my_unfaithful_girlfriend_but_its/hubbwqz/

Guys family had him by the balls in every way and were upset that I was trying yo make him an adult that doesn't run to mommy and daddy with everything.

8cg53	Once I was walking to my local hospital to admit myself to the ER psych ward because I was too close to doing it myself. I had all the tools ready that I needed but I went to ask for help in the last minute.  On my way to the hospital, I saw someone jump from a 10th or 11th story balcony. Because it was literally across the street from the hospital, an ambulance got there within the 2 minutes I stopped. I was in shock. I saw someone kill themselves before my eyes, just minutes before I decided to ask for help for help. That also could have been me. Then came a lady with kids and a stroller and said something like "Can you believe people choose to do this in front of a childrens play area?" I told her that it was a suicide, and her face gave a disgusted look. "So he CHOSE to do this HERE?" I wanted to strangle her.  I ended up in the psych ward for a week or so before they kicked me out (because there is a constant lack of beds).	1643227979.0	huc9xml	t3_sd15gx	t3_sd15gx	/r/offmychest/comments/sd15gx/ignoring_a_suicide/huc9xml/

I actually feel sort of bad for your boyfriend. He was upfront and honest from the start, he told you that this friendship was important and he wanted to maintain it. He respected every single boundary you placed besides the one time (so it seems).   You decided to enter into the relationship knowing he had an ex as a friend, and you throughout the relationship made the decision that you weren't comfortable with it.   I guess I'm just confused because it doesn't seem like he was flirty with her or being inappropriate in anyway with his ex, but your past experience wasn't allowing you to feel secure so you made him sacrifice a friendship.   Did you go to therapy? Did you try and also create a friendship with this woman?   While your young now, you may enter into a relationship later in life that involves children, sometimes ex's are going to be apart of the picture. I would really suggest working on your trauma and heal yourself.	1643241048.0	hud90fs	t3_sdjqmd	t3_sdjqmd	/r/offmychest/comments/sdjqmd/my_bf_went_no_contact_with_his_ex_but_i_still/hud90fs/

ixgykzm4	>I have to respectfully disagree. OP made it their goal to lose weight and they are achieving it. When people see a person sticking to their goal, it is hard not to feel happy for that person. In my opinion, people shouldn‚Äôt overthink compliments unless they are overtly confusing.  It sounds like they're not saying, "Wow, OP, you've been talking about how hard it's been to keep up the motivation for your new weight-loss routine, congrats on your commitment!" They're saying, "Wow, you're skinnier now, yay!" Her BF isn't complimenting her work ethic when she goes off for an early morning jog, he's comparing her to her past appearance \*while they're being intimate\*. I think lots people would be a bit upset if their partner dropped, "Wow, you're so much sexier in this makeup than in the makeup you usually wear," while things were getting hot and heavy.   Also, aside form OP's BF, do any of these people actually KNOW she's been working to lose weight? Or are they just seeing that she's thinner and delivering affirmation that things are better now that she's thinner? Because that's not appropriate, and a rain of that could effect how she experiences these comments overall.

But there‚Äôs plenty of ‚Äúdepressed person smothers the light of the outgoing positive one‚Äù.

fl1uazfl	  I feel I might be a little biased on this because I do suffer from a little list of mental health issues but these werent detected before i moved out in an age of 19.  I was very picky as a child and first in my age of 25 learned to put things on bread. I have faint memories of food anxiety related to the way my father would treat me around foods i didnt like and even though my mom did her best to cook for me to make me eat, I still suffer with sometimes extreme food anxiety today.   I‚Äôm just saying you might not know why your child is fuzzy around food and you might do more damage than good if theyre sensitive like myself  (I know this sounds horrificly stupid but you dont know how embarrassing it is to be grown and not be able to find things on a menu in a restaurant with your friends/parents in law/etc.)  Pls its ok to laugh, I cant do anything myself either.	1643244344.0	hudgx6h	t3_sdg6ld	t3_sdg6ld	/r/offmychest/comments/sdg6ld/whats_for_dinner_is_what_we_are_eating_insane_how/hudgx6h/

6xe6wv4n	I can't answer your question because I don't know what you look like, and even if I did, this is a very subjective topic. One thing that I've learned though, you will likely never see yourself the way other people do. You've been staring at your mug since day 1. Watched it morph over time. Everything. It is imprinted in your mind in a way that no one else will ever have. So, that being said, one thing you eventually need to do is learn to be okay with other people perceiving you differently. If they like it, so what. It just is the way it is. I have a similar complex and eventually just accepted that some people are going to like the way I look more than I do. Think of it as giving. It's nice to look at someone who you think is attractive. If they like it, and they aren't improper obv, then you're just another nice feature of nature in the world. Looks are such a contentious issue. People that are clearly attractive can think they aren't, and some folks that maybe aren't natural born models can think they are descended from heaven. It's a weird thing. Okay, maybe spun around in a tangent, but again, learning to let go and accept that other people perceive you differently and that's okay will go a long way	1643312062.0	huhaqxj	t3_se67x4	t3_se67x4	/r/offmychest/comments/se67x4/im_ugly_why_does_everyone_i_meet_find_me_so/huhaqxj/

a0mfc4vn	I was just like this in college. It was incredibly stressful. I was doing drugs and coping with terrible habits. I did try therapy and antidepressants too and it almost broke my brain. It didn‚Äôt work, then I developed crazy panic attacks. I really thought I had gone insane some days. I told myself over and over what you‚Äôre telling yourself but I vowed to finish what I started. I slept all day. I failed classes. It‚Äôs a snow ball effect that just gets worse. You have to stop the cycle and just go. And I graduated late too. But guess what, it doesn‚Äôt really matter! Plenty of people take longer. If it‚Äôs too severe maybe dropping out and focusing on your health is better in some cases but in my case my only goal was to graduate no matter what. When I look back I realized I was holding myself back so much worrying about trivial things. Focus on what you do enjoy about school. Focus on what you can control right now. And keep trying to seek therapy as well. I‚Äôm sure your school might offer some services? And Marine biology sounds like a bad ass career. Really dive in (hardy har) to your studies and try to connect with your professors and classmates. I think you‚Äôll realize that lots of people are going through similar things. I wish I could help you more here so sorry. My life isn‚Äôt perfect either but it did get a lot better.

You can also work on your career path and personal interests and develop a life that isn‚Äôt a 9-5 job consisting repetitive tasks. But that seems too tiring to achieve, right? So you basically want a different lifestyle without putting in the hard work. When there was no money or capitalism and people‚Äòs only aim was to hunt for food and have a safe place to sleep, they also had always to do something in order to survive. We have always been collective individuals, who need eachother. Today in a world with 7-8bill people, our population goes to work basically for the same reason, and everybody bashes it with ‚ÄûI hate capitalism‚Äú. Why? Why don‚Äôt you just stay at home and let the system take care of you?

You started associating those 2 things out of some kind of mental habit, not because you actually associate them.   As a personal example, every time I shave, I think about a specific person. I haven‚Äôt seen this person in years. And this person has absolutely nothing to do with my shaving routine. But for some reason my brain associates shaving with the thought of this person.

Seeing that growing up I‚Äôm glad I can just go to the store and buy bottled water, meat, vegetables Etc. But I‚Äôve never really had an actual job until I moved out of my grandparents house and moved into an apartment in the city after becoming a welder  And having a decent enough paying job to have the luxuries I never had and neither my grandparents ever had.

Identities are among those things; sexually identifying oneself is just giving out more information that the algorithms at large can tag you in to feed you more relevant advertising.

37byonzt	Small people need to break others down because they want others to feel as tiny as they are... You are not selfish, they are; they're supposed to be the adults, your guardians, your support system. I'm so sorry you always have to be their punching bag. Please never blame yourself for their behavior. I hope you'll always put yourself first, fight for yourself, love yourself more than anything. I know it's all so hard right now but keep doing the things that you love in spite of them because honestly, fuck them. As you grow and meet good people, people who see you and love you as you are, you'll create a new family. You deserve to feel good and safe, always.   Do you have people you can talk to? Does your aunt understand your situation? Does she talk to your parents?  I hope one day all this hurt will be a distant faded memory for you.	1643348666.0	hujq251	t3_sefqm8	t3_sefqm8	/r/offmychest/comments/sefqm8/im_so_fucking_done/hujq251/
80ymw994	I completely understand‚Ä¶I‚Äôm in the same position regarding comfort items to soothe my depression. Whenever I feel like my purchase was silly, I remind myself of how it makes me feel & I focus on that. I buy Squishmallows, btw tbh. They help me with my anxiety, CPTSD, OCD & depressive thoughts. I get ones with different textures because I can hug them & it helps ground me/bring me to the present while providing me some cuddles (I didn‚Äôt grow up with much physical affection from the people I needed it from so sometimes in my depressive states I go back to my childlike self where I need to fulfill those basic needs). I hope you can work through feeling it‚Äôs stupid. I think it‚Äôs brave & important you‚Äôre doing something to help you. While I don‚Äôt suggest going overboard (I sadly recently overspent, like waaay over & too quickly = stressss), I support this endeavor to find things that comfort you in the meantime as you work through things. I hope through these days, you‚Äôll find some gentleness & compassion to extend yourself. Life is hard, & being so harsh on ourselves makes it all worse ‚Äî this is coming from someone who does the same & whose partner tells them ‚Äúbabe, gentle reminder: you are too harsh on yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy are you so mean to yourself? Be kinder to yourself as you are to me, to those you love.‚Äù   Anyway, I hope I didn‚Äôt come off preachy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve done & honestly do the exact same thing so I get part of this albeit I‚Äôll never know your pain‚Ä¶. I wish you the best, I wish you safety & warmth. I hope you continue to take care‚Ä¶. And something that helped me too was to remind myself, ‚Äúa day at a time. I can handle one day at a time. And that‚Äôs okay.

Jennifer Lopez is hot for some people and Keira Knightley is hot for other people.  > small waist, normal sized and normal looking chest, wide hips  This, honestly, sounds "hot asf".

You don‚Äôt know it yet, but you‚Äôre necessary and important. Take it from someone who attempted suicide at 18 and who has had Major depression and anxiety since the age of 10. I now have a wonderful and fulfilling life and I‚Äôm 42. I never thought I‚Äôd live past 30. I had to learn that I‚Äôm in control of my own happiness and that I can actually be happy. You can too. You just have way too many toxic distractions in your life right now.   I have a daughter your age who is gorgeous and a kind soul. she struggles with friends, teasing, feeling like the odd person out, and she has a lot of anxiety. It‚Äôs a really hard time right now for your generation, but it‚Äôs all temporary. I tell my daughter that all the time. Life can be incredible!
