There's a longstanding tradition of the Church being the Bride of Christ and other such imagery. So you're really cherry-picking at something without seeing the full context.  Also, January 1st is the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God in the Roman Rite. (I'm not sure in terms of the Eastern Rites.) So is it really a surprise the Pope might choose a more woman-focused quote, assuming Breitbart is giving proper context, on a day that honors the most important woman in the Catholic faith?  It would kind of be like complaining about a lack of mentioning mothers on the Feast of St. Joseph.	1641111546.0	hqwwhxj	t3_rtsr5k	t3_rtsr5k	/r/MensRights/comments/rtsr5k/sjw_pope_goes_fullon_gynocentric_claiming_that/hqwwhxj/

9qhqjvom	I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, feminists are some of the most misogynistic people I’ve ever come across.  It’s insane how quickly they’ll resort to the same misogynistic behaviour they claim to be fighting (behaviour they claim only men exhibit) when it suddenly benefits them.  They claim men see women as objects only good for sex and yet they’ll call a woman a “dick worshipper” just because she doesn’t hate men.  They claim men and the patriarchy are to blame for rape culture and then tell a woman she deserves to get raped just because she pointed out the fact that men can get raped and women can be rapists.  They say “all women are beautiful” and then attack a womans appearance when she disagrees with them, and they’ll accuse her of grovelling for mens attentions by having “internalised misogyny” because it’s the only way they’ll ever fuck her because she’s too ugly. Wow, how very feminist.  “All women are just as smart as men”…. Unless a women calls them out for their hypocrisy and bigotry, then she’s stupid.  They don’t care about doing good, they care about looking good, and they only care about looking good to the other idiots in their own echo chamber. They’ll resort to bigotry if and when it suits them even if they were calling someone else out for their own bigotry five minuets earlier. They’ll resort to misogyny and justify it so long as the women “deserved” it. They pick and chose when they support women and equality.   A misandrist women calling little boys “predators in the making”? “Yes! You beautiful goddess! You go girl! Women are the most intelligent beings on earth!!1!”   A woman supporting both women AND men and taking everyone’s issues seriously?  “Ugly ass pick me girl lmao go suck a dick you dumb bitch XD”  I saw a post on tumblr a few years ago where a feminist was telling women who had been hurt by other women “at the end of their day they’re still your sisters and we’re in this together because no matter how much a woman hurts you you, men can and will hurt you worse”  I wish I was joking. As a victim of abuse by a woman, this infuriated me when I saw the post and it had SO many likes too. So many idiots agreed with that shit. These people claim to care about female victims of abuse and then they tell these same female victims that our abusers are our SISTERS. Fuck that.  These are all things I’ve seen feminists say and do throughout the last 10 years that ive been on social media but it’s not everything I’ve seen, its just a small example of how feminists don’t actually care about women, and that’s nothing to say about how badly men and boys are effected by their shit either, five minuets on this sub and you can see just how fucked over men and boys are by feminists and their bigotry as well.  Nobody benefits from feminism other than feminists. Nobody. Feminists are a joke to the word equality.	1641111821.0	hqwwuod	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqwwuod/

bbb2t4qb	If your father was a danger and you were too young to understand, it would have been her responsibility to protect you and make the best of that really difficult situation.   This being said, and without knowing more, it sounds like your mother was wrong. My mother also similarly demonized my father and made herself out to be a perfect parent. I didn’t know that my father wasn’t a total prick (and that my mother was a liar) until late 30’s. My dad is no peach, but we do get along these day, so she completely robbed me of decades of having a father…basically just to spite him. She was mad during their divorce so she wanted to take away his kids - the other side of the equation didn’t compute for her or wasn’t important enough.   On another note, her saying “our lives” when you’re grown has an enmeshment vibe. Your need for a father as a human and her relationship with the man who made you are 2 separate things, and she should(’ve) be(en) able to tell the difference and suck it up to some degree for your best interest instead of deciding what you need based on her agenda. It’s not so unheard of for people to split up maintain civil contact purely bc it’s healthier for the kids. A friend of mine is currently in a dead marriage but they’ve both agreed to keep the home intact until the youngest is in college - that’s years.   Unfortunately, some people are just willing to sacrifice more than others for their children, and it seems you and I may have drawn a shorter stick.	1641113043.0	hqwyd89	t3_rtgdub	t3_rtgdub	/r/MensRights/comments/rtgdub/is_my_mom_in_the_wrong/hqwyd89/

We can always refocus the discussion on the hills I think we all mostly agree are worth dying onto for boys & mens rights:  - Paternity fraud - Military draft  - Workplace deaths - War deaths & violence - Suicide rates (**not** suicidal gestures) - Sentencing disparity  - Shorter life expectancy - Child custody & child support rights (big contributing factor to suicide rates) - False rape allegations - Homelessness  - Infant male genital mutilation - Criminal court bias - Educational bias - Mediatic bias	1641116008.0	hqx1zvh	t3_ru1yzd	t1_hqwpqw0	/r/MensRights/comments/ru1yzd/stop_canceling_people_for_literally_having_an/hqx1zvh/

dz67i3y4	Overall, I think it's a well-designed survey. Some of the criticisms I have are: (1) I don't care for the use of the term "real man". It's a loaded term, which, in my experience, is used far more often by misandrists than men who are speaking out on men's issues. (2) the question on the reasons why a participant first got involved with men's rights needs some answers that reflect the fact that some people came here because they observed the experiences of other people rather than having bad experiences themselves. (3) I like the free form sections where I can elaborate on certain responses, but the text boxes need "word wrap". I had to type one answer in notepad first so I could see everything I wrote.	1641116936.0	hqx346r	t3_rtvj42	t3_rtvj42	/r/MensRights/comments/rtvj42/research_project_in_the_netherlands_survey_about/hqx346r/

You cannot be upset about men and women in their 50s and 60s, and perpetually take it out on men in their 20s. Surprise, people in their 50s and 60s will not be effected by your new policies. Using stats of them, implementing a policy, then using stats of them again does what? The numbers will continue to be skewed in the direction you don't like because they are not effected by your policies. Are we suppose to just be in some endless loop of giving women advantages?  Don't be surprised when young men get fed up of being robbed and begin protesting discrimination.	1641117075.0	hqx3afh	t3_rtvhyv	t1_hqvxc38	/r/MensRights/comments/rtvhyv/the_new_political_cry_in_south_korea_out_with_man/hqx3afh/

7o73xhl8	Actually men have bigger problems to deal with than 'being not able to express emotions'..    There is risk of sexual assault, false allegations, biased family court and DV courts, misandry, etc..    You don't really need everyone to listen to you to express your emotions..     I have my parents, two sisters and two best friends (male) to confide-in, and they are more than enough..      I don't really believe in marriage, so I don't need a wife or GF to express myself.   But the social and legal bias are impossible to deal with..

e6yjqcmd	Yes dear yes. Accidental, unintentional physical contact with a woman's skin, let alone breasts or hips is generally interpreted as sexual harassment (in my country the federal penal code has a special section for it titled "Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty") or possibly assault, but viciously hitting a Man in his genital area is seen as hilarious for some demented reason.   Men in general and Male Artists in the media and entertainment industry need to stop simping or tolerating it and stand up to this absurdity.

f153moet	This friend zone thing is an American thing. If I was single,  I would never date someone I wasn't friends with first! (UK). And if USA had an NHS and genuine supportive benefits system,  American people would be less likely to have that intense desire for wealthy men to provide for them to survive life and have a safety net. Because they would already feel more secure,  and wouldn't have to worry about ending up homeless under a bridge if they got sick. Seriously skews the whole of life and dating in America.  A lot of it is born of desperation on the part of women, and a lot of American society,  including women is completely unconscious of it.	1641122038.0	hqx9914	t3_rtjspn	t3_rtjspn	/r/MensRights/comments/rtjspn/why_do_women_think_the_sexzone_doesnt_exist/hqx9914/

At any rate, it strikes me how much the narrative trying to exculpate her is anything but progressive, but downright reactionary: a Victorian vision of women as incapable of such actions. As I understand it, in those days, sometimes even serial killers (women) were exonerated by all male juries  in cases where the seriousness of the crime and level of evidence exceeded those in this case.   Justice was served in a path-breaking way.

hqsve4uc	>How is a woman that has many sexual partners bad if none of them are exclusive  Women who have sex with many different man have their pair bonding mechanism damaged and that makes it harder for them to bond with each subsequent partner. (Emphasis on many **different** men, it's worse if a woman had sex 1 time with 100 different men than if she has had it 10.0000 times with the same guy). That aspect makes it even harder for a woman to sustain her desire for her partner during a long-term relationship than it should normally be. So the fact that not a single one of them is exclusive is precisely the problem.  >So do you also think men who have many sexual partners are man-whores  I would never use that term unironically in my life, so no.	1641123237.0	hqxaotw	t3_rt7tel	t1_hqx9lxu	/r/MensRights/comments/rt7tel/its_not_okay_to_slutshame_but_virgin_shaming_is/hqxaotw/

There’s really no other way to do it. Is it possible that women are less likely to admit infidelity to a researcher? After all, it’s more likely that a male cheater got caught and so has nothing to lose when answering the survey. Women may be more apprehensive about answering truthfully, because they’ve never been caught.   I don't see how women would be more incentivized to not answer truthfully, because when researchers are conducting studies like this, they make sure to let the participants know that there answers are confidential so that there more comfortable giving a truthful answer.I this is a weak argument, but everything else I agree with.	1641123375.0	hqxauwe	t3_ru7o4z	t3_ru7o4z	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7o4z/why_do_women_cheat_and_blame_men_for_being/hqxauwe/

It's reasonable to discuss why people end up the way they do; as I said above in a response to someone else, discussing why criminals commit crime is, I think, generally useful to society.  > I can assure you there would be a lot of outrage, and for very good reason.  In the very broadest sense I understand what you're saying and I *suspect* you're right, though I wouldn't have worded it like that. I'd have said "I wouldn't be surprised if..."

This is the pope, in the Bible vicar (latin, in place of[!!], not representative]) is only the Holy Spirit, while in the Catholic Church the higher ups are called the "Vicar of Christ": analyzing the Bible says that it could even be blasphemy to refer to the pope or other "Vicar of Christ", because Christ has more power and authority than them. The pope isn't Christ on earth. The pope doesn't speak for him. (Papal infallibility dogma is only valid when he's talking in ex cathedra). So please don't say that. God does care about men.

i3uus6e3	People without arguments tend to resort to insults. Take note of how they attack you, though.   You're a "pick me girl", which is a term they've created for girls who don't have enough "value" for men to choose them as mates without you having to do something (do a backflip!) to get attention. Note the currency they're judging your implied value on, your ability to get male attention.  While there is truth to the whole social value concept, it is described quite incorrectly there.  Not to stray too far on a tangent, but there's just a few simple steps for women to have a high social value, aka be the type of mate the vast majority of men seek. Pay attention to how many of these "practicing" feminists get wrong:  1. Maintain a healthy weight. Not that healthy at any size BS, nobody actually believes in that "body positivity" bullshit they just use it in commercials to sell soap.  Inability to manage a basic healthy lifestyle is a huge red flag, fat diabetic kids always have fat diabetic parents. Yes, some guys are into big girls, but that's a fetish.  2. Don't alter your body unnecessarily. Yes, some guys like tattoos, piercing, and fake boobs but again, that's a fetish not a norm.   3. Don't look/act/dress like a clown, aka don't go out of your way to be repulsive. For example, many feminists think having purple hair attracts attention. In reality, humans are biologically programmed to avoid things that are clearly wrong, the same way we are disgusted by rotted food... (I'm relatively sure that the blue haired feminist type does it thinking it will keep you from noticing how fat they are, which obviously isn't true.) Wearing a bunch of makeup is another good example of this, there's a vanishingly small amount of makeup that doesn't just look immediately unnatural. There are some guys who are into clowns, but that's a fetish.  4. Don't start a family without a mate. Single moms are about as low as you can go on social value while still having all your limbs. They're a terrible deal for the vast majority of men who want their own families, and who want a relationship where the partners come first at least for a little while before having children. Dating a single mom means you're always second place, not to mention the whole concept of raising another man's children. Yes, some guys are into that, but it's a fetish.  5. Have some depth, be more than just a pretty face. Time keeps on ticking, if your only value is a your looks you're on a downhill slope before you hit 30. Learn some things worth learning, do some things worth doing. Those beautiful actresses and models who end up divorced, they were *boring*.  The rules are pretty simple, and short of an actual disfigurement will put you far ahead of the pack.  So back to the initial topic, note how many of those basic rules are consistently gotten wrong by "practicing" feminists. The stereotype of a fat, blue haired tattooed nose ring shrieking single mom feminist is relatively accurate, these women have effectively removed themselves from the pool of viable mates and will lash out at women who haven't.  Anyway it's a sad fact that men and women fight for rights not just separately but sometimes against the others. The adage of "if you're not with us, you're against us" is absurd from a movement claiming to support a demographic. We should all expect equality in the eyes of the law and to be judged on our own merits rather than by our genitals.	1641125364.0	hqxdd41	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqxdd41/
cfo6r1u4	Body count is a personal preference for someone. She may be less desirable to you, but not everyone. Also, what if the woman doesn't want a long term partner? It's everyone's choice to have a long term partner or stay single if they want.   And your logic with the men who sleep around makes no sense. They are doing the same exact thing as women who sleep around.

hqsve4uc	>Body count is a personal preference for someone.  So what ? Just because people like something doesn't mean that it's good  >She may be less desirable to you, but not everyone  A slut's value is lower than the value of other women for the reasons I've stated. My desires have no effect on that. And also just because there are people who desire something, that doesn't mean that something is good (2).  >Also, what if the woman doesn't want a long term partner? It's everyone's choice to have a long term partner or stay single if they want.  That doesn't change the fact that her  relationship value is lower. That remains the case either if she wants a long-term relationship or if she doesn't. They hardwired their brains to sleep around and settling down takes way too much work than it normally would. Being less valuable than normal is always bad.   >And your logic with the men who sleep around makes no sense. They are doing the same exact thing as women who sleep around  Men's pairbonding doesn't get weakened because male humans have evolved to reproduce with multiple partners (unlike women). So the amount of oxytocin men's brains produce will always be higher when they are with their current partner than with other women. Men will always have the capability for a long term relationship, no matter their body count, as long as he's getting a satisfying amount of sex with his current partner. Also, for a man to find a woman to sleep with takes considerably more effort than the opposite. Being a slut takes no effot at all.  >I'm getting a sense that you hear one thing that makes sense to you, and you instinctively subscribe to that idea, and refuse to look at other perspectives.

2zae96xw	While I agree with a lot of your points, the way you're framing some of them comes off as off putting.  Like just cause someone likes women that happens to be bigger, have tattoos or piercings or colored hair doesn't mean they have a fetish for it and someone with those traits aren't necessarily repulsive. They can be but not always. There's lots of sexy and attractive men and women who have some of the traits you mentioned. A nasty arrogant attitude is usually what makes someone unnatractive imo. I'd way rather date someone with blue hair and piercings who's overweight than someone with a terrible attitude, and I think most people would.   The issue with feminists isn't their hair, their tattoos, or their weight. It's their messed up beliefs and attitudes. Like having purple hair to attract attention. That's the wrong intention imo. Rock purple hair cause you think it's fun and it makes you feel confident. Like anything else, you should be doing things not to impress others but to feel good in your own skin.	1641129011.0	hqxiekq	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hqxdd41	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqxiekq/

11khew	One of the big problems we're facing is that, like everything else, the Women's movement has been monetized and is really big business. Whether it's international Women's day, or make up, or whatever, there's huge amounts of money being spent patronizing Women so that they'll spend their money.  We're so outgunned that basic logic about things like genital mutilation, parenting rights and of course dating rituals just falls on deaf ears, or worse, is shouted down.  I do my best to point out inequality in all aspects of life, whether it be gender, race, sexual orientation etc, but the one that really gets people red in the face is the equality movement. Men and Women having the same rights and responsibilities just seems like  mutually exclusive ideas to these people.	1641129057.0	hqxih10	t3_rtycby	t1_hqwntop	/r/MensRights/comments/rtycby/in_2022_i_want_to_see_men_holding_women/hqxih10/

Worst case scenario is that they'll only help the girls, so we would have to watch how they solve it and duplicate that with boys.  Fucking sucks that this is how the world is, but we can't wait for a prejudiced society to catch up.	1641130887.0	hqxld3v	t3_ru8pxp	t3_ru8pxp	/r/MensRights/comments/ru8pxp/i_stumbled_on_a_un_page_on_a_claim_that_40_of_all/hqxld3v/
kjyvk	>FACT: she is going to prison   FACT: they aren't.  Last time I checked Epstein did. Just because he got suicided afterwards doesn't change the fact that he did go to jail.  Maxwell/Epstein went to jail because they were the ones organizing the ring. Not because of gender as the author implies.  Instead of deliberately ignoring the role of Maxwell (and Epstein) to promote a false gender narrative, maybe we should be pushing for everyone involved to be prosecuted.

kjyvk	>Breivik killed seventy seven people.  And Maxwell likely sent that many children or more into sex slavery. Comparing which crime is worse is a moot point.     >and clearly was never victimized  That's the point: he was.

Anyways people shouldn’t be telling you I hope you get raped, that’s just an awful thing to say to anyone. Also where did you receive these comments? Because stay away from Twitter, my advice to anyone, its a fucking shit storm. Finally, how do I stop getting notifs from this community, I’ll admit most people here have a better head on their shoulders than radical twitters but that’s not much, and I dislike the way they ignore crucial facts to distort evidence and make their points.  Yes, men may be more likely to be killed when they are in a physically abusive relationships, but women are still four times more likely to die in a physically abusive relationship, because men are that much more likely to physically abuse their partners! So if it’s a competition, you really don’t have the upper hand. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/warning-signs-intimate-partner-homicide-1.6269761 Sorry, I just don’t wanna receive notifs from this community anymore- and to OP, stay away from Twitter lol, and prolly tumblr as well, actually if you are twelve just stay away from the internet in general.

i3uus6e3	The people you mention in your first paragraph have other attributes that end up being more important than being obese or looking like a cartoon character.. But let's be fair, those are exceptions. if you see two people from a distance, one of followed the list and the other went against it, 100% of the time you will be more interested in the one who did.   Regarding the second paragraph, I didn't feel it was necessary to put "don't be a purposefully terrible person", but i acknowledge that is an extremely important thing, just below "be alive".  The trope about being able to spot a girl raised without a father from a distance is relatively accurate. People cope with things in different ways, but a few of them end up being common. Childless women in their 30s tend to get cats and drink wine. In their 40s and 50s they push little dogs in a stroller through Costco. Similarly, the number of mentally healthy people with tattoos, piercings, and blue hair is tiny.. The safe bet is that the person has issues you're better off avoiding.  Regardless, this is a generalized list and I believe it is quite accurate even if it includes some snark. I appreciate your comment and the chance to add some additional context!	1641132164.0	hqxnk3l	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hqxiekq	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqxnk3l/

dmt0p	Yes, there are girls, too, but most of them are boys, more than 90 %. Which was my guess - produced by my brain which knows that boys make much better soldiers and guerilla soldiers in particular.  It's not an accident that almost all soldiers we know of during the past 150 000 years or so have been boys and men.  Guerilla soldiers need units whose peak performance level is high. And that means that every member of the unit is top notch. Those who are not will become a burden sooner or later. For purely biological reasons women or girls are seldom so strong and tough that they don't become that burden.   There are other reasons why boys must make a vast majority. You can train your brain by trying to infer them yourself.	1641134268.0	hqxrfc3	t3_ru8pxp	t1_hqxkg0w	/r/MensRights/comments/ru8pxp/i_stumbled_on_a_un_page_on_a_claim_that_40_of_all/hqxrfc3/

4f9df1w6	it's a standard buzzword response.  it's meant to elicit a response from you.  if they resort to this mindless nattering as a gotcha, then acknowledge your logic is sound and the only response they have is to attempt to reduce your argument to an enemy stance.  because if you are the enemy, you must be a man, and men are wrong, see how frail their logic is.  it does not even matter if you are a man or a woman.  acknowledging the *all men* argument is not only wrong, but harmful, should be held by someone who is sound of mind, man, woman, other.  if you hold the view, *all men are evil, and out to get me and opress all women* then you are simply devoid of any rational thought.  I can barely scrape by, I've never been privelidged, in fact being a man has harmed me more than it has ever helped me.  one tiny, tiny example. in the sea of hate towards men, is, I'm a man, in a woman dominated industry.  me and my partner, discussed earlier in 2021 the decision of having a child, after being together for 8 years, and making shocking progress in both of our careers, lives and mental health.  we decided we would, and were blessed to conceive a child, together, planned and we are ready.  I chose not to reveal this to any coworker, boss, supervisor etc.  my partner needed to come in to discuss something with me, while I was at work.  everyone found out on that day, 32 weeks in.  I was bombarded with, "are you married" "was it planned" "typical male, forgot to tell anyone" "is she leaving her job" "what have you done to prepare for the child".  just insane questions, like an interrogation. instead of the celebration of life we wanted, I was ridiculed.  this "pick me" response, is the lowest form of reducing a logically sound stance that men, are treated as monsters, incompetent, or lacking of care and humanhood.  do yourself a favour and leave any conversation relegated to such low levels of ridicule.  be you a man, or a woman.	1641134672.0	hqxs8hy	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqxs8hy/
5pkuorrp	Seems like you didn't even put in the effort to read my previous comment yet again  Since you ignored this before, I'm going to ask again. Give me proof on how the UN is biased. Your whole argument is useless if you can't rebuke this one thing.   And what are you talking about saying that I don't have a data. I do??? I get you are saying that the criminal justice system is biased so the data isn't solid but that's just being ignorant. I said this again before and I'll say it again.  "Just because your point hasn't yet been proven false doesn't mean it's true" You have no evidence to back these claims apart from a few court cases.   I'm going to have to explain this again though because you cant seem to read properly.  You have no proof on how often these defences are used. Your whole argument is placed upon a possibility that females constantly abuse the corrupt defences to get away with murder.   But that's the thing???? You don't know how often this occurs. You have no real evidence here but you constantly act arrogant and superior. You have the nerve to call my evidence fake but you don't provide any yourself. You know you don't have any evidence on how females kill more than men but you still claim this.  I agree that the criminal justice system is biased since men's sentences for their crimes are much harsher than females for the same crime. Here's the crucial thing though.  The bias doesn't affect whether females get charged for their crimes. It affects how harsh the *punishment* not the *charge* that the woman receives.  I genuinely don't get how you can still deny this when the information is so easy to see. Search on Google whether men kill more than women. Your answer will be there.	1641134761.0	hqxsew5	t3_rt3c11	t1_hqvf8jc	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqxsew5/

7f5dxeeo	Adult circumcision does affect sensitivity.  The reason why they say it's better is because they had a legitimate medical issue with their foreskin that caused painful or problematic sex. Also adult circumcision is definitely different then infant circumcision for a variety of reasons. 1 its done way before the human is fully developed. 2 a baby cannot take full anesthesia so its always painful even with a nerve block. 3 the doctor has to guess how much skin to remove. 4 if someone gets cut as an infant their glans start to dry out and keratinize at a very young age so by the time they are older they are calloused. If a man gets cut at 25 he will have roughly 15 years of sex before it fully keratinizes. 5 infant circumcision is non consenting. 6 doctors who perform infant circumcision are less informed about the function of the foreskin compared to doctors who perform adult circumcisions. This sometimes leads to complete removal of the frenulum at birth. Being cut as an infant is the worst time to get cut. They say adult circumcision has more complications. That's only because babies can't talk. Also no one takes a 4 year old seriously when they complain about their infant circumcision so they learn to just deal with it. If you read what the "studies" actually test you will quickly realize why they are flawed. They test sensitivity by poking the penis with a metal poker and ask if its painful. They are not testing how an intact penis feels a warm vagina or how a cut dick feels sexual contact. I am aware I missed a few points but I hope I explained why adult circumcision is better for the owner of the penis lol 😊✌	1641135641.0	hqxu6y5	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hqxkm0j	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqxu6y5/

A false rape accusation effects many people, including those who are in fact actual victims of sexual battery in any form, it should not be taken lightly.  Rape and false rape allegations both need much steeper punishments, but for crying out loud at least start punishing false allegations.

dkyx3t5s	In my opinion and experience, a ton of women do not count emotional support from a close male friend to be cheating. A lot of women do not count talking to another guy to get their emotional fill to be cheating at all. There’s supposed to be reciprocity in a relationship for men and women. If the man is not giving a woman enough emotional support and or “listening” to her enough, then she will go out and get it from someone who will. Often times that leads to a physical need being met eventually. That’s why when a man cheats it’s never ever complicated like that. Dude has an itch to scratch and goes and gets it scratched and still continues to love his woman with all his heart. Woman goes out and gets an itch scratched? It means she’s lost all respect for that dude and there’s no coming back from that.	1641136699.0	hqxwe57	t3_ru7o4z	t3_ru7o4z	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7o4z/why_do_women_cheat_and_blame_men_for_being/hqxwe57/

13cs15mc	Yeah, they have to do that in order to invalidate your opinion. Otherwise it would look bad if other women support men, then they can't use the 'men vs women' argument anymore. It would mean they have to admit that they might be a minority that's just bitter and loves to judge all men based on their own shitty experiences with men (which is usually a function of manifestation, e.g. looking for bad boy characteristics and being surprised they screw you over).  It's not dissimilar to dehumanisation that nazi's applied in the 2nd WW, equating jews to rats. Hopefully it will never get this drastic, but considering the out-of-control existing female misandry groups that are out there now, I wouldn't be surprised if the dehumanisation and demonisation of men (in general) will continue to escalate - as long as it serves the 'internet-feminists' agenda.	1641138166.0	hqxzmmw	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqxzmmw/

That is a good thing in a majority of times you can make dumb decisions. This is just one very unfortunate side effect of it. Your feelings are valid but getting that worked up about something you cannot change anymore is quite pointless. My best guess is that most of the Men's Rights people also wouldn't circumcise their kids for no good reason anyway.

eu1ns	Men prefer women who support their rights.  Feminist concludes the only reason a woman would do so, is because men prefer it, suggesting her own ideas and agency don't exist and she is merely reacting to mens agency.  As the woman begins to articular a reasoned understanding of why mens rights are self-evident, the feminist reacts by calling the woman a man because she dares to have an understanding of mens humanity and begins to articulate it.  The reason is the feminist wants you to have no understanding of it and just hang on to mens arms and go "Whatever you say baby, gosh you're so clever, tee-hee.". This is why they call you a pick me girl. They assume you're not actually interested in any of this shit and simply trying to please men.  When you show you have an understanding of it and support it for moral reasons, the only option they have left is to call you a fake-woman or a woman posing as a man. The alternative would be to *actually engage with the arguments*, which they can't do.	1641141083.0	hqy6jg5	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqy6jg5/

I might be inclined to give the slight edge to girl soldiers due to the psychological effect of being forced to shoot children being amplified when forced to shoot girls, because of male disposability.

Digging back further:  “associated with armed groups and forces totalled 893 in the 2018 report; four times more than the 216 recorded in 2017.  However, as girls are largely used in ‘support’ roles and kept away from frontlines,” (1)  Also note, these relatively small numbers observed must only represent a small portion of all children involved in conflict so there’s no reason to believe this necessarily is true of the whole.    I see two related issues here:  1.  The UN once again focusing on females despite the fact far more boys are recruited to fight in combat.    2.  We should be concerned about any child being forced or coerced to fight.

4jhltni0	I understand that its hard for you to understand my question. Instead of writing and deleting, just stop and think about it. The epiphany may arrive.  Black men are treated equally as white men and all other citizens in USA. They have a constitutional right to equality and are afforded the right to innocence unless proven guilty.   Despite the fact that they are only 15% of the population but commit 50% of the violent crimes in USA the innocent black Americans are not subject to the abolished Jim Crow laws.  Almost all Spanish men, actually only heteresexual males, are all subject to the draconian LIVG laws enacted in 2004.  You are claiming that because more men kill their partners that all men should be subject to anti constitutional laws. Many men have been killed by their partners in Spain and have been subjected to violence, this information is hidden by the authorities.

7o73xhl8	I do criticize male feminists here, but you seem to be from a different breed.     It ultimately comes down to zero-sum game...    A lot of MRA issues like gender-neutral draft, gender-neutral rape/DV laws, punishment for false allegations, family court and custody reforms, exempting non-biological fathers from paying chikd support, etc cut into the 'female privilege'.     Others like banning MGM, male suicides, censoring of online misandry, equal paternity leave, often get some support from feminists. Mainly because it doesn't threaten female privilege...  I dont see how gender-equality can be achieved when society panders to such a biased version of 'equality'.     I don't think there will be a common gender-equality movement ever... As and when society makes peace with fact, we will be able to actually start working towards true equality..	1641143430.0	hqyci8c	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hqx7ic7	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqyci8c/

30ymvhrd	I read the same page. The headline says 40% are girls.   The actual text says up to 40% may be girls which isn’t the same thing.    Digging back further:  “associated with armed groups and forces totalled 893 in the 2018 report; four times more than the 216 recorded in 2017.  However, as girls are largely used in ‘support’ roles and kept away from frontlines,” (1)  Clearly they are counting non combatants as soldiers to create a misleading picture.  Just because someone supports the military effort in some distant way doesn’t make them a soldier.    Digging back even further this number is cherry picked from a single region of the world, and is not representative of global conflict as a whole. (2)    I see two related issues here:  1.  The UN once again focusing on females despite the fact far more boys are recruited to fight in combat.    2.  We should be concerned about any child being forced or coerced to fight.  Why make it a gender issue at all?   1.   https://reliefweb.int/report/world/child-soldier-levels-doubled-2012-and-girls-exploitation-rising    So, the 40% girl soldier headline comes from multiplying  at least 3 biases on top of each other.   First cherry picking one region of the world.   Second, counting girls not involved in combat as soldiers  Third.  Relabeling “as much as 40%” as being 40%.	1641144140.0	hqyedul	t3_ru8pxp	t1_hqyaw8w	/r/MensRights/comments/ru8pxp/i_stumbled_on_a_un_page_on_a_claim_that_40_of_all/hqyedul/

And creating a safe environment for our lil boys and girls who are about to explore the world.   In my opinion this video shows what woke community is truely about. These people think, because they identify as the same gender as a biological one. They have the same rights as such. Its wrong, its faul and shouldn't be allowed. But when anyone stands up to protest against these movements they are cancelled.   We as men should protect our women from this kind of worng ideas and fight for their rights aswell.	1641144568.0	hqyfie5	t3_ruef2z	t3_ruef2z	/r/MensRights/comments/ruef2z/its_about_to_save_the_traditional_relationships/hqyfie5/

dghd027x	First of all thank you OP for the support!   Now getting back to the post. By calling you a pickme they think that it would affect you in the same way it does for men when they are called whiteknights or simp. But the truth is that there are way more incels who are men than women. So, a woman doesn't need to side with the men if her aim is to get "picked up." My suggestion is that you should take that as a compliment if anything. Don't get annoyed by it because that's the best that they could do as even they know the truth, they just want to misguide you into thinking that by going against them you are doing wrong.	1641145862.0	hqyiwd1	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqyiwd1/

4etv6	I have to wonder what exactly is wrong with being a "pickme" girl.   Trying to educate yourself, making yourself cultured, learning how to socialize with a wide variety of men and women, making yourself physically attractive and intelligent, and putting yourself in a position where people of the opposite sex can interact with you, and generally wanting to find a successful relationship are good things.  Same thing goes for men. Learning how to make yourself attractive both physically and socially in the hopes of attracting a mate and then doing it is part of the maturing process for absolutely everyone.  Some people get this idea like they have to dominate their relationship and that they need to be 100% in control, and the other person should do exactly what they think as they think it. That's... not how relationships work.	1641146227.0	hqyjuos	t3_ru0zvy	t3_ru0zvy	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqyjuos/

I'm not saying if you ate poisoned food all food would be poisoned. I'm saying you're ignoring variance.  >97% of the population is heterosexual  Straight up lying. Recent studies show lower rates of heterosexuality than initially thought. About 90%. Turns out when you have bigots telling people they're not normal they tend to come out less. That number will likely decrease further as more people stop feeling like they have to fit in with hateful rhetoric.  Of course there are plenty of tradcon fascists stuck in the past who can't accept variance but most people I've met under the age of 30 tend to see straight through those claims of what is "normal" or not.	1641146846.0	hqylhwl	t3_ru7o4z	t1_hqyjtfl	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7o4z/why_do_women_cheat_and_blame_men_for_being/hqylhwl/

abd5q	Just to clear up a few things and keep the discussion going...        Circumcision is a religious or cultural ritual for many Jewish and Islamic families, as well as certain aboriginal tribes in Africa and Australia.     Circumcision can also be a matter of family tradition, personal hygiene or preventive health care.        Sometimes there's a medical need for circumcision, such as when the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back (retracted) over the glans. In other cases, particularly in parts of Africa, circumcision is recommended for older boys or men to reduce the risk of certain sexually transmitted infections.        Circumcision might have various health benefits, including:        \*Easier hygiene. Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.    \*Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.    \*Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.    \*Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.    \*Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.    \*The risks of not being circumcised, however, are not only rare, but avoidable with proper care of the penis.    Circumcision doesn't affect fertility, nor does circumcision enhance or detract from sexual pleasure for men or their partners.	1641146916.0	hqylook	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqylook/

If you can't make a point without being a liar you have no point.  >MOST women process sex much differently than men. There’s no getting around that. To believe otherwise is just lying to yourself.  Women and men experience things differently yes. But once again you never provided the metric used to measure men loving the partners they cheat on "with all their heart" because you're simply pushing rhetoric. You've just shifted the goalposts deliberately. I never claimed men and women experience sex in the same way and you know it.

9c9zs	There will never be "truly equal" because men and women are not equal in the first place.  Look st the Scandanavian countries.  More done there in those "officially feminist" places to force "equity" than anywhere.  What happened?  With total freedom to do anything they want, with all kinds of programs to get women into STEM and Business courses and all media trying to brainwash them into it, along with those in office and even free day care, the so called "gender wage gap" has increased, not decreased, due to WOMEN'S CHOICES.  This is a study that was done over years.  Left to their own devices, men and women will do vastly different things.  Of course, single motherhood went way up.  People need to understand that it is men who build and maintain societies.  Go out and point at something substantial built by women.  You can't.  But women will sure bring down a society when not restrained.  Look around.  Women contribute ony one thing to society and they know it.  They rail against it and call it "sexist" to say it, but ask any woman what women contribute to society and the answer will always hypocritically be; "We make babies!"  The problem is that they let the FemiNazis convince them that the miracle of life; the very method used to avoid human extinction, makes them "less than" if they do it, when in truth it's the most impressive thing, period and the only thing women can do that truly impresses men and creates respect from, since he can't do it and it is, well, the miracle of life.  But you ladies here keep striving to fail at being men and thinking it makes you "equal".  Just don't complain when you hit the wall and your eggs are drying up and men aren't lining up to wife you up because you were told they'll do that out of "respect for your accomplishments".  But hey, you can (and will) blame men.  I mean, how dare they not go against their DNA when you spent your whole life pretending you could go against yours!

74mshwht	For semantic purposes only then. Let's try this, to draw a parallell. There is no 'Masculinism'  equivalent, so..  Toxic *FEMININITY* (not feminism).  Any person in their right mind has already sharpened their hair-splitting knife, am i right?   Like, have i just implied innate characteristics of the female mind, psyche and personality are toxic? Of course not, i'm talking about gender-specific traits we are all to blame for. Cue squinting meme - *'the patriarchy!'  *It's a framework!!* It's toxic semantics, too loaded a term to serve its liberating ideal. It puts the burden of change, with its gendered specificity, on one 'sex'. And that's an abusive dynamic, anyone who's been a narcissist's punching bag KNOWS you cannot win your enemy over, nor appease them, by 'changing'.  Can you honestly see the concept of 'toxic femininity' through the same rose-colored glasses? Or would you rather have the right to name your own frameworks? History says yes. Femi*nism*.  Honestly, guys are supposed to talk it out and we're forced (quite nobly and insistently) to use loaded catchetism. It's a framework that sets the rules of the debate, and the imposer of that framework sets the rules and kreps the score.

Equality would be:  bust the nuts = break the ovaries.  Break/cut off the dick = Slice out the vagina and sew it up.   That's equality, but society hasn't learned to understand that yet, so they claim that this way of seeing it is unfair, brutal and misogyny, and thus proving they know shit about equality.  If you destroy a mans reproductive organ, you shall destroy a womans too.  If you destroy the tool that is used for the reproduction, you shall do the same to women.

79hemk7t	You know, I'd much rather spend my time doing something productive and healthy but here I am on reddit... Ugh, anyways. So, you know what psychological pain is? Like the kind you feel when a friend betrays you or such. That is pain too. And neurological studies show that the brain handles psychological pain the same as physical, which is why some people faint when hearing a loved one has died. Now get your facts right please. And no pain? Sexual abuse? Bullying? Getting gaslighted by psychiatrists? That isnt enough pain for you? How masochistic are you to consider that much pain "any pain"?	1641153145.0	hqz2sm6	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hqz11oi	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqz2sm6/

9c9zs	I think you may have read it too quick.  I don't like the feminist site "The Guardian" at all!  But in this instance, I didn't get what hou said about it from it at all.  What I got out of it was (paraphrased), "It could have been her abusive father, or she was just evil.  In the end, it doesn't matter.  She did the evil."  In fact they even gave a kind of "she knew what she was doing" attitude, as well as painting her as the typical rich person who pays others to make problems go away.  The part about the men read to me as (again, paraphrased); "It's not right that none of the rich and powerful men aren't also paying for having sex with underage girls!  Let's get them too!"  A sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with.  If you saw something that I missed, then by all means, please correct me.  But that's what I personally got out of it.	1641153160.0	hqz2u57	t3_rtpit2	t1_hqu1x04	/r/MensRights/comments/rtpit2/the_guardian_blames_men_for_ghislane_maxwells_sex/hqz2u57/

It’s possible 30 years there may be a depression epidemic among women in their 40s and 50s because they chose not to have children and are no longer capable. The lady who inspired the main character on sex and the city feel victim to this belief and even confessed to regretting it in an article. I am a fan of Jordan Peterson the arch-nemesis of feminism I am by no means a feminist if you don’t agree with my politics that’s fair i absolutely do not want women disproportionately representing the status quo that would be a nightmare for men.	1641153161.0	hqz2u8q	t3_rstsnd	t1_hqyth4s	/r/MensRights/comments/rstsnd/mens_fascination_with_porn_and_games_is_on_the/hqz2u8q/

Much better and healthier to  get a fair segment of it from friends and family...otherwise far too much pressure on the partner and the relationship,  It becomes co dependency and emotional suffocation and resentment. Getting emotional support from friends is nothing to do with sex or romance,  regardless of the genders involved.  Nothing to do with cheating. I would be only too happy for my oh to get emotional support from friends.	1641153175.0	hqz2vlu	t3_ru7o4z	t1_hqxwe57	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7o4z/why_do_women_cheat_and_blame_men_for_being/hqz2vlu/

79hemk7t	Well, medically, circumsion has many benefits. That is medically, the only downside is losing alot of your sensitivity. BUT, it has many, MANY psychological effects, which makes it qualify as bodily mutilation. And I accept that using sexual abuse as a parellel to this situation was kinda dumb, not kinda but really dumb, but still, it is emotional pain, and it counts as pain.	1641153314.0	hqz39s8	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hqz2rws	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqz39s8/

Seriously, it reminds me of all the radical feminists that shut you down if your opinion is not the same. Even if you state facts. I post my opinion and/or facts which is not meant to harm or insult anyone and all I get is "shut the fuck up" "circumcision fetishist" instead of engaging into an actual debate.  And I want to say now once and for all I have no idea who this guy is, I am not pro circumcision nor anti circumcision. I couldn't care less. But I will stand by my arguments:  Circumcision has health benefits and is often needed for medical reasons. Circumcision is not the same as mutilation. ( OP has also made a comparison to the Holocaust in another post which is insane ) Circumcision on a newborn WITHOUT medical reasons is debatable, and I'm not gonna argue about it.	1641155566.0	hqz9hy1	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hqz7st3	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqz9hy1/

d0kskp4h	Good for you. I’m glad that you are okay with their decision. As for many other men, we are not okay with the decision. I was not okay with having a doctor cut a massive swath of purposeful, functional skin off of my reproductive organ at 2 days old for any reason outside of being medically necessary.

eqqhh7sf	No. Absolutely NOT! Did you know most rape cases don’t get checked out because cops either think the girl is a slut or lying? Did you know that even if it’s been proven that the father isn’t fit to be alone with his children that the courts will STILL allow that child to see him ‘for the best interest for the child’ then wonder why children are killed by the unfit father. Also women still struggle to get constitutional equality, Ending violence against women, economic justice, and reproductive rights and equality. I will not sit here and babysit the facts for you as you’re smart enough to do your own research from a credible source.

She then made false allegations.of.abuse to circumvent the Hague.  In our divorce she admitted no DV and agreed to 50-50.   She then went to CAS (child protective services in Ontario) and they blocked me from my kids for 3.5 years. It was hell. In the end I won and got my kids back half the time and I changed the law for the province because of illegal stuff they did with my ex. But it has severely impacted my relationship with my kids forever.  So I am glad you got full custody because the joint custody route is really hard.

8jur0	Feelings aren't be up for negotiation.  I think you're right to defend them.  However, how you act upon them is up for negotiation.  Using absolutes and extremes can be a sign of emotional immaturity.  Many people (including myself) will sometimes have a knee-jerk reaction to them and be dismissive.  Doubly so when profanity is used.  I'll try not to do that here.  That being said, and open letter in this manner is probably a good way to explore and sort out your feelings.  It's a first step, but not the final step.  I certainly hope you're not at a final step because where you're at now isn't a healthy place.  Consider what you want to achieve.  Is it for change? To inflict damage?  I also can't help thinking the relationship with your parents wasn't in a good place to begin with.    Seeking therapy is my best advice.  Don't take this to mean that what you're feeling isn't justified or abnormal.  It's just that it seems to be effecting you in a way to make you unhappy.  As men, we deserve to have feelings, come to grips with them, and live healthy and happy lives.	1641156808.0	hqzcze2	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqzcze2/

77o6a7cx	Have you noticed a lot of men on these mens rights pages don't actively speak on mens rights but throw out a lot of hate for feminists instead. Every and any time I've visited mens rights pages I see loads of misogyny. That's undeniable. Just like if you were to go to feminists pages you'll see loads of hate for men. That's why as a feminist and an advocate for mens rights, I specifically look for intersectional feminism pages. To the part about blaming it on toxic masculinity, that's not necessarily wrong. Guys take offense when using the term toxic masculinity but fail to realize that's a very big factor in why mens issues aren't taken seriously. Its equivalent to women who don't believe in feminism, and assume men need to act like men and women need to be treated like a princess, in a way where men enforce the idea that men need to act like men and women need to be treated like princesses, because that trait in men has traditionally been known to be considered masculinity.	1641157209.0	hqze4m6	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hqwc02t	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hqze4m6/

Even when I let her down easy she got super abusive and threw fists and kicks with one landing on the balls, I upper cut her into the next life and all her trash friends came running after me and all got knocked down to the ground.

532dt	I think that’s important.  Many of the organizations/structures that once provided a safe outlet for men to get compliments are gone or are greatly reduced.    Another aspect of that is emotional support for men that are clearly having a hard time.  I hear all the time from feminists about how men who are weak are rejected by other men (which they call, among other random things) “toxic masculinity”.  When I was having a really bad time, absolutely zero men gave me any grief for being emotional in public.  Men I barely knew stopped by to talk or offer help.    The big lie is that men do this to each other.  During the same period, no woman that wasn’t related to me wouldn’t communicate at all.  Women are uncomfortable with suffering men, to the point where they will just un-person that man.  No conversation, no eye contact, nothing.  It’s ridiculous, and horrifying, and feminists WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT.  Or even acknowledge it’s a problem.    If you are having a hard time, it’s ok to show it.  You probably won’t get support from the organizations that are supposed to provide it (HR is pretty much exclusively women and almost completely man-hating), but men I worked with were amazingly helpful.  Saved my life.    Everything the feminists say is a self serving and man hating lie.  Once you push past their attempt to overwrite reality, you’ll see there is help.	1641157340.0	hqzei3m	t3_rtycby	t1_hqwwc3l	/r/MensRights/comments/rtycby/in_2022_i_want_to_see_men_holding_women/hqzei3m/

1xdyuxl0	With respect, my man, you have some serious growing up to do. I agree with you generally, and I have not circumcised my sons like I was for very similar reasons, but to feel this amount of vindictive anger over something so _relatively_ minor is ridiculous.  Your feelings are real. They’re also absurd and immature.  If you actually want to effect any sort of real change instead of merely validating your ridiculously out of proportion anger, then this sort of “woe is me” word vomit tantrum screaming at mommy and daddy for something that a large majority of parents in the US choose to do will not get you there. Again, I am someone who agrees and has already taken a couple small steps to change this culturally with my own sons, but I read this and felt nothing but embarrassment for you.	1641158040.0	hqzggiz	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqzggiz/

I briefly researched and apparently some men have issues with sexual pleasure, but what causes it?

2pnondnf	Yes, surgeries without medical purpose are extremely debatable I agree. The same goes for unnecessary circumcision.   Well for example, I'm not going to circumcise my kid unless it is medically necessary. Not because I'm anti circumcision, but because it's just unnecessary.   It's still a fact that there's evidence that circumcisions have health benefits. It's just a fact.  I'm genuinely not trying to chose a side, but seeing these people insult me for stating facts and my opinion which is in no way meant to insult or hurt people is just ridiculous.  So yeah, i'm not getting my son a circumcision until necessary.

ifshx	23 years ago, I was circumcised without my consent. I am not going to talk about if it's right or wrong, as I think that will cause a lot of pain here right now, judging by the comments in this thread so far.  I want to preface this with the fact that your feelings towards this are not very different from mine - but I don't blame my parents for this. My mom isn't a medical professional and made a decision based on the advice of her doctor and that it was what a lot of people were doing. If you are going to be angry, get angry at the system - not your parents.  If they genuinely intended to mutilate you to hurt you, then that's fucked up. But if not, well then I think you have misdirected your anger a little bit. I think a lot of the tension in the male community about this is that SO MANY of us got circumcised during the 80s, 90s and 00s that it's hard to admit that there could be something wrong with us. That's probably why there are so many comments that you feel are gaslighting you.   I think with issues like this, we have to stop putting people on separate teams and actually target societal issues. What is targeting your parents going to do to stop circumcisions for babies? I think you should ease up on your parents because I doubt they had any idea what they were doing. They were fooled by the medical system too in an area that wasn't studied enough.  I hope this doesn't come across as gaslighting, as I agree with you. I just think your anger is misguided. I feel like our stories are pretty similar so I feel like I can talk about this too. I just hate when actual issues like this turn into targeting one another when I doubt any of us really disagree that much.	1641158563.0	hqzhcot	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqzhcot/

3oo1f	As a fellow dad who won full custody, congratulations. I know what you had to go through to get this: congratulations for a hard fought victory against a biased family court system.   > RECORD EVERYTHING: Please invest in a small recording device. (Please check state law with regards to filming) keep it with you at all times in case you run into the parent.  Yes! The best thing we can do to help other fathers before they divorce is to teach them how to document. Also to teach them what qualifies as abuse because most men are being abused and don't know it. Buy a recording device AND a journal.  Your ex's lawyers have a million tools they can use to invalidate a recording or a picture so a judge won't even look at it. But if you have a journal entry to prove you recorded it and the date, then it's harder for her lawyers to invalidate it.  > Do not take to social media to blast the attorney or judge by name during an active custody battle. Ask for advice without making derogatory comments about the other parent, judge, parent, guardian ad litem etc. It will be used against you. Find a trusted confidante that is good at listening because there will be days that you just have to vent and sometimes cry  Yes, never say anything bad about the judge or the courts during the process. Never say anything bad about the other parent in any place that it can get back to them, especially where it can be screenshoted like in social media.   Also, Social media is bad for your mental health after divorce. As a man you're held to a higher standard here. So stay off if it.   Also, get a psychologist because they'll listen as you vent and cry. AND they'll document what was done to you, which if you're being abused, is a form of documentation that is admissible in court.	1641158802.0	hqzhvtn	t3_ruio9u	t3_ruio9u	/r/MensRights/comments/ruio9u/advice_from_a_father_who_won_custody_after_mom/hqzhvtn/

9c9zs	I'm not attacking you when I say this.  I have no emotion about it.  But I must say that you're delusional.  Sorry, but that's what you become when you've bought into a delusion.  In this case it's that there's a way to make the sexes equal.  You tried to temper it with "way more equal" to make room for my "making babies" statement, but we both know what you're after and it just isn't possible.  Nor will saying that "we're individuals" help you.  We're still individual *men* and individual *women*.  And just FYI, it won't do you any good to point to the rare exceptions to the rule and pretend they prove your point.  They don't, by virtue of being exceptions.  We're talking about the 99.5% here.  My apologies if I'm wrong, but by your writing, I'm going to assume that you're female.  That's fine of course, but it explains why you want to see yourself on a man's level, which is a mistake and I'll tell you why.  Because when women try to imitate men and be like men, besides making themselves undesirable to men, they are openly admitting that they themselves believe men to be superior to them.  I'll expain how, but first I'll ask you not to attribute that word to me.  I did *not* say whether it is, or is not my belief.  Rather, I am simply telling you what *women* are saying, without realizing it.  Now as for "how" they're saying it by trying (and failing) to live their lives in a way that imitates men, that's simple:  * You don't try to imitate that which you believe to be inferior to yourself.  That would be stupid.  And it blows apart the claims of women who say they're superior to men, since that would mean that the feminist plan was for women to achieve their own inferiority.  And while I would argue that feminism has made women inferior to women prior to 2nd Wave Feminism, they surely did not think that getting women to try to imitate men would make women inferior or they wouldn't have done it, so my point stands.  * You do not set out to imitate that which you believe you are already equal to.  There would be no point.  It's a lateral move.  * But you do however, attempt to imitate and be like, that which you believe to be superior to yourself, in an attempt to better yourself.  So now, what does that say about "today's woman" (99% of Western women)?  You may not like what it means women are actually saying by trying to imitate men, but saying it they are never-the-less, whether they like it or not and the typical female response of; "Nuh Uh!  And I'm female, so I'm right!"… won't make this fact go away. :-)  Now I'd like you to please, if you would, for a moment, imagine if 99% of men tried to imitate women.  Btw, that also means all heavy work would stop completely and society would break down, since women can't do it (equal?).  But we'll put that aside for my point.  We're going to pretend we're as weak as woman and so we can't do it anymore.  Instead, we'll spend our time at light duty jobs, go shopping, we'll be totally into shoes and purses and want women to pay for dates and buy us flowers and jewelry.  And most importantly, we'll pretend we can have babies and the media will pretend along with us (like they pretend women can do anything men can do) and all women will be publicly pounced on if they dare to disagree and we'll call ourselves superior to women and hit and kick women in the crotch when they get fresh, or just say something we don't like and people will applaud us for it and shout, "You go, boy!  She deserved it!"  How do you think women would react to that?  Do you think they'd be sexually turned on by men behaving that way?  Do you think they'd be eager to marry us?  Not a chance on any of it, huh? :-) Yea, it woud be pretty stupid, huh? :-)  Now you know how men feel about "today's woman".  We're not equal.  Not even close!. In truth, we each have our place, but women have ruined most of that.  Except for anything physically demanding, of course.  So they consider us a lower class now; utilities with wallets for whatever use they wish.  If you want to know the functions of the sexes, go a thousand or two years back.  You will surely respond with today's technology.  But technology doesn't mean we have different DNA, because we have smartphones, etc..  And besides that, women float around in this world today as if everything magically appeared and maintains itself, as they spit on men from the window of their highrise, built and maintained by men, not women.  So just how different is it?  The hard work is still done by men.  The difference is that now they're no longer respected for it and instead are called "toxic" and "sexist" and even "r*pists" just for being born, by the same women who can't survive without them!

Something similar happened to me.  When my son was 3 the custody evaluator told my ex that when my son turns 12 my ex can take me back to court and she'd give my ex full custody.  I must admit my ex wasn't very good at court and bragged about this to me in between hearings.  I kept my mouth shut and when my son turned 12 and my ex took me back to court I told this story and the judge ruled out the old evaluator and I won full custody as my ex was moving and we had 50/50 at that point.	1641161944.0	hqzpw5c	t3_rugdq0	t1_hqzi1yc	/r/MensRights/comments/rugdq0/a_father_in_the_united_kingdom_complained_of_a/hqzpw5c/

He killed him because the trespasser tried to disarm him for the stated purpose of “using” the gun on the homeowner.   2. The argument, from the homeowners point of view, was that the trespasser wouldn’t leave his property. To protect himself, as is his right, he armed himself before asking the trespasser again to leave.  3. What was unnecessary was attacking the homeowner and trying to disarm him. This conflict and the outcome is 100% the decedent’s fault.

k5qcy8	> Circumcision is a religious or cultural ritual    If someone wants to circumcise themself for their religion/culture/tradition, they are absolutely free to do so. They are not free to circumcise *someone else*, eg a newborn. If that newborn grows up and wants to circumcise themself for their own chosen religion/culture/traditions, they are absolutely free to do so. Absolutely free. There is no impediment on the right to practice their own religion on their own body.  Same with hygiene and preventative healthcare.   > Sometimes there's a medical need for circumcision,    > Circumcision might have various health benefits, including:   I recognize the Mayo list.  I think the stats on the items listed by the Mayo clinic sheds great insight.  - Hygiene: We have easy access to water for hygiene. It’s easy to wash body parts.  - Lowers UTI: ["It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision). And UTI’s ["can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss"](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)  - HIV: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) Condoms are an actually effective transmission barriers to STIs and must be used regardless.  - Penile Problems: ["An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)  - Penile cancer: [“Decreased penile cancer risk: NNT = 900 – 322,000”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision). It is incredibly rare.   - Cervical cancer is from HPV which has a vaccine. Which is so effective that (turning to news) ["Australia could become first country to eradicate cervical cancer. Free vaccine program in schools leads to big drop in rates."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer)  These stats are terrible, it's disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits.

Masturbatory pleasure decreased after circumcision in 48% of the respondents, while 8% reported increased pleasure. Masturbatory difficulty increased after circumcision in 63% of the respondents but was easier in 37%.

Let's look at the ratios   ["Masturbatory pleasure decreased after circumcision in 48% of the respondents, while 8% reported increased pleasure."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17155977)  That is a factor of 6 times.  ["Masturbatory difficulty increased after circumcision in 63% of the respondents but was easier in 37%."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17155977)  That is a factor of 1.7 times.

If you suggesting to focus on the no change category, I think the ratios are more important here.  The ‘No change’ answer is kinda its own category and not a very good answer. The ratios of improved vs worse is important. Unchanged (actually all of it) suffers from: Surveys ranking sex on a scale of 1-5 can’t note the nuances of sexual pleasure, we don’t know the time after the circumcision was done, etc.  First ‘unchanged’ is the safe answer immediately after adult circumcision when you are still figuring things out. Eg not sure what to say? Say unchanged. Second, it's subject to all sorts of hopes, wants, social pressure, self-pressure, etc. The better and worse are too, but I think the strongest narrative/hope/etc. is that circumcision has no change, especially now that they did it. Third, the answers can change years after the survey. While this can change for all of them, ‘unchanged’ is the most susceptible because, guess what, things change with time. Both figuring it out, realizations, *long-term effects*, etc.  Back to the ratios, I think improved vs worse are the stronger, more definitive answers. And the ratios are massive.	1641164163.0	hqzvldu	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hqxkm0j	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hqzvldu/

She was jealous of his relationship with me and made stuff up. It caused me (an actual rape victim) so much harm — let alone the psychological damage it inflicted on my boyfriend, himself. I supported him through it and gently suggested therapy. He’s doing a lot better but I still get very panicked and twisty when I think about what she did.  What happened to you is not that rare. You were not just unlucky, you were a victim, and you were hurt. You will move through this, but give yourself plenty of time to process what happened to you. Your friends who turned on you do not deserve the privilege of knowing you.  You are strong and more resilient than you know. And it’s totally understandable that you don’t feel like that now.   Message me if you ever want to talk. My heart goes out to you.	1641165364.0	hqzymjh	t3_r2g1jd	t3_r2g1jd	/r/MensRights/comments/r2g1jd/i_cannot_get_false_accusations_out_of_my_mind_and/hqzymjh/

evsusrl	That is one I absolutely cannot agree with. Men can be feminists, and I hate their ideology just the same, I don't hate it less because they're a man. Your line of thinking you just said implies all women are a monolith, and that all women agree with feminism... seems sexist to me.   I don't look at people through a group identity lens, all people are individuals. I don't hate anyone based on their immutable characteristics.   I hate ideology, especially one's used for pernicious motives and in hurtful ways.   You will never agree I'm sure, but the ideology (or at least what it has become) I find absolutely abhorrent and evil; and that is not because "a few horrible people", but what the very foundation the ideology is based upon. (To be clear, I am not talking about first or even second wave feminism).  Not to mention, a huge proportion of feminism is what you've described as a "few".  I think it is a hateful sexist movement; and that has absolutely zero bearing on how I feel about women or men. I'm not sexist, despite you implying I am. I'm an egalitarian.   You see, you just so casually said a blanket statement about all men, and you painted me and many others with a horrible brush, implying I'm sexist because I hate a specific ideology.   I would never do that to you, nor even a feminist. Like I said, I hate the ideology, not the proponents of it.   Perhaps you should ask WHY some men are quick to hate feminism, and perhaps you should actually LISTEN to their reasons. I mean listen to understand, not listen to respond.   You will not get anywhere in your understanding of men's rights, or even feminism, if you simply look at it through a lens.   Just my two cents.	1641165955.0	hr004tz	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hqzxqov	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hr004tz/

77o6a7cx	I believe feminism is exactly what it is defined in the dictionary to be, not what you've interpreted it to be over many years and waves of feminism. I won't define feminism by what is clearly not feminism. The double standard here is amazing. If I were to keep the same logic you apply then I wouldn't advocate for mens rights specifically because I've been treated like crap by men my whole life, because a lot of men who actively advocate for mens rights openly perpetuate misogyny. When I join mens rights groups, I am harrassed for talking about mens issues, I am hated on for just being a women with a voice whether that voice fights for men or not. Does that mean I let that completely diminish my stance on misandry and mens rights? I won't hold Mens Rights accountable for the ideals of a lot of misogynistic guys. So why is it okay for men to do the same with feminism? Women who aren't feminists don't want to be treated equally. Doesn't mean I won't treat them equally, but they also perpetuate the oppression of women and by not wanting equality, also the oppression of men. I don't see how that is sexist.	1641166696.0	hr020r8	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hr004tz	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hr020r8/
2mmrzff1	> Women can grape men  Not how society nor the law of many countries see it. In England rape is defined by unconsensual pentration with a penis. In Switzerland it's unconsensual penetration of a vagina.  > Most acts of violence are towards women from men as well as men on men violence.  And that changes what? Men face more physical violence. Why should women be... above men?  > unless you were a white man you’ve never had to worry about voting or being heard  White as in Anglo Saxons. So about 10% of the USA. Germans, Spanish, Portguese, French, Swiss, Italian, Greek, basically all Scandinavians but a few on the coast were **all not white**. In most countries the common men could not vote until around 100 years before women could. That means that for over 2000 years, men couldn't vote either.  > There are plenty of women in college and training right now to dominate those ‘hard labor fields of work’… my generation of females work just as hard as men  No they don't and they can't. Most women do not have the physical capacity of the average men. And all those jobs are still heavily dominated by men.  > And yes unfortunately men do get mutilated at birth, which should be changed and honestly is declining as new generations are born  No, they are not.

46a6opwn	This sort of advice is unhelpful because it doesn't mention anything about age and foreskin retractability and may encourage forcing because of unrealistic expectation.  [https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact\_sheets/Penis\_and\_foreskin\_care](https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Penis_and_foreskin_care/)/ and h[ttps://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline\_index/The\_Penis\_and\_Foreskin/](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/The_Penis_and_Foreskin/) are more informative.  Whilst it is technically easy to do, when to do it relies on a boy's "natural" development.  &#x200B;  >Most young boys will frequently touch or play with their penis. This is a    normal part of their development and how they learn about their body.    Once the foreskin is ready to be retracted, your child will probably    discover this for themselves.  The problem can be some parents who believe it is wrong for children to play with their genitals and actively discourage this practice, leading to delayed development and subsequently issues.  We hopefully don't leave adolescents to accidentally discover sex or develop shame around exploration because of lingering Victorian attitudes: we educate them in advance. However, for some reason, we seem to be squeamish about educating younger children about their bodies, leaving it to chance and "natural" development.  There is a worrying trend of women making decisions about mens bodies because of their own personal preference: thinking foreskins are "yucky" and circumcised is better, or objecting to male erections or male sexual expression when it is not their place or body to be making changes any more than it is for men to be wanting to coerce change in women's bodies to suit their own personal tastes. Most concerningly, this extends to circumcision of boys (although Female Genital Mutilation is frowned upon and criminalised). I think women are confusing personal choice and its consequences, with entitlement to change/coerce someone else to meet personal choice.  I personally believe it is time for rights to bodily sovereignty to be enshrined in legislation to make it a criminal offense to invade a persons "envelope" or use their tissues without consent, except in circumstances of genuine accident. Part of this right to bodily sovereignty should include education about one's body so that development is not simply left to chance discovery, or worse, malicious or selfish obstruction or destruction.	1641167967.0	hr0576s	t3_rudrg6	t1_hqz690l	/r/MensRights/comments/rudrg6/cut_dad_looking_for_teaching_materials_for_intact/hr0576s/

4zyym	> being able to vote  This old canard. In Britain women were always allowed to vote in local elections, the same as men. For the national government fewer than 5% of the population had a vote in 1850. Full female suffrage was granted within 10 years of full male suffrage but without the obligation to do military service. That advantage alone outweighs everything else.  > work  So if this were true, it amounts to saying that men had to do ALL the work, hardly a privilege.  > open a bank account  you may be referring to married women. Because husbands had a non-reciprocal obligation to support their wives and pay their debts and because wives could not be held accountable as individuals, they needed their husbands to countersign in some dealings. This, is, once again, a reflection of female privilege.  > our husbands were legally allowed to rape us  simply not true.  You have been the victim of historical feminist revisionism.

4b5zd12y	Idk, I'd have to see the statistics on women who commit violent crimes, then go on to resist arrest vs men. From what I remember seeing women commit more burglary type crimes, meaning they are more likely to be persecuted in court than shot in a confrontation. But, they get easier court sentences, so I would see why they would want it to go to court.  I disagree with it being a race, or gender issue. The statistics speak for themselves.	1641168716.0	hr071w1	t3_ruldsp	t3_ruldsp	/r/MensRights/comments/ruldsp/police_brutality_is_mens_rights_issue_in_addition/hr071w1/
a6lkv	There's three intersecting reasons why a male hormonal contraceptive hasn't been done yet. The first is that men suffer less physically from pregnancy, so there's stricter standards on the side effects. The second is that female hormonal contraception works on an existing cycle where the male side is more like a production line. It's harder to interrupt the production line. And lastly, because female hormonal contraceptives also can be used to treat or minimise other issues with the reproductive system, where there's no such side benefits of a male hormonal contraceptive.  The most promising male contraceptives are not hormonal at all. There's the use of a spermicidal gel injected into the vas deferens to create a truly reversible version of a vasectomy, and there are two I have seen recently that use the fact that the testicles are outside the body and sperm cells are weaker than most cells in order to damage them inside the testicles.	1641168722.0	hr072fd	t3_rtomgw	t1_hquox0o	/r/MensRights/comments/rtomgw/when_will_women_have_to_subsidize_male_health/hr072fd/

bcqa7	Not to take away from anything you feel (because it is valid and well reasoned). Here it isn't too common for guys to have the snip unless they need it, but lots of kids have it done later in preteens without a problem.  I ended up having mine done for medical reason as a teenager. What they don't tell you is that if you have it done after puberty has started the pain you stuffer after the procedure for weeks is insane. I have a condition that causes me constant pain but I was not prepared for the suffering I went through. All I can say is that I truly wish I wasn't given the choice as a preventative measure.  Your view point is perfectly valid but some of the guys I have met who are upset about it don't know about these kinds of outcomes.  PS. Curse that nurse in the hospital who straight after the operation said I wasn't in pain I just had a pride issue. I hope it was ignorance on her part that she didn't realise that puberty complicated the procedure greatly.	1641169124.0	hr081xe	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hr081xe/

30ymvhrd	Whites are shot by police more than whites but blacks are shot more as a percentage of their relative population.    A thing to keep in mind with both race and gender is correlation alone does not prove discrimination.    Men do commit more violent crime than women and blacks do commit more violent crime than whites proportionally.   Still when one looks at the enormous disparity as shown  on the OPs graph as well as other information it’s hard to write off all that disparity to the fact men commit more crime.   I think it’s no great secret that police are overall more reluctant to shoot a woman than a man.	1641169639.0	hr09av2	t3_ruldsp	t1_hr02cmz	/r/MensRights/comments/ruldsp/police_brutality_is_mens_rights_issue_in_addition/hr09av2/

Even used the word “tripe” girl i know u learnt that word recently and have been using it ever since to look smart LMAO. But okay lets look up a article on female hypergamy shall we? “The fact that women are naturally hypergamous means that it’s in her biology to look for a man that she “looks up to” in some way.“ Not just looks its more of a man=dominant things its the same as men looking for submissive woman or their “hero instinct” dipshit. It has nothing to do with looks or this arguement “Not all men are born with good looks. And not all men are wealthy.  The goods news?  Because of female hypergamy, it gives guys without good looks or wealth a chance.  Looks and wealth are can be a hypergamous factor, but they’re not the only ones.  There are other ways we can use female hypergamy to our advantage.  Here are some qualities that women find attractive in men.  You can work on these traits to give yourself a chance to meet the woman of your dreams.“ The first trait in the article is surprise! surprise! LEADERSHIP which ties into what? CONFIDENCE.

evsusrl	I'm very sorry you've experienced such vitriol and disrespect from men in your life, no one deserves such maltreatment.   Frankly, I don't even believe you're listening to what I'm saying in this very instance... You haven't come into the discussion with one ounce of interest in understanding, nor have you extended a single olive branch.   Three sentences in and you've declined to steelman my argument, and also haven't acknowledged half of what I said. Then, condescendingly imply I'm basing my argument on "my interpretation of it", though I'm basing it on my study of the ideology, as well as the literal tenets of it. I can cite that if you like?  But perhaps I'm expecting too high of a level of debate here.   The dictionary definition is practically irrelevant to me, as it is with many other ideologies. Do I go off of how something is "defined" or what it results in?   Communism sounds great on paper, based on the dictionary definition; but it's resulted in a hundred million deaths.   Christianity sounds great on paper, but its resulted in this massive amount of deaths as well. It doesn't mean it's good inherently nor bad inherently, I'm simply going off of what it results in.   Feminism is based upon the theory that western culture is an oppressive tyrannical Patriarchy. This is not something I can condone whatsoever. The very center tenet of the ideology is based on a pernicious lie.   A lot of MRA's don't hate feminism because of how they're treated by women, they hate feminism for the movement and ideas behind it.   Okay. You claim you're hated on by "a lot" of MRA's "just for being a woman with a voice"... Well, I know plenty of women that come into Men's Rights spaces that aren't hated on... Have you considered that it's because of your lack of acknowledgment or willingness to understand, instead of just assuming those MRA's are sexist?   "Women who aren't feminists don't want to be treated fairly."   Yeah, there is the condescension. That's about enough for me. You're not even implying it anymore; you are outright saying so many women, many of whom I love and hold in high regard, are simply incompetent and weak because they don't agree with you or an ideology.   I had high hopes for this discussion, but I'm afraid it's devoid of an actual point now.   If you'd like to revisit this discussion later, I'd be open to it. But for now, I've got bigger things to deal with.   Beat of luck to you and yours.	1641171079.0	hr0ctav	t3_ru0zvy	t1_hr020r8	/r/MensRights/comments/ru0zvy/youre_a_pick_me_girl/hr0ctav/

After resuscitation and bleeding control in the operation room, the patient developed with sudden cardiac arrest and expired. In conclusion, we suggest that the circumcision procedure should be performed at least by a qualified, experienced medical practitioner."     "Parents of a 5-month-old boy took him to the hospital with complaints of purulent discharge around the penis, bleeding, and amputation of the distal part of the penis after ritual circumcision two days ago. A local non-qualified traditional person had used the Mogen clamp technique to circumcise the boy. Before the procedure, no antibiotics were prescribed. It was also done without the use of an anesthetic. The patient’s vital signs were unstable when he arrived (blood pressure: 60/30 mmHg, respiratory rate: 28 respirations per minute, pulse rate: 150 beats per minute). He was very pale and agitated. "     Uggh, they "suggest" a medical professional is the only one that should be able to cut open a boy for no reason but tradition? How about protect these boys and require it!

Less likely to injure the eye or the arm, less likely chance of getting an eye infection or skin cancer on the arm, or bones cancer. Now have to clean the arm.  Men are upset because they had part of their genitals cut off for no reason, their bodily rights were thrown out the window and there penises left scarred and dried. You bringing up these questionable benefits that have been shown not to be true and or be as beneficial as pro cutters claim is making these men upset because you are trying to give a reason as to why it was good it was done to them.  It was not good, it was mutilation of the flesh just as FGM is.

Obviously the age(s) of the child(ren) matters... But for the most part, it's literally one of the easiest things a person can do.  "Keeping house" takes like 60min max of work a day. Pleasing someone else (especially someone you love) isn't a chore, it's not work. It's fucking easy. You can easily get 4 hours to yourself, every day, if you want.

80nlpb6x	No mine kidnapped my kids, tried to alienate me, then when caught and I won in court she changed her name and disappeared to a new city under a new identity.  And the court allowed.it because she is a woman. And of course no make up for lost time with the kids and I had to find my kids by tracking the transfer of their student records.  My ex routinely calls authorities and makes false allegations but they never charge her with making a false report. And when she fails to follow the court orders and I file for contempt the courts answer is well it isn't that bad.  I was like....well when your kids are stolen from one country to another and your ex changes her names and takes off with the kids again and then violates every rule and everyone believes her and not you despite it being on court record and admitted in email etc then what would you do as a dad your honor?  His response was...well I don't have that problem...contempt dismissed.   How I love joint custody when one parent does anything they want and the other parent being me is villified when I did nothing wrong....  Not bitter...just realistic.  I swear my case should be a life time movie. In Canada the authorities were so convinced by her it took 10 years to get my kids immigration records and it now proves that she committed immigration fraud and my kids should never have been there.  Saddest thing is a member of Parliament helped her commit the fraud and the government new and pushed it through....

Do you have data on bisexual ipv vs heterosexual - I'm saying its wrong but I'm interested.  Other possible explanations is that they may not be working towards the legal definition of DV (which I'm not sure atm what it definitely includes) but it could also include from other family members (unusual to include them but not impossible).

eqqhh7sf	1 in 4 women experience violence in relationships compared to 1 in 9 men. Women and children definitely get to be on the short end of the stick when it comes to violence. Now as far as voting. You’re really reaching as every damn person is a colonizer from the beginning. In 1776- only ppl who owned land and over 21 could vote. In 1787- only white male landowners can vote but states made their own laws In 1790- only free white men can vote and become a naturalized citizen In 1792- almost all free white men can vote regardless of owning land In 1807- women and black people aren’t allowed to vote any longer. Only tax paying white men can vote. In 1848- anti-slavery and womens rights activists unite to rally for their voting rights and freedom from the white men In 1848- Mexicans are now legal US citizens in the US territory but they can’t vote and it was heavily and violently enforced In 1868- former slaves are granted citizenship In 1870- votes can’t be denied bc of race so white men decided to put them black peoples thru the ringer and so ultimately they couldn’t vote In 1872- women TRY to vote. One women arrested and another turned away from the voting booth In 1876- indigenous people can’t vote In 1882- Chinese can’t be American In 1890- Wyoming is the first state to legislate voting for women in its constitution In 1920- women can FINALLY vote!  100 years you say? More than that. Also by white men I mean the men who were white which were all.

fk339	" Men and women are at war with each other "  &#x200B;  Sounds like America's gender wars.  Thought I read somewhere that it's Russian propaganda bots spreading misinformation and causing chaos among ignorant/ young/naive people.    Something like 75k facebook articles or comments daily or something like that is Russian bots and fake conversations or information.   And fake or not, the ideas stick in their heads.   EXAMPLE: Could be as simple as a girl talking about her abusive boyfriend and throwing a bunch of relatable content into a fake story and making women despise men, then rinse and repeats of fake stories over and over, and women start fearing men because everything they read is about these monsters that are made up fake stories, then that mixed with real domestic abuse stories and the whole thing gets momentum and grows.   Then all kinds of momentum, Hollywood sex scandals, Inequality, Equal pay, for every real story there are like 50 fake ones to keep it constantly in the background on media platforms and the whole thing feeds itself.  Also remember some spy or rogue spy saying something a long long time ago that this was what they were working on, some mind control information wars or something, I know it all sounds tinfoil hat crazy, but I saw a post on Reddit a few minutes ago that kind of captures the idea of how we are being manipulated in the most simple ways, though nowadays it's way more advanced.  It's like the simple-minded propaganda used to promote the movie "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”, 1953.  Link below.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/rukv02/brunettes\_and\_redheads\_protesting\_at\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/rukv02/brunettes_and_redheads_protesting_at_the/)  When you think about something this simple and then think how much of what you see nowadays is fake or being used to manipulate what you perceive as reality.  Is scary!  anyways, crazy how this manifested over the past 20 years and blew up with the internet and allowed easy access to create chaos in society without firing a single shot.	1641175536.0	hr0niyf	t3_rug6bs	t1_hr06bmq	/r/MensRights/comments/rug6bs/the_new_political_cry_in_south_korea_out_with_man/hr0niyf/

30ymvhrd	The definitions of patriarchy (political) I’ve read are very similar to your definition number 1, which means we don’t have a patriarchy.     Women can and do run for political office, women have equal voting rights, in fact there are more women voters.   Feminism has a much stronger lobby than MRAs.  We don’t see government passing laws that advantage men as we see in a patriarchy, we have many laws advantaging women.     Since we don’t live in a patriarchy any feminist premise based on a patriarchy or patriarchy theory is a argument based on a false premise.   Anyone who discusses a post made on a false premise is validating the incorrect premise.  People should simply refuse to discuss any such point until feminists remove the false patriarchy premise.    The Bailey as you call it simply isn’t an example of patriarchy, so again one should simply call feminists in this false definition.     Related, demographic representation and to be represented politically are not the same thing.  Feminists conflate these for agenda reasons.    Constituents are represented by the politician they elect to represent them.   Female voters often chose to vote for male politicians to elect them.     So, the feminist argument is basically saying when women choose a male to represent them they aren’t really represented because the representative is male.   This is nonsensical.  If you elect a representative, you are represented.  It’s like saying if I have brown eyes someone with blue eyes can’t represent me.	1641176830.0	hr0qlu9	t3_rupeuw	t3_rupeuw	/r/MensRights/comments/rupeuw/the_motte_and_bailey_of_the_patriarchy/hr0qlu9/

Secondly, the onus is on the party making a claim, so, they'd have to prove that men as a class use this 'power' to oppress women.

k5qcy8	> There are a ton of studies of normal adult males given circumcision in Africa to see if it would reduce rates of HIV transmission  Ah I think you're referring to the Kenya and Uganda studies. Well you gave the conflict of interest right in your sentence. They were pressured to get circumcised for HIV reasons and *then* asked if there was a downside.   Here is the [Kenya survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042320/). And we have the [Uganda survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18086100).  The following applies to both surveys:  These surveys were done only two years after circumcision. Both tacked on to the end of an HIV study. So the people were pressured into getting a circumcision for HIV benefits and then asked if there was a detriment. Surely you see the conflict of:  1) Being pressured to undergo a procedure for health benefits, and *then* being asked if there’s downsides.  2) These are 5 point surveys, a pretty terrible way to note the complexity and nuances of sexual pleasure.  3) With a language barrier to boot.  4) The skin and glans were protected for 20+ years, and then exposed for only up to 2 years. Leading to,  5) Applying data from adult circumcisions to newborn circumcisions is overextending the data. That’s two years and one year of glans and foreskin remnant exposure compared to ~16-18 years for newborn circumcision before their sex life *starts*.  The Kenya study even reveals the first conflict with one of their questions, that most "feel more protected against STIs". Unfortunately, [“greater endorsement of false beliefs concerning circumcision and penile anatomy predicts greater satisfaction with being circumcised.“](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320719227_False_beliefs_predict_increased_circumcision_satisfaction_in_a_sample_of_US_American_men)  Kenya also circumcises as a rite of passage. From a different study: [“The fact that circumcision is traditional in most Kenyan populations is likely to create a major cultural bias. Circumcision is considered a rite of passage in Kenya and distinguishes man from boy. This probably biases how men perceive sexuality.”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11761.x)  From another paper discussing the Kenya study: [“these extremely high scores for sexual satisfaction are dramatically out of line with baseline estimates of sexual satisfaction in many other places in the world [12], and that the ‘rates of sexual dysfunction [reported in these studies] were 6 to 30 times lower than [those] reported in other countries,’ ... **Thus, it is either the case that Sub-Saharan Africans ‘are having the best sexual experiences on the planet’ or the surveys used to assess sexual outcome variables in these studies were insensitive and flawed.**“](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274710223_Does_Male_Circumcision_Adversely_Affect_Sexual_Sensation_Function_or_Satisfaction_Critical_Comment_on_Morris_and_Krieger_2013)  >They have done other studies that show that there is nothing special  Vague handwave to studies, please substantiate your claim.  >Tons of men have adult circumcision and notice no difference.   Another vague handwave to studies, please substantiate your claim.  Sorry to point out, we are not duelling studies. I have given studies and you have not.  Perhaps you'd like the histology:   “The prepuce”  [“The prepuce is an integral, normal part of the external genitalia, that forms the anatomical covering of the glans penis and clitoris.”](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1034.x/abstract)  [“**The prepuce is primary, erogenous tissue necessary for normal sexual function.** The complex interaction between the protopathic sensitivity of the corpuscular receptor-deficient glans penis and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the male prepuce is required for normal copulatory behaviour.”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1034.x)  [“The **glans** penis is primarily innervated by free nerve endings and has ... cruder, poorly localized feelings (including pain, some temperature sensations and certain perceptions of mechanical contact). In the glans penis, encapsulated end-organs are sparse, and found mainly along the glans corona and the frenulum. In contrast, the male **prepuce** ridged band at the mucocutaneous junction has a high concentration of encapsulated receptors. The innervation difference between the protopathic sensitivity of the glans penis and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the prepuce is part of the normal complement of penile erogenous tissue.”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1034.x)	1641178041.0	hr0thtk	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hr0n627	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hr0thtk/

ch81q55l	Majority of people killed by cops in the US could have easily been arrested. In fact, majority of the people killed by police are unarmed. Like I said in my original post, there are men who have been killed simply for having a mental breakdown. The cops get called, and they see a man experiencing a breakdown, and assume he must be threatening and violent. That's what this post is about; police seeing men as disposable, and more threatening due to their gender. Everyone knows about police brutality, and we all know the number of people killed by police could be reduced, and part of the issue is stereotypes of the male gender.	1641179641.0	hr0x6ns	t3_ruldsp	t1_hr0w87p	/r/MensRights/comments/ruldsp/police_brutality_is_mens_rights_issue_in_addition/hr0x6ns/

It was not NOW that tried subjecting women to the equality of selective service, it was Marc Angelucci with the NCFM.      Feminism invented the tender years doctrine to give women the right to custody in a divorce, then invented child support to push the custodial responsibility to financially support children back FROM the newly custodial mothers back to the noncustodial fathers. and feminism has repeatedly fought against default shared custody bills. actions speak louder than words feminisms actions are blatantly female supremacist, not egalitarian.	1641179652.0	hr0x7iv	t3_rs8weo	t1_hr0o8m3	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8weo/i_just_watched_encanto_and_i_think_disneys/hr0x7iv/

My oldest daughter was aware enough to realize that the situation was( scared to the point she hid in the back seat floorboard of the car). But my youngest was in the car with my parents who were assaulted and my father was attacked by my ex-wife's mother.

The bigger issue here is that (even with criminals), police play the judge jury and executioner. Even if a man is resisting arrest, the police have tools to arrest him instead of killing him. Female criminals are apprehended in a very different way.	1641181056.0	hr10dxh	t3_ruldsp	t1_hr0yif0	/r/MensRights/comments/ruldsp/police_brutality_is_mens_rights_issue_in_addition/hr10dxh/
hwethzuc	Women and men play by different rules.  When a woman makes a generalizing statement about men, her feelings are valid and based off her experiences. When a man makes a generalizing statement about women, he's an incel.  When a woman encourages violence against men, it's harmless venting and justifiable. When a man encourages violence against women, he's an incel.  When a woman swears off men because she simply dislikes them, she's an independent queen to be showered with praise. When a man swears off women, he's an incel.  I'm not defending any of the above behaviors. Generalizing, encouraging violence, and promoting hatred against any group is wrong, or at least it should be wrong for everyone. But after feminists made up special "the rules don't apply to me" terminology (see: "punching up"), it's impossible to argue. Men just have to walk on eggshells.

Taking the foreskin off of your penis is akin to removing all of your fingernails and toenails. Doing so would greatly reduce the risk of infection, and help you keep your hands clean and dirt free! The only problem is, it’s not fucking necessary to do that if you know how to wash your hands. Same thing goes for penis hygiene.   For your argument about STDs: The only thing that reduces the risk of STDs is by wearing a condom or not having sex. Cutting off your foreskin has no fucking benefit to reducing STDs.

63k24p6f	I completely disagree with OP. I feel that way about women and its for good reasons and I think OP just hasn't considered some of those kinds of scenarios. If I get to feel that way then so do women. I think the important distinction is whether someone does something to you AS the thing which you are fearing.. Or whether they do it and the thing which you are finding yourself scared of is something that is only coincidental. Many things are coincidental and not intrinsically related to the nature of the harm that is done. so for example, it is not right to blame yellow birds because a yellow bird shit on your head but it is fair enough to be worried when a bird flies over your head because birds poop but yellow birds don't poop by virtue of their being yellow. They poop by virtue of being birds.  So if a woman is afraid of men because she got raped, she isn't being bigoted towards men, she is reacting to the reality that men are the gender that generally wants to have sex with her gender and therefore rape is a thing that men can and will.occasionally do to a woman. Likewise, most men don't exactly fear being falsely accused of rape by another guy because it's a bit unusual. Whereas you come on r/mens rights and you see tons of stories of women doing that to men. Then when a woman falsely accuses you its like "oh shit, this is something that women can do to hurt me". Now that being said if a gay guy rapes you then you might fear being alone around a gay guy in the future. Is it bigotted? Not neccesarily. I mean it could be bigoted if you otherwise have a predilection for hating gay people. But it isn't necessarily bigotted. Slot of people might think so but it could be as simple as getting PTSD when you are around a gay guy because it reminds you of the guy that raped you or something. its all very contextual and multifaceted. You could be the biggest fan of big bird ever but if big bird comes and rapes you and shits on your head I bet the next time you see a dude in a yellow bird costume you are gonna run the other way.	1641184602.0	hr182m6	t3_ruqxir	t3_ruqxir	/r/MensRights/comments/ruqxir/the_im_allowed_to_distrusthate_men_because_of_my/hr182m6/

30ymvhrd	I like your analogies.  If you switch the demographics to any demographic other than male the discrimination is clearly bigoted and the same should apply to men.   Regardless of the demographic, the rational makes no sense.  To hold all men guilty for the actions of another man is a guilt by association that’s irrational.   I don’t control and am nit responsible for the actions of other men.    Is rational and justified to hate everyone with brown hair because Hitler had brown hair?

9yrpo0xl	The WW2 thing is already debunked. That pope manipulated Hitler in order to move allied soldiers and Jews through the church system, and is now credited in having saved 864,000 Jews because of these actions. American Council of Jewish Scholars corroborates the credits. And the descendants of those Jews came out decades after and made a supportive statement and asked the Hitler's Pope people if they'd pls f**k off.  So the Hitler's Pope story now falls in the realm of alien lizard people anal probing tractorbeamed rural US residents, Bill Gates injecting nanobots in covid vaccines, and Elvis having a baby in South America.  But we don't need tinfoil hats to back the OP, sure. Do you remember reading when a bishop in Dubrovnik thought cats hosted witches and banned them, introducing the Black Plague to Europe via the newly multiplied rats?  Or the banning of the tango because of its development among male prostututes in Argentina?   These amd other misapplications come and go all the time. And there will likely be an apology or qualification for this too in the future. Women are not angels, and they don'tmerit belief above other members of society. They constantly demonstrate themselves capable of the same evil as men in about the same rates as men.   And the church is not the architect of western society, despite their notions otherwise. A partner maybe, but they've been used by secular forces for centuries.   This latest expression reads like nothing more than pressure to manufacture the matriarchy. Our collective dignity is not tiered and no one in our society exists to be hit by another.   By the way, interesting recent development in South Korea. Think it will catch on?

What bothers me most about it is the fact that it’s not even medically necessary. Hospitals profit off of our foreskin.   In fact, we’re not broken at birth. It’s not a defect. There are no substantial health benefits. Circumcision creates an enormous risk to erectile dysfunction, nerve damage, and surgical complications. 100 babies a YEAR die from a botched circumcision.   The reasons for doing it? Religion, hygiene, and tradition. All 3 of which do not justify MUTILATING GENITALS AT BIRTH. All 3 reasons are BULLSHIT. Hygiene most of all.

It isn't the Pope's job to decide who goes to heaven.	1641186410.0	hr1bmty	t3_rui5bq	t1_hqzmgwa	/r/MensRights/comments/rui5bq/great_now_the_popes_at_it/hr1bmty/

e13pa32v	For guys who don't know, this is an Indian boy, some girls on the internet trolled him and harassed him I guess... All other girls followed suite and then bashed him online, posting Instagram stories... He couldn't hold it anymore, and then he suicides... The girls who posted stories never accepted their wrongdoings by posting stories correcting the real plot, the main culprits did the same, its just that they played the victim card too... No media outlet in India, be it left wing or right wing, showed anything about him.... They sidelined and said feminism has nothing to do with all this, and a new term "Pseudofeminists" was used to belittle those culprits (only as a gimmick so real feminist leaders couldnt be questioned)  Since then, countless such things have happened...  The boy Manav was a 17 year old, just like i am currently, and his dad has been asking for justice everywhere, since many years, yet no success... Wherever videos are of Manav Singh, you see only 1-2 female comments in 1000s of comments on men in the comment section of YouTube...   The main leaders play the sympathy cards that women suffer more and that females are less due to "female infanticide", which actually perhaps is an outdated thing, it doesn't happen now, actually, this year, number of females here overtook men (maybe due to COVID and men working in the frontline, plus suicides and accidents)  Still no outrage... Here, the rape laws are heavily biased for females against men, like there are 49 special laws for women, not even 1 for men... The rape accusations are majority false here... At a whopping 80% false rape accusations....   India is a hugely corrupt, pussy whipped, vote bank politics country, and these dumb women (majority) are their biggest vote banks, and men are their major cash cows...	1641189203.0	hr1go6t	t3_rupjdu	t3_rupjdu	/r/MensRights/comments/rupjdu/manav_singh_suicide_and_the_quest_of_a_father_for/hr1go6t/

1kcc8jns	I agree with you, but in an opposite sense on that last point.  Women distrusting men or people because of past experiences, is the same as a man doing it.  I would argue the real problem here is that women are allowed (In society, just generally speaking) to have this type of response, but if a Man has it?  He's an asshole and misogynistic?  So I agree, but I think being weary or distrustful based on experiences is arguably a good thing, and different from hating them, which I would disagree on, you shouldn't hate anyone based on a previous persons actions.  I just agree in general with your statement, because Men should also be given support and encouragement when they have the same issues women do.  As for the top 3, those are really more broad I think, but still fall under the same idea.    Your personal experience with being robbed should be given support and encouragement, color of skin shouldn't even be a part of the discussion per se, as it has no bearing or meaning to what actually occurred, you were mugged at knifepoint by a person.  It would be completely normal reaction for you to fear being mugged again, and this one I'd say hating it is valid even too.    You lost a person due to terrorism, which comes in many forms and from many religions depending on your perspective, distrusting terrorism is what you're doing, not a religion.  (Don't get me wrong, some people do translate this into straight bigotry, I'm just saying you don't have to, we're better than that)  Most importantly, you're a survivor of domestic abuse, it is not bigoted to distrust women, hate yes, but being a bit more careful is always going to be in the back of your mind.  The same could go if you were Bi-sexual, you could lose trust in men AND women.  It doesn't mean you should hate them, just learn from the experience, and get support and encouragement where needed.  Equal rights is about equal rights across the board, instead of thinking it as their bigotry is valid, it's not.  It should be about the support and encouragement you get for being wronged by whatever happened.  Distrust follows afterwards as a defense mechanism in my opinion, and is a valid response, hatred not so much (Depending on context, we all hate terrorism is a great example)	1641190196.0	hr1ibx2	t3_ruqxir	t3_ruqxir	/r/MensRights/comments/ruqxir/the_im_allowed_to_distrusthate_men_because_of_my/hr1ibx2/

So the question is, how much of that increased risk is for reasons that are not sexist/racist? In both cases, probably most/all of it. Though at least in the case of racial minorities the likelihood of living in a higher crime area could potentially be attributed to structural racism. Maybe the increased aggression and risk taking behavior in men could also be attributed to structural sexism. People don't call being less likely to be shot because you are a woman privilege though.  They might conceded it is benevolent sexism, but more likely will just blame men for being bad.	1641191755.0	hr1ktns	t3_ruldsp	t1_hr071w1	/r/MensRights/comments/ruldsp/police_brutality_is_mens_rights_issue_in_addition/hr1ktns/

392cfhb4	I'm sorry.. but what ever you are smoking you need to stop..  Firstly, a leader of the country does not have carte blanch authority to approve or disapprove any law..   Laws are first entered as bills, discussed, voted on etc and only after they pass their 3rd reading do they move on to be entered into law.  The leader of the country has **NOTHING** to do with deciding what does / does not become law.. except in dictatorships of course..  Secondly, how about the FACT that in many countries, Rape is a crime that **ONLY** men can commit? Seems pretty misandrist to me..   Or how about the **FACT** that men get longer prison sentences than women do for the same crimes?  If we lived in a 'patriarchy' Rape would not be a crime because under a patriarchy it would be a woman's 'duty' to submit to men.   But that's not how society works does it?  Many men get convicted and spend **LONG** periods of their lives in jail on false accusations.. this would **NEVER** happen in a true patriarchy but look at reality for a second and it becomes clear to see that we do not live in a patriarchy at all.	1641192016.0	hr1l8e1	t3_rupeuw	t1_hr1409s	/r/MensRights/comments/rupeuw/the_motte_and_bailey_of_the_patriarchy/hr1l8e1/

46a6opwn	Bigot: a person who has strong, unreasonable beliefs and who does not like other people who have different beliefs or a different way of life.  If you get mauled by a tiger, it is not unreasonable to be wary of tigers in future to protect yourself against the possibility of further negative outcome. We are designed to give greater weight to negative experiences in order to save our lives as top priority. This is not bigotry, it's primitive survival instincts. However, we may reason a relaxation of that fear if the circumstances suggest that the tiger is controlled or contained or otherwise likely unable to create a further negative outcome in that instance, but it doesn't mean that all encounters with a tiger will be as well protected.  In reality we can distrust tigers and avoid them because we don't need anything from them: it's different in the interaction between men and women in that women need something from men and vice versa, so a risk needs to be taken if we want that benefit. For some reason, women believe they should be able to choose without risk or consequence or that they are entitled to a life free of harm simply because it is something they want. Men have learned there are consequences for anything they want, and they never get something for nothing.  It's not men's fault they are driven to sex by their biology and womens biology is the object of men's biological drive. It's also not a man's fault that a woman might not choose to be with him because it is her subjective choice: it's not about the man at all but her fantasy of the ideal man.  Do not envy women for being given false support and encouragement: men have the advantage in knowing the reality of things and can reason solutions versus the inherent instability of creating foundations based on a fantasy. If you think about what you want as a number of independent outcomes that do not necessarily rely on embodiment by a single person, you are much freer to adopt solutions to each need via more options than a sole woman.  Women can say what they like about men, but they should remember that men have what they want too and driving them away means less chance of getting that.	1641193033.0	hr1msix	t3_ruqxir	t3_ruqxir	/r/MensRights/comments/ruqxir/the_im_allowed_to_distrusthate_men_because_of_my/hr1msix/

Unless it’s some way out of proportion anomaly, a human body is capable of functioning on its own very fine. No need of that capitalism or religion or culture rules. Leave a body to function as is.   Of course some get phimosis so need foreskin removed but that has justification like any surgical intervention when something goes wrong.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer This dude had his whole life ruined due to circumcision being “just a thing everyone does”. If society didn’t circumcise his story would not have happened.	1641195388.0	hr1q7hj	t3_ru7wzj	t1_hr1avq1	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hr1q7hj/

You are just a human with certain views who says things on various subreddits. Gender plays little role here.

hee69	43 yr old.  Female with HPV + head and neck cancer despite negative paps and the vaccine.  So yeah.... I caught it from oral sex on men and women.   Boys absolutely need to be getting the vaccine when the girls do.  Head and neck cancer rates are dramatically rising and will even eclipse cervical cancer.  The back of the throat where the base of the tongue and tonsil area are very similar in tissue nature to the cervix so HPV likes to hang out there.    Luckily these HPV + cancers are MUCH more treatable than HPV - cancers of the head and neck... so these are preventable and treatable!!!	1641196210.0	hr1rc2l	t3_pfht7m	t3_pfht7m	/r/MensRights/comments/pfht7m/head_and_neck_cancer_a_gendered_disease/hr1rc2l/

4b5zd12y	If you read my comment you'll see that wasn't the only factor. I also talked about the "types" of crimes. I'm not being naive. I think police brutality has a lot more to do with individuals within the police force being terrible people and doing a terrible thing, and/or the individual getting arrested and how he/she acts.  It's more likely there are shitty people in the police force, that do shitty things to anyone in their way, than there is some underlying agenda to inflict extra brutal force upon men and minorities. Or, that the individual getting arrested forces officers into using lethal force, or split second decision, etc  Another way to look at it: if a woman resists, does she pose as much of a threat as a man? On average, no. Most male police officers would be able to restrain a woman without the use of a fire arm or taser (and men are more likely to be able to resist the taser). There's just more threat. (I still think this is a factor, but I concede the overall arguments premise)  I'm all for not killing people, I don't see how anyone would want the police to gun someone down, but assigning sexism(I concede this point, I think it's a major factor) and racial prejudice as the reason for the difference in police shootings(divided by race it actually isn't that different, nowhere near the male/female divide). There are way more factors, just like with the "wage gap"(women think the wage gap is just sexism, but that's not what it is, there's way more to it).   I believe racial prejudice is one of the smallest factors in police brutality. In the George Floyd incident, the officer was known for doing that exact same "leg on the back of the neck" move before this. Other policemen have been known to do it too. Jacob Blake, also wasn't shot for racial reasons. Neither was the incident that led to the Ferguson riots. All of it was media outlets lying, and spreading misinformation. Every time one of these cases comes under scrutiny, it falls apart. Jussie Smulletts case also turned out to be a hoax. (Not police brutality, but media sources lying)   So no, I don't believe racism, or sexism(point conceded), are what have to do with police brutality, i think there are a lot of factors leading to it, one of them being the types of crimes, and the circumstances involved during the actual arrest (ie, trying to climb in an SUV [a dangerous machine, that someone just recently used to run over multiple people in a parade] full of kids, that aren't yours, with a knife in your hands, while the children's mother screams, "my kids are in the car!", while police are screaming to get down, to put down the knife, have tackled you, and tased you... All because they were responding to a call naming Jacob Blake [who had a warrant out at the time], and staying he wouldn't give back the keys to her car).  Honestly, I can see police brutality not happening to women anywhere near as much because of sexism. So many men would never even hit a woman. Most men I know wouldn't. I'll actually concede the sexism point. But, the racial prejudice, I disagree with. Racism is not just shunned in society, it's completely black listed, 0 tolerance.	1641196583.0	hr1ru88	t3_ruldsp	t1_hr1ktns	/r/MensRights/comments/ruldsp/police_brutality_is_mens_rights_issue_in_addition/hr1ru88/

4en6ik1l	That's racist if poc are inherently violent then there wouldnt be any people left living in Africa. If all the muslims are terorists there wouldnt be people living in saudi arabia, iran or turkey. Around the whole world men are the perpetuaters of most of the violence. Look im not saying men are inherently violent and no matter how many times we try to educate them they will be violent. Im saying they live in an environment that promotes "good" violence. Like "man, if my girl cheats on me im gonna beat her so bad" or stuff like that and people around them dont tend to call out on this behavior. So we need people to unlearn this. Im not saying there arent violent women. There are and it goes unreported most of the time. The difference is that the male violence leads to death more. Btw this statement doesn't mean men kill women all the time so we should unsee female violence. Of course if you see someone, anyone who has violent tendencies you have to call them out. Just because there are people dying in car crashes doesnt mean splinted ankle is insignificant. But if we see a person who needs help because of a car crash we go and help them first because they could actually die, splinted ankle hurts like a bitch but it wont kill you if you were to be treated an hour late.	1641197322.0	hr1stvw	t3_qiwi93	t1_hqzjihl	/r/MensRights/comments/qiwi93/feminism_has_always_been_bad/hr1stvw/

5x9r4ntn	I attack it in two ways main ways:  1. There are women in my life I care about. Why the F would I do things to hurt them?  Then I can explain the idea of "patriarchy" as the attempt by de Beauvoir to normalize her relationship with Sartre.   This use of the word patriarchy also semantically overloads it, and the real role of a patriarch cannot be achieved through suffering of those whom he is in charge of.  2. It contradicts empirical evidence.  Historically, in European cultures women where not bared from any profession, as long as they where able to do it on par with men. This barrier only ever applied to the elites in 18-19 centuries, therefore is not representative of overall human behaviour.  Neurologically, men react to women exhibiting socially meaningful behaviours on a biological level. This is part of human biology and is mutually exclusive with the overall feminist narrative, "patriarchy" in particular. Therefore, "patriarchy" is bs.  *if the person is philosophical enough one could go in to deeper philosophy and how every movement based on philosophy of romanticism has been nothing more than a power grab, never solving any issues.	1641201668.0	hr1ydi7	t3_rupeuw	t3_rupeuw	/r/MensRights/comments/rupeuw/the_motte_and_bailey_of_the_patriarchy/hr1ydi7/

You have a vagina, if you don't want a child, have protected sex or a tubal ligation🥴  When you apply the same logic to women that's what you sound like.

47rp0gko	We shouldn't be censoring words, we should be de-stigmatizing them. In itself, 'incel' is not a term that should express hate, it's merely an identity describing people who, for whatever reasons, cannot have sex. A lot of people would misconstrue that label to attack them, and I think that's terrible, but at the same time, censoring the talk about them completely means that there's no attempt being made to understand them, and help is the one thing they could all need.	1641202099.0	hr1yx2g	t3_ruqxir	t1_hr1lirk	/r/MensRights/comments/ruqxir/the_im_allowed_to_distrusthate_men_because_of_my/hr1yx2g/
7dy6cv1e	You really don't read anything do you... you read 10% and assume the rest. The crux of the matter here has nothing do do with men trying to have opinions of women's health, its about the fact that whilst women's sexual healthcare is often publicly funded, men's is ignored and underfunded. The same can be said for cancer care, in which cancers that primarily affect men are underfunded compared to those that primarily affect women.   We are still living in a world where doctors butcher the genitals of baby boys based on pseudoscience, whereas baby girls are legally protected from such cruelty (and rightly so).  None of this has to do with arguing for women & girls to have less rights/protections, its about arguing for men and boys to be given the same rights and protections.   And any argument you have that "men aren't interested in taking birth control" is just nonsense. Many of the men here would love to have options like that, unfortunately whilst their are multiple ongoing studies to create such forms of birth control, they are chronically under funded. Not because "men aren't interested" but because male specific healthcare is underfunded.	1641202134.0	hr1yyoc	t3_rtomgw	t1_hr1xote	/r/MensRights/comments/rtomgw/when_will_women_have_to_subsidize_male_health/hr1yyoc/

f7dqdbd1	You don’t realize what you are talking about.  You all here are fired up about a health care decision France made, for women in France! By the way France gives out free condoms through health care providers since 2018 and vasectomies seem although to be covered.   Somehow you guys here are qualified to comment on this decision despite neither being a woman nor living in France because penis.  But YOU criticize me for commenting on male birth control studies because that’s a male health matter and I don’t have a valid opinion because no penis.  I already knew that you guys believe in the magical abilities of your dick but here take it to another level.  YOU ARE A FUCKING HYPOCRITE!  To make it very very clear to you, that men are just not interested in taking hormones wasn’t my argument, it was the spokesman’s argument, when the study was stopped.  But all that aside most women, including me would be delighted, if men had a birth control pill/gel/injection whatever. We don’t stop you! We would be very happy if you guys would share responsibility and burden to have safe sex.  But to actually have that developed, YOU guys need to be loud that you want it and maybe you although have to get your asses up and do something. You know why breast cancer is funded more then prostate cancer? Because women do something about it. Because women put in the work for decades to advocated for it. Women did and do all kinds of fundraisers for that, make it a topic of discussion and make it seen. How about you doing the same for male birth control? You know instead of shitting on women.  I very much believe, that you guys would be so much more successful in making things change, if you would actually discuss YOUR problems and tried to work on that. BUT ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS SHITTING ON WOMEN.   So how about you guys do something about your own issues and stop crying about young women in other countries getting free birth control pills? Which by the way helps men as well, as this women wouldn’t make babies by themselves.	1641203988.0	hr21aux	t3_rtomgw	t1_hr1yyoc	/r/MensRights/comments/rtomgw/when_will_women_have_to_subsidize_male_health/hr21aux/

8zntcen4	As much as i agree with just how bad MGM is, I don’t support this kind of letter at all. Adding your parents’  pain to your own, and deciding you can magically guess how much it will be ( less than you own ) is foolish.  It is seriously naive and un-nuanced to think you can, just through proper ethics, get through life without unintentionally maiming other people. You will do that as a good person, just by going with the flow, by conforming by listening to expert advice and by being imperfect.  This letter is very much that of an inexperienced 23 year old.   The expression of pure outrage is very valid and needs expressing, but does not belong in a volley aimed at your parents. Changing your anguish to the anguish of 3 is not justified. It is not the same as working through what they did with them, expressing anger in a way that can go somewhere and eventually let them earn your forgiveness.    Communication of your hurt and anger and demand for recognition of this injustice belong in a communication separate from an expression of pure unfiltered howling rage and pain.	1641204270.0	hr21nqe	t3_ru7wzj	t3_ru7wzj	/r/MensRights/comments/ru7wzj/genital_mutilation_a_message_to_my_parents/hr21nqe/

Only some men in power who are against it, never a woman in power.  >lesser men are being forced to pay child support to their rapist  Like what ? Men in this situation represent 0.001% (if not 0%). And you want them to have 50% of the support, of course. Let's start by giving women right and we will see after.  >Do you really think it isn't problematic that women choose to have children with men who don't consent to having them?

8kk65sg0	This is unique to india. A woman can enjoy sex one day and later withdraw consent and file a case against the man and put him in jail without investigation for years. The logic behind this is that indian women do not indulge is sex unless there is a promise of marriage. Which is not true. Currently any woman can say 'I had sex with this man but he didn't marry me' and put the man in jail for more than 10 years but this does not apply to wives. Feminists want all women to have this power over all men. Also, women's statements are considered evidence on par with video evidence while men's statements are considered statements.

We all (even judges) operate under an assumption that when a judge sentences a guilty person to jail time that they go and sit in a jail cell for however long their sentence is. We're wrong. What they are really sentencing a person to is rape, abuse, torture, malnourishment, and constant harassment. I'm not sure how judges do it.

I'm in the top 10% for income too, but I lived very frugally when single and downplayed it as much as I could being vague about my occupation, etc.  Unless you marry someone with similar income, it's just too risky to marry someone who is mostly attracted by your money.  In American divorce courts, the breadwinner gets the short end of the stick.  My sister is going through one now and earns probably 5 times as much as her husband and is finding that out the hard way.  For example, she feels like her retirement account should all be hers.

The only thing the wealthy Elite have in common is their money and power they do not give two fucks about men in general they have used patriarchy in a very limited way to maintain a status quo they have used racism in order to resolve a lot of the economic contradictions they had been using feminism to a greater effect because women are inherently narcissistic with their natural feminine hypergamy and Men very easily care more about women's needs than other men.

You can look at Family Court and see how little women think of fathers or the children who need their fathers.  Men are the one who looked upon to provide for tags and provision for a family this is the very idea of caring.  The idea that caring for your children or your family or your husband is some kind of fun wage labor is another example how Little Women understand the word caring or care for it.

822oezpy	The whole feminist movement is built on the idea that they care... smfh  Women do not demonstrate any kind of natural inclination to care or empathize this is all a bunch of BS feminists gaslighting.  You can look at Family Court and see how little women think of fathers or the children who need their fathers.  Men are the ones who are looked upon to provide, protect, provision,etc. for a family -this is the very idea of caring. Caring is a verb, not some sort of theoretical superfluous adjective.  The idea that caring for your children or your family or your husband is some kind of  unwaged labor is another example how Little Women understand the word caring.  Moreover there's no way women can continue to raise their daughters to practice every form of prostitution and raise their sons to be the ideal host to be cannibalized by WhoreCulture... you cannot continue to play the hypergamy game and sell it to your own children and call yourself a caring or empathetic person.

There are absolutely women out there who are capable of sympathizing with men, and on the flip side there are *tons* of men who are more interested in ingratiating themselves to women than they are in caring about men.

Since more and more men live alone, they run the risk of dying from more minor heart issues, since there's nobody monitoring them on a regular basis.

Women understand that a marriage is a f****** contract that disadvantages men and yet they ask for it they manipulate boys into thinking it's about love.. smh  What act of Love requires men to sign over their economic sovereignty the sign a lopsided contract that most often ends with them being an indentured servant being forced to pay for things called alimony palimony child support.  What kind of caring empathetic women we'll set there and advocate for their three legally protected rights to decide to be a parent and then not even give too s**** to even talk about how men do not have even one legally protected right.

Standing in front of a speeding semi truck will likely end in death this is a good example of a useful generalization.  That women lack any kind of real caring or compassion is a useful generalization because you can open your eyes and just simply acknowledge your experiences ...you're most embodied immediate experience of women in general.

What is the main reason for the current migrant crisis? the search for a better life - the clue is right there. Moving on from countries with lesser school systems etc etc  Why would I back track? its not an opinion that white hetro males are generally more qualified for higher tier jobs in the US, its fact. Quotas **do** take jobs from more skilled workers...that's literally what they are designed to do. What "labels" am I throwing out that gives you cause to call me a racist? I call you a racist by definition, because you are supporting quotas which discriminate against people on race, which is the fucking definition of racist. Its not some stupid word you throw around at people you disagree with you fucking shallow cunt.  In almost every medium or high tier job you need a good grip on the language  "Absolutely foolish. Equal opportunities= racism?? You're delusional. You've shown a lack of comprehension"  This is what is comes down to, for some reason you believe in racially and sexually discriminating against white hetro males in order to put others on equal tread is OK. You are a racist and a sexist for thinking this way, by dictionary definition. I just want equality. Quotas are not equality. I don't want children to suffer because of the colour of their skin or the sex they identify as.  Quotas don't work. Racial and sexual discrimination doesn't work, and its deeply immoral, I shouldn't have to point this out to you but you don't have any sort of compass. Just because such tools were used in the past does not make them successful. You ignore history when you start focusing on the parts of oppression that suits you. You probably think the unborn should pay for the sins of those long dead, with reparations.

652q8518	I have been told, in recent discussions in other subs, that it is in fact gender-neutral. I would like to confirm that for myself, but I can't figure out how to read the actual text of the relevant bill.  I assume the relevant text is the Hate Crime (Misogyny) Bill 2019-21, as reported by the College of Policing as being presented to Parliament in November last year.  Quite frankly I have very low hopes for equal treatment when the bill has an explicitly sexist word in it.  Edit: What caused me to be corrected in those other threads is my assumption, based on the reporting, that it *is* one-sided. I don't think it's reasonable for me to accept responsibility for that assumption, given damn near everybody is reporting it *explicitly* as an anti-misogyny bill, and I can't find the source text to judge for myself. The reporting of it alone makes me sceptical that anybody's going to treat misandrist crime seriously, even if it is included in the wording of the bill.	1642527969.0	ht7btdq	t3_s71xoa	t3_s71xoa	/r/MensRights/comments/s71xoa/this_is_getting_concerning/ht7btdq/

When you marry a woman who isn't legitimately physically attracted to you, you're pretty much guaranteed a whole host of additional problems - dead bedrooms, high cheating risk, lack of respect, resentment, excessive demands (she'll expect you to continually "compensate", but it'll never be enough), constant nagging/picking fights, etc, etc.  You can't buy love. No matter how much money you have, and no matter how hard you simp, it'll never truly compensate for lack of attraction on her end, and she'll never genuinely respect you. You can buy companionship and unenthusiastic sex, but you can't buy love or respect.  We gotta screen out the people who are only settling for us.  As a general rule, if she doesn't find you good looking enough for something casual, she can't be trusted for something serious.	1642530738.0	ht7jec5	t3_s6ha68	t1_ht7206x	/r/MensRights/comments/s6ha68/discrimination_on_tinder/ht7jec5/

gn9g7ooc	Feminism has harmed men in many ways, yes. I'm not disputing that. But let's look at some ways it *has* helped men. This is focused on the US and might not apply elsewhere. I think it is important to consider that some big hurdles were crossed by feminist movements that will make our work easier. While they were designed to benefit women, many aspects of their work laid down the road we now travel. Many of these points have caveats and aren't perfect in execution by feminists, but they are still a big deal for us.  1. It brought the issue of gender roles into discussion. Sure it was focused on women, but even looking at gender roles was a hurdle Feminism passed.  2. Many civil laws were passed regarding the equal treatment of men and women. While they may be biased in application, their existence *is* a win and something we can work with.  3. Women voting. This is good and strengthens the country when all citizens can vote. While it wasn't granting rights to men, it is a benefit to us that our wives, mothers, daughters etc are represented. If this wasn't a thing already I would for sure be out there advocating for it. When women get involved in politics it  helps break down the stereotype that men are the ones who have to run everything.  4. Women working. This is a big deal in breaking down gender roles. While we still have a lot of work to do, giving Women the ability to provide for themselves and not rely on men to do it is a big win.  5. Creation of some social services for stuff like domestic violence. While we all know this is very bias in application, we can see a template for services we want for men and how to run them. We got work to do on this but it is a help in showing us direction.  It most cases the argument is going to be "improving women's position benefits men in xyz way" which is valid but a pretty lame attempt at helping men. We can look to many things feminism did do right and get equal treatment and assistance for men under those programs. If those things didn't exist already we would have more work cut out for us.	1642533198.0	ht7q1qn	t3_s74mg9	t3_s74mg9	/r/MensRights/comments/s74mg9/how_has_feminism_helped_men/ht7q1qn/

7h5xel5p	Depends on where you live. The US seems to have different laws depending on state etc.  The theory of spousal support is to help the lower income spouse transition to their new single life.  The theory of child support is to enable the child of the marriage to continue to enjoy the same level of life they had before.  The practice, can be very different and is often fuelled by false information, entitlement and the family legal system which can make a lot of money off drama.  Can men receive spousal support, yes. Can men have full custody of children, yes. Can men be paid child support, yes.	1642533625.0	ht7r78i	t3_s709bo	t3_s709bo	/r/MensRights/comments/s709bo/can_somebody_explain_spousal_support/ht7r78i/

For guys attractive enough to pull it off and who don't find it morally objectionable, they've never had more opportunity.  Other guys might not want to pursue multiple women at once, but never want to commit either - just enjoy the infatuation stage of a relationship (up to about 2 years) and then move on (never marrying).  The current situation seems to work out for them pretty well too.    For the majority of men though, it's been a net negative.	1642534329.0	ht7t3wx	t3_s74mg9	t3_s74mg9	/r/MensRights/comments/s74mg9/how_has_feminism_helped_men/ht7t3wx/

7gpdb	We need to recognize that the protests are not all feminists - there are people involved who just want to protect workers' rights.  Of course, the idea that women deserve to retire earlier because of "years of part time and unpaid work" is just feminist boilerplate. It shouldn't surprise anyone here that women consider any homemaking/chores as work when they do it. Of course, it's our "manly duty" to step up and take on half the housework at minimum (/s obviously...). But it's not unpaid work that results in men deserving to retire as early as women - it's just our "duty" to our partners.  Let's recap: 1) women live longer than men in basically every civilized society (so its not just that men are slobs who don't care for themselves because of "masculinity" but rather it looks like a systemic barrier to healthcare access)  2) In multiple surveys throughout the 20th century, women self-reported higher levels of happiness and fulfillment, with lower levels of stress than men.  3) Therefore, women deserve to have an extra year of retirement.  Wait, what? I think there must be something I'm missing here. A truly oppressed class lives longer, arguably better, lives than their oppressors and then they get to retire earlier. Yup, sounds like feminism is totally needed in the western world. Absolutely. Because women being ACTUALLY oppressed by countries that established islam as the official religion is totally relevant to some gender studies "student" at an american University. The impact on her life is immeasurable!	1642535214.0	ht7vict	t3_s6vqn5	t3_s6vqn5	/r/MensRights/comments/s6vqn5/feminists_protest_against_equal_retirement_age_in/ht7vict/

When women get involved in politics it helps break down the stereotype that men are the ones who have to run everything.  This was not feminism's doing by any means... It came about through lobbying behind closed doors, helped along by people like Millicent fawcett who actively distanced herself from the domestic terrorist group known as the suffragettes. While the suffragettes committed arson and domestic bombings as well as shaming and discrediting politicians, fawcett actively worked together with politicians already in favour of women's voting in order to successfully pass the bill to let women vote.  In other words, feminism's precursor, the suffragettes actively worked against women's voting rights. The fact that feminists today harp on about how they got women the right to vote is ridiculous, raking credit where none is due.	1642535500.0	ht7wa9o	t3_s74mg9	t1_ht7q1qn	/r/MensRights/comments/s74mg9/how_has_feminism_helped_men/ht7wa9o/

39554x0l	A lot is wrong with his viewpoints. I see his teaching as more of a slide into right wing conservative traditional mindsets. He seems to value what is the “natural order” of things even though humans by design have pushed the boundaries of “nature” to get to where we are today. Also his idea of the feminine being seen as chaos and destruction while men are the answer and the order. It’s pretty sexist. He also believes women shouldn’t wear makeup in the workplace because it “invites” sexual harassment and believes women only wear it for male attention. There’s a lot of things wrong with his views and they’re masked as a self help style idea which maybe helpful to some but can also lead a lot of men into destructive mindsets when he talks about how society should be set up. He also doesn’t believe climate change is that big of an issue and also rejects the idea that capitalism caused mass wealth inequality in America. I could go on but you get the point. Also regarding brink layers (I can tell you got tht from Peterson too) that’s like one job out of millions and machines are slowly taking those men out of practice. And women and men can do construction and brick laying. Most of the job is operating machinery and tools anyway. Women just use more leverage angles than men when lifting things which doesn’t account for much disparity in getting the job done	1642695928.0	hth444b	t3_p3s6zs	t1_hrc23ez	/r/MensRights/comments/p3s6zs/how_do_i_stop_getting_angry_at_men_are_trash_i/hth444b/

3itt0i7a	I don't think that the marital rape law is the real problen here, as much as the lack of protection one has when accused. Marital rape is definitely a real problem, though it is one that can affect either party, to different rates. Just because you are married, does not mean you are entitled to intercourse with the other person whenever you feel like it. Promoting the "marriage is consent" rule is only going to hold back the real issues, which is false accusations and men's lack of protection and representation in the case one is accused.	1642696913.0	hth6rj7	t3_s8m66i	t3_s8m66i	/r/MensRights/comments/s8m66i/india_plans_to_criminalize_marital_rape_so_some/hth6rj7/
5x9r4ntn	Edit: In terms of BDSM, the dominant partner is supposed to deny the submissive partner things that will have a permanent effect on them, that is where morals and functional philosophy comes into play and why it is so important to have a good basis to the rest of your life.  I think that a lot of it comes down to a lack isolation from family structures and education on moral values and philosophy.  In years past most people lived relatively close to their extended family and it was common to stand up for your relatives. Men dealt with men, women dealt with women. And because this connection is at least partially erased this mechanism cannot function as it should.  In terms of morals and philosophy, most people do not connect the dots between what lead cultures to flourish and the moral values they propagated. Previously this had been transferred through traditions and religion (the Louis Pasteur perspective, as opposed to "old man in the sky") and tradition. This was disregarded en mass by people to a large extent thanks to indoctrination posing as intellectualism and education. This substitution results in disregarding of crucial aspects of human biology, specifically that our actions have an effect on our psychological wellbeing (PTSD is a good example showing this connection). By rejecting these aspects present in philosophies that created flourishing societies as part of religion, a critical aspect safeguarding people was lost and it is leading to glorification of psychopathic and narcissistic behaviour and producing misery and destruction of human psyche (not having that response is a neurological (biology) anomaly, most often what is known as psychopathy).  These overstepping of boundaries as a result of a worldview and these acts of overstepping boundaries is what attracts manipulative individuals to these movements and makes them desire and attain prominence. One of the key issues is that these individual have no issues with lying and consistently trick people into acting against their best interests just so that they could get more power. Human tendency to be lazy and searching for easy and immediate gratification along with oversimplification that disguises lies and malice are what makes them so efficient.  This rule book has been used many times in human history, with the latest major iteration being what is collectively known as political left-wing. While not exclusive to left-wing philosophies, the philosophies that are now termed as right-wing that followed this pattern had the time to die. This is how all great kingdoms and empires collapsed, simply by not understanding what made them great and allowing manipulative individuals to gain power.  The reason I point out left-wing philosophy is that it requires accepting a lie for it to have validity. For feminism the lie you have to accept is that "men created society to benefit men at the expense of women". When the left wing formed one of their lies that they had to accept was that what was in the past was evil, that included things like not killing everyone who questions you (Machiavelli wrote it in "the Prince", that it's always been a bad idea; we get the word terrorist from what the French left-wing did as soon as they got power) and that the monarch was the enemy of the people (despite the monarch actually trying to do what the revolutionaries claimed they wanted to do and never did).  That's the gist. Sounds a bit like a conspiracy theory, that's why I prefer that others point out if I gloss over something crucial.  Let me know if you have any questions or want me to expand on something specific.	1642696931.0	hth6tct	t3_s7xt5c	t1_htfpac9	/r/MensRights/comments/s7xt5c/i_have_observed_the_bdsm_community_break_its_own/hth6tct/
7gpdb	Ugh. She even touches on the only valid point in her post and then moves on without thought: RELIGION OPPRESSES PEOPLE! For fuck's sake, men are told to DIE FOR OUR FAMILIES, it must be real tough to be told you have to be a partner to your husband.  Men don't oppress women. Religion oppresses men and women alike. When you have overly-patriarchal religious sects like the Muslim sects that control entire countries, then the clergy is exclusively male and yeah, they issue ridiculous edicts every day. Religion just doesn't benefit the world enough these days to justify its existence. What other social movements exist that freely and openly belittle those outside the group, claim that only they have the truth, get tax exemption, gain free political power from their followers, amass wealth via donation and then use it to progress their hidden agenda of oppression within the government, define hate speech on their own terms, define gender roles as they see fit, decide who is and isn't a good person, ...  Wait, am I describing religion or the feminist matriarchy? Oh. The tax exemption. There are plenty of businesses that are operating tax-free because their stated purpose is somehow empowering women - when women out-earn men in major cities and outnumber men almost 2:1 in college admissions. Women outlive men while reporting greater happiness, fulfillment, and life satisfaction and are therefore oppressed (I'm confused, too). Thus if a business empowers women it's a charity. So oppressing men and boys is charitable.	1642696987.0	hth6yud	t3_s8bbyd	t3_s8bbyd	/r/MensRights/comments/s8bbyd/i_feel_like_misandry_is_starting_to_become_a/hth6yud/

During good times you overtime pay is no problem. But when it's slow they make it almost impossible to get overtime and the work still has to get done. We all know it's implied, but one manager was even bold enough to tell a coworker to be happy he has a job. Oil and gas in Canada btw. I've managed to get away from it mostly during these last couple of years.. mainly because I have a hard time getting enough hours.. I also don't care as much because I'm so underpaid since a bit wage correction after last layoffs, but some people make a career out of it and are taken advantage of more  It's not just in Canada either. Was working with some american colleagues for a while and there budget wasn't enough. Everyone in all disciplines has to volunteer some time, but weren't happy. Everyone thought about quitting at some point. Although older engineer basically said if he did he wouldn't find another job there in that industry.

652q8518	Why? Is a woman incapable of considering the need for emergency supplies in her car? Is she unable to bring a spare coat or blanket in case it's cold and the car breaks down? Is she less able to use a telephone to call for help or inform somebody where she is and that she needs assistance?  I *might* consider the argument that a woman may not be as physically strong as a man, so would be potentially less able to perform certain types of car maintenance, or less likely to be interested in car maintenance to the effect that she may not know what requires fixing, but by the time you get to calling the AA that's moot anyway - you've already accepted that you need somebody to come and help you, so your ability to perform the maintenance yourself is no longer relevant.  As another commenter (perhaps several) said: if you expect priority service, you'd better be prepared to pay more, otherwise you're getting exactly what you paid for - assistance whenever somebody is free to come and give it to you, exactly the same as a male member of the AA.	1642698279.0	hthajbd	t3_s8ihes	t3_s8ihes	/r/MensRights/comments/s8ihes/uk_fury_as_aa_says_it_does_not_prioritise_a_lone/hthajbd/

Why do we allow these antiquated belief systems so much power and control? Science has done, is doing, and will continue to do more good for humanity than any number of holy texts.  We could get rid of the notion that women must be subservient to men (this makes zero sense for lesbians!) AND drop the notion that a man's only purpose is to sell his labor to support a housewife (makes no sense for gay men!). We could stop shaming and scaring people into compliance and let kindness for its own sake be a thing. If the religious folks providing compassion, relief, support, medicine, education, blah blah blah are only doing it because of heaven/hell, then I don't want to be relying on them. If the medical care my family receives is dependent on the religion of the providers then that care can be removed at the whim of the clergy.

I also agree that what might be considered problematic about male spaces can also be found in female spaces, in terms of apparent hatred, aggression, entrenchment, and exclusionary behaviour.

h7uw2	Thanks for giving a rational and composed summation of your side of things.  It’s actually fascinating because your reasons for feeling sympathy are directly correlated to (some of) my reasons for my *lack* of it.   The following is going to be long and I apologize if it’s incoherent; it’s the first time I’ve actually tried to explain this “out loud”:   I went through a period of time in my teens (around 15-18) where I became painfully aware of how intentionally sheltered I was compared to the rest of my peers and also how little the one responsible for a lot of that sheltering cared about the negative effects it had on me in terms of how it affected my relationships with my same age peers.   This instilled a heavy amount of resentment in me towards adults as a whole. Anytime someone older than their teens or twenties tried to give me advice or establish rules and boundaries, I saw it as an attempt at “restraining” my freedom. That combined with your average teenage rebelliousness gave me an incredibly toxic and dysfunctional attitude that still makes me cringe when I look back at that time through the eyes of an adult.  The reason I bring this up is because I see a lot of this sort of mindset—women who feel like they have been controlled or brainwashed by men and therefore must “take back their power” via exaggerated displays of nastiness.   An example of what I mean would be women who feel like they’ve been “conditioned/brainwashed to coddle men’s egos” and are therefore overly rude and even cruel to men as a way of somehow breaking free.  It’s no different than the idiotic teenager I was so long ago and what’s worse is that these kind of displays are often demonstrated by grown adults. I could forgive this is a teenage girl (even if I’d roll my eyes) but this kind of juvenile and misdirected hatred from an adult is completely unacceptable.   I see this post as just one more example of this.   Now that’s just the whole “she was brainwashed and is just angry” thing.

652q8518	Failing to make any kind of distinction whatsoever between different areas of "the manosphere" seems likely to me to make things *worse*.  Assuming that a hypothetical lonely, confused, perhaps angry man, who feels mistreated and/or ignored, has decided that he needs to find community and brotherhood, where would it be better for him to go? Somewhere like here or LWMA? Or somewhere like a hardcore incel forum? I think most would agree that this sub, or one like it, would be greatly preferable.  Not that I wish to demonise those in incel forums, because they're just looking for the same answers and communities that many of us are. I admit that such environments are likely to be, on the whole, less positive than some others might be, but I understand why they exist and I think they serve a purpose. That purpose is *not* the formation of an army of rapists.	1642699468.0	hthducc	t3_s8e6ek	t1_htfw7e8	/r/MensRights/comments/s8e6ek/how_men_get_trapped_in_the_manosphere_laura_bates/hthducc/

She can never do any wrong, she never gets punished for her mistakes, give her everything she wants when she’s even slightly upset.

1h8zkp22	Valenti wrote that her abortion made her life better.  That's almost an exact wording from the article.  She implies that women's lives can be better by abortions, which implies praising them for choosing to have their unborn child killed.  Abortion is unethical in the vast, vast majority of cases.  It's often about financial reasons or feelings of inconvenience.  It's a failure to accept responsibility.  Women absolutely should feel ashamed of having abortions in the majority of cases, and accept that they made an unethical decision.	1642699920.0	hthf4m2	t3_s804hf	t1_htg1bk4	/r/MensRights/comments/s804hf/this_person_doesnt_acknowledge_that_it_could_be/hthf4m2/

652q8518	Not that I wish to minimise the experiences of women who are subject to sexual crimes, but as the number is such an outlier compared to all of those other crimes, I can't help but wonder whether there is some element of bias.  There are often men who mention, in discussions on Reddit, that they've been victims of sexual harassment, sexual coercion, and other sex-related crimes, but have not reported it because it seemed "normal" or because they feared they wouldn't be treated seriously, or that they would even be laughed at and ignored.  In the UK there are quirks to the law which exclude men from being victims of rape, under the definitions of what rape is, which might also contribute to skewing of statistics.  Whatever the cause - and I don't doubt that there are some significant amount of sex-related crimes committed against women - I think there is a strong possibility that the *real* rate of such crimes against men are higher than reported here. Especially when you include things like sexual coercion.	1642701028.0	hthi6th	t3_s8n2m1	t3_s8n2m1	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n2m1/victims_of_violent_crime_german_statistics_2020/hthi6th/

But the prejudice against women is much more widespread and severe.

w55pl	Personally I didn't downvote you, no, but seems we're basically capturing the same sentiment, but having very different reactions too it. Probably thru' the lense of being the person we are. I didn't have that experience with adults growing up, or anyone aiming to control more or less anything in my life(almost to a detriment), so I never nurtured much resentment towards much of anything perhaps, nor did I have a rebellious phase. Wasn't really anything in my life to actively rebel against.  I just wanted to care for something; or to fit in; constantly being a latchkey kid without supervision, so I guess that explain some of the reason I seek to understand even those who seem deadset on rejecting intrinsic values of who I am. Every person, a potential friend to let in.  Both of these biases ofc, will lead us astray, and make for some poor judgements all through life. I know I've made mistakes, and gotten my naivite served back at me on a platter a time or two. Or dozens...

2v4g7qms	For example, look at all the easily observable problems that result from single mother families. The kids in those families have a dramatically increased risk of teenage parenthood, failing high school, delinquency, not attending college, and a whole host of other such issues. I suspect that fatherlessness is the single most important social issue we face today. It isn't immediately obvious why fathers would be so important, it should hypothetically be possible for single mothers to raise kids properly, but in reality we see the negative results of fatherlessness. Fathers contribute something that is necessary for society to function.  I imagine there's a similar necessity for mothers, though we don't really have an epidemic of motherless families, so the results of such an epidemic may not be very obvious.	1642702179.0	hthld8q	t3_s7x7i0	t1_htdcd9g	/r/MensRights/comments/s7x7i0/men_dont_need_women_a_discussion/hthld8q/

That’s why I’m blessed to live in a country led by English Common Law, which enforces responsibility on the individual, and I believe that the current culture being promoted by leftist groups is a threat to that.	1642702584.0	hthmh2k	t3_s88krq	t3_s88krq	/r/MensRights/comments/s88krq/the_use_of_the_phrase_toxic_masculinity_is_in_and/hthmh2k/

Even then, she has to be dressed according to religious law. This is a very real thing.  However.  This is a situation that has NO impact on the lives of women in the west. Claiming it as justification for a "the ends justify the means" mindset regarding lying about statistics for rape, gendered pay disparities, violence against women, or education is nothing but another stitch in the dress of the matriarchy. I saw the two-x post about how men in India were pushing a marriage strike due to marital rape being made illegal. It sounds like an obvious straw man, but as long as men are shying away from marriage, I'm happy.	1642702756.0	hthmy1g	t3_s8g6ku	t1_htgv0rh	/r/MensRights/comments/s8g6ku/men_in_india_trended_marriagestrike_for_over_2/hthmy1g/

They will say they don't "owe men anything" while at the same time expecting men to owe them this spectacular treatment.   I also don't see how this girl can write that and possibly think it is going to make men treat her better, want her or whatever.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume she has held this kind of attitude prior to today and is probably why people are not bending over backwards for her.. just a thought.

h2jt1i58	Abortion talks is one of the best examples of how feminism is NOT about equality, but control and power.  If feminists just simply added "men should be able to have a choice to be a parent or not as well, and not be forced to rent time with their own child" the whole abortion debate would be over in a day because half the men in this country would back that decision up in about 10 seconds.  But they choose to not mention that because they want women to be able to have the financial power over men for the decision SHE makes. (remember: HER body, HER choice,  It's not his choice, it's hers.  They love to remind us of that)  They want 100% control in the area, that's why they only address what they want, ignore what men say, then blame the men for her being 50% of the participation.  If feminists cared about abortion, the impacts of people having children and so on, they would include men who make up half the fucking adults involved, not ignore them and blame them.  It's not abortion and women's health many (obviously plenty do) care about, it's the control and they want it exclusive.    Right now feminists have the abortion talks as: her body, her choice.  His body (life/wallet), her choice.  And all men want is a choice, that's fucking it.  But it's fought against like no other.  A smart person would ask... why?	1642703780.0	hthpr8z	t3_s804hf	t1_htdtc7t	/r/MensRights/comments/s804hf/this_person_doesnt_acknowledge_that_it_could_be/hthpr8z/

67mofgzp	>because men did less labor  This is reframimg the exact same claim. Women do more = men do less. Why do women do more = why do men do less.  >I didn’t think I needed to repeat myself  You didn't repeat yourself. You claimed that women are "forced" to do more chores. On the same ground i will claim that men are forced to do more work outside of the house.  The study you cited do not support your claim (women are forced). It establishes, that women do more chores and childraring which is a fact, but it doesn't attempt to answer, what is the reason for this.  I'm going to tell you. There are a lot of woman who work full time while having kids and the guy does nothing at home. True, but it's far from being the mean. These are the exceptions.   The vast majority of women with kids however, CHOSES to stay home especially in the low and high earning brackets, while the husband is out, earning the bread. Many other CHOSES to work part time while the husband is working full time. In most cases, the husband is the only one who can chose between working full time or working full time.  https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/time.com/4068559/gallup-poll-stay-at-home-mothers/%3famp=true  So my question to you is, do you expect men, who provably work far more hours outside of the home and pay for the majority of the bills, to  also do 50% of chores and childraring?  https://www.statista.com/statistics/280749/weekly-hours-of-work-in-the-uk-by-gender/#:~:text=The%20overall%20number%20of%20hours,respectively%20when%20compared%20with%20the	1642703885.0	hthq1n9	t3_s7shyj	t1_hthkwhh	/r/MensRights/comments/s7shyj/why_women_being_more_college_educated_than_men_is/hthq1n9/

39554x0l	I did repeat my answer about men doing less work in the house and the study I referenced showed that even women who were breadwinners did more house and child work. In my first comment I mentioned that men did less. As to being “forced” yes they are in that the husband does not do the labor so the woman has no other option than to do it for him. Essentially that is giving her no other option meaning forced. If no one takes care of the children of no one cleans the house well then the home and children are going to suffer so yes it is forced.	1642704414.0	hthriol	t3_s7shyj	t3_s7shyj	/r/MensRights/comments/s7shyj/why_women_being_more_college_educated_than_men_is/hthriol/

652q8518	What I mean is that mindlessly conflating all possible groups of men who disagree with Feminist narratives, or who are terminally single, or who are outcast from society, or who communicate in ways which contain angry outbursts, or whatever else might be included, has negative effects which could be prevented with some consideration and nuance.  Those who create and contribute to media which fails to make these distinctions, who simply throw all concerned or unsuccessful men into a pot and brands them "dangerous", are behaving counterproductively to their claimed goals. They are helping to cause, reinforce, and exacerbate displeasure and disenfranchisement. They are helping to confuse the boundaries between communities which might be of help to such men and blur them with communities which are more likely to cause those same men harm.  Simply by failing to acknowledge or understand the different layers or philosophies of congregations of men who, for various reasons, have difficulties with/in society as it's currently constructed, authors and writers like this make it *more* difficult for those men to find healthier communities. This can happen by various mechanisms:  By convincing the general public that any gathering of men must be nefarious and that any such gathering should not be trusted.  By ramming home the point that mens' concerns are not valid and thereby reinforcing the beliefs in men who are already suffering that nobody cares or, worse, thinks they're evil.  By driving those less unhealthy communities to more extreme and reactionary positions.   By making it seems that if you're in for a penny you might as well be in for a pound and, because you have some issues with being male in our current society, you might as well just head right for the incel forums, because all of these communities are "equally bad".  In causing these things to happen, either by misinformation, disinformation, or inaction, these commentators, reporters, and authors are making problems which they claim to be serious and dangerous *worse* by pressurising the situation. They cannot reasonably simultaneously claim be concerned about those problems *and* be oblivious or aggressive towards the men who suffer from and discuss them, without causing the very things they claim to be so problematic to worsen.	1642704699.0	hthsb12	t3_s8e6ek	t1_hthncs7	/r/MensRights/comments/s8e6ek/how_men_get_trapped_in_the_manosphere_laura_bates/hthsb12/

I.e. you are guilty, solely on the word of your accuser, if you cannot prove your innocence.   And even in “norma”, “guilty until proven innocent” legal regimes, like the US and UK there are many cases where men have been found guilty of rape who subsequently were totally exonerated.  So yes, it’s absolutely possible to be prosecuted and found guilty of rape, with a absolutely no wrongdoing on your behalf.	1642705584.0	hthupu2	t3_s8ozqu	t3_s8ozqu	/r/MensRights/comments/s8ozqu/can_men_get_sentenced_for_rape_without_any_proof/hthupu2/
30ymvhrd	I’ve read in the U.S. and Canada twice as much is paid per female inmate as per male inmate.  Women’s prison facilities often offer more amenities, not less and tend to have less over crowding issues.    A judge recently ruled exempting women from selective service is unconstitutional and discriminatory, but Congress refused to equally require women anyways.    Both of these issues come down to the fact society is gynocentric.   We cater to women.	1642705643.0	hthuvhc	t3_s8n8iv	t3_s8n8iv	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n8iv/your_thoughts_on_this_agree_or_disagree/hthuvhc/

870xw	When you feel powerless you need someone to blame for your situation. Often that takes the form of blaming entire demographics. She's blaming men for the way she was raised, and while to an extent the leaders in her religion were probably male, that doesn't mean it's a fair representation of all men. Women can be just as homophobic and controlling as men. This is a religious issue that she's twisted into a male issue because in her case those were the people in charge. If there were women in charge it would be the same bigotry and intolerance.	1642705707.0	hthv1ld	t3_s8bbyd	t3_s8bbyd	/r/MensRights/comments/s8bbyd/i_feel_like_misandry_is_starting_to_become_a/hthv1ld/

Point 4 is hillarious about it helping men understand women better because it's very clear she doesn't even understand how attraction works in women.  Fastest way to get a woman to dump you is to start acting all feminine.  Bonus points for crying a lot and telling her all your problems like she's your therapist.     >The husband's role in a marriage is to be a leader. As the head of the household, he should take the lead. Make the hard decisions for the benefit of the family and put himself first to protect and provide for them.

30ymvhrd	A few thoughts:     1.  She says her points are based on the idea of toxic masculinity.  Masculinity isn’t toxic however, so any points based on this false premise are not valid.    2.  It sounds like she wants a man servant not a relationship.  If she’s like most women, she probably also wants this man to help provide for her.    3.  Men are expected to be providers and protectors.  It’s mostly men who fight in combat to protect others.  Most dangerous work is done by men, most hard construction is fine by men.   It’s mostly men who will respond when someone needs help.   The idea of feminizing men directly contradicts all these male roles.     4.  Being masculine is the attribute of being male, just as canine is the attribute of being a dog.  These words are only social constructs to the degree all words are created by humans to describe something.  They are labels. They are not toxic and don’t require anything of anyone.   I’m not a male because I’m masculine and masculinity doesn’t force anything upon me.   I’m masculine because that’s the attribute of being male.	1642707373.0	hthzgy8	t3_s8pk5a	t3_s8pk5a	/r/MensRights/comments/s8pk5a/benefits_of_feminizing_your_husband_11_surprising/hthzgy8/

99josor0	Women are in fact weaker and unable to fight. I've personally witnessed CCTV footage of not one, but TWO female police officers failing to apprehend one male thief. One ran for the hills like a coward and the other one somehow got her gun stolen by the thief. No amount of feminist mouth frothing will change that fact that women are weak and pathetic when it comes to physical altercations of any kind. It's easy for them to be brave against a husband that doesn't want to have his house and kids taken, by a misandrist court system. But as soon as an aggressor doesn't give a shit, women fail to do anything.	1642707922.0	hti0yzp	t3_s8n8iv	t3_s8n8iv	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n8iv/your_thoughts_on_this_agree_or_disagree/hti0yzp/
zupxy	But the dildo/bodyguard, I mean the Chad club guy is more stronger than the guy  that is emotionally compatible, that is willing to stick with you for eternity, so of course the woman will like the guy that can protect them just in case something bad happens to them, but they don't want to marry the Chad, just use him for ten minutes of fun and the other 23 hrs of the day they want a guy that has the finance and is more easily able to forgive if you happen to mess up..  But even a conservative like Steven Crowder says that it's human nature for men to fuck every girl that is willing. I hate how celebrities want us to embrace the polygamy lifestyle, if it works for you fine, I don't want you to lose the freedom, but most guys have a hard enough time handling one woman if any of my coworkers are right about their exes.	1642707927.0	hti0zhh	t3_s8acs6	t3_s8acs6	/r/MensRights/comments/s8acs6/anyone_seen_people_pushing_single_parenthood_and/hti0zhh/

She will cheat on the guy for someone who can make her cum. It’s not rocket science. Men would absolutely do the same in that situation. I expect this is information men don’t really like to hear. That all we want is a good orgasm. Since many have trouble performing in that arena. Never fear men, the vibrator is your best friend.   Claiming women just want a relationship and are mad when men won’t commit isn’t exactly true either.

30ymvhrd	Yes.  There are many documented cases of men being  falsely convicted based primarily on the word of the accuser, but are later exonerated when actual evidence such as DNA evidence proves them innocent.    The innocence project is one organization that has often uncovered evidence proving innocence.    I recently saw a sign outside a police station saying “we believe victims of sexual assault”.  They are basically saying they will believe the accuser automatically rather than form a conclusion based on evidence.   Similarly, feminists claim false claims are almost non existent.  This misleading propaganda also creates a huge bias.   We may have a standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but since we go into these situations in a biased manner, it’s easy to feel there is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, even when there is no supporting evidence of guilt.	1642708322.0	hti22qd	t3_s8ozqu	t3_s8ozqu	/r/MensRights/comments/s8ozqu/can_men_get_sentenced_for_rape_without_any_proof/hti22qd/

That's not to say they shouldn't criminalize marital rape.  They should.

bxbpq1g	In the UK it is illegal under the Equality Act of 2010 to discriminate against anyone on the grounds of their sex. So the AA have to tread a very fine line between satisfying the Twitter mob, and abiding by the law.  This is what the AA said:  *'Replying to her letter, Mr King, said "the safety of women, and all vulnerable customers, is 100% at the top" of its priorities.'*   *'He said the AA had "reminded staff" of its "vulnerable customer processes and procedures", and said if there was a breakdown involving a lone woman, "where there is any concern raised by the customer, they receive the highest level of care and priority."'*  Now that looks like a statement written by a lawyer, as it does not specifically say, that they will come to a female customer faster than a male one just because of their sex. Rather his statement treads very carefully, namely:  *"...the safety of women, and all vulnerable customers, is 100% at the top" of its priorities".*  So what exactly does *"...top of its priorities"* mean? And anyone, including a male, could claim to be *"vulnerable"*.  *"...where there is any concern raised by the customer, they receive the highest level of care and priority."*  So any customer can *"...raise concern"*.  I think that one would have a hard time using that statement in a court of law to show they were discriminating against men in practice.	1642712996.0	htidkm2	t3_s8sc5r	t3_s8sc5r	/r/MensRights/comments/s8sc5r/follow_up_to_the_earlier_aa_post_theyve/htidkm2/
drm9t323	Okay, so heres the thing.  Shopping for clothes isnt real work.   Doing makeup isnt real work.   Spending 2 hours cooking when you can do it in just 1 is an extra hour of work thats not real work.   Spending a billion years picking out *just the right* items for the child/house isnt real work.  Stop acting like womens lives are so unfair when most of it is just women putting it onto themselves. Spending more *time* doing work means very little if someone else can achieve the same results using less. Which is what men generally do. So yeah. If you want an "equal amount" of work done, the solution is really easy. Its called not wasting your own damn time.	1642713090.0	htidu37	t3_s7shyj	t1_hti8rzk	/r/MensRights/comments/s7shyj/why_women_being_more_college_educated_than_men_is/htidu37/

itxc484v	Dude, what are you even talking about????  You have things so jumbled up in your head, I don't know where to start untangling all this mess.  First of all, no, that's not how women choose sexual partners at all. Women aren't nazis. Your claim can be disproven in a single sentence. Plenty of men who are physically weak, short, obese, lack confidence, are unemployed, have no trouble finding sexual partners. I've personally known terminally ill men who got laid. If women aren't fucking you, the problem is not biology, it's you.  Second, stop using bullshit evolutionary reasons to reinforce your nonsensical beliefs. Just because pregnancy is a larger investment for female mammals than it is for male mammals doesn't mean all this nonsense you've been asserting is truthful. There's no logical connection here. Just like there is no logical connection with equating seal behaviour to human behaviour. Humans aren't seals!  You clearly have a very poor understanding of how evolution works. Especially since you cited *The Selfish Gene*, which pretty much DISPROVES everything you've been saying here.  Here, read some of this stuff:  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behaviour_genetics  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_inheritance_theory  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_epigenetics  And for the last time, there is no scientific evidence for your wildly sexist assertions.	1642716131.0	htim9du	t3_s88krq	t1_htgorhk	/r/MensRights/comments/s88krq/the_use_of_the_phrase_toxic_masculinity_is_in_and/htim9du/

I've always viewed crime against women and children more taboo and that it's considered worse and cowardly to assault women. The exception is crimes of sexual nature.

ynh8y	This result is very much in line with a growing body of research that shows women's expectations of gender roles include preferential treatment (privilege) for women.  The first piece of research, that I'm aware of at least, was a paper titled ["Lay misperceptions of the relationship between men’s benevolent and hostile sexism"](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6958/Yeung_Amy.pdf) by Amy Yeung. Her research showed that women do not in fact want equality, they want "benevolent sexism" and that's the standard of behaviour by which they judge men.  Amy's research exposed women to three types of behaviours: Hostile Sexism (which is what people normally think of when they hear the word 'sexism'), Equality (i.e. treating women exactly the same as men) and Benevolent Sexism (i.e. giving women advantages and preferential treatment on the assumption that they are less capable than men).  The interesting thing is that the women in the study considered Equality to be the same as Hostile Sexism, i.e. misogynistic & sexist behaviour by men. They were only happy with Benevolent Sexism, which they assumed to be normal, expected behaviour for men and which they misunderstood to be equality.  This quirk of psychology helps explain why many women are so hostile towards men's rights advocates and their pursuit of true gender equality. They really, REALLY don't want gender equality, they want to preserve and extend their privilege.	1642718689.0	htir05m	t3_s8ihes	t3_s8ihes	/r/MensRights/comments/s8ihes/uk_fury_as_aa_says_it_does_not_prioritise_a_lone/htir05m/

3eq6aksv	There's a search function on reddit, and false accusations being rare has already been discussed countless times. The reason I don't answer is because the famous "false accusation = between 2% and 10%" is a well-known manipulation of statistics that has already been discussed countless times. Do a redit search using these words and you'll find countless discussions about it. Long story short, if about 5% of accusations are rare, since this is the number of cases prosecuted as false, about as much are true, and around 85/90% could be any of them but the charges have been dropped due to a lack of evidence. The scam being that these dropped charges aren't counted as false, only the ones where the accuser admit that it was false or the ones with overwhelming proofs are.    So, once again, this is the worst statistic one can use as a "proof" because it also means admitting that only about 5% or even less accusations are real, which is just as stupid as 5% of the accusations being false.  That's the usual feminist scam of assuming that any accusation that is "in-between" has to be real.  Again, search for a bit by yourself, it is a common subject here and you'll notably find a study addressing this problem somewhere. The statut of an accusation isn't a boolean variable that is either true or false, so saying that "only a few accusations are false" is ridiculously misleading. According to this narrative, even less accusations are true.	1642718850.0	htircys	t3_s454j4	t1_hthtifq	/r/MensRights/comments/s454j4/study_false_rape_accusations_can_be_just_as/htircys/

If you do decide to tell,  I Wonder if having some trusted and good friends present as your back up might be something to consider, as well as informing the family?   if she knows you have spoken outside the family about it, it might help if you chose to confront her.   Also, consider contacting the authorities and/ or police, to safeguard the children in her 'care'.  I think because of your young age at the time of the rape, you are less likely to be dismissed, with the ghastly insinuations older male survivors often deal with,  but more likely that you could be told its in your imagination etc...so be prepared for that.

Random bad things that happen to women for reasons unrelated to discrimination do not count as women's issues.  It should work the same way for men's issues.  Men committing violence against other men is a human's rights issue not a men's rights issue.  Historically, men were drafted to preserve the reproductive capacity of the country. The notion that men are better at fighting wars is a patriarchal one not a feminist one.   Little boys aren't told to not hit girls because violence against men is ok.  They're taught not to hit girls because women are smaller and weaker.  Most people in this world are decent and fair and wouldn't attack someone who is way smaller than them.  The reason women get attacked less is that most people only pick on those their own size.	1642721593.0	htixztp	t3_s78o8f	t1_htiurwi	/r/MensRights/comments/s78o8f/no_for_the_last_time_men_do_not_get_killed_less/htixztp/

I am not the only one.  You can use other terms for the same thing to call it out. For example, you don't have to use the word selfish, to call out selfish behaviour. You can use other words like narcissistic, self-centered, or egocentric.  We are constantly changing the terms we use to be more sensitive to people.

The problem is that sometimes it gets me downvoted into oblivion round here, but I think that desperately striving for a middle ground is the only route to any sort of solution to this stuff.

It’s not a patriarchal one. It is a fact. However it is still discriminatory to force one sex to war.  > Little boys aren't told to not hit girls because violence against men is ok.    Violence against men is seen as preferable.   Most people in this world are decent and fair and wouldn't attack someone who is way smaller than them.

10qc8n	So I just read this... drivel. It's the most disgusting thing I've read in a little while.   It starts from a position that men are violent and quick to anger and basically is all about trying to dominate him through force. Making him do things to suit your needs.  First of all, any man with any self respect will Immediately reject any attempt to do this.  Second, it won't help any man who is weak enough to be bullied this badly. But it's a pretty good way to make his life even worse.  Anyone who thinks this is good advice is mental.	1642722306.0	htizprr	t3_s8pk5a	t3_s8pk5a	/r/MensRights/comments/s8pk5a/benefits_of_feminizing_your_husband_11_surprising/htizprr/

49wha	I’m not sure if the person who said the above was being deliberately obtuse in some of their answers or actually misread the questions.   Some of the answers appeared as though they spent some time deliberating to give a balanced response. However, I’m not sure how they misunderstood the question regarding retroactively revoking consent.   Revoking consent during the act is what they were basically responding to. So… person says yes initially, then changes their mind afterward. That is what the entire reply was debating. However… RETROactively revoking consent is where the person said yes at the begging, continues to say yes at the middle, and end. Then… afterward (whether later that same day or at a period considerably later, like days, weeks or months later) they decided “oh, I no longer give consent.”   As other comments have pointed out, if you consent to be given the cake, consent to eat the cake, then eat all the crumbs left on the plate, you have consented. You cannot thereafter revoke that consent. That cake is gone. You may regret it the following day because you ate so much your belly aches, but you cannot then say “oh, I didn’t agree to eat that cake.”   I’m not sure why that premise is difficult to understand.	1642722644.0	htj0j9q	t3_s8n8iv	t3_s8n8iv	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n8iv/your_thoughts_on_this_agree_or_disagree/htj0j9q/

Arguably, mental illness still exists beyond birth defects because we've gotten so good at keeping the mentally ill not just alive but normalized into society. Evolution isn't a humanitarian process, as a species we made it out of the primordial soup because some changes worked.. And the organisms that changed in ways that didn't work didn't make it out.  Now we have a world where upwards of 20% of the population in the US has a mental defect, almost 50% of us are obese, and 13% of us have diabetes (this figure is rising FAST).

That flawed logic is why no one talks about “male violence” when men are killed, even though men make up the majority of the lives it takes. If people had compassion for men there would be a hell of a lot more concern as to why men commit violence more and why they do target men more often.

iunwi95r	This article is embarrassing and frankly quite sexist. There is literally zero evidence as to the gender of the navigators. We know that the captain was a man, and we have an article saying that four of five navigators on that ship were women in March 2017. Therefore, the article concludes 4 female navigators were responsible for the incident. It should be obvious why this isn't supported by the evidence, but I will mention some reasons anyway. Firstly, the math doesn't make any sense, the ship had a crew of over 100 people, not 5, so you can't just subtract the seeping male captain from 5 navigators and get 4 incompetent female navigators. The captain was not a navigator, and we don't know how many navigators there were, on the ship or currently on duty. There is also no reason to assume that the people who were on the ship in March 2017 were also on the ship on 8 November 2018, assignments are not necessarily that long, and conscription is never that long.  I was a conscript in the Norwegian army a few years ago, and I can say with certainty that there was no affirmative action or difference in treatment between women and men. The standards were the same, and for my unit they were much higher than the police physical tests cited in the article. I'm a woman and had no problems keeping up with the men, nor did any other woman I encountered.

The OP refused to engage in any sort of discussion with you and other posters who were asking where the misogyny and toxicity were in your post.   All her replies to you and others were merely ad hominem attacks that did nothing to move the discussion forward. Usually the person who resorts to personal insults is the one who feels they cannot defend their ideas or behavior.   This is how a small, yet vocal segment of a certain extreme ideology debate now. They use the same few buzzwords like toxic, gaslighting, abusive, narcissistic, sociopath, etc, to shut down any healthy debate and silence criticism.   They redefine these words to suit their agenda and use them as a cudgel to beat anyone who questions them into silence.  They don't want their beliefs questioned and they definitely don't want to have to defend them.   This is wrong on so many levels because there can be no real learning without debate and exploring one's own beliefs. Actively exploring and examining your beliefs is a basic tenet of learning.   It also minimizes the actaul trauma, abuse, narcissism and sociopathy that people are subjected to and are affected by in exchange for scoring some cheap points in a debate that is circular and never-ending.	1642728376.0	htje0fr	t3_ar0wyp	t3_ar0wyp	/r/MensRights/comments/ar0wyp/posted_a_reply_to_a_guy_on_ramitheasshole_whos/htje0fr/

The name of the survey is really important to getting good results. In the USA, the government changed the name of the 'drug abuse' survey to 'drug use and health' survey. What they found was a lot more people reported behaviours in the renamed survey that should have been captured by the earlier surveys but were not.   We know that a lot of male victims of sexual assault don't consider it to be something as mild as 'shenanigans', rather than an assault or crime.	1642728569.0	htjeg9t	t3_s8n2m1	t1_hthi6th	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n2m1/victims_of_violent_crime_german_statistics_2020/htjeg9t/

bouozf5h	My original comment was only talking about murders, why would I have brought those topics up? I also did address drafts laws in a conversation with a different user. Feminism itself is meant to uplift women, not to bring down men. Organizations to help women were created because women in order to give them an equal opportunity to recover, as they were seen as second-class citizens and unworthy of rights for the longest time. Equality is much more prevalent today, and to you it may not seem as though women need these organizations. However they were very much needed at the time they were established.	1642729577.0	htjgsfz	t3_s78o8f	t1_htjecfw	/r/MensRights/comments/s78o8f/no_for_the_last_time_men_do_not_get_killed_less/htjgsfz/

But it is possible to to have stomach reduction, or liposuction.  Drastic stuff, and should only be last resort (as in your health is at risk and there’s no other way).  But what’s the “height increasing” equivalent?  Having your legs and arms cut and inserts added?  What do you do about nerves?  Adding artificial discs to the spine?  This is way WAY more drastic than what I’ve mentioned above as surgical “solutions” to obesity.  Certainly you cannot make any significant increase to your height through something like diet, lifestyle or an exercise program.    I don’t minimise the difficulty in losing weight.  But to pretend it’s no easier to control than one’s height is ridiculous.	1642731680.0	htjlm8b	t3_s7qmtd	t1_hthcjrp	/r/MensRights/comments/s7qmtd/my_history_teacher_just_brainwashed_the_entire/htjlm8b/

3eq6aksv	What do you mean by 'being a feminist"? Do you mean "believing in men/women equality"? Because that's not "being a feminist". Feminism is an ideology, that includes a lot of other things like a hierarchy of oppression or the devil known as the patriarchy. ​   A lot of us are former feminists. That is, feminists in its "feminism is about equality between men and women" meaning. We left because it ended up being a religion assuming that gender roles are the ONE thing causing any existing problem in the world, assuming that the patriarchy exists and is the root of all problems, etc.  If that's not the kind of feminist you were, well, you were never a feminist in the first place. That's how it is. Study feminist theory for a while and you'll see what "feminism" really is. It's not just about equality. It includes a TON of postulates that you have to accept as an universal truth as well.	1642732035.0	htjmfk3	t3_s8bbyd	t1_htiewhp	/r/MensRights/comments/s8bbyd/i_feel_like_misandry_is_starting_to_become_a/htjmfk3/

These sexists who cry so much about oppression seem to forget what oppression even means the second it might involve acknowledging men's issues.  Group A: Compelled to fight in war in the event of a draft.   Group B: Has the option, but not the obligation, to serve in the military at all times.  Which group is being discriminated against here?  The person you were talking to would say "B."  In the U.S., we've *let* women serve in our military for a while now.  Only men can be compelled.  They're spouting nonsense to portray every issue that affects men as a women's issue.

46a6opwn	As you say, those articles are POV, but they are not evidence.  The studies mentioned as to actual differences between men and women in spatial awareness and other factors are perhaps greater evidence that men and women are most optimally suited to different roles. It's not hate speech to identify this reality, or sexism or discrimination to believe that critical occupations require maximised, focused skills.  It's a nice idea that women should be able to do everything a man can and vice versa, but biological differences do not support that fantasy. That doesn't mean women or men are less than the other, only that they are more complementary with the combination potentially being greater than the sum of the parts.  Naval accidents are sufficiently rare to not be able to point definitively at female incompetence at the job as the cause.	1642733657.0	htjq7cu	t3_s8uxwj	t1_htjepns	/r/MensRights/comments/s8uxwj/the_knm_helge_ingstad_catastrophe_a_consequence/htjq7cu/

13dncz	Did they actually change anything though? I can't tell if that second article is based on exactly the same tweet response included in the first article: "Where there is any concern raised by the customer, they receive the highest level of care and priority".  ie. Their policy was always to prioritise anyone who raised concerns about safety. The second article just reframes that as "Women are top priority".... when they raise concerns (which was always the policy).  What do you think? Anyway - If the headline alone *was* true at face value, it would be a shame because I bet *every other* procedure they have for prioritising call-outs is based on realistic needs. And this would be entirely based on a false belief held by a minority of the public; who have the power to exert so much pressure, that they can enforce it.	1642735806.0	htjv1tw	t3_s8ihes	t1_htiz3qk	/r/MensRights/comments/s8ihes/uk_fury_as_aa_says_it_does_not_prioritise_a_lone/htjv1tw/
6vmx5	I hear women talk about unrealistic body standards all the time but all a woman has to do to have a nice body is not get fat.

3enu2fz6	Of course genetics plays a role. However, if you are aware that these are bodies largely enhanced by lighting, dehydration, between-scenes pumps, and PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS, then the bodies just become part of the detachment from reality.  However, what many perceive to be "unrealistic" is just a fit dude with a six pack. It's no different than girls stroking the ego of fat chicks on Tik Tok, then shaming the hot girls because they hurt body positivity or some shit.   Getting to 10% body fat isn't unrealistic. Hard, absolutely, but not unrealistic. Expecting to make the progress that these dudes make, at their age, in the *stated* time frames, is unrealistic. If celebrities actually cared about this topic, they'd come out and say "I, Chris Hemsworth/Dwayne Johnson/Hugh Jackman/Etc. take steroids to look like this."  Pro tip: If a celebrity says "Chicken, Broccoli, and rice" it's almost always code for steroids. Combine that with ridiculous hours in the gym with no days off. They make it sound super extreme to make their progress naturally believable to normies.	1642735915.0	htjvagk	t3_s8zf5y	t3_s8zf5y	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zf5y/15_famous_men_who_opened_up_about_shirtless/htjvagk/

4h5eu4lg	I’m glad you’re not, and I can see in the rest of the thread you’re willing to listen.  Too often I discuss things with feminists who are in absolute denial.  And they want to cling to the “women are slaves” mantra and exaggerate women’s “oppression” both now and in the past.    Now Coverture certainly limited womens autonomy, in that they couldn’t independently own and run their own property without their husband’s agreement.  But it’s forgotten that widows and single woman could, and did, own property, sign contracts in their own right and otherwise have full control over their financial life.    As far as I’m concerned, the truth should be enough, without seeking to exaggerate, claiming it was “all women” as opposed to those who were married, and that these disabilities had vanished in or by the 1880’s.  I’ve seen feminists here insisting that women couldn’t open a bank account before the 1960’s.  Like my sister’s absurd claim women weren’t “allowed to work” in the 1960’s and before.  It’s ridiculous given that this is within living memory.  Such stuff can only be meant to enrage women against men, and to justify laws and policies that are heavily biased against men.  There can be no other reason to push this line.	1642736156.0	htjvtjp	t3_s7qmtd	t1_hthccia	/r/MensRights/comments/s7qmtd/my_history_teacher_just_brainwashed_the_entire/htjvtjp/

449hp4ox	That's a complex question but I think overall what needs to be engrained into both young men and women's heads is that your manhood is not something that can be taken away from you. You can lose a fight and still be a man. You can be raped and still be a man. You can be gay and still be a man.  You can be bad with women and still be a man. Beard or no beard, tall or short. You are a man.  Look how many men in inner city areas would rather pull out a gun and shoot another man rather than possibly losing a fist fight. In rough areas where your shallow view of masculinity is tested everyday, they can't afford to lose it. When we become so afriad to lose something we will do anything to keep that image, that's when masculinity becomes toxic. That's how we get bullies who believe being a man is being the biggest and strongest person in the room. That's how we end up with single mothers and absent fathers because he thinks being a man means sleeping with the most women. That's how we get incels who beat and kill women because they feel women owe them sex.

4etv6	She doesn't define what "feminizing your man" is or how to carry it out, but she promotes what she sees as it's benefits.  I do think that there are many men who haven't been properly trained how to be good men. We often don't have anyone to teach us proper male hygiene, our mothers often don't teach us how to care for our clothes or dress ourselves in properly fitting clothes, schools don't teach us how to exercise properly, and education fails to give us the culture we need (arts and literature) to be able to hold a reasonable conversation. We also aren't really taught how to have a conversation, because when kids talk in school it's not a conversation, it's reciting things back or whispers while being told to shut up.	1642736413.0	htjwdsf	t3_s8pk5a	t3_s8pk5a	/r/MensRights/comments/s8pk5a/benefits_of_feminizing_your_husband_11_surprising/htjwdsf/

7o73xhl8	How can it be 'normal' when it goes against the biological drive of both men and women? Especially women?  There is no social or legal protection for men who decide to stay home.     SAHMs often get full custody, alimony, child support...    Men are denied custody or have to fight for 50-50 custody.     A SAHD will lose his financial support in event of a divorce. Women are protected by family courts, men are not.     The two problems I pointed out were.   1- No legal or financial support for SAHDs (at least even 10% that of SAHMs).      2- Biological imperatives of women make them seem higher earning spouse (than her). Marriage with a lower earning man or SAHD fail at higher rates.     3- If the above issues are corrected then may be man will stay home.     You are trying to reverse the order by making the 3rd event happen without removing events 1 and 2.... Which are its root cause.     Cause preceeds effects.. Basic common sense...     If you cant remove the cause (event 1 and 2) you cannot prevent the effect (event 3).

Meanwhile, nothing happens to the women throwing out these accusations, needless to say, it creates a massive imbalance.	1642741288.0	htk6h4c	t3_s8zl72	t1_htk22i8	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zl72/they_somehow_twisted_a_mens_rights_issue_to_make/htk6h4c/

Feminism and Feminist will take female to such a hell hole that it would be difficult for them to even recover .  I always give example of Iran that how a progressive society under Shah was destroyed and Feminist were the part of it .  Look at Afghanistan every one knows what is the situation of women there but have you seen any reactions from feminazi yet NOPE .They would destroy traditional marriage and system and later in their 40's and 50'z realise that they are alone with no family no children to take care and then they would say I wish I would have settled down	1642741323.0	htk6jkk	t3_s8zt0i	t1_htk37lk	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/htk6jkk/

Some women are fit enough to be infanteers, but most simply can't handle the weight. British soldiers in Afghanistan were carrying 40kg+ of equipment (sometimes much more). I don't think I've ever known a woman that could manage that amount of weight and still be able to fight. Not to say there aren't exceptions, and of course there will be, but mixed units is risky from a psychological standpoint. If we got into a WW2 style scenario and we're taking mass casualties, nobody would tolerate the female death count, not least the men on the ground.

It's not that men are sad that they cant rape their wives anymore. 43% of rape cases in Haryana (so called worst state for women) were false and the new marital rape law only gives more opportunity to women to falsely accuse men of rape. The law doesn't even recognize men as victims of marital rape or any rape for that matter.	1642745397.0	htkdy49	t3_s8m66i	t3_s8m66i	/r/MensRights/comments/s8m66i/india_plans_to_criminalize_marital_rape_so_some/htkdy49/

Also it's funny how they always bitch and moan about "bodily autonomy" and how they "shouldn't be forced to fuck one human for the rest of their lives", but they all promise that with their own lips, at the altar. Nobody is forcing them to get married, but they do anyway, because they want that sweet, sweet alimony. And let's not forget how they all expect you to take care of them during and even after the marriage, but when it's their time to hold up their end of the bargain, they scream about marital rape. And of course, if you get it anywhere else, you're cheating scum, because you're a man and you don't need affection.

796eeiay	So basically the #MarriageStrike is in retaliation to women in India are pushing for marital rape to be made into a law as it is in many countries.  However, it appears to be redundant "*The Delhi government said a law on marital rape is unnecessary as it is covered by an existing section of the penal code that deals with cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband"*  [https://www.vice.com/en/article/4awn89/india-marital-rape-laws-marriage-strike](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4awn89/india-marital-rape-laws-marriage-strike)  However, to be honest this does seem like more of a womens issue (pushing for a marital rape law) and less of a mans issue (men worrying about false accusations if it happens).

7o73xhl8	Although I follow MGTOW principles (like no marriage, no cohabitation), I think MGTOW shouldn't be use as a leverage to achieve gender-equality for men.     The very existence of MGTOW is a testimony to the failure of MRM.      By the time MGTOW becomes strong enough to affect our policy decisions, it will 'too late'. This is **by design** (of MGTOW) not an after effect..  As MRAs we should convince the society to care about mens issues long before they realize it because of MGTOWs...    MGTOW's success will cause some sort of reset (or even collapse) of our society. And we will go back to traditional patriarchy as countries and state split apart to survive.     That's is not the goal of MRA. I think we can achieve a middle-ground before it becomes inevitable..    The ultimate effect of this gender- war is not matriarchy, its anarchy.. And we should all strive to avoid that fate.	1642746574.0	htkfvef	t3_s8zt0i	t1_htk6jkk	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/htkfvef/

dmt0p	One of the key concepts of the book (The right to sex) is fuckability. Patriarchy, so we are told, has made some bodies fucakble and others not. So, for example "women with dicks" are not fuckable within the lesbian community, because patriarchy.   Another key idea is that white men (who are the evil ones in all possible respects) think that they are entitled to women bodies. And patriarchy has convinced many women think so too. Can an Oxford professor really be this far removed from reality?  When I read the book the obvious bias, in my opinion, rises from the fact that her body is fuckable. So, she has no idea how the world looks like for those who are not particularly fuckable, as is the case with most men. So, she's ate same time right (standpoint matters) and wrong (because she's unable to see her own privileged position).

That is not a feminist belief, it’s a patriarchal belief. Feminists and men’s rights activists are both against this type of thinking, sometimes the father is more capable than the mother.

ena7ot5m	I agree to this point that MRA have failed but you see the real reasons why MGTOW came to existance .When you will categorise all the men under one things like " ALL MEN ARE PIG ,DOG RAPIST " " A WOMEN NEED MEN IS SIMILAR TO A FISH NEED BYCYCLE" . Definately the other side will also get polarised . Usually what Feminist have done and achieved is to make all the nice men,men with good heart who are caring , loving  go on to the path of MGTOW .For years the feminist have made women to conceive on the notion that they don't need marriage instead focus in their career but as soon as MGTOW conceived this notion the situation got reversed   MRA is a failure not because they lacked the efforts but their voice were unheard .They were suppressed and mocked .So they took the same path.The Panic that women are giving to this by ridiculing it , mocking it , shaming it is only adding fuel to the fire   EQUAL RIGHTS COMES WITH EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND OVER THE YEARS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS  RESPONSIBILITY IS KRYPTONITE FOR MEN.  IT IS NOT LIKE WOMEN ARE NOT SEEING THIS PROBLEM .MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE SON ARE FACING THIS ISSUE OF CONSTANT BACKLASH AGAINST THEIR SON   maybe 10-20 years down the line the women will see how feminism has beaded them .Just ask a Iranian feminist who was present in Iran in 60's and 70's who have seen Shah of Iran .They will cry like hell for not supporting Shah .They will laugh at western feminist for calling Hizab a choice and all of their shenanigans.  It also depend on geopolitics to some extent .As soon as US will downfall and China would replace it .The Western value will collapse like anything   Feminist talk about equality but there action always seems otherwise .If your movement shred responsibility then your entire generation will pay the price	1642747852.0	htkhui4	t3_s8zt0i	t1_htkfvef	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/htkhui4/

ch81q55l	Except mainstream media (such as tv, newspapers etc) are the ones who have the most power. Tell any person that 79% of homicide victims are men, and majority won't believe you. Why? Because mainstream media only reports on female victims (white female victims, which makes it a race issue as well tbh), but the point is, this is a perfect example of how men's issues are ignored and society gets a false perception. Society knows that we need to teach women to protect themselves, but no one teaches men this as well (which we need to start doing). This directly contributes to the high male homicide rate, because many men are taught that they don't need to take precautions on the streets, because they are indirectly taught that nothing will happen to them (even though men make up nearly 4 in 5 homicide victims).	1642748358.0	htkilio	t3_s8a84q	t1_htghlo3	/r/MensRights/comments/s8a84q/the_struggles_of_traditional_male_roles_are/htkilio/

But as long as feminism remains politically strong, MRAs will not make much headway. (Case in point- recent defense bill and draft)....  A lot of conservatives are now supporting MRAs, but they aren't fully supporting it...     As long as MRAs remain dependent on conservatives, we will never achieve much headway. (Again the defense bill is a case in point)...  MGTOW is a logical outcome of this. That's what us happening.     But it wont solve the issue.. It will aggreviate the issue to the point where feminists cannot handle it anymore.    Then they will demand more authorative govts (exactly what they are doing now) hoping that it will be authorative only against men.    But authorative govts are a double-edge sword. (Case in point- Hitler). Sooner or later that bubble will burst, forcing society to acknowlege MGTOW... It will be too late by that point.    A collapse will be inevitable..     Idk how we can reverse it... As of now, all paths seem to lead in only one direction....   May be we might get lucky to get an authorative govt in men's favour. But its a small chance..

Lesbian women have higher divorce rates (more than double) than gay male couples and I think even higher than straight male/female couples. So clearly women initiate divorce at a much higher rate than men ACROSS the spectrum **regardless** of gender or creed. I found this especially fascinating because based on all we know and the way the media and feminists portray women as impeccable and flawless you would think that putting 2 women together would be unstoppable in terms of quality of marriage.

6cf5vpmu	If people knew how to read, they'd understand that the protest is happening not because 'men want to keep raping their wives', it's because the laws in India are very female centred. Definition of rape in Indian law is the forced insertion of a man's penis into a woman's vagina. That's it nothing else. Puts the men at an obvious disadvantage. And all they've been asking for is for the laws to be gender neutral. No one is actually supporting marital rape.   There are 100s of reports of females falsely accusing men of SA and walking away with a slap on the wrist. And the courts have ruled multiple times that the man must pay support to the wife even if she makes more than him. Why would anyone want to do this to themselves? Of course people would protest. But then again that subreddit is blinded by its hate for men and refuses to see the full picture. I cannot understand why it's so hard to treat people as more then just their genitals.

I clearly have no problem with the marital rape law. The only problem is I am 16 and it seems it's only focus is "minority women" for vote bank rather than actually doing something. Our constitution doesn't recognizes men getting raped, so it also added as oil in the already hot fire.

At 21 I was dating girls of my age.  At 25 I was dating girls of 22-23.  I met my future wife when she was 24, and I was 29.	1642749133.0	htkjq49	t3_s8qudw	t3_s8qudw	/r/MensRights/comments/s8qudw/is_it_unprincipled_for_people_to/htkjq49/

For example look at Afganistan,Iran ,Saudi,UAE .Even during Hitler Germany the women were considered only for child bearing for Aryan birthline.In Soviets women were working in dangerous sectors such as coal mine and steel mines (which of these sectors western women will.want to go) and although the Soviet society promoted equality the reality was far away from it .Not one women was there in the polit buero and the rights of the women was supressed   Recent example if Putin how he has suppressed  the women movement how he has changed the domestic violence bill and sort of decrimalised it .  Look how China censored the voice of women when the wanted to speak they were immediately shut down .   https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/100165360  https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/09/putins-war-on-women/	1642749820.0	htkkpeb	t3_s8zt0i	t1_htkizmg	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/htkkpeb/

This is true for Hitler, Putin, Kim-Jong-Yu, and also for China.    The feminism-directed authoratian govt will put more restrictions on men, including possible bachelor tax, and poor access to birth control (for men).    It will fail, but men wont succeed. It will fail because men will loose faith in such a govt. And the govt will gradually loose its power and authority.    The actions the govt takes to get back its authority, is what that will lead to anarchy. By that time the civilization will be at the brink of collapse..     That is what MGTOWs will do. Unless we MRAs can prevent it.     The govt and socoety knows that, that's why they try to censor MGTOW. Not because they are 'terrorists'... But because the society knows exactly what MGTOWs are capable of..

Different means different.  >I'm sorry, I have no earthly idea what that means. Could you rephrase or elaborate it?  Most of "liberation"  movements are in one way or another, connected to good old humanistic philosophy, that took main place in Western worldview circa Restoration age.  It places human and human personality in the center of their value system. But by the end of the epoch, several schools of humanism got it too far, to proclaim, that human mind is something of a more value than human instincts, etc, so the former is irrelevant and is to be edited, changed and so on, to serve the mind.  It is a simplification, but main idea was like I said above.  This though, that "we are not animals", is an underlying idea that modern left took consciously or unconsciously into their ideologies.  This idea is wrong in the core. We are animals. Sentiment animals. There is no actually contradiction between to statements. Therefore both aspect of human being - "human" and "animal" - are equally important. ( In reality there are no two separate aspects even, there is just a continuum from one stage to another).	1642751578.0	htkn5pu	t3_s8qudw	t1_htkkx8i	/r/MensRights/comments/s8qudw/is_it_unprincipled_for_people_to/htkn5pu/

The working class is always oppressed under these regime  but not in terms of paying alimony or getting divorced but on the terms of wages , working condition etc .That is the style of these regime working .In China there is no workers' right.They can't form unions and demand any working incentive .But so is the case of Japan who work there ass off in democratic system that completely screwed their family values .  I would talk specifically about China how it reversed One child policy and encouraging couples to produce 3 children .They have fixed the work hours to 40/ week so that couples can focus on their family. China developed a efficient high speed rail network , manufacturing industry and US was mute spectator   Weibo has banned cis men who have Feminist attitude .Look at the ad of Chinese millitary and that of US millitary .Who is promoting masculinity   There was a joke that I read somewhere  China- We have tanks Russia - We also have tanks US and western countries- I IDENTIFY AS TANK    MGTOW will not stop by these tactics .It will only halt if government and judiciary process takes neutral stand in case of divorce ,child support, alimony ,rape and other female issue .IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WHEN ORTHODOX TAKE UP MGTOW AND WHAT WILL HAPPEND IN DEMOCRACY ACROSS THE GLOBE WILL BE SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAN	1642751803.0	htkngma	t3_s8zt0i	t1_htkm7jo	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/htkngma/

Well, a bit weird, for example in the first article the law says that on ever relation between a man and a woman the woman is assumed to be always in a position of inferiority because men are more dominant. But it is extremely rare that a woman sue her boss without any reason, there r only a few cases when this happen and those cases r using for the extremist right to attack the law. The problem is that some articles of this law go against our constitucional rights, the law break the equality between men and women, it's a complicated topic of discussion here (like in any other country I guess).

4smqr1ik	Most films aren't based in anything resembling reality. The serious actors should refuse to be ripped unless it's absolutely required for the role (like Arnie was always jacked even playing somewhat regular guys which was absurd and generally left unexplained). But I agree that it's bullshit that the actors aren't honest about it. I am tired of the famous, really good-looking 'movie star' actors (e.g. Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot who are always in awful, overbudgeted garbage and can barely act). They don't look like anyone I know or interact with  excepting the outliers. I'd rather see something realistic, or an ironic take on their egos and need to be beautiful to sell mediocre films while they profit obscenely. But I think many of the star's egos won't let them commit and play a regular, schlubby person.	1642752144.0	htknx76	t3_s8zf5y	t3_s8zf5y	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zf5y/15_famous_men_who_opened_up_about_shirtless/htknx76/

99josor0	>Equality is a chimera, aside from equality before law, of course. People are different.  I hope you're not using "different" as an excuse for double standards. Women being "different" is no excuse for shit behavior, when they themselves claim to not be different, whenever it suits them. I don't know, maybe I'm understanding this wrong. You tend to use big words and English is not my first language.   >This though, that "we are not animals", is an underlying idea that modern left took consciously or unconsciously into their ideologies.  When I say "we're not animals", I don't mean that we're literally something else, in the same sense that plants are "not animals". Of course we're animals. And yes, a lot of our behavior is instinctual. But we're also supposedly more evolved than your run of the mill mammal that can't even produce fire. They use this to shame men into compliance. (They being feminists, leftists, mainstream media or whoever.) But the same people are using the contrary, the animal instincts, to excuse or even praise women for filthy behavior. For example a woman scoring a rich guy is seen as successful, not as being a gold digger. But a man having multiple girlfriends isn't viewed as "successful", but rather it's severely frowned upon, even by other males sometimes. He's automatically a sexist pig that thinks of only one thing. Like no shit, lions kill their own offspring to get the female to go in heat again, black widdow males literally die for reproduction and I think mantises too? The one with scythe like limbs.  >This idea is wrong in the core. We are animals. Sentiment animals.  Look, I'm not contradicting you.

Sometimes they actually wheel the baby out of the room,  only when queried by the mother are they told its for 'his' circumcision!

99josor0	>Women and men are different, therefore, they need a lot of things done differently. Like it is obvious, that female-oriented psychological consulting is unable to help men, for example. Therefore there should be two branches of psychological consulting.  Please don't misunderstand my words. I've never claimed that women need to get the exact same treatment as men everywhere. I understand that the biological differences create the need for different branches in something like medicine for example. Except perhaps in courts. Of any kind. But promoting sexual liberation and progressive bullshit for women, while telling men that "real men" have to be workhorses that bend over backwards for women, that's just wrong. Women asked to be self sufficient. To not need men. They got what they wanted. They themselves have removed the reason for them to demand or deserve a rich guy. Unless you count greed and selfishness. But we all know that women only want equality when it suits them. When men are shamed for going by their sexual instincts and even get accused of rape when the girl later decides she don't like him anymore, while women get praised for going by their biological imperatives, that double standard is unacceptable. If women want to be like men, let them. It's their choice. But that choice comes with consequences. And they don't get to change their minds when they're on the edge of infertility. They already chose their path. And men shouldn't be shamed for doing what's right for themselves, the same way that women are encouraged to do.  >Ah, in that sence? Of course I agree with you. I even add, that feminists, while, "supposedly fighting for some shit to be better for women", in fact are degrading women to some tribalistic-paleolitic form of society.  I completely agree with you there. In fact I'd go as far as to say that all of these bullshit woke movements do more harm to the demographics they're allegedly protecting. It's the same with feminism, BLM and LGBT. They're all equally hypocritical and disgusting.  >"WhErE aLl GoOd MeN gOnE?!!!"  That always puts a smile on my face and warms my black, dead heart.

27729nce	I'm well aware that there are a few jackasses on twitter saying that.  [Here's another asshole](https://twitter.com/ashrafnansari/status/1483480084094898184) who completely misses that the point of rape is a lack of consent.  But I'm still not seeing any objections *here* to having legal protections against marital rape, nor does every tweet about this topic put misogyny over reason.  Also, regarding it "taking a lot of time"...at some point, the excluded class has a right to speak out.  Imagine if we gave voting rights only to white people, black people protested the bill, and then white people said to the protestors, "sounds like you don't respect the voting rights of white people."  Whose side would you take then?  Men in India (and increasingly, all over the world) are *tired* of gender-neutral laws being constantly kicked down the road, and in some cases even getting blocked by women's groups.  This exact same dialogue played out with genital integrity.  "It's easier to ban FGM, so let's do that, but don't worry, we'll come back to protecting boys someday!"  Thirty years later and not a single fucking law in the world protects baby boys.  The only people even pushing consistently to have a dialogue on MGM are me and two dozen other weirdos who act as dedicated dissent on reddit, because barely anyone on this goddamn planet even wants to fight that battle.  Men in India are protesting because they've decided that the time for governments to stop gendering basic human rights is *now.*  Men are not obligated to sit down and shut up when faced with constant discrimination, and having it twisted into apathy towards women is a disingenuous way for the media to marginalize very legitimate men's issues.	1642756400.0	htktj7o	t3_s8zl72	t1_htksd0f	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zl72/they_somehow_twisted_a_mens_rights_issue_to_make/htktj7o/

But promoting sexual liberation and progressive bullshit for women, while telling men that "real men" have to be workhorses that bend over backwards for women, that's just wrong.  Definitely. If a women is allowed to behave like an ape, why men should not? This is a thing they fail to understand.  By the way, during last several month I have seen a wave of almost similar post highlighting this thing and debunking feminism, as, actually done nothing to "break gender roles" and such.  They did absolutely nothing. They have build nothing new.  They just morally degraded women and enforced more strict version of chivalry on men.  And still shouting about "fuck the gender roles". The clowns.  I, my self, have nothing against some codes of behavior for both sexes, but only **when it is a fair deal** - both sexes have norms enforced on them.  Though, I would prefer instead of punishing those who deviate, utilize uplifting of those who live up to it. This way stabdarts became not restrictive shackles but goals to achieve.  I have a luck to live in such society, and as far as I can see, things are going well on a family sphere. People  can do things when they are young, but by their 27-30th they are mostly settled and live in typical marriage with both working, until the child is born. Then for a period of 5-7 years men works, women keeps the house and cares for the child. Yes she puts her carrier on hold for that time, but sorry, children and family first. We are not oviparous species after all. Then she resumes and by her 40 she is quite on pair with her husband, if she desires so.  >And they don't get to change their minds when they're on the edge of infertility.  That's why I expect such lifestyle to die out in next generation or two. Such women either do not have children, or fuck them up too bad to be succesfull. Meantime adequate people do not by into that bullshit,have  a nice marriages and raise normal children. Guess who wins populational race here?  >I completely agree with you there.

4h5eu4lg	I’m not advocating it.  I tried to talk a friend out of it.  But you cannot say weight is “no more controllable” than height.  It’s simply not true.  A rigid diet and exercise program isn’t easy.  But it works for most people that can stick to it.  Especially if it’s a true lifestyle change, where people become less sedentary.  It’s harder after a certain age as well.  But come on, it is not as hard to control as height is, which is pretty much fixed.  And the sorts of surgeries I described, whilst extreme and expensive, are far less costly and invasive as the sorts of intervention needed to significantly increase height.  Imagine slicing through muscle, sawing through bone, attaching “inserts” to “lengthen” the leg, and then stretching the muscle, nerves etc to accommodate the greater length?  Or having callipers to slowly lengthen legs.  Even more drastic than liposuction, and more expensive too.  Plus most people can significantly lose weight through diet and exercise, certainly if it’s a lifestyle change.  I’ve seen it happen.  You’re not going to gain any significant height with that.  I think the view is that feminists constantly berate men for this whole “fat shaming” thing.  And as feminists they generalise this to the whole male population.  But women are even more negative on height (or lack their of) than men are about a woman’s weight.    I think it’s reasonable to ask feminists (and those women influenced by them) to stop dumping on men in general like that given that women do the same thing regarding height (and with weight to some extent too) especially since height is essentially uncontrollable.  And asking for this to stop, or getting annoyed about this constantly being brought up to “shame men” or attack them is not “oppression olympics”.  More calling out feminist double standards.  That have rather a lot of them.	1642757222.0	htkul18	t3_s7qmtd	t1_htjnak9	/r/MensRights/comments/s7qmtd/my_history_teacher_just_brainwashed_the_entire/htkul18/

In any negotiation you need to have the option to walk away from the table and perhaps more importantly the other side needs to know you have that option. If the feminists think the men don't have have a choice but to participate then what incentive do they have to amend their shitty deal? if they know men can walk away from it all then a rational negotiator would at that point consider some concessions to make the deal palatable enough to the remaining men still at the table.

Women will often defer to the father for the choice since they assume the father knows more about it (ironically, thats far from the truth).   IMO the probability of a mother standing up to the father and saying no to circumcision is very low due to human nature, and due to the father being the same sex.

4h5eu4lg	I think it’s not just being up the past.  It’s misrepresenting it.  Presumably to promote sense of grievance and oppression, and the concept that women are “owed”.  It gives them an excuse to say that even if there are things currently unfair to men (and they usually are in denial about that) they can justify it, or at least justify putting it lower on the list of priorities than whatever “womens issue” they care to mention (such as “manspreading”, “mansplaining”).  It’s also used as justification by genuine man haters, who are quite prevalent in gender studies departments.  I think it’s important for women to realise that the past WAS tough for most women.  But things were much tougher for most people, and the sort of professional and educational opportunities feminists make hay about today were not options for the vast majority of people, and not just because of “sexism, racism and homophobia”, which feminists try to claim is the cause of all “injustice”.	1642762839.0	htl1lh7	t3_s7qmtd	t1_htjytd3	/r/MensRights/comments/s7qmtd/my_history_teacher_just_brainwashed_the_entire/htl1lh7/

4h5eu4lg	Btw women do have total control over reproduction.  Even in the US (and I’m not) most people do not live in Texas or Alabama.  The reason why research in a female contraceptive pill was funded and a male pill was not was because the funding came from a wealthy feminist who wanted women to have control over their fertility.  This means to stop taking the pill if she decides she wants a baby.  It’s not some sort of male oppression of women, it’s actually an attempt to maximise women’s choices.    So not only can women choose to take the pill or not (and yes, I know it can fail, and adversely affect the health of some women).  They can also take the “morning after pill” or, within a reasonable amount of time, have an abortion.  She can also legally put the child up for adoption without reference to anyone else, simply by abandoning the infant at a fire station or police station.  The father of the child has no say at all.  This is current law.  If, on the other hand, she chooses to have the baby, and can identify the father, he is legally compelled to pay child support.  And most feminists are perfectly happy with this and deny there’s a double standard.	1642763492.0	htl2gbg	t3_s7qmtd	t1_htjytd3	/r/MensRights/comments/s7qmtd/my_history_teacher_just_brainwashed_the_entire/htl2gbg/

Whereas if a woman something same, it's still men's fault for making her feel "insecure".     Right now IM not doing good mentally, and instead of logic I am controlled by emotions(for couple of weeks). So, like u genuinely don't have any hate and are just living a normal life right??

Bro, consider me a little child(I actually am, and am not doing good mentally), and like can u tell how long have u been doing this and does it work?     Becuz, the thing u said about avoiding women also applies to MGTOW, but man the way society is it's very hard to be MGTOW. I just feel like there is indeed a pressure to marry and have kids if u wanna have a normal life. So I feel like even men choosing MGTOW, eventually get married and all. So, like do u feel the pressure to change this??     Once again I know Im coming off as very weird, but right now am thinking emotionally tooo much.

7o73xhl8	I never posted on r/mgtow, but posted on MGTOW2. And one thing I can tell you, MGTOWs can never be used a leverage by MRAs...     Most men don't even know what a shitty deal marriage is, until they are halfway into the divorce process.  Nearly 95% are unaware that a non-biological kid born within marriage gets child support from the husband (even if he didn't sign anything).  And 50% are unaware that merely cohabitating with a women for long enough is considered common-law marriage in many jurisdictions.     MGTOW will grow. But it will grow under the radar. Especially due to the rampant censorship.    By the time their number is large enough to affect economy and birth rates it will be game over for the society...    At that point, even if society wants to acknowlege MRAs, it won't have the resources to affect any change.      So, MRAs will never be able to use MGTOW as a leverage.      [Note that birth rates are already falling. Economy will soon follow suit. But its not because of MGTOWs. Their number is very small. Probably 0.0001% of the population.     Until it reaches at least 5%, they cannot used as a leverage. And if and when it reached 5%, say good bye to the society as we know it. ]	1642767579.0	htl8f9r	t3_s8zt0i	t1_htkx7i2	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/htl8f9r/

If your car breaks down, you call the AA, who come to your location and try to fix your car. id they can not fix it, they will tow it, and you to a garage.  In some circumstances, they may also offer a safe place to stay.   Their competition in this field is the R.A.C. (Royal automobile club) and Greenflag. Both of which prioritise women over men, and charge lower fees. Sadly, there really is no where to take my money.  Perhaos someone should start a car recovery clubb for male only drivers.

It's not girls who people assume will be too stupid to care for their own genitals. I'm thankful for men who have the guts to speak about the horrible, shameful, unnecessary practice that IS ABSOLUTELY genital MUTILATION. In most cases female circumcision removes what amounts to a square inch of skin, in the case of a man, the foreskin is 15 square inches. It is taken from you against your will when you're too small to fight back. It's organ theft, as the skin is used however the medical industry sees fit. It's a scam and an injustice that needs to be illegal! And yes, it affects a man's sexual partner as well. I have protested against circumcision several times. This is a hill I will die on.

A tenant of the house where she lived was arrested by the police after she claimed in her statement that she was one of the criminals.  She was involved in a similar case earlier as well and got compensation of Rs 2 lakh from the government 2 lakhs is like 10 grand in indian rupees. Mens literally have no right in india. As an indian guy ik how it will go is you are accused of rape.  Modern indian women are misusing the laws and getting paid for it.  Imagine getting paid for accusing a guy for rape.

I dunno about you, but in my life I've met both men and women who are selfish and entitled and both men and women who are not. Reducing all of humanity to women are one thing and men are the opposite is an incredibly immature way of looking at life.

The navigators on that ship would have been selected based on standardized tests and trained to be navigators by the military. They would not have applied with a CV like if it was a civilian job.

63qix	What does "victimizing" mean to you? I tried to explain my understanding of how such self-hatred comes to be, that's all.  I did not blame "women" for this at any point. The idea that you need to be wary of men is probably as old as civilization. That's what causes Boko Haram to kill all the boys when kidnapping the girls, or atrocities like the [Srebrenica massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre). Otherizing has always been something that was primarily focused on men. Oversimplified, women are easier to assimilate than men, especially in a hostile takeover.  Though, admittedly, in modern times feminism has done a lot of harm by highlighting almost exclusively those negative aspects of masculinity. Ignoring, for example, that most male aggression has it's source in how our ancestors protected us.	1642775130.0	htlnc57	t3_s7bat4	t1_htlkxbn	/r/MensRights/comments/s7bat4/reported_this_tweet_i_came_across_the_other_day/htlnc57/

hzx8rvqp	No they don’t. Abortions are being taken. Female contraception has horrible side effects. Getting your tubes tied is decided by if a man gives you permission. Quite literally you have to have children and be a certain age and have a husbands permission. And if you don’t have kids you can pretty much forget any kind of permanent birth control. And adoption should never be an option. That’s a whole mother mess. And no I totally disagree with them having to pay. I mean me and my bf already worked out if we were to split I get the kid and I won’t ask him to pay because I wanted the kid.

1k237qwq	Look at the indian male context then. They **already are**. Look into how [anti-dowry laws are used to abuse men].(https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-38647822).   When men simply want to be included in rape laws, [they literally get protested].(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms). Indian men aren't fighting for the right to be rapists, they're fighting to have their experience legally acknowledged.   Women (very rightly) want to have rape by a husband considered. Men want to have rape **by anyone** considered. Why can the entire world understand protesting when something affects *their group* but be dumbfounded when another group kicks up a fuss (on twitter no less), to draw attention to their issue.   Rightly or wrongly, those men feel like they have to protest women's progress because otherwise they'll have no leverage to even consider being forced to have sex with someone, rape. And if you do your due diligence, you might understand why.	1642776240.0	htlpyxw	t3_s8zl72	t1_htkvh0u	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zl72/they_somehow_twisted_a_mens_rights_issue_to_make/htlpyxw/

72ghad5b	The protest is done by men, on the grounds that if it becomes law, then women will misuse it to take revenge from their husbands. The situation is made worse, by other two factors -  1. Whenever such a case comes to light, the media by default passes social judgement that the women is right and to gain TRP, destroys total privacy of the person. Due to this, the person loses his job/business and his reputation is destroyed in the society.  2. Indian judiciary by default assumes "Guilty until proven innocent" and on top of thar, Indian Judiciary is a fucking joke where people have to spend years to get justice. Politicians also, to be seen as progressive pass feminist judgement or don't say anything, but doesn't advocate for a fair trial with privacy of both individuals respected.	1642776367.0	htlqa73	t3_s8zl72	t1_htkkuyx	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zl72/they_somehow_twisted_a_mens_rights_issue_to_make/htlqa73/

Most of the time if you ask a woman what a red flag would be, it's going to be extreme or ambiguous, or a personal preference. I.e. not useful. Personal preferences aren't red flags.  A red flag is going to be relatively specific and true for almost everyone across the board. You can tell that her "red flags" list is really just her bitching about her ex/exes.	1642777212.0	htlsdqj	t3_s9b5ya	t3_s9b5ya	/r/MensRights/comments/s9b5ya/red_flags_in_men/htlsdqj/

I cant really just sit here and change the law to prove that I am not against men or consider them less valuable.  and I m also admitting tht women have misused these laws, but will taking them away be the solution? again I m not saying dont bring laws for men or dont make them gender neutral. or that men value less.  I cant change the law with my laptop but I am not against it either  please bring gender neutral laws and criminalise male rape.  just helping few hundred women is good enough for me to keep these laws but ALSO BRING LAWS TO **PROTECT MEN . not saying men are of lesser value (I just dont want women to b oppressed again)**	1642778227.0	htluybf	t3_s8zl72	t1_htlta1m	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zl72/they_somehow_twisted_a_mens_rights_issue_to_make/htluybf/

a10e2	Which bit did you want a source on? With the bit you quoted, that's not what I was saying; that's what some of the Tweets are saying (e.g. one from the article "That would be a fair comment if lone men were equally vulnerable as lone women. They are not. \[...\]").  The rest of my comment was actually based on things I've seen quoted in places like this subreddit. I actually saw this pop up somewhere else (not on Reddit), and nearly commented about it again, but decided I'd have a look for myself at the stats.  It's actually a tiny bit confusing honestly. I can't find anything specific about roadside crimes while people are waiting for their cars to be fixed (though, that might be a longshot for off-the-shelf third-party data). I'm in the UK, so I was interested in stats from there. I found a table of data about violent crime broken down by gender for the year ending March 2020 (so, mostly out of COVID as people stopped going out as much). Turns out, women actually are about just under twice as likely in the UK to be victims of violent crime compared to men (that's assault, homicide, sexual offences, rape, and "other sexual offences...").  But, that isn't necessarily indicative of women being at greater risk at the roadside while broken down. How many women end up broken down at the roadside vs. men? Where do women more regularly break down vs. men? Are men more likely to breakdown in generally more dangerous places (not necessarily in terms of likelihood of being victims of violent crime; rather, places like motorways)? This kind of thing will come down to the types of journeys men vs. women typically do, how well they look after their cars, and the kinds of cars that men and women tend to drive.   So basically, I have no idea whether women are or are not at a greater risk haha. Maybe on an individual basis they are? But maybe there are more men being put at risk? (Or maybe not, without the data who knows!)

That shit needs to stop. Men and women are allowed to have female/male friends. And a lot of people don’t believe in marriage. And…and…and…I could break this down all day. Even the valid ones where it’s like, “tell you to shut up/chill/calm down,” women do that too. Like…ugh. So dumb. Just be and a healthy relationship will follow.

People stranded on the side of a road get priority over someone at home that needs a jump start.  Obviously standing on the side of a freeway is dangerous versus sitting in your house with a dead battery or at the mall with a key locked in the car.     Saw it once with AAA here in the states.  They openly on the dispatch asked about these type things and then notified a longer possible wait due to the situation (i.e. keys locked in a car, everyone was in a business meeting for the next 3 hours, not really urgent).	1642784762.0	htmccge	t3_s9aivi	t1_htlg808	/r/MensRights/comments/s9aivi/another_followup_to_the_aa_stuff_ceo_openly/htmccge/

1262us	I had gotten divorced back in 2013. I dated around for a couple of years, but never more than 1 lady at a time. After a bit I met a wonderful woman and after a year we got married. Shortly before and for a couple of years after, my wife would get private messages that I was no good and a cheater. My wife would get upset about this and I told her to just block or ignore them. It finally became apparent that this was a few of these women that I had dated previously and they just wanted to destroy me and my marriage out of spite. It all came to light when they told her I was away cheating on her with another woman, when I was actually home right next to her. The "Mean Girls" mentality doesn't go away after high school. I left social media to prove my fidelity to my wife and just to get away from their drama that they thrive on. Guys don't do that type of thing.	1642784984.0	htmcy8d	t3_s9b5ya	t1_htmakom	/r/MensRights/comments/s9b5ya/red_flags_in_men/htmcy8d/

wny0e	Women call women "females", they call men "males", men call men "males", there is only an issue when a man uses the word "female".   English is my second language, but I think that this word being misogynistic is a fairly new phenomenon, that appeared in the last four or five years. So lot's of men will still slip up and use the words "female" and "woman" interchangeably from time to time. Basically it's a convenient excuse to call someone a woman-hater.  I've seen men get criticized, when they used "female" as an adjective. For example "woman soldiers" sounds wrong, and "soldiers who are women" is kinda awkward to say, but I can't think of any other ways to say it without using "female".	1642786701.0	htmhmub	t3_s9b5ya	t1_htm20qv	/r/MensRights/comments/s9b5ya/red_flags_in_men/htmhmub/

30ymvhrd	One would think feminists would support free choice for women and allowing women to do with their bodies as they wish.    The problem with prostitutes for feminism is that it decreases sex as a leverage in male-female dynamics.   Women freely choosing to have sex also diminishes the feminist argument that women having sex is only due to men oppressing women.  Any woman freely choosing to have sex is therefore an enemy of feminism.	1642787770.0	htmkld0	t3_s9f85m	t3_s9f85m	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htmkld0/

We don’t have to imagine a film where women are insulted, we already live it everyday. They want to have female representation, not to try to silence men. Feminism is about uplifting women, and some how you have perceived it as an attack against men. I think we can agree to disagree, your definition of feminism is far different from mine.	1642787984.0	html6ow	t3_s78o8f	t1_htlzah3	/r/MensRights/comments/s78o8f/no_for_the_last_time_men_do_not_get_killed_less/html6ow/
jq8gpyw	So uh as far as i have read the articles, i guess if a wife engaged pre marital rape (lol what?), She's safe.  And if a husband did that, it's a criminal offense.  The only plausible argument here is that women in India don't do that (they are not as hungry for sex as men), which is kinda far fetched, even considering probability.  Even the definition of rape in sec 375 of Indian penal code starts with a man. Which means, rape cannot be committed by a woman at all.  Here's the link:https://www.indiacode.nic.in/show-data?actid=AC_CEN_5_23_00037_186045_1523266765688&orderno=424  It's hard to talk about equality, when all we focus is on the outcome rather than the opportunity. Law should be amended equally on women too. It's not like men enjoy forceful sex. Just like women don't.	1642788011.0	html9e1	t3_s8zl72	t3_s8zl72	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zl72/they_somehow_twisted_a_mens_rights_issue_to_make/html9e1/

30ymvhrd	An earlier post documented a spokesperson for such a service admitting they claimed to be equal but in reality prioritized women.    It makes me wonder how often I’ve had to sit around waiting for service longer than I should have because women were given priority.     While you are addressing roadside assistance, I’m sure this same bias applies to other assistance as well.     As your situation shows, it’s not just a matter of prioritizing women’s needs above men, but the bias in expecting men to accomplish certain things but not women.    When it comes to changing a tire, the issue typically isn’t strength, it’s whether you have a spare, the right tools, are wearing nice clothes, etc.   In my last instance the mechanism holding the spare tire was broken.   The professionals (men) couldn’t even get it off.   Some economy cars these days don’t even come with spare tires.     If we can’t change the social perceptions that women are more deserving of help and coddling, we will never change the related discrimination against men.   This isn’t just about road side assistance, but affects everything from domestic violence victim resources to education to selective service.	1642790582.0	htms8pt	t3_s9h4di	t3_s9h4di	/r/MensRights/comments/s9h4di/the_sexism_against_men_when_roadside_assistance/htms8pt/

7fryd4ol	Yeah, one really has to wonder.  It's just plain illogical and/or delusional to push for men to be effeminate because women aren't attracted to that kind of man.  They push for control over men, but then are attracted to the man who won't give control to her.  I'm really starting to think many women are as clueless about how women work as many men are.  The only other explanation is it's a way for them to test men to find one who actually has a backbone.   It does seem like a lot of women get very bitter and resentful when they don't find a guy like that who wants them back.    It seems pretty clear that they think winning means women have all the privileges and no responsibilities while men have no privileges and all the responsibilities.   They just fail to realize that if they actually got that, there wouldn't be any men they'd be attracted to.	1642790632.0	htmsd7i	t3_s9f85m	t1_htmd6sz	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htmsd7i/

3enu2fz6	I recently saw a woman post her list of "red flags" where she would immediately reject an online dating profile if the dude wore too many hats in pictures, or took pictures with boats or fish, or didn't have a college degree.  It's very common for men to congregate online and come up with various terms, then those terms make their way into the mainstream only to be misappropriated by dummies (e.g. Grifter is someone popular you disagree with, incel is anyone opposed to feminism even if they have a wife and kids). In this instance, women have formed their own online dating advice market to mirror the market the manosphere created. Difference is, when men talked to each other about red flags, they were objective and mostly measurable and applied near-universally. X-red flag is bad because of Y, and often leads to Z-bad outcome. Let's use some of these "red flags" from women in the formula.  Wearing hats in pics is bad because he might be bald, and bald leads to... something? There formula is really "I think bald icky so no hat cuz bald maybe." Except when she's 35 she's going to be into bald dudes suddenly. Plenty of chicks are turned on by bald dudes. He also might be a fuckin baseball player and like hats. There's no tangible bad outcome that would destroy a relationship that you can discern from being concerned with gold diggers, wearing hats, or enjoying fishing.	1642790742.0	htmsmzq	t3_s9b5ya	t1_htmqfr4	/r/MensRights/comments/s9b5ya/red_flags_in_men/htmsmzq/

They mostly all seemed to like that arrangement when men still played by the old rules and there were plenty of men around willing to marry her when she was ready to settle down and start a family.  They seem to have not anticipated that men would ever adapt.  They seemed to think men's sex drive was so vast they could get away with more and more without limit.  It does seem feminism has split.  One side recognizes women have lost leverage by sex being more available to men without the commitment of marriage.  The other side is the women should be free to do what they want and that promiscuity/onlyfans/etc is somehow empowering.	1642791258.0	htmty01	t3_s9f85m	t1_htmkld0	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htmty01/

She implies that her friend who deserved sex and romance, since she was "popular and beautiful", got it denied, because she was not a ~~Stacy~~ "hot blonde slut".

I thought it was your fault when people won't sleep with you, but I guess that only applies to men. When women don't get sex then it's the fault of societal norms. Societal norms that are influenced by patriarchy, at least in feminist belief. And patriarchy was created by men. So men are at fault that some women aren't desirable. Can't have sex = men bad.   This shit is not even incelish. It's full-on incel. Incel ideology is permissible in large publications as long as it comes from women and stipulates that it's women who are entitled to sex they don't get. Cool.	1642791373.0	htmu8vp	t3_s93vjn	t3_s93vjn	/r/MensRights/comments/s93vjn/amia_srinivasan_is_definitely_fuckable_so_isnt/htmu8vp/
30ymvhrd	From an evolutionary and biology perspective, it advantages men to spread their seed by having sex sex with lots of women.  Women in contrast, benefit by finding a guy who will stick around to provide for her and the limited number of children she can have.    The institution of marriage itself, even without the legal biases is enforcing the woman’s side.    We have of course increased this bias by penalizing men in family law including, child custody, child support, alimony and division of assets.  It’s no wonder most divorces are initiated by women; they stand the most to gain.     You mention the above but more importantly touch on some other biases not so often acknowledged.    A wife can claim she’s only going to stop working temporarily, but if she refuses to go back to work, there’s nothing a husband can do.  To tell her she needs to earn even her own grocery money can be considered spousal abuse, but of course if she refuses sex or stops doing chores, that’s not considered abuse.  He needs to hold up his side, but she doesn’t.     I’m so glad I became aware of these biases before I ever was ever pushed to marry.  Too many men learn the hard way.	1642791570.0	htmurzg	t3_s9gjdh	t3_s9gjdh	/r/MensRights/comments/s9gjdh/how_a_marriage_turns_into_losing_everything/htmurzg/
hpnj6hd5	You literally went directly into insulting the OP in which the OP had done nothing to contribute to your reaction and then made the claim that downvotes are the norm because people just have something against you for "being right".  Could you have been right? Might've but you don't see me ever going out of my way to insult people because I merely disagree with them unless we actively are trading blows and it warrants it.   You say no one has the power to play with your emotions but on the flip side felt strongly enough about a post that elicited feelings from you in which you had decided to let come through and insult someone for asking for a reasonable opinion on whether or not you feel that what the said commenter is saying is agreeable or not.     I'm not here to tell you that you can't agree or disagree with the post's actual content and force you to have an opinion on said matter itself. But it's entirely hypocritical to actively participate in something, complain about a behavior someone is doing, do nothing about what you are complaining about i.e removing yourself from the environment or pushing for a genuine change, and then call people names.   I certainly wish to hear opposing genuine opinions on this sub that provide context and understanding to everything going on in the world because the more we understand things the better we can go about handling things. If you make a statement on something and don't prove it and don't actively care to prove it when you are trying to be controversial you aren't being any better than the people who echo chamber here.   I respect how you feel about this sub and certainly understand that it can feel frustrating to be an opposing opinion considering opposing sides do the same thing in other subs and it's just not productive. But this sub isn't the specific reason you are getting downvoted and more a general behavior Reddit as a whole does.	1642791591.0	htmuu04	t3_s8n8iv	t1_htmslos	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n8iv/your_thoughts_on_this_agree_or_disagree/htmuu04/

So anything we buy has a European plug but we need it changed to a UK plug.  My father taught me how to change plugs when I was a very young kid but many people don't know how to change them.

3sd02e18	Not a fact. Yes women do face mysoginy, but in these days men face more misandry. And feminism literally says they want equality, yet all they do is attack men. Also, feminists harassed a women because she tried to make a homeless shelter for men not so long ago. So no, feminism does not help women either. Feminism is a sexist movement.  Also I found this copy-pasta that fits here:  " *I don't think the feminists you are thinking of represent feminism.  So you call yourself a feminist. Okay.  Let me leave you, then, with a most excellent copypasta from /u/girlwriteswhat:  So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not "real feminists".  That's not just "no true Scotsman". That's delusional self deception.  Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.  But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: "Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating," and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, "we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls."  You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.  You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were "ambivalent about their sexual desires" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.  You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.  You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.  You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.  You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.  You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.  You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's "part of her sexual history."  You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is "not a crime" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a "legal" way to rape them.  And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.  You're the true feminist. Some random person on the internet.  Feminism is lead and ruled by those feminists you claim to deplore. The entire system is rotten"  Btw, you too had some good points. Also, nice job keeping this argument civilised.	1642796173.0	htn7ewr	t3_s78o8f	t1_htmyqvg	/r/MensRights/comments/s78o8f/no_for_the_last_time_men_do_not_get_killed_less/htn7ewr/

i3uus6e3	I'll be honest, I used to stop and help anybody who had a flat tire or other car trouble. At some point, I stopped helping if there was already a man present, which made sense in my generation when we still have things like shop class in school.

532dt	I think it’s a mistake to assume there is any sort of split.  It’s just a matter of convenience, so individual feminists will lean whichever way favors their interests at that moment.    We frequently get told that “feminism is a big umbrella” and there are lots of different kinds of feminists beneath it, but there the differences of opinion tend to be temporary depending on situation.  Feminists are lot more uniform than they want to admit.	1642800660.0	htnjxlx	t3_s9f85m	t1_htmty01	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htnjxlx/

9f7pdqbg	My basis is that of all cases brought to court, 43% result in a conviction, compared to 88% of other cases. That's very a very low rate. So we can assume that it's because juries are unwilling to convict on evidence that essentially rests on  two conflicting accounts with no witnesses. Or that half of women are lying.  Personally, I'm going with the first option. I was called to jury duty on an attempted rape case when was I 18 (barely on the electoral roll!) and it was so difficult. You're so aware that you have no real evidence and you'd rather let the accused go than ruin a life.

e095iqhj	I’m not talking about the laws 100 years ago, I’m talking about the laws now. In case you didn’t know, things have changed a little bit since then.   A main value of feminism is that gender roles should be non-existent, so why would feminists lobby for kids to ONLY go the moms? That’s clearly catering to societal gender norms, which feminists do not believe in.   Like you said, in the past kids would ALWAYS go to the dad- that’s what feminists lobbied against. Every situation is different, some times the mother is the better option and vice versa. But the kids staying with the mother wasn’t even an option back then. The original feminists just wanted it to be an equal opportunity for both genders to have primary custody. And like you said, the main reason the law made it so kids went to the fathers in a divorce is because the mother had literally no way of financial supporting them. That was the reason fathers were favored by law. Now that women have opportunities to provide for themselves and others, and child support became a thing, laws changed. It now favors the mother because according to patriarchal gender norms, they are better at child rearing. These laws only changed because of the financial thing, women were always seen are better caregivers but in the past they had no feasible way to support a family on their own.  This is a rare issue that both sides can agree on, so I don’t know why your are trying be even more divisive.   You are ignoring the fact that the problem I had with your original comment was that you compared feminism to slavery, which diminishes the horrors that poc have gone thought. You cant compare that to a social movement you don’t agree with. Are men enslaved by women? Like legally considered to be the property of women? Are men physically abused and forced into labor for free by women? No. It is extremely disrespectful to poc to compare these two things. I don’t care how “normal” slavery was back then, it was still just as wrong.	1642801224.0	htnlidf	t3_s74mg9	t1_htlorny	/r/MensRights/comments/s74mg9/how_has_feminism_helped_men/htnlidf/

"Equal pay isn't about getting paid the same, it's about equity." Women want to be treated the same as long as it benefits them, when it doesn't they want a boost (equity) of something to make sure the outcome is equal to the best a man can get. In this case equity means getting preferential treatment (extra than what a man would receive) due to the *perceived* unequal threat they face.	1642801917.0	htnnf99	t3_s9awfx	t1_htlmser	/r/MensRights/comments/s9awfx/road_side_assistance_is_sexist_her_car_broke_down/htnnf99/

532dt	Eh.  This sucks, but it is what it is.    Men’s opinion on men’s issues is ignored at best, but more commonly ridiculed.  Appealing to women and leaning on the voices of female MRAs is often the only practical way forward.    Men have a lot to offer, but society demands even more.  The ability to sympathize with men is explicitly discouraged by many different factions.  It’s not just feminists, it’s everyone that wants something done for them, paid for them, or suffered for them. Squeezing value out of men while minimizing rewards for their effort is the fuel that society feeds on.  Feeling sympathy for your food is inconvenient, so they don’t.	1642802076.0	htnnuyp	t3_s906fn	t3_s906fn	/r/MensRights/comments/s906fn/men_circumcised_women_most_affected/htnnuyp/

14yvdqhi	There's a very good reason that (from the outside looking in) there seems to be a lot of hypocrisy (and there is) in feminism around the subject of women's sexuality and promiscuity. I believe we have the emergence of onlyfans existing in stark contrast to all the efforts to crim the "sexual objectification of women" causing a large number of people to experience cognitive dissonance.      This dichotomy in feminism started around the 90s. The feminist ideologues (like Dworkin, Daly, Atkinson, de Beauvoir, Greer, MacKinnon, Bindel, Jeffreys, etc) had been busy describing "Tha Patriarchy" and all the ways in which women suffered under it, ^(supposedly.)     Pornography became one of the leading topics by the 90s, and this led to the split which could be essentially described as "sex-positive feminism" vs "anti-porn / sex-negative feminism."     The sex-positive side believes that sexual freedom is an essential component of women's freedom. They oppose legal or social efforts to control sexual activities between consenting adults. And that in doing so deliberately fight against the oppressive control of sexuality by, you guessed it, Tha Patriarchy.     The other side believes that female sexual promiscuity is an extension of male privilege, male dominance, and further promotes misogyny, rape, violence against women, so on and so forth, which is also Tha Patriarchy.   **This is actually a great example of showcasing how despite all the different feminist subgroups, the core ideology remains the same.**  Both sex-positive and the sex-negative/anti-porn feminists agree on the core tenets of feminism: that women are oppressed, and men are the ones oppressing them. *They just have different ideas on what the solution is.*	1642803451.0	htnrl4c	t3_s9f85m	t1_htmty01	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htnrl4c/
30ymvhrd	Some men don’t follow laws, some women don’t follow laws.  Men drive more than women, so get in more accidents.   The point however:   the gap between men and women dying is decreasing not because women are more at risk, the gap is lowering because increased vehicle and highway safety measures are lowering overall fatalities.    Both men and women are less likely to die, it’s just numerically less significant for women because women have always represented a lower percentage of motor vehicle fatalities.	1642803475.0	htnrniy	t3_s9l7ih	t1_htnoz5w	/r/MensRights/comments/s9l7ih/having_breasts_does_not_affect_the_effectiveness/htnrniy/

It’s something that I had spent some amount of time researching and talking with feminist colleagues about because it was baffling to see only fans being celebrated but “objectification of women” being demonised.	1642803814.0	htnskdv	t3_s9f85m	t1_htns5b0	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htnskdv/
ihf9ii1w	Was there ever a "good" wave of feminism? Karen Straughan argues that even first wave feminists were highly selective in their demands for "equality"  Karen aka u/girlwriteswhat posted this on R/MensRights last week.  I thought it deserved its own thread.  TL;DR -- All of the perks, none of the responsibilities.   Same as it ever was.  1st wave feminists:  1. ⁠⁠Won the right for married women to own their own property and income, and hold it separate from their husband's control. [Yet] maintained the legal entitlement of married women to be supported financially by their husband. (Otherwise known as, "what's mine is mine and what's yours is ours.) Her entitlement to his support even extended to the tax burden on her property and income--property and income he was legally prohibited from touching.  So basically, instead of demanding equal rights as administrators of the marital income and property, they demanded the rights of unmarried persons without the responsibilities, and the rights of married women without accompanying responsibilities. Men were still held to their responsibility as sole provider for the family, including the wife, but now had to do it without access to their wives' incomes and property.  There were men sent to prison in the UK for tax evasion for being unable to pay the taxes owing on the property/income of their wealthier wives. One suffragette, Dr. Elizabeth Wilks even refused (as was her right under the law) to provide her husband with the necessary documentation so he could calculate the taxes, and given that he was a schoolteacher and responsible for paying for everything else, he couldn't have afforded to pay it regardless.  While he was in prison, she urged other suffragettes to do what she had. He was released from prison on humanitarian grounds due to his failing health, and died a few months later.  2) Won default mother custody of young children upon divorce or separation. Previously, the assumption was of paternal custody since the father was solely burdened with financial responsibility for their care.  Of course, it was only custody that was changed--financial responsibility still fell 100% to the father to maintain the household of his minor children. Since his ex was head of that household, he was now forced to continue supporting her even if she was at fault for the breakdown of the marriage.  So again, we went from the man having superior rights and greater responsibility, to the man having inferior rights and still having greater responsibility.  Hilariously, in 1910, after these two legal innovations had been in effect in NY State for close to 40 years, a suffragette lawyer (yes, before women were allowed to get an education and all...) wrote in the Times that the law still discriminated against women on the matter of children. How did the law do so? The only area of the law at that time that did not consider mothers at least equal custodians and guardians were the provisions granting the father control over the minor children's income and property. Basically, the law saw him as 100% responsible for feeding, clothing and sheltering the children, therefore it gave him 100% of the right to manage their money for that end.  A woman could, at that time, go to court and demonstrate that her husband had legally abandoned his financial responsibility to her and the kids, and there were provisions for transferring said rights to manage the children's income/property to her in such cases (and in the worst cases the man could end up in prison for refusing to support his family to the best of his ability). But this suffragette wanted the laws themselves changed such that wives (who bore no legal financial responsibility toward their children, or even themselves) have equal control over the children's income and property.  These changes were all in place decades before women got the vote. And speaking of the vote...  3) In 1917 a group of anarchists in the US filed a federal case against military conscription, describing it as involuntary servitude and therefore unconstitutional. SCOTUS was unequivocal in its rejection of their argument, asserting that the draft was a reciprocal obligation owed by all citizens to the state in return for the rights conferred by the state upon citizens.  Among other legal obligations men owed to the state: hue and cry laws, bucket brigades, the special constabulary (being drafted into the police force in emergency situations), etc.  Some suffragettes (like Sylvia Pankhurst, who abandoned the suffragette movement over it) were opposed to the draft, but other more active (and now more famous) ones campaigned in favor of the draft and participated in campaigns designed to use public shaming to pressure men to enlist. One of their posters even decried the fact that a woman was denied the franchise no matter how great she was (she could be a doctor or a lawyer or a mother, or a mayor), while even men unfit for military service did not lose their right to vote.  Two years after SCOTUS formalized the draft as being part of the price all citizens must pay for their rights as citizens, women got the vote. And no obligation to the state was ever placed on them in return for this right.  And before anyone here says, "but women weren't ALLOWED to be soldiers!", there are other ways to serve your country during wartime, and mandatory "war work" (like sewing uniforms or assembling munitions) could have been made a thing in a female draft. Anyone arguing that if women were included in the draft today "we'd be sending tiny, vulnerable women into foxholes" is ignoring the fact that there is TONS of necessary work in and alongside the military that doesn't involve active combat or serious physical risk, so that argument basically boils down to "how dare we inconvenience women!"  So. Three examples of first wave feminists demanding and getting men's rights without men's responsibilities. Two of them actively involve zero sum situations such as income and property rights, or custody rights to children, and in both cases feminists managed to arrange things such that women got all the rights while men were still burdened with all the responsibility.  Women could and also did own property throughout history: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf	1642803902.0	htnssqh	t3_s9dz4x	t1_htnkynk	/r/MensRights/comments/s9dz4x/third_wave_feminism_is_degeneracy_at_its_finest/htnssqh/

gatel	So why do you think the law changed if it wasn't from feminists lobbying?  > A main value of feminism is that gender roles should be non-existent  That's the opposite of true.  Feminism maximizes gender roles and stereotypes men as evil and violent.  It always has since the very earliest days.  Feminism maximizes gender roles.  it's a type of tradcon.  > Every situation is different, some times the mother is the better option and vice versa  Feminism says men can't be parents and the mother is the ONLY option.  Men are rapists and pedophiles.  > The original feminists just wanted it to be an equal opportunity  They did not.  > because the mother had literally no way of financial supporting them\  Well sure they didn't have to work because the husband by law had to provide for them and the kids.  By law she didn't have to do squat.  Did the feminists change that?  No.  > women were always seen are better caregivers  No they weren't because in those days they sensibly said that caring for kids is to provide them with food, housing, clothing and education not... hugs or something I guess.  > This is a rare issue that both sides can agree on  Agree with a hate movement?  > You are ignoring the fact that the problem I had with your original comment was that you compared feminism to slavery, which diminishes the horrors that poc have gone thought  Oh you're the one who pretended only African Americans in the USA 2-400 years ago were ever slaves?

All I’m saying is that we should be more equal when it comes to child care and chores. Maybe the wife doesn’t mind doing lawn care while the husband can do laundry. I don’t care. Gender norms this day in age especially when it comes to house and child care is outdated.

I start walking to the right and the girl taking the money goes "ah ah! Nice try!" Like bitch what the fuck do you think im trying maybe you could tell me which one I'm supposed to go to, or put up a fucking sign or something so people know.

14yvdqhi	Feminism doesn't really have clearly defined groups because one of the inherent traits of feminism is resistance to definition and a lack of self-awareness.     When this dichotomy first appeared in feminists there were individual feminist icons that took a clear side in the debate, but since then there hasn't really been an effort to "separate" the two "sides". You can see how they have done this with TERFs; where a large portion of feminist adherents kind of globally accepted that there needs to be a way to differentiate feminists who are pro-trans and anti-trans, but there hasn't really been the same effort for sex-positive vs sex-negative. Most of the differentiation happens *within* feminist circles as a way to discuss differences in opinion.  There are certainly ideas that blend the two concepts, and even in the act of that blending, you see different conclusions.      One example is female prostitutes should be free to do as they wish and their prostitution is legal, *however,* men who purchase sex from prostitutes should be criminalised. Female promiscuity and female sexuality are sacrosanct, but any man who dares to participate in aspects of it (namely the purchase of it) is a villain. Yes, this baffles me too.      On the other hand, one of the other stunning feats of mental gymnastics is that the difference between onlyfans and "objectification of women" is that onlyfans is an expression of the power of the individual, the woman engaging in it profits from it, and consents to it - whereas other places where the objectification of women occurs is subjugating the individual, etc, etc. So for these people, sexual objectification of women is wrong, unless the woman is directly profiting from it... from which the logical conclusion would be the act of sexual objectification isn't sinful in the first place - so what exactly are women liberating themselves from and how is sexual objectification harming women...? Yes, this also baffles me.	1642805752.0	htnxp92	t3_s9f85m	t1_htntpb6	/r/MensRights/comments/s9f85m/julie_burchill_a_feminist_when_the_sex_war_is_won/htnxp92/

4smqr1ik	Yes, many of his roles were very suited to his physique. But in Total Recall (they do attempt to explain it by showing him jackhammering), End of Days, The Running Man, Jingle All the Way and True Lies he was playing more of a regular joe type. I found it pretty silly in those particular films.   It's the notion of someone who isn't regular in any way playing that kind of character which is comical. This happens in a lot of films where the main character is shown to be a nerd, dateless, outcast, or bullied but is exceptionally good-looking, poised, and well-groomed by real-life standards. But maybe audiences don't want to see more average people in leading roles either.  You are right that his bodybuilding was a part of his persona and why he maintained it even for roles where it wasn't needed.  Yes, the Zac Efrons are more ridiculous because it generally becomes basically a publicity stunt to sell a bad film (e.g. Baywatch).	1642806254.0	htnz0be	t3_s8zf5y	t1_htmewyq	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zf5y/15_famous_men_who_opened_up_about_shirtless/htnz0be/

g8ett	Well, here's the thing, men and women *are* different. Let's put it this way, maybe men don't like housework because they are more interested in using their brain to do thing that built the society women live in. So sally can get a degree and work a job in a company and society literally built by men from nothing while also doing housework, so what?   Men are more suited to manipulating the environment while women are more suited for nurturing, that's biology.	1642807985.0	hto3fuo	t3_s7shyj	t1_htlovgl	/r/MensRights/comments/s7shyj/why_women_being_more_college_educated_than_men_is/hto3fuo/

Who is she to discern what an entire group “feels”. Being a woman has nothing to do with proximate fear.   Commodity services are typically prioritized on a FIFO basis.

Women couldn’t even open their own bank account or get a credit card without the permission of a man up until 1974. Now that women took their rights back there are more medical students and law students who are female than male. No one likes housework dude that’s why it should be split evenly. Also you clearly dodged the part where I called you out for literally not giving a shit about women being murdered by their partners so who is the more extreme one here?

14yvdqhi	It's got a lot to do with how people work at a fundamental level.     People are usually far easier to persuade with emotional appeal. You don't incite riots by distributing essays written in a calm and academic tone. You incite riots by appealing to anger, jealousy, hatred, etc.     Gamma Bias and the Empathy Gap certainly play a role when discussing the male and female aspects of an argument. Eg, when people discuss rape there is the initial assumption that men can't be raped, and women don't rape, etc, but even when the numbers prove that perps are just as likely to be women as men, and victims the same, people will *still believe* rape is a worse problem for women.     Then of course you have something that is conspicuously absent from discussion; which is the power of Rhetorical Devices. Most of the most compelling speeches throughout recent history, and most compelling orators, have consciously or unconsciously been using Rhetorical Devices to make their arguments/words more convincing and persuasive. [You can read more about rhetorical devices here.](https://www.thoughtco.com/rhetorical-devices-4169905)      One common example is Anaphora (the repetition of certain words or phrases at the beginning of sentences to increase the power of a sentiment, such as MLK Junior's repetition of "I have a dream -".       You see this in a famous quote from Bette Davis:     >“When a man gives his opinion, he's a man. When a woman gives her opinion, she's a bitch.”     The power of Rhetorical Devices coupled with everything else is really dangerous, especially as it allows the sentiment to gloss over logical fallacies. And it certainly doesn't help that we don't teach critical thinking in schools either.	1642808673.0	hto5670	t3_s9o09p	t3_s9o09p	/r/MensRights/comments/s9o09p/what_are_the_psychological_mechanisms_behind/hto5670/

30ymvhrd	Feminists claim a lower conviction rate means victims aren’t being taken seriously and we should therefore deny men accused of rape a trial by jury.   Aside from being unjust, their premise is false.     If one looks at the Scottish government website, it clearly shows and explains that as lower merit cases are pushed forward to be prosecuted, the result has been a lower conviction rate for such crimes.   Ironically, but understandably, being tougher and pushing more rape cases forward results in a lower conviction rate.  (Because a larger percent won’t have supporting evidence).   Sexual assault convictions dropped from 73 to 56% specifically which man’s even with lower merit cases being pushed forward, over half of the accused are still found guilty, hardly the dysfunctional system feminists claim.  Again, the government states this.  See link.    So, not only is denying the accused a jury trial unjust, but so is the premise.   The lower conviction rates aren’t a function of a jury flaw, they are a function of what cases are pushed forward for prosecution.     “Taking rape seriously” and pushing more merit less cases forward for prosecution results in a lower conviction rate.  This is true of any crime, not just sexual assault.     https://www.gov.scot/publications/criminal-proceedings-scotland-2018-19/pages/4/	1642809002.0	hto5zyc	t3_s9lwoz	t3_s9lwoz	/r/MensRights/comments/s9lwoz/feminism_war_against_due_process_scottish_mp/hto5zyc/

You took my statement about division of household chores that were traditionally split by gender roles, and turned it into a women's rights issue about domestic violence/intimate partner violence.  &#x200B;  I've been observing feminism/men's rights issues for years.  From many different English speaking countries news and issues.  Predominate observations are from the US.  Feminists claim they advocate for equal rights, yet only when it means men have to give up something to women so that women could be equal/equally represented.  Never do they advocate for women giving up privilege's to be equal to men.  When I see that feminists actually advocate for real equality, by giving up some of their female privilege's so they can be equal to or equally represented like men, then I'll rethink my stance on not caring about women's issues.

After about ten or so calls I found a towing company who said they had towed someone from there who'd been in a collision. They happily gave me his address. I showed up to his trailer with his passenger side mirror in hand that I'd found by my truck. When the police got there and questioned him he admitted to hitting me and to being drunk @ the time of the accident. When the police asked him what he was doing he said he was out looking for a prostitute. Real awesome fella!

7gpdb	Lol yeah. There are different levels of oppression among different religions. Christianity in its modern form is equally oppressive to men and women. Historically, though, christianity was almost as oppressive as modern-day Islam. Women were basically the property of their fathers until they became the property of their husbands. That's pretty similar to modern-day countries who established Islam as their official religion.  Acting like Christian women in america are subject to the same level of oppression as women face in Saudi Arabia does nothing but de-legitimise the very real struggles of Saudi women.	1642813274.0	htogggq	t3_s8bbyd	t1_htkviyg	/r/MensRights/comments/s8bbyd/i_feel_like_misandry_is_starting_to_become_a/htogggq/

46a6opwn	>People will listen to women. If we use this privilege to serve others, we can really do a lot to help our boys and men!  Ironic when it is this and other privileges that women are granted and men not, that lead to discrimination against men, to be treated as a lesser subspecies, despised and abused and only maintained for their utility.  The article does not explore the possibility that men have such an awful slavish life now, they are more determined to end their suffering, compared to women making a half-hearted attempt as a cry for help, as an explanation for the statistics.  No-one seems to consider that men should be allowed to take their own lives if their suffering is considered so extreme: aren't their lives their own? By trying to prevent men having control over their own bodies, it seems as though someone else wants control for their own benefit, such as maintaining men in a slave state as industry, military and domestic fodder; or more selfishly concerned about the impact on themselves and others, of men taking their own lives, than about the men themselves.  It's terrible that men are in such suffering that they feel it necessary to take their own lives, so it's vital that we address the reasons. However, I think it is important to acknowledge the sovereignty of those men in having control over their lives, including ending them if they feel it is appropriate.  Now, some may say that men are just depressed and should be prevented from taking their own lives because they aren't thinking straight, however society is not setup to treat depression, only drug people to no longer care so their utility can continue to be taken advantage of: there is no determination to address the cause of the depression because that would be too expensive.  The usual outcome of drug crises is to remove access to the drugs in question "to save lives". This has consequences of removing access of people in pain to classes of drugs that most effectively ease suffering resulting in more suffering in people using drugs for pain relief and not to end their lives. Where opioid crises have been managed elsewhere, the drugs have been removed from general prescription and limited to prescription by a separate pain assessment body. As there are less pain assessment bodies than Doctors, waiting lists to see the assessment bodies blow out to a year or more during which time the patient is forced onto other forms of pain relief considered "safer" but also usually less effective at pain management. The end result is overall more suffering than making those drugs available.  However I would hazard a guess that the main reason for the high death rate is accidental overdose due to the potency of Fentanyl or other opioids and their need for dosage to be carefully managed: not something readily achieved in a back alley or by a non-skilled professional. One way to help prevent deaths is to directly manage the distribution and dosage of opioids in what used to be known as "safe injecting rooms" where medical professionals can monitor the patient and the quality of the drugs being used whilst also attending to allied health issues or even offering a program of drug replacement to achieve the same result. It's called a harm minimisation approach instead of the usual prohibition approach that never works. Allowing a black market to flourish with absolutely no control, because the market is not managed directly, has always been a recipe for disaster.	1642813607.0	htoh9mx	t3_s9mkqe	t3_s9mkqe	/r/MensRights/comments/s9mkqe/the_opioid_crisis_men_are_more_than_twice_as/htoh9mx/

His lawyer basically told him, he can either fight for a better custody deal for the twins or he can go after his house, but anything more will be portrayed as him being selfish and he won't get *anything.*  Yet feminists victim-blame and harp on how men don't want kids and don't fight for them often enough. Lawyers know what's up. Family court is a losing proposition for men, and sometimes you're just lighting your money and time on fire to endure genuinely traumatic treatment from judges.

35c0i	  For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**   You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g.   Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206  > > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and   > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.   2010 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  *data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*  And non CDC study...  *A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  *a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*  And another non CDC study...  *National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  *when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*   If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.    Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women’s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn’t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims’ fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1642815040.0	htokq6s	t3_s9qiev	t3_s9qiev	/r/MensRights/comments/s9qiev/precise_cogent_data_on_the_myth_of_1_in_5_women/htokq6s/

The radical misandrist feminism is represented in government, politics, law, education, institutions, mainstream media, entertainment media, news outlets, news media, the workforce, Hollywood, Tech, Social Media, etc. Basically this type of feminism has infested every corner of Western and European society.  Therefore women can no longer claim that the the radicals are not "true feminists".  The women who say *"they are not true feminists"* (in response to someone calling out shitty feminist behaviour) are disingenuous, and are saying that to cover up and deflect away from feminism, to try and convince everyone that feminism is all good and proper so that they can continue to enjoy the privileges that radical feminism has brought to women.	1642815168.0	htol0yr	t3_s9674j	t3_s9674j	/r/MensRights/comments/s9674j/feminism_and_no_true_scotsman_logical_fallacy/htol0yr/

35c0i	 [NISVS 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.  [NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.  [NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.  [NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 and 2 on page 15 and 16 respectively   Varies a bit from year to year, but pretty even overall. The numbers for perpetrators vary a little from year to year too. Something like 79-84% of made to penetrate (nonconsensual envelopment) victims are victimized  by women. Something like 96-99% of rape (nonconsensual penetration) victims are victimized by men. So in the 2010s, it averages out that a typical year has about 60% men and 40% women as perpetrators of nonconsensual sex outside prisons.  Again, in 2010s about equal victims and 60/40 perpetrator split.	1642815193.0	htol35j	t3_s9qiev	t3_s9qiev	/r/MensRights/comments/s9qiev/precise_cogent_data_on_the_myth_of_1_in_5_women/htol35j/

46a6opwn	The worrying thing is the application of profiling to identify criminals and judging guilt based on fitting the profile, when that profile can also be quite innocent.  Women who see a lone male adult with a child, assume he is a pedophile and report him to police, who then require proof of innocence is another example of profiling; when the likelihood of a pedophile being in public alone with a child is quite remote. For the sake of catching that million to one situation, we abrogate the rights of men to justice in general by applying profiling.  The foundation of justice is the presumption of innocence and yet that foundation is being overturned because of an immediate jump to the worst possible interpretation of a situation as reality. Surely in the case of a lone man in public with a child, the most likely situation is a relative caring for a child and observation of the childs interaction should provide further evidence.  It concerns me that mere allegation is enough to abrogate mens rights, especially when that allegation is malicious or sparked by hatred against men and fearing the worst in every situation involving men.  I am also concerned that the system of justice is weighted towards the prosecution and defense is not awarded the same resources. Police work for the prosecution, not defense and this leads to identifying potential criminal behaviour rather than also assessing for an innocent situation. Profiling arises from a focus on criminality rather than innocence.	1642815373.0	htolijr	t3_s9l00u	t3_s9l00u	/r/MensRights/comments/s9l00u/i_am_not_sure_what_to_make_of_this_news_item_was/htolijr/

Additionally, they were not subject to the same military service requirements as men. Men were still doing compulsory service as late as 1963 in Britain and a lot later than that in the US. This complaint about women's voting rights is in the wrong direction; women have, and have had, more voting rights than their responsibilities would justify.	1642815430.0	htolndk	t3_s9dz4x	t1_htod3tx	/r/MensRights/comments/s9dz4x/third_wave_feminism_is_degeneracy_at_its_finest/htolndk/

71v4lvfl	I've meet a man years back that had no idea how to put air in his tires, so they are around. He was rather wealthy judging by his car and suit, but was helpless trying to fix the error of low tire pressure he was getting (he had like 10 psi in each).   My wife has a flat years ago when we had a single basic cell phone. I walked over 10 miles to fix it and when I got there found a guy fixed it for her shortly after leaving. I've been broke down and no one stops, but my wife gets help rather quickly. It has been a while, so maybe things have changed.   I think everyone should know how to fix basic stuff, but some refuse to even learn. I've showed all my kids how to fix a tire several times, and had them help fix other stuff as well. Don't feminist push that women are equal though, and men shouldn't be the only one able to take care of theirselfs? You'd think they would throw a fit over the assumption that they are helpless when compared to men on the side of the road.	1642815518.0	htoluq7	t3_s9h4di	t3_s9h4di	/r/MensRights/comments/s9h4di/the_sexism_against_men_when_roadside_assistance/htoluq7/

ivzr39mc	No matter the statistic, people do not seem to be able to move past their beliefs or the narrative's given.  Men are three times more likely to commit suicide then women, why is that.  I feel it is because of how society in general views us.  Men can be victims of rape, but society does not believe we can be.  Most men don't report due to the wildly held belief that men cannot be raped, a belief held by a lot of woman and men.  Regardless of the man's sexual orientation.    Then their is the concept of Toxic Masculinity, whether you think it is a real thing or not.  Society as a whole has this view of a man that he is a provider, a stoic person, that he does not cry and he should act a certain way.  And we were raised that way, how many of us 30+ heard the expression "Don't cry or I will give you something to cry about".  Real men don't cry, real men have engine oil on their hands, or your not a man unless you can redo all the plumbing or build an extension on to the house.  How many of us have heard this, scene it on tv, on tik tok, it is a narrative seen everywhere.  But not talked about.  A lot of men do not report domestic violence, because it makes them feel like less of a man to admit it and they don't have the emotional tools to deal with the shame.    Men lack in mental health supports, there are no domestic abuse groups for men, and the ones out there a geared towards woman, try showing up for one of those.  I assure you, you will not be made to feel welcome at most of them.  If you are married to your abuser, or have a child with them, even if you manage to get physically away.  The abuse will certainly continue, there are no shelters for you, Family Law only enforces child support, not custody and more and more often children are being withheld from Father's by Mothers to punish them for whatever reason.  And lets not forget that Child support that can and will cripple you.  Parental Alienation is on the rise and most of victims are men.  Men lose custody of their children in a much higher proportion than woman, often due to false allegations.  Police will not step in, often side with "mother".  Men are more likely to lose custody of their children, get saddled with a crippling child support payments, and the lower you go on the income ladder the worse it gets as the stigma increases.    There is a belief that women are less likely to be narcissists, and I think that is incorrect.  The measure used to determine if someone suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder is the same between both men and woman.  And I don't think that measure should be applied to both, because a male Narcists is not likely to show emotion.  Which relates again back to real men don't show emotions.  So a Narcists, a person who is wrapped up in themselves will never admit to being less than that.  But a female Narcists, well, it becomes yet another tool in their arsenal of manipulation.  They can cry on cue, and of course be believed quickly because of it.  So it is easier to believe the person crying and showing emotion than the man who was taught not to, and society feels it to be this way.    Add on woman's group describing "Abuse by proxy" or "Blame the Victim", or the 10K worth of self help books by women describing their divorce from the horrible ex-husband.  And I am sure if you talk to a lot of these "ex-husbands" they were no where near the monster they were made out to be.  I am sure a good portion of them were, but then a good portion were probably not.  But how many books are written by men about "how I escaped my abusive ex-wife".  How many men have had to sign away their parental rights because of crippling child support debt, or they went to prison for not paying.  There is a well known Woman's divorce coach whose popular books describes how she made her ex-husband sign away his rights to get out of 100K worth of child support.  Something she is proud of, a woman who by no means needed the money as she was wealthy in her own right.  But society is so quick to believe that men are always at fault, that proving otherwise is near impossible.  I recently saw a Tik Tok that essentially said "Men cheat because we are assholes, and woman cheat because their men are assholes".  Think about that for a moment.  There are virtually no mental health supports for us, no support groups, no shelters.  The societal view is so ingrained as near impossible to move.  We cannot escape our abusers, people don't believe us, the courts punish us.  And these stats don't really reflect how bad it is, because so much goes under reported.  So with no way out, no support a lot of men turn to suicide and that is just so wrong.  And I am not saying all woman are bad, or that all men are good.  I am just tired of all these stigma's and misconceptions.  Anyway end of my rant.	1642816227.0	htonjhw	t3_s4qrcc	t1_hstodjt	/r/MensRights/comments/s4qrcc/counterintuitive_statistics_about_domestic_abuse/htonjhw/

1hs2nhdv	You’re really pushing sounding like an incel, which is exactly what we need to avoid. I’m just saying be careful.   First of all, even entertaining the idea that women as a whole could be perceived as an “enemy” is literally incels to a 100% T.  Secondly, feminism is absolutely not the “enemy” as you put is. People that actually know what feminism is are for *equality,* which includes us believe it or not. It’s just that most self identified feminists are actually misandrists.  Third, we don’t want conflict. Labeling *anyone* an “enemy” is combative by nature, and we’re trying to avoid that.  Feminism vs Misandry is an incredibly important distinction to make, which you did. Just be careful how you word things. It’s posts like these that will get targeted and used as “see? look how awful men are and how terribly they see women.” Our phrasing is more important now than ever to make sure we keep the footing we have and gain more as a legitimate cause	1642818765.0	htotji6	t3_s9r7ge	t3_s9r7ge	/r/MensRights/comments/s9r7ge/we_should_start_using_the_word_misandrist_more/htotji6/

30ymvhrd	Feminist studies such as the famous Koss study are agenda driven and inaccurate.  The Koss “study” asked women if they ever had sex after drinking and counted affirmative answers as sexual assaults, which later became reported as rape in the popular press. Google criticism of koss sexual assault study.    Forget biased studies and look at actual crime data if you want factual information.   The Bureau of Justice for example wrote a document summarizing sexual assault data over an 8 year period.  They reported 7.6 in 1,000 women reported being sexually assaulted.  For college students the number was 6.2 per thousand.   I used to work in higher education and found this to be very consistent with the number of reports we had per year.     https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf   Under the Cleary Act college incidents are reported by college or university each year, so again this is an objective measure of sexual assault data.  You can Google the sexual assault rates for a college for any given year, but again be sure you are looking at actual data, not biased “studies”.	1642818969.0	htou16q	t3_s9qiev	t3_s9qiev	/r/MensRights/comments/s9qiev/precise_cogent_data_on_the_myth_of_1_in_5_women/htou16q/

It is distinguished from a bench trial in which a judge or panel of judges makes all decisions. Jury trials are used in a significant share of serious criminal cases in many but not all common law judicial systems. The majority of common law jurisdictions in Asia (such as Singapore, Pakistan, India, and Malaysia) have abolished jury trials on the grounds that juries are susceptible to bias.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642819502.0	htovamv	t3_s9ere8	t1_htov95q	/r/MensRights/comments/s9ere8/no_juries_for_rape_trials_in_scotland/htovamv/

hpnj6hd5	This isn't a gendered thing and the fact that you make it so is just blatantly ignorant. It's gendered expectations like these that get called out because that's why we have shit out there for services that both men and women can do.    As a man, I shouldn't be expected to be a personal walking mechanic, DIY worker, plumbing, electrician, and other various male-centric jobs because I'm a man.  If I knew how to do everything there would be a lack of jobs in the world and a lack of opportunities. Also, this implies that the other expectation is for women to know child-rearing and other shit like that.  It's not magically something they know, it's usually taught by either self-learning or previous generations.    Also if I'm paying for your ass to do a service such as AA and you decide that I can handle it myself because I'm a man then your ass just doesn't deserve my patronage. Because why the hell am I paying for something I can handle myself. Oh yeah, I know why, its because I can't and therefore requesting the "expert" to come to fix the situation instead of being an asshole who gets paid to use their hands, not their mouth.	1642823259.0	htp4058	t3_s9h4di	t1_htn6isd	/r/MensRights/comments/s9h4di/the_sexism_against_men_when_roadside_assistance/htp4058/

iw5lsgc7	First off, it's worth noting that men's mental health issues aren't only ignored, but they are \*\*systemically excluded\*\*. A great example of this is depression.  One of the main symptoms of depression in men is \*\*irritability\*\*. But the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illness (DSM) doesn't even list irritability as a symptom.  Can you imagine if the #1 symptom in women was ignored in any medical journal? There would be an uproar. But when it comes to men, it's excluded.  A good resource from the Mayo Clinic explains men's depression  can be found here: [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/male-depression/art-20046216](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/male-depression/art-20046216)  There you'll find that depressed men often experience:  * Escapist behavior, such as spending a lot of time at work or on sports * Physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive problems and pain  * Problems with alcohol or drug use  * Controlling, violent or abusive behavior  * Irritability or inappropriate anger  * Risky behavior, such as reckless driving  Most of the time, these are classified as "toxic masculinity", when in reality it's major depressive disorder (or bipolar affective disorder).  More attention on the topic of men and mental health is desperately needed and the DSM guidelines need to be updated so that the #1 symptom in men, irritability, is finally acknowledged and treated.	1642825442.0	htp8qr5	t3_s9th7m	t3_s9th7m	/r/MensRights/comments/s9th7m/what_are_some_good_mental_health_resources_for/htp8qr5/

Cause if it’s just to prevent kids from flushing drugs down the toilet, or using a marker on the wall, then what was it for? Did I struggle with 4 years of awkward pooping to protect property damage (my high school did it from 06-10)   Another thing is there were some drug overdoses in the county (pretty sure the region was infested with heroin back in the day) so maybe the teachers were “thinking of the children” and trying to catch hard drugs from being done in the stalls.	1642825588.0	htp91np	t3_s9duxk	t1_htoef5k	/r/MensRights/comments/s9duxk/boys_left_feeling_uncomfortable_after_high_school/htp91np/

And a culture with lots of guns and ammo, relatively crud attitude about guns, gun handling, possession, safety, and a culture that's quite heavy in violence, makes for a very deadly combination - really quite the epidemic of gun violence.  Alas, changing the US constitution isn't easy - and there are too many gun lovers/nuts here so ... thus far we're relatively stuck with this problem ... at least so far.

e095iqhj	I never said only, but the majority of slaves in America were from Africa…this is a well known fact. I later thought it would be more inclusive to say “poc”, that doesn’t make me a liar wtf  And it seems like you have far too extreme opinions on feminism to be able to engage in any kind of reasonable conversation about these issues. Like, it’s absolutely ridiculous to say “feminism says men can’t be parents, they are all rapist pedophiles”. Such a blatant exaggeration factually incorrect.   You also have your general facts wrong about feminism, feminists are definitely against societal gender roles. That’s has been one of their most prominent values since the very beginning of the movement. And the earliest feminist WERE focused on equal opportunities for men and women. Now there are too many radicals for the movement to be taken seriously anymore, but you know that the firsts feminists were not just “man haters”. If you’re gonna come on hear and trash feminism, at least know the very basics of what you’re talking about. There are so many valid critiques of feminism that you could talk about, this is not one of them.   You also say that women weren’t always seen as better caregivers? This is the most common stereotype of women! You defined “caregiving” as “providing”, which was the typical role of the father. Caregiving means stuff like feeding kids, changing diapers, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, homeschooling, that kind of stuff. All of this was, for the longest time, considered to be only “women’s work”. You cant possibly think that isn’t true, a lot of people still believe that NOW.   Dude, I don’t think you really care about discussing this issue in a logical way. Your first question is “why do you think the law changed if it wasn’t for feminist lobbying??” Like, that’s what the entire 3rd paragraph of my previous comment explained. Did you not even read it? That would make sense because you are continuing to talk about the whole custody thing while, still, ignoring that fact that I was questioning you on how you could possibly compare slavery to feminism.   Please at least educate yourself on the values and accomplishments of 1ST wave feminism if your going to act like you know shit.   Maybe you should leave this sub and join an anti women’s rights sub instead, bc that’s what you sound like right now.	1642828149.0	htpe4f8	t3_s74mg9	t1_htntib0	/r/MensRights/comments/s74mg9/how_has_feminism_helped_men/htpe4f8/

I'm not just going to accept your assertion here.  >The laws around marriage changed in 1960s-70s, after 'no-fault' divorce.  How does this contradict what I said? Unless you think feminists and advocates for women didn't exist before the 60's?  >If you go into original feminist literatures, feminism was actually against marriage.    They wanted to abolish marriage..        But instead, they used their 'simp army' to change the laws.  There are feminists who made arguments in favor of and against marriage; feminism is not a monolith. At least we can agree on your second statement here. Which is a demonstration of the power women have always wielded.  >And now its men who advocate against marriage. And feminists are the one writing articles over articles to convince men how marriage benefits us..        What feminists never realised is that, unlike women who can only threaten to avoid marriage, men are actually capable of executing that threat without giving a second-thought.        That's what is happening now..    That's why you see them writing all positive things about marriage.        Its their last ditch effort to gaslight men. In the process they are helped by the church and conservatives.    Who want their supply of 'dough' rolling.        Yes church is a patriarchal institution too.....

Problem solved.     “1 in 4 college women are raped”: Point out the Koss study didn’t actually prove that.  Show that actual crime data shows an incredibly different story.    “Women need safe spaces where men are not allowed” :   Same argument used in the 1969s to deny black people equal access.     “Women couldn’t vote prior to 1920”:  1.  There’s not a woman alive today who wasn’t of legal voting age by 1920.  2.  It’s a false claim.  Many women voted prior to 1920, including Colonial America.   Same with land and business ownership.  Women owned land snd rsn businesses in early America.  Saying they didn’t is simply a feminist lie.    “____ because if the patriarchy”: Define patriarchy and show we clearly do not have a patriarchy.

7p7evb6t	I always like to view things from a biological perspective. Women are always going to be cared for more than a male as almost all life forms are hardwired to protect the sex with symmetrical pairings of sex chromosomes as it is where the species stores successful alleles. Males are born with much higher variability than females which means safety or being cared for isn’t really our thing. However us males have a much higher capacity for brilliance and genius. We tended to sacrifice our safety for genetic uniqueness. Whenever you see something like this, don’t take it to heart too much as it is nothing out of the ordinary from a genetic standpoint at least.	1642834928.0	htpq4ps	t3_s9ntb8	t3_s9ntb8	/r/MensRights/comments/s9ntb8/i_dont_get_how_im_supposed_to_believe_women_are/htpq4ps/

3m8b9	If misandry is so common, then accusing people of it probably won't have much effect on them.  I think that identifying and naming feminist misogyny will have more effect on them. Conveniently, misandry often has misogyny wrapped up in it. You can't be prejudiced against men without having having prejudice against women.   For example, if someone says something like "men are responsible for all the evil in the world", then you can point out the misogyny that this erases women's influence on the world and treats them as passive objects.   I think one of the strongest arguments we have is that women are strong, powerful and should be taken seriously in all aspects of life, including as criminals and abusers.	1642835682.0	htprbqh	t3_s9r7ge	t3_s9r7ge	/r/MensRights/comments/s9r7ge/we_should_start_using_the_word_misandrist_more/htprbqh/
iosvry6l	OP is the one who gendered this issue genius, and he complains like a bitch about the reality of life. of course women have it easier in this regard, and if this is news to any man, then you're in bad shape. if you think learning the basics of life requires you to be a "walking mechanic, DIY worker, plumber, and electrician" then you have a very piss poor sense of what the ask is here. they asked him to change his own tire mate, that's not rocket science.   and do me a favor, go back and read this part of your asinine response:   "If I knew how to do everything there would be a lack of jobs in the world and a lack of opportunities. Also, this implies that the other expectation is for women to know child-rearing and other shit like that. It's not magically something they know, it's usually taught by either self-learning or previous generations."      That first sentence has nothing to do with anything, and provides a clear demonstration of just how little you understand about the point I made and the world at large. And secondly, YES - there is an expectation for women to know about child rearing since that is basically their entire evolutionary purpose on this planet, and they should figure that out good and well.  To sum it up, men should learn how to change tires and be resilient, women should learn how to be good mothers.

To me this would be a rather big men's issue that interlinks with topics such as the empathy gap or the mainstream narrative, both putting men at a disadvantage. There is a problem with public opinion influencing legal processes and predominantly men seem to have been innocently jailed, no?

Earlier forms of direct war have been replaced by sophisticated economic weapons because they used up too much human and capital resources. Everyone is aware of the Machiavellian ways in which powerful countries like the US and it's allies have fucked over the middle East, Central and south America and so on despite knowing not to interfere in local disputes. This is not a lesson in history, it's the way things happened. The world may not be visibly warring anymore because those old ways have given way to more sophisticated war games which include the complex web of world economy.

7p7evb6t	I’m not saying that male disposability is in any way ok for us to tolerate. In terms of safety, biology is against us unfortunately. If you look at the Covid deaths, they are mainly male. This is because our bell curve of genetic variance is much wider than the bell curve for females. This means that many more of us males are super weak to covid or we are super immune to it. You don’t hear about the super immune males as it doesn’t affect them much. This is true for most other diseases too, including male suicide. It is also unfortunate that our behaviours are an extension of our genes. ( eggs are stored on ice for thousands of dollars but sperm just goes on a tissue, down a drain ) we seem to be some complex extension of that.

I have come to the conclusion that the only reason she didn't go to the cops and use a false accusation to get custody is because it had been 4 months since we had had sex... now, had she done it, how do you suppose I could PROVE that she had consented, let alone been the aggressor?	1642844614.0	htq46nh	t3_s9yagb	t3_s9yagb	/r/MensRights/comments/s9yagb/so_im_confused_the_society_is_rejecting_the/htq46nh/

For us girls, is kinda okay bc we have individual toilets (idk what their called), for boys they should have a wall blocking the vision, bc usually the younger boys don't noticed this and have the door open.

a7dxasqy	 There are a few issues that need to be evaluated.   Firstly, it concerns the notions of marriage and conjugal duties. Should sex be a form of default duty, to be expected by virtue of entering a voluntary contract that is marriage? Should sex even be deemed as an essential element in a marriage? Personally, I don't believe that it should be. However, legally and socioculturally, sex is embedded in the context of marriage, even if marital rape is stripped of its immunity. For example, consummation (or the lack thereof) is one criteria for a marriage to be voided.   Should we re-evaluate what conjugal duties and rights entail? Or should these concepts be scrapped in their entirety? If the latter, should alimony be abolished too? since it's a default right/liability that comes with the contract of marriage. What's the purpose and utility of a marriage then? How should we decide such issues, and who gets to decide?   What about marital rape perpetrated by wives against their husbands? In India, it is legal for wives, or any women for the matter to have sex or any sexual contacts with any adult men without the latters' consent. You said that these men are in the streets protesting against the potential law amendment, but did you know that women and prominent women's rights groups have in many occasions [vehemently protested against gender-neutral rape laws](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms)? They are even against a gender-neutral Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, which protects children from sexual exploitation by adults. Contrary to popular belief, sexual abuse perpetrated by women/girls against men/boys are not relatively rare. Very few researchers/organisations have conducted studies on this topic but for the ones that did, remarkable results have been observed.   This [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18984509/), published in 2008 is one of the largest and most extensive of its kind. Nearly 16,000 university students from 22 sites in 21 countries participated and it was found that in 10 of the 22 sites (**India**, Israel, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, and the US), a higher proportion of men compared to women reported experiencing sexual coercion in the previous 12 months.  Inadequate safeguards for defendants are also potential implications, especially in marital relationships where implied consent is usually prevalent. The [alarming increase of false rape cases](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-high-court-expresses-worry-over-alarming-increase-of-false-rape-cases/article36042093.ece) certainly doesn't inspire much confidence.	1642848251.0	htq947k	t3_s9yagb	t3_s9yagb	/r/MensRights/comments/s9yagb/so_im_confused_the_society_is_rejecting_the/htq947k/

You had to wait for a teacher to unlock the bathroom door for you, and if you couldn't wait five minutes for the teacher to continue helping another student, you might as well just piss yourself. They didn't do it because of every kid being "anti-social" but because a bunch of people in the women's bathroom would vape in there during classes for several hours. Not even just women in the women's restroom, men were in there too. Men were allowed in the women's bathroom and women were allowed in the men's bathroom. Even after locking both bathrooms, they still vaped in the bathrooms.

l7ck2	Someone unfamiliar with history beyond the past two centuries will tell you feminism began in the 1960s with Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, and Jo Freeman (second-wave feminism) or in the 19th Century with Mary Wollenscraft and Susan B. Anthony.        There is a narrative, borne out of historical ignorance, that frames feminism as 'progress', as a new thing that has never occurred before, with women liberated, for the first time ever, as humanity achieves a new, more enlightened mode of existence.        Feminism is a natural and inevitable part of the cyclical lifecycle of civilizations.        Anyone well-read enough in history will discover that feminism has routinely popped up again and again across myriad civilizations, leading to liberations of women nearly as great, as great, or greater than what we have in modern society.        Whenever prosperity becomes great enough, and a society safe enough from war, famine, disease, and poverty, and several generations are born into and live in this safety and prosperity, feminism emerges.        Just as inevitably, because nothing ever lasts, as the societies feminists inhabit destabilize and grow soft, manly outside invaders surge in, kill the cowering feminized males, rape the empowered females, loot the collected wealth created and accumulated by the civilization's mocked and forgotten founders, and feminism ultimately vanishes and becomes forgotten again. Only to re-emerge later on, centuries later, in some distant land, where again prosperity has taken hold, and women 'fight for their rights' all over again, achieving their 'first ever victories' for the umpteenth time, ignorant of all their brave first-time sisters who fought for and achieved their rights in ages and empires past.        Let's have a quick jaunt through just a few of those past feminist movements:        Feminism in Ancient Greece. In ancient Greece, 2,500 years ago, men complained about the rise of feminism. They opined about the loss of femininity, about women who behaved as men and shirked the duty of becoming mothers, about the fall of ancient sexual mores and the rise of rampant casual sex.        Women throughout much of ancient Greece owned property, and even managed estates. In the 4th Century BC, Spartan women owned nearly 40% of all Spartan property, and some of the wealthiest of Spartans were women. Plato argued women were the equals to men in statecraft, and could run a nation as well as a man could. Hellenistic Egypt was ruled at times by women, including the famed Cleopatra VII.        Ancient Greek sexual mores were significantly more liberated than those of today. Women apparently engaged in lesbianism all across ancient Greece. Women were often sequestered with each other (and men with other men), and a great deal of ancient Greek art survives showing women in erotic relationships with other women. Even the term 'lesbian' is Greek; it comes from the Isle of Lesbos, where the 6th Century BC poet Sapphos churned out poem after poem celebrating woman-on-woman love.    girlfriend feministLesbian feminism abounded in ancient Greece.        The aforementioned casual sex was everywhere. Even cuckoldry got top billing. Elders in ancient Sparta encouraged husbands to let their wives cuckold them for the good of Sparta: if a wife wanted a younger man to sex her, her older husband should let them go at it, so that the younger man's more vital seed could impregnate the wife. Tell that to any modern feminist and she's sure to tell you, "And that's exactly how it should be in today's world, too!"        At the time feminism raged through a prosperous Greece (and contemporary men wrote laments comparable to what you'll find on manosphere sites today), women occupied a far more traditional role in ancient Rome, but that was not to last.        A few hundred years later, Rome achieved the same degree of prosperity Greece had known. With that prosperity came Rome's own feminist movement.  Women were at one point essentially bought and sold in marriage in Rome. As Rome civilized, that practice ended, and women achieved progressively more rights.        In 195 BC, the Roman politicians debated a repeal of the Oppian law, a rule that restricted women's ability to splurge on clothing, barred them from owning gold, and more. Women didn't want this law anymore, and a massive protest of women flooded the streets of Rome to demand its repeal. Cato the Elder, the famous senator and consul, inveighed against the law's repeal, noting to the senators of Rome that, "As soon as they begin to be your equals, they will have become your superiors!"        But there is no resisting progress. The law was repealed, and women embarked on a spending spree, empowered to fight for more rights.    girlfriend feministRoman women protest the Oppian Law.        50 years later, Rome conquered Greece, which had fallen far from the manly fighting spirit it had used to spread its empire across the world. The Romans regarded Greek culture at that point as soft, effeminate, and womanly. They held the Greeks in contempt. Any time you read of a Greek gaining widespread acceptance in ancient Roman society, it is often with some surprise by the historian.        While Greece was ahead of the curve of feminization compared to Rome, all great and prosperous empires go through the civilization lifecycle, and so too would Rome.        In some ways, Rome had always been more progressive than Greece. Unlike some city-states in Greece, even dating back to its earlier eras, Roman women inherited property the same as men, and daughters an equal portion of the estate to sons. At one point, in 169 BC, the Voconian law revoked the inheritance rights of women; but it didn't last long, as women found ways around it, and the law was ultimately neutered.        Divorce in Rome was open to men and women, and focused on benefiting the injured party over the injurer. A Roman senator who divorced his virgin wife without telling or consulting his friends first was run out of the Senate. In a normal divorce, a woman would have her dowry refunded after two years; but if she could show her husband had wronged her, he'd have to pay the dowry back anywhere from six months later to immediately (but, if he successfully showed she had wronged him, she gave up 1/8th to 1/6th of that dowry).        Edward Gibbon, in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, notes:           " While the maxims of Cato were revered, they tended to perpetuate in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity: till female blandishments insensibly triumphed; and every salutary restraint was lost in the dissolute greatness of the republic."        To put that in plainer English, while Romans followed the old rules, things mostly stayed calm and sane.        Yet, over time, women managed to talk men into giving them more and more rights, until all the restrictions came off in the prosperous, decadent Roman Republic.        Eventually, of course, women gained more sway, the Roman world feminized further, and most Roman men, once the core of the Roman military, avoided military service. The Roman military was by then made up of units from Gaul, North Africa, Asia Minor, and Germania, and eventually these non-Romans fighting for Rome began to realize they could fight to take possession of Rome -- and sometimes did (such as Maximinus Thrax, a brutal Thracian who declared himself Caesar, among many others).        Later still Alaric and his band of masculine Goths rolled through Southern Europe, defeating the unmanly Romans and the even unmanlier Greeks of the time. The Greeks were so degraded by then they left the pass of Thermopylae unguarded (the one King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans had held a million-man Persian army at for three days, 876 years earlier), fleeing before Alaric, and Alaric marched through and mopped the floor with them, before rolling into the equally unmanly Rome and taking that city too (the first time it had been conquered by an outside army in 800 years).	1642851377.0	htqdhjo	t3_s9duxk	t1_htpoych	/r/MensRights/comments/s9duxk/boys_left_feeling_uncomfortable_after_high_school/htqdhjo/

15j537ut	You make a lotta good points here, the right to die should be for both sexes though. I know you guys think *all* women have it easy enough to not even need it, but that's where I just have to disagree. And even easy lives can be miserable and meaningless if one's mind is fucked.  >however society is not setup to treat depression, only drug people to no longer care  Exactly! It's total bullshit and antidepressants suck ass. Some of the lamest drugs I've ever tried.  Like really, opioids only kill so easily because they're more potent than say something like alcohol. But aside from the risk of ODing opioids are actually healthier than alcohol. Much less toxic. Actually there's already suboxone that is hard to OD on and is used for opioid dependences. Maybe it should be available otc so people have an option other than street crap with fent in it. Maybe something else could be added to it so that the vomit reflex is reduced too. Because people die from mixing opioids with alcohol or benzos due to suffocating on their own vomit after passing out. So a vomit-suppresser could make OD's even less dangerous.  an otc opioid may seem like a bad idea, but if it's hard to OD on by itself and has an antiemetic to reduce the danger of ODing if mixed then I think it could be a good idea for people needing a cheap way to get off opis. Though I've heard it can actually cause WD if taken at the wrong time.  Kratom on the other hand is hard to OD on even with other depressants. It's weak and legal (in the US) and an opioid, it could be good for managing WD's from opioid scripts or just to have fun.

i3uus6e3	Related but separate issue though.. Women historically would choose mates to maximize their survivability, but that was in ideal (for them) situations. Lots of examples of women being forced to have sex with, or bear children for, military or ruling class over the years. For example, 1 in every 200 men can trace lineage to Genghis Khan.  These days women can choose a mate for a variety of reasons, some good some bad, but at least in western civilization they get to choose.  We're breeding all kinds of weird shit because survivability to retirement age is almost a guarantee for women.

bumcq093	We have to get to the facts of why women were forced to breed in that way - there has to be motivation for that. Maintaining power and keeping the lineage running was important back then for powerbrokers. History is far too complex for such simpleton female-oriented conclusions like "muh freedumz". Humanity and civilization rose from burning lava to reach this point. The path was not easy. Was there collateral damage? Fuck yes. Women, men and children everywhere suffered to maintain status quos all over the world. Each tribe, each kingdom fighting for existence and to flourish beyond simple survival. And that meant any means necessary. Men can't be blamed for that.	1642852655.0	htqfbyq	t3_s8bbyd	t1_htqehyq	/r/MensRights/comments/s8bbyd/i_feel_like_misandry_is_starting_to_become_a/htqfbyq/

15j537ut	I think she's wrong. Foreskin allows for the skin to slide over the penis it envelops, which stimulates nerves in there. Circumcision often makes the skin too tight to slide which can make sex/masturbation painful without lubricant.  But some extra skin probably wouldn't do much for women. It doesn't add enough width to the penis to have a noticeable effect compared to a circumcised dick. Maybe it would slide in/out more smoothly but from what I know that would just reduce pain for women rather than increase pleasure. Maybe it does increase pleasure too?  The strongest methods of vaginal stimulation are either the clitoris or some bundle of nerves somewhere at the top of the vaginal opening known as the "g-spot" which seems like a female prostate of sorts.  Reading the "pros" of uncut dick and "cons" of circumcised dick, it seems to me like most of the pros come from good technique and proper vag lubrication, and cons due to a  lack thereof. I think she needs to provide the exact way foreskin/no foreskin can change the mechanics of intercourse as a basis for her claims.  >the website it really looks like "men circumcised, women most affected"  Well yeah, theres the steotype of women faking orgasms for a reason. She posits that men will enjoy sex circumcised while a women will typically hate it. She then says uncircumcised men will enjoy sex a lot more but that women will be able to gain much more pleasure just because vaginas can orgasm multiple times and generally have a greater maximum pleasure output.  So it's not that women are most effected by what happens to a dude's dick, it's just pleasure from SEX with him is effected more. Still have my doubts that it makes as much of a diff as she claims, there are many more factors that go into how good sex is for either party.	1642855701.0	htqk007	t3_s906fn	t3_s906fn	/r/MensRights/comments/s906fn/men_circumcised_women_most_affected/htqk007/

35c0i	Wives had 50/50 control and ownership over everything in the husband's name. They could even take out loans in their husband's name without his signature.  In a divorce, they took half of his stuff. Including half of what he had before he got married. Fun fact though, anything in her name stayed hers. Marriage even back then was pretty sexist against men.  Women around the turn of the 20th century in both the UK and the US figured out that they could take out loans in their husband's names, buy property in their names with that money, and then divorce them for an easy paycheck. Which actually caused some of these laws to be changed. And is when married women were finally banned from taking out certain loans and lines of credit without her husband's signature (something that wasn't "fixed" until the 1970s in the US... a fact that feminists like to yell and scream about completely out of context, and in ignorance of the history around it).	1642856535.0	htqlfs5	t3_s9ntb8	t1_htpni4o	/r/MensRights/comments/s9ntb8/i_dont_get_how_im_supposed_to_believe_women_are/htqlfs5/

c2l0i26t	Would it not make more sense to protest the lack of laws protecting men from rape? Rather than protecting the laws that protect women from rape?  I believe men and women should have equal protection under the law. Marital rape should be a crime no matter what genders are involved.   However there were no marriage strike last year when men had no protection under the law. The protets started as soon as the government attempted to make it illegal to rape your wife. Something that is obviously such a disgusting and cruel act, that it should be illegal.   There are two ways to fight for equality. Fight for men to get the justice they deserve. Or fight for women to face the same injustices men do. Obviously one of those methods is superior and many men in India chose wrong.	1642856672.0	htqlnq4	t3_sa1unk	t3_sa1unk	/r/MensRights/comments/sa1unk/why_marriagestrike_is_trending_in_india/htqlnq4/

No protest for men's right have ever gained media attention. There were many protest for gender neutrality.

5qy04qvo	are you a woman? That makes sense since you don't give a fuck about men, its obvious you were socialized to view men as below you/disposable. We desperately need men's rights because of ignorant posts like yours. You don't have an argument so you resort to insults. You literally are incredibly man-hating and you need to evaluate why your immediate reaction to men's rights is to try and discredit them. Men have emotions and deserve the same amount of love and support women receive.	1643128442.0	hu65h22	t3_scfp5g	t1_hu64xmf	/r/MensRights/comments/scfp5g/getting_dads_tools_for_their_birthday_is_like/hu65h22/
de5gii5	>about 4% of humans are sociopaths, should i avoid everyone then?  Rationale like this probably won't make much impact on a feminist. Remember, they're intentionally being idiots with examples like this.  Either  1) They truly believe 1/3 men are rapists, which ignores all statistics.   2) They're pushing an agenda to limit rights of men.  And in either of these cases, the likelihood that they've faced serious impact from a sociopath is quite low. So in they're mind they'll just tell themselves "well I've never seen anything happen with a sociopath in my life so I can ignore it but my friend on twitter made a #MeToo so clearly rapes are more common"  Some things to point out:  1) The poisonous cake example is a fallacious argument in two aspects. One is that it ignores facts, and two is that it's a false equivalence. A cake that will immediately kill you upon eating it vs being asked out by a man is not the same thing. Flip it around and say "if you had 10000 cakes and one of them would give you a stomach ache, would you eat one?"  2) If this fails and they truly believe 1/3 men are evil, they will almost definitely have more than 3 men in their lives. Further, they're generalizing an entire group off a minority that even they recognize is still a minority in all their delusions. "So your husband, father, grandfather, uncle, friends are all rapists?"  3) Flip the script. "So I can say all women are gold diggers?" "Women use sex to advance in business which means they're less qualified than men who succeed on skill and results." If they can generalize all men from a minority of men, why can't we?   Remember that your goal is not to attack women, it's to highlight the fallacies that they're using in a way that they can understand.	1643128483.0	hu65kv1	t3_scbga4	t3_scbga4	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu65kv1/

yy954	>Get the HPV and HB vaccine if your sexually active.  Go for prostate and colon cancer screenings.  Go for a yearly physical.  In most countries HPV is only given free to women, men having to go to private clinics to get it. Some countries has finaly gotten around to give boys it too after years of lobbying, after it is shown that men get lots of cancer from also, though usually labeled as an additional prevention for women not getting transmission.   All the while there is routinely HPV screenings for women and breast cancer screenings and cancer information sent to women all for free, and put in place by the government, women only having to show up on the given date.   I agree that many men don't take their health seriously, but why should they when the government doesn't care either?   Much of the "men doesn't take care of their health" is just blaming men to distract from any responsibility women and society has for their neglect.	1643128865.0	hu66ky0	t3_sc9ho7	t1_hu5nu1a	/r/MensRights/comments/sc9ho7/united_nations_compared_to_women_men_living_with/hu66ky0/

You're not even trying to take this seriously, you think its a contest where you have to "fight" for women's side. But the truth is, men in the west face things like genital mutilation, justice system biases, and the empathy gap. And women have to face what?

453oj5h1	It baffles me how people think killing is fine. And just because it’s hidden behind skin it’s mitigated somehow. And you are taking into consideration only contraceptive failures which is minimal.  Most unwanted pregnancies result from not using contraception at all or using it wrongly.  If we are talking a group of cells I don’t have an issue but once it starts developing it’s a different story. Especially considering the cut off point. I agree with one point. Parents can ruin their kids lives. But it’s never the kid’s fault it’s been conceived. It’s wholly on the parents. My original point was pointing out how ridiculous it would be to burden all women with the selfish choices of those that abort when not all women believe in killing a developing being once it’s passed the group of cells phase.	1643129608.0	hu68kow	t3_scbga4	t1_hu622fa	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu68kow/

People have literally been trained, whether by the prevailing cultural narrative, or the left-leaning media outlets that parrot it, to instinctually shut down those three words.   It's a [meme](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5720332/heres-why-women-have-turned-the-not-all-men-objection-into-a-meme) in and of itself, it's become so widely abused.  Am I suggesting something as simple as a semantic shift? Yes.   Try something like: "I'm not responsible for how someone else I've never met behaves," if you're getting flak from some woman about a hypothetical harassment or instance of violence.   Also "Citation missing" is a nice one.     And, as others have pointed out, it's nice to bring the hysterical feminist or feminist-ally down to earth when they start spouting ridiculous, exaggerated statistics.

It's also why they push the reduction in UTIs but they could be easily fixed by anti-biotics  It's also why they say it reduces STDs but there's no strong evidence to support this and equal evidence saying it increases STDs.  But, hey, you know what you're talking about obviously, when you have clearly done no research.	1643139494.0	hu6z6xd	t3_scb4i3	t1_hu615zb	/r/MensRights/comments/scb4i3/sharing_an_essay_with_many_references_that_i/hu6z6xd/

3eq6aksv	The only one I see lacking logical thinking here is you.  Yes, medias, as a whole, have been working to reduce peoples' critical thinking skills for decades. People that don't think by themselves but just follow an agenda of what is considered "right" and "wrong" are easier to use; and are the best customers, since they'll accept anything you throw at them. And if you were the ones creating the trends they follow in the first place, you obviously knows WHAT to feed these people. That's the main idea behind advertisement.  The SJW trend is just the last one that tries to change people into brainless customers, but it's a very agressive one. I also has the benefit of creating horizontal conflicts among people, which in turn allows them to avoid vertical ones (the businesses themselves are "clean" and "allies" since they claim to support every minorities under the sun, even if their products are created by exploiting said minorities; nobody cares. So, the attention is distracted towards horizontal conflicts). It's just the good old divide et impera.  Do you think businesses that have an influence over the entire world support this crap out of the goodness of their heart, even when it doesn't sell at all? Who's the one lacking logical thinking here?  Yes, I'm aware of hanlon's razor. But in this case, it is not stupidity. It's basic marketing and a strategy that has been used for thousands of years.	1643139896.0	hu709qs	t3_sc4mfu	t1_hu67urb	/r/MensRights/comments/sc4mfu/ultra_woke_bs_peddled_by_netflix/hu709qs/

99josor0	Yes, it's wrong. There's no such thing as "necessary evil". Misogyny doesn't justify misandry and misandry doesn't justify misogyny. And by definition, "misandrist values" are not values. This sort of messed up mentality is what took us form "let us vote without taking accountability for what we vote" to #KillAllMen. If anything, the way feminism has "evolved" proves that Islamic men are right to keep women on a leash, since offering them equal rights doesn't mean they'll return the favor, but rather they'll use that opportunity to take advantage of and abuse men. Anyway two wrongs don't make a right and an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. You'd think these are easy concepts to grasp, but I see more and more people justifying "one side's" bad behavior with the other's. Not just in intersex relationships, but everything else, politics, LGBT, religion, you name it. No wonder the world goes to shit if this is how people think nowadays. With each passing day, I understand more and more why people of the 80s thought Skynet would drop bombs on us.	1643140570.0	hu72308	t3_sck3re	t3_sck3re	/r/MensRights/comments/sck3re/is_it_wrong_that_i_support_feminism_in_islamic/hu72308/

392cfhb4	Individually there's nothing wrong with this.. A woman was sexually assaulted by a man and as a result she is now more cautious around other men.   That's fine and reasonable..  What's **NOT** reasonable is projecting this caution onto others by making statements like "Teach boys not to rape" (Implying that **ALL** boys grow up to be rapists) or "All men are potential rapists" Same thing.. its now vocalizing their fear into a generalization which is not helpful in anyway and only seeks to have others share in her fear.  Or to use the example 'A dog bit me'  A dog bit me so now I personally am more aware / cautious around dogs is perfectly fine and understandable.  however, A dog bit me and now I'm cautious / afraid of ALL dogs and everyone should be afraid of ALL dogs too! is **NOT** a reasonable response.  So when we say 'Not all men' we are responding specifically to the women who are making sweeping generalized statements about **ALL** men being rapists.. which is just unfair and unjust.	1643140672.0	hu72cxt	t3_scbga4	t1_hu6ajfu	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu72cxt/

Supporting feminism in those countries? That's up to you to decide if it actually helps women or not, but you can't go wrong with egalitarianism. 1 because caring about both does not diminish the other gender. 2 because in the countries were women aren't doing great, then I can assure you that men aren't either, less or not.	1643140732.0	hu72iru	t3_sck3re	t1_hu6nano	/r/MensRights/comments/sck3re/is_it_wrong_that_i_support_feminism_in_islamic/hu72iru/

dd74pbs3	This is a line of thinking that deserves more recognition.   When is it acceptable to use statistics to inform our behavior?  To protect a child? For years men were not allowed to sit next to unaccompanied minors on airplanes. Not sure if this is still the case. Most pedophiles are men.  To protect yourself? Is it ok to cross the street when you see someone you deem a physical threat? A man? A black man?  Most liberals / leftists have inconsistent answers. They think it’s ok for women to cross the street because “some men rape” but would criticize a man for crossing the street when he sees a black man with a “thug” appearance (“urban” dress).   In reality, we all know a middle aged guy of any race or color, wearing a polo and khakis walking down a suburban street is extremely unlikely to assault another man. Clothing communicates socioeconomic class. It’s not a rule, but it is informative.   What about a 20-25 year old, “thug” looking man, wearing urban type clothing? What if he is black or Hispanic? Statistically, that’s More likely a risk to another man.   The truth is that prejudice is sometimes unfounded, but it’s also sometimes based on facts.   The fact that women feel entitled to denigrate all men, or treat all men as a potential threat - but men aren’t entitled to do the same about anyone else, is the true hypocrisy of leftist women and narratives.   Either we are all allowed to speak in generalizations, and to act on them to protect ourselves, or not. Make up your mind.  The narrative on police shootings is a natural segue here, but I’ll leave that for later.	1643140753.0	hu72kts	t3_scbga4	t1_hu5mq96	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu72kts/

Society is cleaned and maintained by men. And no, I'm not kidding you. I'm not saying it's right. But Islamic men are the only ones who aren't denigrated, backstabbed and disrespected by women. In countries where women got "their rights", they turned against men as soon as they didn't need us anymore. So sorry, not soory, but if women do what's right for them, why shouldn't we do the same?

This what he said:  >"One of the things I do worry about among progressives in the United States, maybe it's true here as well, is a certain kind of rigidity where we say 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be' and then we start sometimes creating what's called a 'circular firing squad', where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues."   >   >"If we are launching purity tests, **we are going to have such a small party and will not be able to win**. Governing is not about saying: 'You don't agree with me, then you can't be part of the conversation.'"

p2yh4	I think that you raise fine points, but just to clarify, I wasn't responding to the idea of broadcasting "all men are rapists" in schools or something like that.   In my mind, the question was confined internally. As in, in my head asking myself. Am I justified saying something like "I'm more concerned for my safety when I'm around men I don't know than when I'm around women I don't know?"  Not as a public statement or something that needs to be an official policy, but just asking myself, in my own head. And the answer is a resounding and unequivocal "Yes." In my mind, this is an obvious fact that I'm in more danger from men than from women. That being said, the crux of the issue here is that this generalization is so too wide to be helpful.   If I walk into a biker bar or I walk into a tabletop RPG session, both venues are occupied solely by men, I won't feel the same level of threat. Therefore just saying "I'm wary around men" isn't sufficient.  There are some factors that make me perceive the bikers as more dangerous. Some of those factors are just prejudiced. You know, the stereotype of big angry bikers but there are other factors that are purely objective. Like they are bigger and stronger than me.  I think that it's perfectly reasonable for me to say "When I meet a stranger who looks like he/she can kick my ass. I'm more wary of them than a person who looks like they can't."  Now if that is reasonable for me to say. I think it's also reasonable to admit that for most women, any man looks like a person who could kick their ass.   Therefore If a woman tells me: "I'm afraid to be alone with a strange man." I don't think I'll be like: "This is an outrageous generalization!"	1643142907.0	hu78c99	t3_scbga4	t1_hu571wc	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu78c99/

I know it’s weak, but you will never be able to get a word in after you make your points if you allow the audience to ruminate on their “you’re an incel” prejudice the whole time you’re talking.  Even if you do this, people will say, “Well, he knew what he was doing, why else would he feel the need to preface his statements like that.”  So, in order to hedge against that, you need to go as far as to say, “I’m only prefacing my statements with this because I’m aware that not everyone with my beliefs expresses them in good faith.”	1643142926.0	hu78e5t	t3_scn1m7	t3_scn1m7	/r/MensRights/comments/scn1m7/im_afraid_to_speak_about_mens_problems_at/hu78e5t/
7gpdb	I'll do ya one better: how often do you hear women say (regarding men), "I can't tell by looking *who the good ones* are." They do it without realizing that's exactly what pearl-clutching white women said about black people. Don't trust one of them because they might actually be one of *the bad ones*. It's racism, and this argument only serves to justify prejudice. Telling this to the women at 2-x got me banned from their subreddit. I guess pointing out that feminists are so sexist they sound like racists... was not a desirable thing for the mods. Or maybe, in their eyes, it's ok to be hateful toward men because soooo many men victimize women (yeah, except most victims of crime are men because even criminals don't want to hurt women)...

abhbtrb9	here's the thing, i don't believe my view of feminism is particularly flawed. while I am perfectly clear some individual feminists are not evil, and they just believe they're oppressed and want equality, there's nothing that has shown to me feminism in general, does not think this way. again, i will link back to my point that we even call these extremists feminists being bad representation to the group. also, just because the individual doesn't feel that way, believeallwomen is still very prevalent and I've not seen enough people shut down the idea to believe it isn't massively supported inside the feminist community as a way to encourage more women to report sexual assault.  even just the fact we recently saw a push to give men a 6PM curfew in the UK government, and have them backtrack and apologise after rejecting the push should say everything about the impact the wider feminism has accomplished. this is not just the work of a few bad apples, and even if it is, the outnumbering good apples aren't doing enough to stop the bad spoiling the batch. i can understand where you're coming from too, but i feel your view may be overlooking the true influence of the bad batch.	1643143137.0	hu78yoa	t3_sbh90y	t1_hu712ho	/r/MensRights/comments/sbh90y/uk_teacher_is_found_not_guilty_of_abusing_female/hu78yoa/

If however you present them with a man who is weary of women after having fallen victim to abuse at the hands of one or more women they will equally blame said man for his “misogyny”. They forget that the majority of child abuse is perpetrated by mothers.

e095iqhj	Exactly. It’s a psychological response to be cautious around men if you were victimized by a man in any way, we can’t blame women for feeling this way. Even if they weren’t the victim. For example, if a you were a woman and your friend was assaulted by one of her guy friends that she really trusted, it would be hard to trust your own guy friends.   I also see many stories of men on here who have been falsely accused, and later have trouble trusting women. That is also valid, even thought not ALL women have falsely accused them.	1643144598.0	hu7cvhq	t3_scbga4	t1_hu65f4e	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu7cvhq/

auh5y	I feel like no one here has focused on the fact the society has been organized to protect women, especially mothers. Someone here mentioned that because of the "matriarchy", but I think that was tongue in cheek. Even if society is organized as a "patriarchy", as feminists suggest, the whole focus of society is to protect women, especially mothers. A gynocentric patriarchy if you will.  Women generally get more time off because society cannot abide a suffering women and will bend over backwards to keep them comfortable. It isn't just the simps. It is society as a whole. Anything that grates on the female sensibilities is relegated as fringes of society. Just pay attention to the things that guys find interesting like hobbies, types of women, types of men, etc. You'll find that a lot of them will be denigrated and dismissed as immature.  But with all that said I think the OP's frustration is valid, and I want to encourage and support him.

That said, I feel women should get more mat leave than men get for pat leave. This isn't an equality issue. Men should absolutely get generous pat leave.

3hgj2c0i	I’m sorry to hear you feel this way. I think in any situation like this you need to be calm, open, polite and balanced in your language, and it doesn’t harm to smile and show people this is not an argument. I would also suggest speaking about how you would like ideas on how to create a truly inclusive environment for ALL, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation etc. which, as I understand from your post, is actually what you are trying to do. Sometimes creating separate groups in the name of equality and diversity causes more disconnection by excluding certain groups. Unfortunately due to the sheer number of women who have experienced various types of abuse it is often necessary to have female only spaces. However it’s wrong that there isn’t any other groups for anyone who doesn’t want to join that, or doesn’t identify as female, so I totally get why you might want to suggest an open study group that is for anyone who wants to join, it’s a lovely idea and I struggle to see how anyone would argue against that being offered.	1643145370.0	hu7exjd	t3_scn1m7	t3_scn1m7	/r/MensRights/comments/scn1m7/im_afraid_to_speak_about_mens_problems_at/hu7exjd/

Anyways if someone been after you to fix something, and then buys said tools to fix that issue for a birthday or something, I could see an issue. Most guys I know don't really care much about gifts though. I can't remember the last time I got a gift at all. My kids tend to get there mom something, but not me and I'm ok with that. My wife gives me other things extra on special occasions and I don't need anything from anyone else. I've known a few guys who do care about getting things, but I know couldn't care less.

3mtarqo0	First of all, a nice iron would probably be a pretty great gift. Get a nice ironing bench to go with it. Second, getting tools is something men probably really like. Why try to make it something offensive? Good tools are very useful because it's a reality someone is gonna need them around the house.

e095iqhj	Okay but I also see many stories from men on here who have been falsely accused, and later have trouble trusting women. That is also valid, even thought not ALL women have falsely accused them.   Even though most women haven’t falsely accused a man, it is completely fair for a man who has gone through that to not trust most women. It’s simply a psychological response to the trauma. Even if you were not the one falsely accused, if something like that happens to someone you know, that would also impact how you feel around women. You could logically know that not all women are like that, but you would still be cautious bc of what happened to you or someone you know.   In the same way, it makes sense for a women who has been assaulted/harassed by a man to not trust most men. It’s also, simply a psychological response to the trauma. Also, consider the fact that most women know someone who has been assaulted. It makes sense that they would have trouble trusting men if something like that happened to them or someone they know. This isn’t even their fault, like I said it’s a trauma response.	1643145475.0	hu7f7li	t3_scbga4	t3_scbga4	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu7f7li/

5daff5a	From a utilitarian perspective in terms of usefulness and contribution to society (payment of taxes, employment and wealth generation, doing dangerous jobs, etc.,), it's man > woman > child so that's how my priority would be. So, if I had to choose who to hit, it would be child > woman > man. Losing a child is not a big deal. The adults can just make another one. Replacing a man, especially a skilled man is a much more tedious task which takes several more years and resources.	1643145669.0	hu7fq9r	t3_sckvnr	t3_sckvnr	/r/MensRights/comments/sckvnr/simp_moment_on_reddit/hu7fq9r/

ih2hp08	Wow that's really cool. I just added an edit to my post. What do you think I should expect if I push the issue with my company?  I actually agree that the leave timeframes don't need to be identical between sexes. After seeing my wife in pain, her physical limitations and the burden of breastfeeding it became very clear how important her recovery was/is. And I became quite infuriated with how my employer treated my role in helping her recover and supporting my family by BEING PRESENT not to mention bonding with my baby. If Paternity leave was treated with the same respect that Maternity leave is I would have been allowed to disconnect. It's that ATTITUDE , reinforced by vastly different policies, that makes it an equality issue in my opinion.	1643145796.0	hu7g2ig	t3_scf6ah	t1_hu7enfa	/r/MensRights/comments/scf6ah/help_me_understand_why_in_this_day_and_age/hu7g2ig/

Being gay in the military is a totally different question, I don’t see how that’s related at all.

3hgj2c0i	I’d also avoid vocalising any comparison about what women have versus what men have. Your point seems much more about how to access support, regardless of gender, to achieve more of a balance in how this is distributed, and to ensure everyone feels supported and included which is entirely valid and fair. If you feel comfortable I would then go on to perhaps share something of your own experience and feeling as an example, feeling unwelcome and not having the same opportunities, keep it short and then seek to move towards a positive solution and discussion. Speaking about inclusivity in this way is far more positive than pitting people or groups against each other. Show that you value supporting all people irrespective of differences, make it a positive discussion about how we can achieve this rather than a complaint about what women have that men don’t etc. in the end it is up to you how you approach but I hope some of the suggestions I’ve made are of use. Nothing you’ve raised is wrong so it’s all about how you position the discussion and you should feel proud to stand up for true inclusivity and your beliefs, good luck!	1643146238.0	hu7h8sg	t3_scn1m7	t3_scn1m7	/r/MensRights/comments/scn1m7/im_afraid_to_speak_about_mens_problems_at/hu7h8sg/
bvu88elj	For hundreds of years before the Victorian era, men in England and France used makeup, partly for esthetic reasons and in some cases to cover smallpox scars.  Christianity had nothing to do with it. Nor did Christianity unite Europe. For centuries, many wars were fought between between Catholic and Protestants.  If you think heavy makeup is suggestive of prostitution, you haven’t been to many beauty pageants, including those for prepubescent girls. Indeed, heavy makeup is common through much of the South and conservative Christian communities.	1643146256.0	hu7haiz	t3_sc9i03	t1_hu5186u	/r/MensRights/comments/sc9i03/social_stigma_and_general_acceptance_or_lack/hu7haiz/

Conveniently lined up with something the gifter wanted done for them  There's no beating around the bush, that's lame.  Now, that being said, I've also been given tools that I really wanted, but couldn't justify the $, and the gift-giver knew me, knew my hobbies, and wanted to make me happy.  Those kinds of thoughtful gifts make me smile every time I use the tool, because of what went in to it.

And that means challenging policy where it favors one person over another. I don't know that there is a life event more impactful than having a child. But men should take unpaid leave or quit their jobs to be with child and Women should be allowed to stay at home at 100% pay?  Plus your logic has major holes. In this scenario a "bad" or inadequate mother becomes encouraged to spend more time with child than a "good" father simply because they are the Mom. Let's step in to the 21st century, Mom's are not superior to Dad's.	1643147621.0	hu7kt5c	t3_scf6ah	t1_hu75rj5	/r/MensRights/comments/scf6ah/help_me_understand_why_in_this_day_and_age/hu7kt5c/

dvku7	Disagree. I do all the laundry and all the home repairs in my household, and there is no comparing a good set of tools to an iron. I use my tools for repair jobs, but also for personal projects-- and I enjoy both. Ironing just needs to get done.

2v4g7qms	First of all, ignore all the drama queens in the comments talking about how you will surely be expelled and loose your degree for even suggesting that men should be supported. That won't happen, the worst that could happen is that you get into an argument with someone and a lot of people write you off as an idiot or a loser. Sure, that would suck, but it won't be life ending.  And to the drama queens, how counterproductive are you trying to be exactly? Why are you trying to scare your fellow MRAs into not taking action? That's the exact opposite of what we need. It would be one thing if you were honestly warning someone of the threats they face, but you aren't doing that. You're just scaremongering.  I don't know much about Germany, but I know what I would say as a U.S. college student. I would point out that men now make up about 40% of college students, there are numerous female-only scholarships and programs. Feminists are going to try to justify the resources for women and lack of resources for men by saying that men are privileged in universities, so if they do that, it's important to be ready with statistics that demonstrate that this isn't the case. If the feminists were to argue that men have been historically privileged, I would point out that even in the 1920s, women attended college at about the same rate as men, and that the disparity that caused men to surpass women in college attendance started once we began drafting men into wars and implemented the GI Bill, which granted funds for veterans to use for education or for buying a home. The last war in which men were drafted was the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. The gap between men and women in college was closed in the 1980s.   I don't know the exact situation in Germany, but it may be similar, and being familiar with the history may be valuable if it devolves into an argument with a feminist crying "male privilege." Most importantly, don't ever apologize for speaking up for men. Apologies aren't taken by feminists as an olive branch, they are taken as an admission of guilt.	1643148119.0	hu7m2wr	t3_scn1m7	t3_scn1m7	/r/MensRights/comments/scn1m7/im_afraid_to_speak_about_mens_problems_at/hu7m2wr/

30ymvhrd	Colleges tend to be incredibly gynocentric and have no empathy for men’s issues.  Your concerns about negative reactions from the woke crowd are valid concerns.     One thing thing I frequently used to help when I worked in higher education was the college’s non discrimination statement.     When SJWs proposed women only spaces or events, I’d shake my head as if empathetic, but say their idea violated the college’s non discrimination statement.  See if your school has such a statement or stated philosophy.	1643148356.0	hu7mnzf	t3_scn1m7	t3_scn1m7	/r/MensRights/comments/scn1m7/im_afraid_to_speak_about_mens_problems_at/hu7mnzf/
cwf9o9g7	100% , i just made an honest observation. Because being progressive doesnt meant constantly demonizing white males. And sticking to the topic, Ozark has destroyed all t=strong male characters , both white and non white, and the remaining male characters has been watered down to either effeminate or outright dumb. At the beginning you dont notice , but as the story progress, you realize that they are trying to give a message here, which is very blatant by sacrificing the story. You wont see a single frame where there are no female rough riding character in it.

I have bought my mom tools back when she was a new homeowner but i wouldn’t at this stage in life when DIYing is not something she does anymore. My husband asks for tools pretty much anytime someone asks what he wants for a gift giving occasion. Coincidentally, he works using tools for a living so he might actually use a gift for work, like you complained about.	1643148658.0	hu7nekw	t3_scfp5g	t3_scfp5g	/r/MensRights/comments/scfp5g/getting_dads_tools_for_their_birthday_is_like/hu7nekw/

15it3r	I figured I'll put this here as well.  There's a common quote attributed to Bell Hooks about the [false accusations in the Central Park 5 scandal against 5 minority boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_jogger_case)).  From *Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics*, page 106:  >No one can truly believe that the young black males involved in the Central Park incident were not engaged in a suicidal ritual enactment of a dangerous masculinity that will ultimately threaten their lives, their well-being. If one reads Michael Dyson’s piece “The Plight of Black Men,” focusing especially on the part where he describes the reason many young black men form gangs - “the sense of absolute belonging and unsurpassed love” - it is easy to understand why young black males are despairing and nihilistic. And it is rather naive to think that if they do not value their own lives, they will value the lives of others. Is it really so difficult for folks to see connection between the constant pornographic glorification of male violence against women that is represented, enacted, and condoned daily in the culture and the Central Park crime?  The funny thing is people post this quote and then her supporters come in and try to say that it's taken out of context.  But the context, if you want to call it that, doesn't change what people are actually upset about in the quote.  And this really isn't even the worst thing she's said, either.  It just got a lot of attention because of the recent coverage of the Central Park 5 scandal in a Netflix documentary.  I'm not going to transcribe more of it here, and I'm not going to link to any of that "drama" (particularly on Twitter) about the context of this quote, but longer versions of it are easily found.  It goes from *"white people suspect black men because black men do stuff like this"* to *"white people suspect black men because black men do stuff like this because of the patriarchy and centuries of racism"* to *"white people suspect black men because black men do stuff like this because of the black patriarchy which has origins with the white patriarchy, and possibly from cultural attitudes that came from Africa, depending on which book of hers you're reading"* (the context there being her entire psudo-intellectual framework about the patriarchy, which is just 🤮).  She ultimately still sees black men as monsters who need to *"be better"* in order to fix these hurtful stereotypes. Her language of the patriarchy is intellectual double-speak that confuses some people, just enough, to not see the underlying problems with what she's saying.	1643149076.0	hu7of2r	t3_scnlcy	t3_scnlcy	/r/MensRights/comments/scnlcy/we_often_say_that_nobody_would_call_black_people/hu7of2r/

cwf9o9g7	Very well thought out comment ! While I do agree with many of your points , it is the constant symbolism in the show, specially season 4. Up until season 3, i believe it was completely fine, the remained realistic and very interesting. HELEN PIERCE is one of my most favorite character in the whole show. But in season 4, literally they went over over board to go woke. "YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF FETUS LOVING, WOMEN HATING MONSTERS"- WTF WAS THAT ( I AM A DEMOCRAT BTW) , then came the "YOU ARE SUPRESSING VOTE" , they could have done the job much differently if they wanted to.    Ruth is now Jona byrdes "master" ( - according to darlene) , darlene shoots someones dick off ( at the beginning it seemed to be an interesting part of the story, now it feels like nothing more than girl power trope)    The CEO of big pharma (she doesnt fit the role, should have chosen some other female ) "throws out her BROTHER" ,  if you still cannot detect the woke hints in literally  every scene of ozar S04 , then i am sorry.	1643149108.0	hu7ohx1	t3_sc4mfu	t1_hu54sr5	/r/MensRights/comments/sc4mfu/ultra_woke_bs_peddled_by_netflix/hu7ohx1/

b80o6	>dude op is the one who said women get stared at not me  Maybe you should read what you type before hitting the reply button...    >and feminism is just about gender equality  Since when?   FYI:  Feminists like to claim that their movement is about "equality" and often use the dictionary definition as proof.   But what the dictionary says and what feminism and feminists do are two completely different things.   Actions speak louder than words, therefore feminism and feminists should be judged by what it and they do instead of what the dictionary definition says.   And through its actions the feminist movement has constantly shows that it isn't about equality, but is actually about female privilege and misandry -  a skewed system in women's favour, seeking superior rights & privileges for women, demonising men & boys.   **It is very obvious that "equality" is nothing more than a mask that the feminist movement uses to conceal its female privilege and anti-male agendas.**  ---------------------------------------------------------  *Feminism was and is always a supremacy movement, and feminists will do what ever it takes to keep perpetuating it. This necessitates playing on people's emotions and painting MRA's as evil regardless of the truth. Therefore to succeed MRA's must expose the nature of feminism and give feminism zero moral ground.*	1643149911.0	hu7qgyz	t3_sb9oli	t1_hu57jj2	/r/MensRights/comments/sb9oli/what_do_you_guys_think_about_the_male_gaze/hu7qgyz/

50fejop9	How exactly is the way that people are treating men (or whatever group) at all like eating cake (skittles)?  Would it make sense to bring all three cakes into a room and lecture them about how they shouldn't be poison? As though this would make them safer to eat?  Would it make sense to assume that cookies are never poison? If we come across a cookie and cake sitting next to each other, and "that cake is poison" is written in frosting on the cookie and "that cookie is poison" is written on the cake should we just believe the cookie, because statistically most poisoned pastries are cakes?  Should we not eat anything, ever, because it might be poison?  The only way this analogy makes any sense at all is if we accept the presumption that the victim of the poisoning has taken some voluntary action which directly enabled the poisoning and that they could have prevented by being more prejudiced.  Isn't that victim blaming, at the very least?	1643150400.0	hu7rpp5	t3_scbga4	t3_scbga4	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu7rpp5/

5x9r4ntn	There are ways to mitigate the risks, the problems with that are: 1. It requires accepting responsibility for doing the things that mitigate the risks. Basically - become an adult. 2.In doing so you will gain the habits and knowledge nesessary to solve your own problems, thus having no need for outsourcing that responsibility. This makes you harder to control and scam, which is the bread and butter of all of the groups that seek to propagate the men=bad narrative. That also means that if you think for yourself they can't embesel/racket money from the charity's and organisations. 3. By taking things into your own hands you start learning - which doesn't make you a lot of "friends", as you start to see the gaps in logic, same logical constructs. Example how most people don't know where the word terrorism comes from, or why all left-wing based movements invariably lead to horrible outcomes (for example concentration camps, effectively slave labour) .  If you live in fear you will never do the things that make life worth living, that however doesn't mean you should do stupid things.	1643151023.0	hu7tbb0	t3_scbga4	t3_scbga4	/r/MensRights/comments/scbga4/discussion_not_all_men/hu7tbb0/

867db4al	No. I wouldn't eat any of the cake. But every cake slice in every cake in the world isn't poinous. A group of men might have a rapist. But not every group of men have a rapist.  I remember telling a woman that this logic is the same that racists use. She denied it and said "No. Because men are a gender not a race" I never implied that she was being racist. Nor did I imply that men are a race. She took the word "race" out of my statement and ran with it.  She couldn't even see the problem in this logic. But if it were "all women kill their babies" I'm pretty sure everyone would call sexism and wouldn't allow any man to justify that generalization by using the "three slices, one poisonous" or "basket of berries, some poisonous" analogy.   Makes me wanna fucking off myself as a guy because of the stupid outrageous double standards people create.

1hh8d8by	I honestly couldn't agree with you more. I think the first six months of a baby's life should be spent being reared by both parents ( if that's the family dynamic). I think both should get 6 months paid leave and an optional additional 6 months subsidised by the government. Or don't take it concurrently, whatever makes sense for you.   Imagine the company loyalty you would have to work if they actually considered your life. Look how easily we all switched to work from home when the option to say no was removed.   We have to insist that companies treat us like people. With paid parental rights a part of legislation. Why do people think father's don't want to rear their children, they're hardwired to do so.	1643153154.0	hu7yoxz	t3_scf6ah	t1_hu7pua5	/r/MensRights/comments/scf6ah/help_me_understand_why_in_this_day_and_age/hu7yoxz/

eg3ar	I used to get my dad old spice, growing up. Turns out, he was allergic to most perfumed products. I finally settled on giving him some obscure cd of ethnic music, always with a Latin flare. It was a passion we shared.   He made the mistake of hearing my mother complain about her vacuum during their first year married. He bought her a very nice vacuum for Christmas. She (probably not so nicely) explained that was a necessary TOOL and not a gift. A gift is thought out, and something she wouldn’t buy for herself. I stand to inherit a lot of quality jewelry, lol. I don’t wear much jewelry, as I am very active at work.   My husband complained he didn’t have a jacket. Two days after I bought a nice, versatile jacket for him for Christmas. Once, he mentioned wanting a finishing nail gun. He has only used it a few times, but it’s high quality and he appreciated it.   So, it depends on the guy.

These companies don’t do anything out of the goodness of their hearts and they need to be strong armed into giving employees what they deserve.   And they should really consider the gravity of what’s being asked : at a minimum, simply more time for Fathers. What % of new Father’s will even comprise their workforce? It’s such an easy and low impact cost to offer that sends such a positive message about the company culture.   I totally agree that , like WFH, being on the wrong side of this should begin to expose these large employers who don’t have employees best interest in mind.	1643157481.0	hu8956f	t3_scf6ah	t1_hu7yoxz	/r/MensRights/comments/scf6ah/help_me_understand_why_in_this_day_and_age/hu8956f/

4c2tfmlh	I think he’s right about women getting slightly more leave than men. After all it’s not about being ready to return to work.  Imagine there was a job to do and there was two people who could do it. One person really strained themselves to complete the job while the other sat there and did nothing. A week after the job is done, the person who did all the work would likely be perfectly recovered and in a similar state to the one who did nothing. Would it be right to then send them both back to normal work?  Obviously I’m exaggerating a lot, but my point still stands. The woman will likely be doing more work and will have gone through the most pain. It’s only fair for her to get a longer grace period than a man who didn’t go through the birth himself.  Though that’s not to take away from the fact that men don’t get enough, because they don’t.	1643157601.0	hu89ffb	t3_scf6ah	t1_hu5xmre	/r/MensRights/comments/scf6ah/help_me_understand_why_in_this_day_and_age/hu89ffb/

There is acknowledgement on Wikipedia that it has nevertheless been challenging for men to get coverage under the Act, and measures have been passed to address this issue, like the 2013 non-discrimination provision. As for the law, US law uses language that empowers men to report women for DV and sexual assault.  And it is not true that police are required to arrest male DV victims of females.

67mofgzp	>Those lands were conquered by men while women cooked their meals, made their clothes, and cleaned the homes they built on that land, which we continue to do today.  That's not the point. The point is that land owners had the mandatory responsibility to answer the ruler's call for war, be it defensive or offensive. Lands and titles were in fact most often awarded to men as a reward for their loyalty and military achievements. Men fought wars, (in fact more often called into it by a Queen then a King in mid age Europe), men got the rights of land ownership along with a plathora of assigned responsibilities. And not even all men, but a minority.  >It doesn't stand to reason that because certain rights and privileges come with certain responsibilities, it was thus the right thing to do to deny women property and bank accounts.  I never said it was the right thing to do, nor that it was just. I said the reason for all this is the way societies conducted themselves in eras when survival was more important then individual rights. It wasn't to oppress women, nor was it to benefit men. If anything, it was to benefit the ruling class which consisted of both men and women. What feminism also fails to account for is the fact that most men and most women didn't have any rights or privileges whatsoever. The life of the common people weren't at all so different in the basic principles from today's people. Only back then, roles were given and socially enforced (by both sexes) for both men and women and if you were born into a role, you likely died with that role. Wether you were a man or a woman, it was insignificant from this standpoint.  >Also, I would point out here that many women today are still doing the cooking, cleaning, and childrearing while also working a full time job.  Many women do while many women do NOT, and many women do part time jobs. If you come at me with general statistics you don't get to shift the conversation to the individual level. Men generally work more hours, commute further, and as a result spend much more time away from the family. This accounts for the less chores and childraring done by men on the general basis and not "carelessness" or "toxic masculinity" or whatever "boogie man" you guys usually come up with. This doesn't mean that there are no careless people on the individual basis, but you need to use different measures when you talk about on the basis of individuals vs on the basis of groups. You guys keep mixing the two which is dishonest at best.  Even the source you yourself cited confirms what i said to the "T". I can not derive any other conclusion that you suffer from confirmation bias, as you cherry pick elements that confirms your theories, which is a common mistake.   At this point i would like to respectfully ask you not to get out from the conversation. I need you to rebutt the statements above, or have the courage to say if you can not. It happens way too many times that people have their worldview objectively destroyed, as a result they walk away from the debate, then a few days later they appear parroting their debunked claims like nothing ever happened.	1643309015.0	huh2dxw	t3_sd90ty	t1_hufd71b	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huh2dxw/

Well, I think most people in the UK are pretty sensible and tend to do the right thing rather than completely crazy stuff out of a fear of out-of-control litigation as exists in certain other countries.  But, it does seem that there are certain cases where the law breaks down. This case seems like a likely contender.   The concepts of 'hate crime' and 'hate speech' are obviously highly politicized, highly suspect and should probably be removed completely.  As a resident of the UK, I hope we can work towards this goal of building a better society.  But, just look at Reddit.

1fax70th	You can believe that your point still stands, but that doesn't necessarily make it so. Sex differences in intelligence, or the lack thereof, have no bearing on my original statement of epistemological technique. It is a red herring, and a poor one at that.  I believe that people that use morality to justify experience or action under the guise of reason are intellectually dishonest, that doesn't necessarily mean my belief is true. Belief is not proof.  You can believe in the "patriarchy" all you want, but without proof of conspiracy amongst men to take deliberate concrete action to oppress women as a class, it is nothing more than propaganda designed to coerce people into following an agenda.

I've acknowledged in some post somewhere today that I do think it's possible that men reporting sexual assault may not be listened to or have their cases investigated to the same degree as some women, and I'm acknowledging it again.  I would strongly suggest that you don't assume how much knowledge I have based on the limited information I've given you about myself.  And no, sorry. You're clearly requesting the link so that you can try to take the document apart, and that really isn't relevant to the original conversation, and isn't a conversation I'm interested in having with you. You'll excuse me if I don't share my personal information with strangers who give off negative vibes. I mentioned my thesis to prove my point that you referring to the survey as a "poor source" is in contradiction to what my more qualified advisors said, and my point rests. You judging the quality of my thesis will not help your argument that this nationally known and respected survey is a poor source.	1643309314.0	huh389z	t3_sdmkr5	t1_hugm2jg	/r/MensRights/comments/sdmkr5/looking_back_at_the_start_of_metoo/huh389z/
2i7hmnu6	Nope.  The females you referred to were adult women like me.  Nice try though.  It's great that you were raped without trauma but many rape victims kill themselves.  Your personal experience does not invalidate their trauma.  I don't believe that men are just as likely to get raped outside of prison.  That sounds made up.  You hear about women getting raped all the time.  Your jab about how females wouldn't understand this because of our lack of career success was really unnecessary.	1643309319.0	huh38sf	t3_sdmkr5	t1_huh1ftb	/r/MensRights/comments/sdmkr5/looking_back_at_the_start_of_metoo/huh38sf/

Does that give them a right to half of all the stuff men have built? No way. Men are stronger than women. Physically and psychologically. Women are more sensitive, and more compassionate.

j2emgu4a	Let’s talk wage gap then, because as corduroyoyod1 pointed out, there are many systemic reasons for it. Here’s the thing: men and women were socialized differently. Men are told their whole lives that they need to be the bread winner and take financial care of their families, and women are told to find a wealthy husband to take care of you and your kids. Luckily for me, my mother was aware of this and encouraged me to enter the STEM field so I could make lots of money, because that’s how society deems your worth. When I was in my degree at uni, only 18% of my fellow classmates were other women. The guys in my lab groups didn’t know how to act around me, didn’t take me seriously, and made me very uncomfortable at times..asking me out, ogling me or other weird shit. I hated it and switched to a less male-saturated degree. Now I work in admin and make far less pay than I would have, but I’m much happier not having to deal with all the bullshit men were putting me through and likely would have continued throughout my career.  Money = power, and most of the money and power belongs to men. Sure, we could value professions like school teachers and nurses, but since they are predominately female, what’s the point in raising those wages? Professors and doctors on the other hand…  and sure, you could argue that the latter two require more education and training, but that’s just another systemic barrier. That education and training requires time and money, both of which women are typically in shorter supply of than men due to domestic responsibilities, AKA unpaid work.  as for the hard, dangerous and heavy work, those jobs are often codified with language that discourages female candidates from applying. What about gross and undesirable jobs that women do and men don’t what to do, like daycare, housekeeping, salons, elder care? Is that less valuable work?	1643309886.0	huh4tii	t3_sd90ty	t1_hud8hbz	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huh4tii/
1fax70th	>But by not acknowledging anywhere in this thread that men brutalize women (e.g., in domestic violence cases where 94% of intimate partner murder suicide victims are women),  A tragedy to be sure, but this is framing in an attempt to focus the view of domestic violence onto how men victimize women. Women commit 70% of non-reciprocal domestic violence. Meaning, women outnumber men by a factor of 2:1 when committing violence against men. And studies show that *any* such violence has profound effects on psychological well-being regardless of sex.   It could be ignorance on your part or outright intellectual dishonesty, but doing what you did there is abhorrent. Please avoid minimizing female violence when we are discussing *men's* issues. This isn't a female issue space, it is a *men's* space, and I would ask that you give them the same respect you expect.	1643309886.0	huh4tjp	t3_sdjido	t1_huekoqp	/r/MensRights/comments/sdjido/excessive_force_against_men/huh4tjp/

7o73xhl8	Exactly...I have made a similar comment back on (now banned) mgtow2 forum...  The greatest power for feminism doesn't come from women, it comes from the top 1% men which comprises of the simp army..    These men pander to women for political (votes) and economic (consumerism) power.    These top 1% men then subdue the rights of other 99% men to keep their power intact...     Feminism can never destroy patriarchy, coz it draws its power from it.    The only way to destroy feminism to starve it of its power source..     How?    Take away the political and economic power of the top 1 percentile.     If men don't marry and have kids, we will becomes less productive. Less kids means less future taxpayers..    In a few generations the society will get what it rightfully deserves for alienating men..     MGTOW hits the society where it hurts. That's why they censor it.    The ultimate outcome of failure of MRA is MGTOW. We should all strive to avoid that last fate.     Coz it won't end well for humanity..    But if society doesnt heed the warnings..

Circular argument. Gabby could very well have been the aggressor in the first incident, and Brian the aggressor in the second. By using the second to dismiss the police response when you don't know all of the details in both separate incidents is not reasonable.  >Often, women are arrested for one domestic violence episode against men they have been enduring physical abuse from for years.  When women commit 70% of all non-reciprocal domestic violence against men, the same argument could be used to justify the claim that women's deaths in DV are primarily a result of self-defense. It's stupid, but it could be used that way.

The issue was the misleading infographic that uses different scales to present a biased view.   I have no interest in who you are and honestly am offended by that. Why would I care? Such an odd statement.  I'm curious about the thesis, because you say it was from a sole source, which to me is poor practice.  Am I putting your degree down? nah I just know it's not hard, and I know that from personal experience. Big yourself up if you want, but it's not hard. Been there, done it and got the paper to prove it. It may have seen hard at the time, in hindsight you'll realize it wasn't.  Academics as you'll learn will say whatever you want for money. If you're paying them then they will keep you happy.  As for your thesis, if it wouldn't stand up to peer review than its not worth the time involved. That's what peer review means.

It‘s very disheartening to see a lot of men on here paint women and feminism with a broad brush without a second thought. I feel like each men’s rights activist I’ve come across has different points, some I agree with and disagree with on a case but case basis. I like to think that there are reasonable feminists and reasonable men’s rights activists who can find common ground on these issues.  I’m truly sorry if you were neglected as a boy. I too was neglected as a girl, and regularly emotionally attacked by my father with little to no help from my mother. But I recognize that my brother had it worse, as he faced physical abuse on top of all the other abuse. Life is hard, regardless of your circumstances.

First: a guy who worked for me was dating a coworker.  Her fiance (big surprise to my guy) found an explicit text message  and she was suddenly filling a complaint for sexual harassment. Problem was their relationship was well documented.  Second:  a woman who had a huge anger management problem had a full rage meltdown when her boss told her she couldn't treat people the way she did.  She said and I quote "fuck you, I quit!" And stormed out.  Whole office heard it.  She called HR from the parking lot and said "I couldn't take the harassment any more".  Third:  married couple worked in the same department,  they had a bad breakup.   She thought the number of complaints she filed against him both at work and by police would help her divorce position.  She ended up being fired for harassing him.  Of the only three incidents I know the absolute facts of, all of them were maliciously false.  So yeah, when I hear complaints that I don't know anything about,  my initial reaction is doubt.

The sophisticated modern feminist seeks plausible deniability for lacking as much empathy for men as they do women by acknowledging men's struggles, but still blaming patriarchy, and empowers feminists with influence to continue focusing on women while giving lip service to men's issues.	1643311114.0	huh8675	t3_sdzl26	t3_sdzl26	/r/MensRights/comments/sdzl26/andrew_yang_supports_men_and_boys/huh8675/

j2d0c0x3	"That's not the point. The point is that land owners had the mandatory responsibility to answer the ruler's call for war, be it defensive or offensive. Lands and titles were in fact most often awarded to men as a reward for their loyalty and military achievements. Men fought wars, (in fact more often called into it by a Queen then a King in mid age Europe), men got the rights of land ownership along with a plathora of assigned responsibilities. And not even all men, but a minority."  By this point, you are already talking about a patriarchal social structure that was oppressing women. My point is that before all these systems like landownership and militaries were created, I believe that there was an opportunity, and still is, for men to view the contributions that women make as equal, and to then afford us equal rights. You say, well, that's the way it had to be for survival, but I don't see how it affects the survival of the human race to allow women to own property.  And to me, the significance of gender roles in those times is that we still see their impact on men and women today, centuries later.  "What feminism also fails to account for is the fact that most men and most women didn't have any rights or privileges whatsoever. " What I would point out in response is that as soon as those rights and privileges started developing, they started going disproprionately to men, and that imbalance persists today.  As for my source, you're right. I thought that the data reflected women working more hours outside the home and inside the home, but this data doesn't. It's not that I'm cherry picking, though. My personal experience of having a mother that put in vastly more hours of work every day of the week, whether for work or the home, while my father worked his 40 hours and then watched TV is important to me because I couldn't see much justification for his behavior beyond sexism and laziness. I realize now that this experience probably doesn't reflect the data trend, and I hope that my willingness to acknowledge that I'm wrong in this point will help you not to make assumptions in the future that you're "objectively destroying" my worldview when I have no problem admitting I can be wrong, and I'm going to go about my day now with a slightly altered worldview and the knowledge that I've gotten at least one guy on here today to admit that he made a mistake with data, too.

4srbgbef	There is nothing you can do about how other people behave. But you can change your own behaviour. There are ways to vet men, you look for honesty, kindness, consistency, humbleness. The probability of finding a man that wont rape increases if you find them in churches as well. Whether you are religious or not, those are all variables that can better your odds. Find the group's of women who have not been raped, and mimic their behaviour/strategy.  You are the one who is really assigning blame, because you are looking to blame men rather than actually practically change your behaviour.

You seem to have a chip on your shoulder regarding education. So do I. I'm no academic. As  I said, I brought up my thesis not to brag, but to support the source I cited as quality enough that university professors considered it acceptable. If you still think the national survey is a wate of time because of an infographic posted on a different page than the actual survey, then I'm not sure how else to change your mind. I've already agreed that that graphic seems biased.   My thesis would stand up to peer review, I hope, but it's only an undergraduate thesis, and at least for my school, they aren't peer reviewed. Also, I know what peer review means. I'm sorry I offended you.

j2emgu4a	As far as parenting issues and abortion goes, I’ve seen men make the claim on here that because they had the responsibility to take care of the finances and estate, that they should have the jobs and money, etc. That it was acceptable for women to be excluded from this critical institution.     so by that logic, women who are in charge of carrying the spawn for 9 months, then feeding it, raising it, while the man goes out and works and is just too wiped out to help when he gets home, should be the one with the right to decide on whether or not to have the child in the first place. She will be the one to do most of the work.     i don’t really care one way or another on abortion, I just want to understand why a man’s say would have any weight on the topic when they, in most cases not all, do less work and are far less involved in the bearing and raising of a child.  if you say, well of course he has a right, then i argue that not allowing women to have an income or bank account simply because she had less responsibility in those realms was not acceptable.  I have identified as a feminist for many years, and do not see my views as being focused only on women. I see society as focused on men, and feminism as a vehicle to remind men that women are being treated as second class citizens. I’m not trying to say men’s lives are easy, but for most of history, they have had more power and control than women. With men at the helm, they could prioritize their own interests, while ignoring others. I don’t think it’s harmful or radical for women to speak up. I have a wonderful life as a woman. I wouldn’t trade it for the world, but there are still some things that fucking suck, my man.	1643312968.0	huhd80l	t3_sdzege	t1_hugl9mh	/r/MensRights/comments/sdzege/feminism_is_trying_to_control_the_equality/huhd80l/

c6tufhax	I guessed as much, but I couldn't be sure. I was a member of a UK based forum for many years, and what I saw there strongly suggested that British men may still have some antiquated ideas about women. I have a friend my age in the UK who used to vacation here every year, and I couldn't help but notice that he talks to his wife in a way that no American woman would put up with, calling her a "daft cow", and commenting that she had trouble thinking rationally because she's a woman.   In fact, I was thinking back to my university days to see if there was anything there to lend credence to your comment about how female students are treated, and the only example that occurred to me was a professor I had from England. It always bothered me that he seemed to talk to his female students as if they were small children, and if they hadn't done the assignment correctly, he would just let it slide. Male students were held to higher standards. I always assumed this was because he was very old compared to my other professors, but it may in fact have been a cultural difference.	1643313507.0	huhep85	t3_sdfnc1	t1_huh7zxg	/r/MensRights/comments/sdfnc1/not_supporting_feminism_does_not_make_me_a_sexist/huhep85/

j2d0c0x3	I've looked at the Duluth model and I don't see where it is discriminating against men. Can you post a link?   It isn't circular reasoning to point out that Gabby may have lied to the police about starting the violence to protect Brian from arrest, and it isn't circular to point out that the police were faulted with not following up with a witness of the violence. It would be circular to say that the police should have arrested Brian as the killer when he hadn't yet killed.  I was reflecting on this statement - "Another thing to note which you have kindly brought our attention to is the issue where women are treated far more leniently as suspects in domestic violence situations. In the review following the Gabby Petito case, one of the ONLY things the police officers were found to have done wrong was not issuing her with a DV citation (she admitted striking him first in the incident to which they were called out). If they had been more willing to arrest her (thereby physically separating them) who knows how differently things could have gone in that tragic case."   I take issue with language like "if they had been more willing to arrest her," used after the fact by someone who is actually aware that Brian was the killer. While it's impossible to know what their last argument looked like, I can't imagine what Gabby could have been done to make language like, "If they had been more willing to arrest her," appropriate. I don't see that they had any more evidence to arrest Gabby than they did to arrest Brian, except that she admitted to something that may not have happened that way. I sure wish they had been more willing to talk to that witness and arrest Brian, because he was the threat, and it's not circular to acknowledge that they might have discovered this had they completed their investigation.  I'm not sure about that 70% statistic, but it's true, the argument could be reversed.	1643313555.0	huhetum	t3_sdjido	t1_huh663n	/r/MensRights/comments/sdjido/excessive_force_against_men/huhetum/

I would ask for a citation on that 70% so I can read some more on it, but your comparison of non-reciprocal domestic violence to my point about intimate partner murder suicide seems to me to be minimizing violence against women, actually. I am showing you respect when I say that I would like to read more of the data on non-reciprocal domestic violence.  I'm not sure you're showing me respect when you suggest that receiving non-reciprocal domestic violence is on par with being murdered. My point was that when it comes to the most severe form of domestic violence, murder, women are much more victimized than men. I'm not sure I would consider the men in these cases to be victims of suicide after having just committed murder.	1643313948.0	huhfwn4	t3_sdjido	t1_huh4tjp	/r/MensRights/comments/sdjido/excessive_force_against_men/huhfwn4/

25e5z17l	It's this simple.  I see men who are anti-feminist ocassionally, but more rare are men who are anti-women's rights or think women should all suffer terribly.  They exist, but they are not the norm; you will not see any hashtag trending that implicates all women are violent criminals.  You will have a hard time finding men who think violence against women shouldn't be punished severely.  However, feminists take it upon themselves to deny parity to men whenever possible.  The draft is a feminist issue, but only because we have to keep women out of it -- not end it.  Men who were raped and must pay child support to their rapist is a feminist issue, because they are liable for the child they "created".  Even underage boys who were statutorily raped are found to be liable for child support, and it's a feminist issue.  It's also a feminist issue to deny men equal access to their children, e.g. in Florida by lobbying against codifying a legal premise (not a binding law) suggesting that 50/50 shared access to children should be aimed for.    Maybe not all feminists are like this, but there are enough of them to make a difference.  There are enough of them that this behavior essentially defines the movement when it comes to issues of expanding men's rights at the expense women's privilege.  You can't "both sides" this one.  It's true that advancing men's and women's interests don't have to come at each other's expense, but it's not MRAs who need to be made to understand this.  Cassie Jaye, who created The Red Pill documentary, even has [a TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY) about it, and it's why she doesn't self-identify as feminist anymore.	1643314160.0	huhgh5h	t3_sd61uj	t1_huaz3zz	/r/MensRights/comments/sd61uj/the_way_to_raise_mens_right_and_awareness_is_not/huhgh5h/

ix7ont9n	Thats actually really interesting, I didnt realise there was that big of a difference between cultures here. It is definitely VERY normal in the UK and ireland to hear husbands give off about their wives like that. Wives also do similar but more like complaints about chores or their husband being lazy. More so older generations than younger ones, and depending on the area too. When i think about it, no one says anything to them about it either. Its like the ‘humour’ here. How are students generally treated in schools/unis in America? Here it is very common for teachers to be a bit mad and can be really disrespectful. I remember a technology teacher i had in secondary school who clearly favoured the boys in the class and i despised him for being so condescending and did treat me like i was an idiot. It confused me too since i and alot of the other girls always were able to get high grades in his class	1643314552.0	huhhizh	t3_sdfnc1	t1_huhep85	/r/MensRights/comments/sdfnc1/not_supporting_feminism_does_not_make_me_a_sexist/huhhizh/

I thought it was a provocative account to wind up people so they could then feel angry and post comments which could be taken out of context later.  I agree this site can become an echo chamber (what can't tbh) and yes sometimes people need that. If you're ever bored then you'll see I've quoted that paper already on this sub, that infographic just let's down the remainder of the paper and makes childish errors in presentation.  So my apologies, I thought you were doing a provocation account to trap people, sorry about that.  I honestly do have an arts degree and yes I do think it was easy buts that's just me tbh. Only issue with academics is that ivory tower syndrome they can develop, and an inability to distinguish theory and practical application. As well as a BA Hons I've had relationships (and ex's) with academics for many years, so I've hung out with a lot.  No issue with them, just think they could do with spending time not in academia at times, it can become an echo chamber.  Again my apologies for thinking your account was there to just provoke and make people express opinions they would have only done out of frustration.	1643315815.0	huhky9q	t3_sdmkr5	t1_huhj0qh	/r/MensRights/comments/sdmkr5/looking_back_at_the_start_of_metoo/huhky9q/

5rtjacss	I think it's his right to choose not engage in personal conversations and topics with whomever he wants based on his comfort level. Think if the tables were turned. It would not be construed as discriminatory if one or more men tried to corner a woman in personal conversation at work and she felt uncomfortable or simply didn't want to disclose personal information to these men, so instead she maintained her boundaries, gave a short professional answer (courteous/respectfully) and excused herself. In fact SHE might've been the victim of harassment if she felt uncomfortable that her space was invaded.  Discrimination? No. Double standard.	1643316190.0	huhlz1w	t3_sdmkr5	t1_huh5rj1	/r/MensRights/comments/sdmkr5/looking_back_at_the_start_of_metoo/huhlz1w/

j2d0c0x3	Because men condescend to women more than women condescend to men, and it's because men have been socialized as boys to believe that they are smarter than women for a long time, and though we're seeing some big changes in socialization now, men talking down to women is still an issue. I find it especially hard to watch in intimate relationships. For you to suggest that I cannot gender the term condescension when my experience of condescension has been gendered by men talking down to me so incredibly frustratingly often, including on this sub. I use the term mansplaining because it differentiates between the condescension I experience occasionally from women, but almost constantly from men. With that big of a disparity, I think the experience is deserving of its own name.	1643318163.0	huhrao7	t3_sd90ty	t1_huhn7bz	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huhrao7/

c6tufhax	Yes, that was probably the biggest cultural difference I noticed about the British and Americans. I first became aware of it during a discussion on the UK forum concerning plans the American government had to allow women in combat roles. This led to all sorts of demeaning comments from the Brits on that forum, implying that women were too inept to be trusted with a loaded gun, etc. One responded that female pilots would probably crash their planes because they'd be too busy using their rearview mirrors when applying makeup. Jokes like these would be something I'd expect to hear from men of my parent's generation, but certainly not from mine.   In American universities, you do get the occasional condescending professor, but it's a rarity. Professor Howes, the Englishman I mentioned earlier, was like that. He was easily the most arrogant and obnoxious teacher I've ever had. I assumed at the time that his behavior may have been due to the fact that he was a notorious alcoholic. I absolutely detested him, and wrote a long and scathing report about him on my teacher evaluation form. Later it emerged that he'd been having an affair with one of his female students (perhaps more than one), which only confirmed in my mind what a terrible person he was. I was very happy to hear about his death not long after I graduated.    Aside from him, the only 'mad' professor I remember was a young woman who taught in a different department, but would frequently be seen walking through our studio area wearing a skin-tight catsuit and very high heels, like prostitutes wear. Needless to say, she attracted a lot of attention from the male students, which may have been her aim.	1643318854.0	huht6jw	t3_sdfnc1	t1_huhhizh	/r/MensRights/comments/sdfnc1/not_supporting_feminism_does_not_make_me_a_sexist/huht6jw/

4b5zd12y	I think you have a good point here. I am 100% fine with anyone fighting any sort of violence against any sort of group of people (unless the obvious: we are stopping a genocidal dictator, etc). I wish violence against women wasn't the sole narrative behind it though... Especially when it's pretty equal, and again, that doesn't matter. We should still fight for everyone.  My post isn't pointing out the hypocrisy that women were saying they have it worse, when in reality men do (I think this is a terrible mindset). My post was pointing out the hypocrisy of her targeting men "making it a competition" in the comments, even though the video posted made it a competition in the first place.  I think the original person who commented(that we are now replying to) took what I was saying the wrong way.(I could be wrong, I don't know everyone's intentions, thoughts, or feelings)  I really hope you all look at the actual post I linked. I have multiple comments in there, outlining my thoughts.  Because I think the basic idea she has out there is right. We shouldn't make it a competition... But THEY ARE. And are ignoring when they do it... Not just ignoring, THEY make a comment (post, etc) making it a competition, and when men point out the statistics (not making it a competition, just pointing out some fallacies in the narrative being pedaled...) they get upset and say "it's not a competition" when the pay gap, etc is all a 0 sum game, a competition....... The hypocrisy makes me want to vomit. The entire feminist ideology of a patriarchy is based off men and women being in a competition.........   Sorry if this comes off as hostile, I have no ill will against you, and don't think you should necessarily get downvoted for saying people should be able to stand up for whatever they believe in, even if I think that stance should be more inclusive (but I also know it might be hard for some women [who were assaulted by men] not to have a safe space or whatever... But, also, isn't her blaming 'men' kind of an issue? Like how society portrays men in general? Is a safe space [void of men] not hurting more than helping? You get 0 male interaction other than the constant "we must protect women from men" to the point you forget your DAD is also a man... If you have a boy, he is a male... Like... It sucks man. There are 40 million social justice teams ready to fight for any and every problem women face, and when men say, "we have these problems too" it's met with "it's worse for women" then "it's not a competition" then "youre an incel"... This isn't 100% the case... But it's the vast majority)	1643319302.0	huhuedj	t3_se5bhx	t1_huhji6g	/r/MensRights/comments/se5bhx/woman_tells_this_sub_not_to_make_things_a/huhuedj/

j2emgu4a	The military? College campuses? I was raped by a cadet on a college campus who had raped 5 other girls before me. I asked the other girls if they wanted to come forward, and none of them did. The reporting process was more traumatizing than the actual rape, but i was just happy that dude would never be in a position of power over women in any branch of the military, for he was dishonorably discharged after a thorough investigation. This is just one case, and the fact that 5 went unreported from ONE PERP just goes to show how many times these men get away with this shit. Brock Turner is a perfect example of men getting away with raping women in the western world. There were two witnesses that had to pull him off of the girl he was raping.  You didn’t originally ask for an institutional power that allows men to rape women, you asked for “ one institutional discrimination women have today” I offered you several, and yet your post is the one with upvotes.

j2emgu4a	Lol sure. So as a woman that was pursuing a STEM degree, most lab groups I was in were all men. I was in a degree that was 18% female, so this was usually this case. My male classmates couldn’t hold comfortable eye contact with me, would double check all of my math, (but not double checking the other guys’) and asking me out on dates and making the whole thing weird. (I don’t care if you call that female privilege, I am jealous of men who can be friends with men without those men wanting to immediately fuck then).  The schools are not literally turning women away from these programs, but the students, TAs, and professors create a very misogynistic environment that I could not thrive in. I even had a class with a rapist of mine and was forced to drop the class, even though he had been disciplined by the school for the incident. Before college, I was a straight-A student with high academic ambitions. The level of discomfort that so many of my peers had with my very presence just for being a woman was basically screaming “get out of here woman”	1643321350.0	huhzuiv	t3_sd90ty	t1_huhnlf2	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huhzuiv/

Typically, all the men (students and faculty) would wear jackets and ties to class, so you can imagine what a shock it was to see this professor prancing around campus in a leopard print cat suit! Why the university administration would tolerate it is beyond me.   I think the reason students are treated better here is twofold. First, it costs a lot more to obtain a college education in the US than in the UK, so we're not going to put up with being treated badly by our professors. Second, there's far less tolerance in the US for class distinctions. It does of course exist to some degree, but nothing like it is in the UK.	1643321871.0	hui17g7	t3_sdfnc1	t1_huhvz28	/r/MensRights/comments/sdfnc1/not_supporting_feminism_does_not_make_me_a_sexist/hui17g7/

Who maintains the infrastructural plumbing, electricity, etc. in our communities? Who wrote the greatest philosophical treatises? And made mathematical discoveries? Women could've done these things but they didn't. They preferred to garden, sew, knit, gossip, etc. They're simply weaker and less driven than men. Now feminism has convinced us that this was because women were oppressed. If only we blow up the patriarchy, they said, women could accomplish all the things men accomplish. But look: women have been liberated. And they still prefer to gossip and paint their nails and go shopping and take pictures for their social media.

j2d0c0x3	Your last bit about how career choices affect the disparity is mostly what I care about in the gender pay gap conversation.   "In general, women are overrepresented in degree subjects with low financial returns (Figure 1). There are some exceptions – for example, medicine and law both have average or slightly above average shares of female students and very high returns."  I think it's a fair argument that many men are overrepresented in higher paying degree subjects (with exceptions) because they are usually socialized as boys to have a greater interest in those careers, and often get a headstart with toys tailored towards learning helpful career skills.   For example, when I worked in child care, there would be boys at the lego and other building stations every day, and there would rarely be girls. This wasn't because they were better at building, but because by the age of 3, they had already been socialized to prefer blocks, and the girls to prefer other toys, and they had already been socialized to play in gendered groups that deepended the divide. These boys' hours of playtime with building materials improved their spatial reasoning, and that headstart in spatial reasoning can help men get into those high paying careers.	1643322350.0	hui2gnb	t3_sd90ty	t1_hugpehh	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/hui2gnb/

67mofgzp	>By this point, you are already talking about a patriarchal social structure that was oppressing women.  I am talking about a patriarchical society, yes. And if you wish to use the word "oppression", fair enogh. Butvif it was oppression, it was class related oppression and not sex related oppression. The vast majority of men and women in this cotext were both oppressed. If anything a fair woman always had a chance to escape poverty by marrying up. A man born in poverty died in poverty if not for his own wits.  >My point is that before all these systems like landownership and militaries were created, I believe that there was an opportunity, and still is, for men to view the contributions that women make as equal, and to then afford us equal rights.  We do not disaggree here. The ideal state we should aim to achieve is equal rights and opportunities to everyone. The question is how. If you say, the main issue is sexism and oppression, you are wrong in a sense that you didn't dig deep enough. Sexism and oppression are reactions to environmental challenges. There's a reason why nordic countries are traditionally more egalitarian, these are old cultures, the countries are small, they never allowed migration to the same extent as others, they were always ritch in natural resources and they invaded other countries while never really been invaded. Their history is a constant relative prosperity never threatened by outside forces. This can be said about many hunter-gatherer societies. And yet, what you will find is that the sexes are more likely to converge towards "traditional" gender roles. This is what one might call the "Nordic Paradox".  >What I would point out in response is that as soon as those rights and privileges started developing, they started going disproprionately to men, and that imbalance persists today.  Please specify.    >I hope that my willingness to acknowledge that I'm wrong in this point will help you not to make assumptions in the future that you're "objectively destroying" my worldview when I have no problem admitting I can be wrong,  Just to clarify, i wasn't talking about you personally. I do appreciate that you are willing to admit that you were wrong in regards of a specific topic, this is a rare courage. There is nothing wrong with being wrong. I am wrong plenty times and i know from experience that it's not easy to admit it.

4ut296gi	For the same reason I am not OK with black/white only establishments.   Because living in a modern, civilized society means you tolerate the presence of individuals even if they are different from you, so long as they conform to the society's moral and legal norms. In other words, And if you don't, then society shouldn't bend over backwards to accomodate your bigotry.   Personally I don't like the idea of sexually separated locker rooms either, and I would prefer entirely private locker rooms - for example, small shower-cabin sized dressing cabins where you can change into whatever attire you want to, with a "hub" around all this that is entire unisex. But I can see how people are less likely to compromise in this regard.   For gyms though, there is no excuse. if you think female only gyms are fine, then you should have no problem with aryan only universities.	1643323089.0	hui4dkg	t3_se4lmw	t1_huhvtkf	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/hui4dkg/

You don't need to get defensive about people being angered about injustice and you don't need to start throwing semantics around. Yes, I do think that forced penetration can do actual bodily harm but I also think that it would be different if the forced penetration caused permanent sexual dysfunction and if the perpetrator actively maliciously ripped off a part of the victim's body. Which of course can happen too. But you seem to be taking umbrage to people being upset by this story which I don't understand. You're trying to create an argument with people that don't want to argue back. I am in agreement that forced penetration is very bad, that anyone that does it should be fittingly punished and that often sentences are too light for criminals in general.

j2d0c0x3	I'm taking issue with this idea you guys have that there would be an unjust uproar if the same situation happened to a woman with a man as the perpetrator, and that the man would get more time for the same crime. Cases like Brock Turner's show that, details aside, courts are still giving some men guilty of violent crimes against women a lot more leniency than they deserve. This goes against the assumption on this thread that when it comes to sex crimes, men are the victims in the courtroom.  I'll definitely acknowledge that if a case pops up in the States of a man chopping off a woman's breasts or clitoris, it might get more coverage. I'm just not sure as you all are that he would also get more time, since men are still being shown leniency in clear cut cases of violent sex crimes, like Brock Turner's.  As for the sex offender list, I agree that she should be listed as one. I've heard that sex offender lists can often discriminate against men by charging them as sex offenders for public urination. While I don't love men urinating in public, I don't see it as more than something to be fined, at most, and definitely not indicative of sexual offender status unless the guy is peeing like a creep right next to me or something. What do you think about that?	1643323900.0	hui6gew	t3_sckpih	t1_hui4mtl	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/hui6gew/

It's ridiculous statements like this implying that all women are suffering from X-issue that makes me not be able to take feminism seriously.   Like some nuance please? Can we just acknowledge that there are definitely privileged 1st class citizens that are women in this world?

I also agree that forced penetration leaving permanent sexual dysfunction or disfigurement is different.

You ask what it is about this post that upsets me, but I just don't know why you think I'm upset. I don't think the language I'm using is giving that impression.

My "therapy" was horrible, I am very anxious with strangers and such. I struggled to output my feelings to the therapist, and rather than addressing it, he begins to tell me theres nothing wrong with me. I felt violated, the therapist did not establish any empathy, and the therapists all seemed cold towards me. Hell, one time, I told them, I dont wanna die, but I also dont wanna continue living on.

a1zwaoqm	I think your last point is especially observant and true. And I have no doubt that there are cases in general where people are let off too lightly for crimes they obviously committed, this Brock Turner included if he was definitely guilty (not saying he wasn't, I haven't fully read the case but I'm working on the basis the guilty verdict was correct which makes the sentence all the more inappropriate).   I do however think that there would be a far heftier sentence if a man did the equivalent of this story to a woman. Even if it's just because of the coverage it would get. People are usually made an example of more if the publicity is there. Maybe we could look for a similar case of we really wanted to....  It comes across as trying to defend this woman's actions by bringing up alternative stories as a point of argument. If you were to ask anyone about that Brock Turner case I expect that most people would be in agreement that it also is wrong. But they can coexist as two wrongs as I've said before. The irony is that if all the people that were angry about men's rights and all the people that were angry about women's rights decided to take on board each others' 'gripes' (to put it mildly) without putting them down or trying to trump them with other stories then the world would actually start to be a better place rather than slowly becoming a worse place where we are getting more and more alienated with each other. We don't need to belittle each others'plights to achieve our own goals. In fact it's imperative we don't.   I do believe that men have a harder time in court, but I also believe that women have a harder time in other areas of life. I really think it's odd to assume one sex has it significantly better than the other or easier than the other. There is always a counterbalance so the things that men have it bad in mean women have it better and things that women have it bad in mean men have it better. Same with old and young, black and white, rich and poor, short and tall etc etc. It's just that some of these issues are more spoken about and therefore more recognised. Or they're more obvious and therefore easier to address. It's also crazy to assume that gender is the biggest factor in what makes our lives difficult. Just because you're a man or a woman doesn't mean you will have a great/bad life. There are enumerable examples of things that would have a far greater effect on the quality of your life than that.  A lot of the disbelief from the men's movement comes from the incredulity of everyone telling them how great they've got it when in fact men are deeply struggling every day in society, the same as women are. The difference being that it's acknowledged for women but actively snubbed for men.   If you were to write a post and listed the hardships that women faced and openly asked men to add the hardships they face (without contradiction), I think it would be an eye opener for all.  The main difference SEEMS to be that men are fighting for the rights of men and women to be acknowledged. Women are fighting for the rights of women and discrediting the same pleas men have. That's how it is currently perceived anyway.	1643325695.0	huiaxm0	t3_sckpih	t1_hui6gew	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huiaxm0/
j2emgu4a	You’re absolutely right, and those women would be able to take care of themselves if they had not been systemically kept from attaining wealth by not being allowed bank accounts and stuff.  Again, this leads back to the systemic issue of women being kept from the work force, military (because you can make good money from a career in the military) etc. If a woman is in a marriage and is told to stay home and watch the kids, how else is she supposed to take care of herself without alimony?  And just to be a naggy lady, I’ll point out that there are men who receive alimony because the women were the breadwinners during the marriage.	1643325715.0	huiazg7	t3_sd90ty	t1_hui91d4	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huiazg7/

Reading what you have written here makes me think you don't understand what patriarchy is or what feminists mean when they say it.  Sexist holdovers are sexist beliefs and strict gender roles.  There are still plenty of people around who are very sexist in this world.  It's not like they all died as soon as feminism changed society.  We still have more men in leadership positions than women.  That's probably the kind of thing feminists are talking about.  You didn't answer my question about how feminists are rewriting history.  Actually, feminism does not preach that only women can be victims of sexism.  Lots of feminists care about men's rights and consider fighting traditional gender roles as being something that will also help men.	1643326118.0	huibytu	t3_sdmkr5	t1_hui8obw	/r/MensRights/comments/sdmkr5/looking_back_at_the_start_of_metoo/huibytu/

FYI the vast majority of the 3.95 billion women (half the worlds population as of 2021) have the exact same abilities as I do, and a large percentage of those women probably use their abilities better than I use all of my abilities.

a1zwaoqm	I'll leave it after this reply as the conversation isn't as productive as I'd have liked. I'll give you an example of how it seems and why you came across as passive aggressive, maybe you'll agree with me maybe not.  If the post were about the Brock Turner case on a women's rights group and a man came in and said "3 months and a lifetime on the sex offenders list isn't a slap on the wrist". And in a response to a post about how a woman was raped and the perpetrator got off lightly someone replies with a story about a man who got attacked to try and nullify the original point. It comes across as if you are actively trying to discredit everyone's points. Maybe that's not your intention but it's definitely how it comes across. I think you would get a lot further in your conversations with people if you changed the way you approached them. And it comes across as gaslighting to call people controlling when they disagree with your sentiments. No offence intended, I'm just saying how it comes across from our point of view.  I apologise for doing so but I looked at your post history and it does seem like you like poking dogs in cages with sticks a bit. Sorry if that's a harsh analogy but it seemed too appropriate to not say. The impression is given that you come on these forums with your mind already made up. If I'm wrong about that then I apologise. But all I can say is that I wish for all women, all men, you and I to have equally free, happy and enjoyable lives safe from the hardships and injustices that plague either our society, our minds and our imaginations.   I honestly wish you all the very best and thank you for your interaction :)	1643327043.0	huie7mz	t3_sckpih	t1_hui7ghi	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huie7mz/

3ajbtxmq	Of course not.   But is that a regular occurrence? Do large numbers of men interrupt their workout to creepily film some girl they don't know? I find that hard to believe.   In response to the person who said if I asked women how they feel, well, no. I don't ask strangers, men or women, about their feelings. But I imagine for women it largely depends on the man who's approaching them.   I'm tall, fit, and reasonably successful, so most women don't squirm away or wilt in fear when I talk to them. They often initiate conversations with me, at the gym, on Tinder, or even in the subway. I have on more than one occasion seen women photograph or film me.   A shorter, fatter, uglier guy in old clothes? They don't acknowledge he exists, and if he talks to them politely they'll roll their eyes and walk away in disgust. Even if he's the nicest guy in the world.   We do notice these things. Your feelings are rarely some sort of inscrutable mystery.	1643327275.0	huierts	t3_sdarcs	t1_hudshww	/r/MensRights/comments/sdarcs/connecticut_supreme_court_womenonly_gym_areas/huierts/

Escape is you only option in a knife fight, unless you have a gun and are 50+ feet away. 2.  If a woman was stabbing me most people will assume I did something to provoke that attack and she was defending herself.  They will be coming to her defense not mine. 3. So even if I survive the knife attack, and some how survive the cops or a crowd of bystanders.

a1zwaoqm	A quick addition to this as everyone has already mentioned most things, but by cutting the frenular delta, the most sensitive part of the foreskin/penis, you are actually severing the psychosexual nerve. The nerve that sends the sexual satisfaction impulses to your brain. So not only will it feel significantly less and different you will lose the ability to be properly sexually satisfied, even after orgasm,  which can lead to severe depression and frustration. I'm convinced it can lead to antisocial personalities.	1643327649.0	huifobu	t3_sdqgzw	t3_sdqgzw	/r/MensRights/comments/sdqgzw/considering_circumcision_someone_help_m_15/huifobu/

And frankly, every time my girlfriend, sister, or mother tell me a man has looked at them in a nasty, strange, or unsettling way, I think of the cases I have been identified as a creep, a loser, a horrible subhuman creature by women just for existing and not being attractive; and i realize women have a tendency to exaggerate their own importance, and to see men as treatening for no goddamn reason. And I don't want anyone banned from any establishment for the paranoia of a few karens.

Breaks into exes house and goes through her stuff. Films what's meant to be a sex tape on her bed with the girl. Waits for ex to get home, then watches her shower. Sets up sex tape on the tv so she sees it when she walks into het bedroom. This video's been up for 12 years, and Timberlake is not cancelled.

He was 19 and had to move in with his parents because his paycheck was less then $10 (sometimes even completely negative) every week. I wouldn't have thought it was legal to do that, but seen it in person. It took 2 years before he had the back pay caught up and could actually make money. He was forced to make $300+ a week or face jail time.  He was 15 when she got pregnant and didn't tell him, just left. She came back 3 years later and took him to court. She claimed he refused contact and paying her child support. he couldn't prove her wrong since he didn't even know about the child. He wasn't even given rights to see his child at first, took almost a year till he meet her.

The idea that marriage is a modern form of slavery is very heteronormative and ignores the fact that for some of us (gay folks in particular), marriage can be a lifeline. Oops, there I go again speaking of exceptions again rather than generalities. Sure, for cishet men, marriage is little more than the last legal form of slavery. But again…it might not have been that way if it wasn’t designed by men to be that way…  I know your goal is probably to get me to bow down to your beliefs, but I will continue to argue with you on points I disagree with.	1643328999.0	huiivku	t3_sd90ty	t1_huih9k4	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huiivku/

j2d0c0x3	I don't believe that men have a harder time in court when it comes to a lot of rape cases, and that was my reason for bringing up Brock Turner's case, to disagree with a view expressed by some like yourself that men are being discriminated against in court and given hefty prison time for violent sex offenses, when there are plenty of examples of men getting off easy for sex crimes. I did not bring up the case as a defense of this woman, and I don't have any defense for her.  I agree that we shouldn't belittle each other, so I try not to, and without going into all the details of my position on feminist issues, I'm not assuming that all men have it better than all women. Some men have it much worse than some women. But I've had a very clearly defined experience of misogyny throughout my life, and it has made women's rights important to me personally. Men's rights are important to me, too, because of course we all need our human rights. Most men I meet are not even remotely aware that they're treating me in a patronizing manner, even in the wake of the feminist movement. For me, misogyny is all about the attitude, the way that men talk to me. It is unique. While women also condescend, they don't do it to me daily, as a rule. Almost every man I meet talks down to me, and it's why I like the word mansplaining. Because even though women patronize me sometimes, many, many men do it to me constantly, and have as long as I can remember. This patronizing, combined with a certain air of superiority that often leads men to make decisions like spreading their legs into my space on the train, or freezing out the women in the office with the AC so that the men can be comfortably cool, or taking extra food from the communal plate, these are the experiences of sexism that matter to me. And while the patronizing and superiority hurt, it also hurts to realize that a lot of men just deny outright that these things are happening.  And absolutely, men experience sexism from women, too. I would counter that we take more from you, that it works its way into the smallest of things, like a man being handed the check on a date, whether he makes more money than her or not, reminding her that she often isn't considered as valuable in the workforce on sight, and that while these small things don't kill, they do chip away at our mental health more than you're perhaps willing to acknowledge without insisting men suffer an equal experience of sexism. A little acknowledgement would go a long way, though. I've called out a ton of patronizing behavior on this sub, for example, especially around the concept of logic, and I've yet to see a guy own up to it.  When it comes to hardship in life, I agree that it's a sweeping generalization to say men have it better than women. Indeed, you listed some points of intersectionality, like race, height and wealth. I'm seeing a lot of MRAs make similar sweeping generalizations about women, though, and that's not okay either. For example, that all women are marrying men for economic security.  It's a generalization to say that men are fighting for men's and women's rights. I see a lot of men on this forum saying in as many words that they don't think much of women at all. And when they say they're doing it because it's what the women are doing on their subs, I don't see that as justification.	1643329032.0	huiiyhv	t3_sckpih	t1_huiaxm0	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huiiyhv/

This is a problem that affects more than just heterosexual relationships.

Well maybe it's time women stepped up and started doing what men have to do to get these leadership positions. After all you dont want women to become leaders simply because they're female do you?  It's vital to keep in mind what it would actually mean for women if we were to close the real gender and pay gap. For many women, it would mean giving up their chosen career, and putting in a 50 - 60 hour work week and not being able to spend time with their family. It would mean trading in jobs like housekeeping for night shifts doing road repairs; It would mean giving up the joys of seeing your child's first years of life. All things that men do only to be accused of creating a 'gender and pay gap'.  I've never seen feminists/women pushing for gender equality in male dominated fields that involves dangerous work, exposure to the elements, extend time away from home and family, or hard physical labour, usually for minimum wage...  I wonder why that is?   Sitting there complaining about perceived sexism and women not being promoted because they're women and not actively doing something about it just smacks of sour grapes.  >You didn't answer my question about how feminists are rewriting history.  Yeah, I did. Here it is again: The patriarchy: **No theory is more fundamental to academic feminism than the theory of the patriarchy.  Quite simply - and perhaps too simply - patriarchy is the feminist theory that there is a regime of institutionalised male control over women.**  >Actually, feminism does not preach that only women can be victims of sexism.    🤣🤣🤣  - **Many scholars and feminists argue that reverse sexism isn’t real.**   What is referred to in its name is a dictionary definition of sexism- ‘prejudice, stereotyping or discrimination on the basis of sex.’ This definition implies that men and women can equally practise sexism against the other.  https://www.woospire.com/is-reverse-sexism-real/  - **What Are Some Common Forms of Sexism That Men Face?**  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-are-some-common-form_b_4473062  > Lots of feminists care about men's rights and consider fighting traditional gender roles as being something that will also help men.

The United States women's national soccer team does its practice against high school *under-14* boys soccer teams. And frequently loses.  The bell curves for strength capacity in human males and females have very little overlap. Women have to work extremely hard to achieve upper body strength levels which are normal for men who don't work out at all. Sure, it happens, but bringing it up means you've missed the point.   If you judge humans by their physical strength, women are almost always inferior. If you judge humans by their capacity to give birth, men are always inferior.	1643329753.0	huikp80	t3_se4lmw	t1_huh10ti	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/huikp80/

I went inside a large store that sold everything from fridges to washing machines, cookers etc. I was still single then.  I started asking the salesperson about the washing machines and at one point she stopped and told me 'Don't you think it would be better if you came with her?" She assumed that because I was a man (1) I knew nothing about household appliances (2) That because I was buying household appliances I had to have a female partner.	1643330067.0	huilg4z	t3_sdb8ee	t3_sdb8ee	/r/MensRights/comments/sdb8ee/another_antimale_commercial_vroom_where_a_woman/huilg4z/

j2d0c0x3	One of my posts contains an admission that I misread data about the hours worked by men and women. This would be an axample of how my mind is not already made up, and it's pretty insulting to me that you're telling me it is. At least you apologized in advance for being wrong.  And if you looked at my posts, I'm surprised you think I'm "poking dogs in cages with a stick," when the only taunting behavior I've seen was directed towards me. I've been pretty respectful in sharing my views.  As I've said, I made the Brock Turner analogy in response to this post: "I can't even imagine the societal uproar if a man that mutilated a woman got just two and a half years sentenced. Just imagining that should let you know exactly how society feels about men." While I understand he didn't mutilate her, he did commit a really violent sex crime and get off with three months prison, and I think it does further the conversation to point out that this lenient sentence, and others like it, also "lets you know exactly how society feels about men," that sometimes they can commit violent rape and get away with it. I think it was also fair to point out that if a man can violently rape an unconscious woman and get three months, he could certainly mutilate a woman and get just two and a half years sentenced without this supposed uproar.  And it isn't gaslighting to point out a strong trend I've seen on this sub of men trying to explain to me why my views don't matter because I'm not expressing them in just the right way you like. I'm being respectful, and that's what matters. You can accuse me of being argumentative, passive aggressive, and so on, but it doesn't make it so. You don't need to point out that I'm "getting defensive" or "taking umbrage." That's an attack on my character, not my points.  As for your last wish, I second it and wish you the best, as well.	1643330255.0	huilwfv	t3_sckpih	t1_huie7mz	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huilwfv/

1hh8d8by	I don't think I fully get you. The original post was about how women feel when they're alone. Tbh it's a worry that you're going to get raped, that's what that feeling is. Maybe killed if you fight back. A lot of it is being aware that a larger stronger person might be behind you. That's the original post.    Then this post was about how maybe commenting to that post in an insensitive manner maybe isn't the best way for us all to be aware of each others struggles. I don't know the best way. I want to hear it though, I know men suffer too. In terms of sexual assault, I've no idea. Actually, I do, I ask my male friends. But in this case, make another video showing how scary it is all the time when you're.. somewhere as a man. I don't even know when men feel that fear or what it might be like. I want to know though, so want to see that and recognise the signs, I know men experience violence.   So.. I don't know what you wanted OP to say? I didn't read the comments ( there's 17K), but I'd like to stop seeing women's and men's rights in competition with each other too.. The original OP was trying to highlight how women felt and didn't want the conversation derailed.    Here's an example, always helpful. I'd imagine if you posted about how you had FA parental leave, and how shit that was. You'd find it insensitive if a load of women started saying well, we gave birth and ours isn't long enough, we only get xyz aswel. What about us. Yes, they would have a point and maybe they should get more, but if you are facing the greater injustice and have made something to highlight that it's not right to dilute that perspective. Right now in that forum is not the time to address it. Not that it can't be spoken about, but I should make my own video about maternity leave instead of highjacking the narrative you have created about the injustice you face. I could go make a post supporting your right to ask for equal paternity leave and together we could have the law changed to get what we both want.

This comes form a man in his mid 40s with a 6 year old son. My wife is 36. Had we waited a while longer - there would probably have been difficulties in conceiving.  But people need to understand that we do not have the right to have children. I may come across as insensitive, but in my country the state is now paying for all fertility treatments including in vitro fertilisation. Couples go through a lot when they sign up for in vitro attempts at conceiving. The costs (born by other tax payers) are also prohibitive.   There are thousands if not millions of little children without parents. Had my wife and I had problems conceiving we would have gone for adoption, and though we have not discussed it, I see nothing wrong in adopting our next child.	1643330965.0	huinlqi	t3_sdppb4	t3_sdppb4	/r/MensRights/comments/sdppb4/parents_who_retrieved_soldier_sons_sperm_after_he/huinlqi/

2i7hmnu6	Wow, you really write long comments.  I'll try to reply everything.   "Where, when, and how? I'll wait."  In the very first comment I replied to.  That's what it was about.  Do you really need to be this defensive?  You very clearly don't understand what the term patriarchy means if you're defining it as hate speech against men.  Try reading a book for a change.  "You REALLY need to list what you're talking about? What sexist holdovers? What sexist beliefs? what strict gender rolls?You REALLY need to list what you're talking about? What sexist holdovers? What sexist beliefs? what strict gender rolls?"  You really need me to explain what sexist gender roles are?  You don't know this?  Ok, traditionally women are in a caregiver role while a man is expected to provide.  In caveman days, men would hunt for food and women would look after offspring.  In more modern times, men worked and provided money while women took care of children.  It was viewed that a woman's place was in the home and men had careers.  Men are stereotyped as being tough and unemotional. Do I need to go in to more detail here or are you getting the idea?  "Sure there are, and it's not only males. There are plenty of females who are sexist in this world as well. But that does not mean every man or every woman is sexist."  Well, no duh.  "Who says they did all die?"  I sure didn't.  "Well maybe it's time women stepped up and started doing what men have to do to get these leadership positions. After all you dont want women to become leaders simply because they're female do you?  It's vital to keep in mind what it would actually mean for women if we were to close the real gender and pay gap. For many women, it would mean giving up their chosen career, and putting in a 50 - 60 hour work week and not being able to spend time with their family. It would mean trading in jobs like housekeeping for night shifts doing road repairs; It would mean giving up the joys of seeing your child's first years of life. All things that men do only to be accused of creating a 'gender and pay gap'.  I've never seen feminists/women pushing for gender equality in male dominated fields that involves dangerous work, exposure to the elements, extend time away from home and family, or hard physical labour, usually for minimum wage... I wonder why that is?  Sitting there complaining about perceived sexism and women not being promoted because they're women and not actively doing something about it just smacks of sour grapes."  I think women are trying to do that and have dramatically increased their numbers in leadership.  " Yeah, I did. Here it is again: The patriarchy: No theory is more fundamental to academic feminism than the theory of the patriarchy. Quite simply - and perhaps too simply - patriarchy is the feminist theory that there is a regime of institutionalised male control over women."  Ok, that doesn't actually answer my question.  You are just repeating yourself.  I was hoping for actual specifics in how they're trying to rewrite history.  You just keep saying the word patriarchy which is extremely general.  Are you pretending like patriarchy never existed or what exactly?  Ok, now you're just cherry picking the most insane feminist quotes and trying to apply them to everyone involved in women's movements.  There are different types of feminism and different types of feminists.  Feminism refers to a very broad range of academic study that encompasses a lot of different theories.	1643331539.0	huiozeh	t3_sdmkr5	t1_huiklki	/r/MensRights/comments/sdmkr5/looking_back_at_the_start_of_metoo/huiozeh/

71v4lvfl	That is something I've noticed but never really thought about. Growing up with a bunch of sister's there were tons of times they would claim a guy was staring at them and making them uncomfortable. When in reality the guy just glanced at them as he walked by. There are many other examples of stories they told each other to make guys out to be horrible, which the reality was totally different. It makes it hard to see actually stories and believe them.  I had a job once where sexual harassment was considered smiling at a women. We weren't allowed to whistle because that could be as well. We were even told not to say hello to women who didn't say it first. That whole place was oppressive as hell. Keeping your head down and not making eye contact with any women just to be safe is not a good work environment. It was a government building too, so that's probably a basic standard at most of them.	1643331710.0	huipe6h	t3_se4lmw	t1_huig2gu	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/huipe6h/

There’s thousands more but I think you get the point.  Women have, and continue to help create and improve life changing inventions.   Men made the government/legal system which only benefited white men. No one else. Now women wanna complain about the system ? Seems to me y’all are just mad that other people have rights now lmao  The system is still set up to benefit men, especially white men, the most.

If the trans community wants us to see transmen as men then they should have the same responsibilities that all other men have.

46a6opwn	As I read the article, it seems to imply that Ms. Spayne and Officer G were in a relationship for a few months until she was dumped by Officer G, but he then sent her an explicit video and she complained, but she lied about the relationship.  It's not clear the timing, but isn't sending an unsolicited explicit video considered a basis for harassment and so Ms. Spayne might have a case if they were no longer together when she received the unsolicited video? In that situation, why would lying about a prior relationship have any relevance to the case itself? Lying itself is obviously a serious offense in the police service, but it seems to overshadow the case itself and normally sexual history is not pertinent to current misconduct.  I'm just curious about the standing of harassment charges when explicit videos are provided unsolicited and whether a case depends on the relationship status between the participants at the time, considering relationship status doesn't preclude harassment, rape, assault, abuse, etc normally.  Not that I believe an unsolicited explicit video is harassment, regardless of relationship status, since future receipt can be blocked: it's merely an inconvenience like being asked for consent for sex the first time by someone new we are not interested in; we understand that biology motivates people to pursue sex, so its an expected part of life. It's only harassment if it persists after a rejection. However, the trending view of women seems to be that even the first approach is harassment if they are not interested, or that men in general are guilty of harassment because they keep pursuing sex collectively when a woman is not interested (ie one man after another).	1643333019.0	huish1g	t3_sdy5t7	t3_sdy5t7	/r/MensRights/comments/sdy5t7/a_female_police_officer_has_been_dismissed_after/huish1g/
71v4lvfl	My wife and I just had a conversation about this. She didn't see why it's a problem, even though she would never go to one since the women are far worse at criticising other women around. When we talked about men only places, I asked which men only places? We talked about our experience with girl scouts, and how they changed boy scouts to cub scout. How girl scouts have funding to help girls join it, and the cub scout don't. How cubs scouts have equal access, but the girl scouts still were only girls (yes I know there have been cases, but not 1 in our entire county). How any mens only place gets taken over by feminist demanding entry and changing it to equal access, while fighting to keep their area separate. The double standard that it's perfectly fine for women to have there space, but men are not.  I'm personally fine with women only gyms, but I'll fight it because the opposite isn't allowed.   The narrative that women are harassed being the reason is just nonsense. If that's a problem at your gym find one that isn't. Make it an issue at that gym and get the guys who do it banned. The truth is every decent looking person at gyms have dealt with harassment from women and men, and it's the responsibility of the gym to ban people like that. If that can't be done separate the gym into sexes. Banning an entire sex without having the equivalent available is sexist, and shouldn't be tolerated.  Men have a tendency to just ignore and shrug off things that bother them. If we spoke up more about them and broght more attention maybe we wouldn't be looking at onesided gender issues. Everything I've heard women complain about, I've dealt with as well. Domestic abuse, violence, rape, sexual harassment, and ect. have all been done to me by women, and yet I've never really spoken about them. The truth is even when I've brought it up and tried it's ignored because men are expected to fix there own problems. This creates a view that shows only one side, when it's more a human issue, then a sex one.	1643333037.0	huisil4	t3_se4lmw	t3_se4lmw	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/huisil4/

There are more examples than the beta who receives alimony from his boss ass ex.  Sir, you are continuously ignoring the several points I have been making about the generalities, because they are a part of the bigger picture. Just because certain things don’t fit into your narrow MGTOW window, TRP or whatever (honestly, I’ve been on Reddit for less than a day, and I’m quite shocked and concerned with how delusional many folks on here have been enabled to become).   I just responded to a point you made about common law unions and their institutional entrapment of men. I argued that it is not in fact the same thing as choosing to marry someone. It is a separate choice to shack up with a woman for greater than 5 years. Nothing of this child stuff you’re talking about.   I think that you have been unfair towards me and my intelligence. As I pointed out, I was an honors student for most of my life, made it halfway through my masters before finally giving up on academia, and continue to challenge myself and grow everyday. My partner and I came onto this sub to challenge ourselves and the men here. It sucks to see such crass and presumptuous things said about women and feminists on here. I have many generalizations about men due to my own experiences with them, but I like to think that every man, every person deserves a chance. I would hate to write you off simply because of your views or your sex.

If you find it impossible to point to even one institutional discrimination of women, then I think it begs the question of whether you were actually worthy of any kind of educational recognition.  That men do not have a choice to be a parent or not is a real institutional discrimination given the fact that women have three legally protected choices to decide to be a parent or not it's called abortion adoption and legal abandonment.  Forcing men into a marriage equivalent when in fact they don't want that is institutional discrimination.  Forcing men out of fatherhood because women go for full custody has been an ongoing issue and still is today. And guess what this involves institutional discrimination.  Forcing men into the equivalent of indentured servitude using creative feminist ideas like child support alimony and palimony is a huge problem and it is also part of the institutional discrimination we're talkin about.

a1zwaoqm	I know I said I would stop the conversation there but I thought it important to reply again. I have upvoted your comment as I found it very touching and refreshing. Believe it or not I have  lot of sympathy and empathy for what you have said. To get it quickly out of the way I will also say that the things you say about misogyny, and men not recognising the little things that eat away at women's lives, are mirrored by the experiences of us as men too. Not always by women either. Men are just as culpable of some of the harmful ways men are treated just as women are culpable in some of the ways women are treated badly. It's a societal issue. Honestly not said to discount your points as they are very much valid and appreciated but a few things we as men feel in every day life include general mockery and humiliation in life and in media, hearing and seeing male genital humiliation and body shaming every day, generally being told we are useless, being told we are emotionless and uncaring, being told we should man up or being told to share our emotions but being dismissed and ignored if we do because people don't know how to handle us being emotional. And things like being handed the bill, it also eats at you feeling like you're the one meant to be taking responsibility for everything financial and practical. it feels like a huge burden, not a privilege. My experiences also involve women putting their handbags in my foot space and having the heating in so high I feel like I'm dying. In the workplace I experience women saying really quite vile sexual things about men openly and laugh about how men, and their husbands and boyfriends, are useless and can't do anything right. All but one of my bosses have been women and some of them were sexist, manipulative and horrible. No one I know has personally worked in an industry run predominantly by men and the bosses were largely unpleasant and condescending regardless of gender! As for mansplaining, I believe it's just what shitty people of one gender do to the other gender. I constantly have women (and men) talk to me in patronising, condescending and superior manners. And it's hard for me to hear 'men do this and men do that' as I don't fit the stereotypical misogynistic male characteristics that are so brazenly thrust upon us so I have to defend myself as it's simply not true.  I think in many ways you hit the nail on the head. You have had a life unfortunately filled with negative male experiences and I have many negative female experiences. Your life has been filled with misogyny and mine has been filled with misandry. But I will say that I don't blame women. As I don't think women are worse than men. I think there are just bad people and unfortunately those bad people often tend to target the opposite sex. So in our own lived experiences we see the world from different perspectives.   But I promise you that my whole life I have noticed the things you mentioned and the things I've mentioned and I've been actively against them all since childhood. My home, my school and and my workplaces have all involved actively talking about and seeking equality and pointing out the things that go against this. So I do recognise the things you say as true and will add they often effect men too (from other men I mean) so I too experience it. Woman gets wolf whistled and and inappropriate comments shouted at them men get threats and horrible comments thrown at them. Some guys pulled up in a van and started hurling abuse and laughing at me down the road the other week. It's horrible! And sexism and equality doesn't have to mean women against men and vice versa. I am unfortunate to have been assaulted many times through no fault of my own. I have been hospitalised twice and had broken bones and scars. And, in my opinion, it was because I was a man. Evil, drunk men out looking for a fight and they chose me to attack. One time I thought I was going to die as they were stamping in my head. I had a broken jaw and multiple stitches in my head. I've also previously had a broken eye socket. And nobody helped. People stood by and let it happen. I don't blame them. It would have been very dangerous for them. But I feel more would have been done to protect a woman if people had seen it in the street. That IS NOT to negate the horrendous things that happen to women too but it's to tell my lived experiences and to show how I feel constant fear and no protection in society. I feel like I am more expendable. I have also, without going into details, been sexually assaulted by both a man and a woman. I have also been romantically manipulated, humiliated and broken.  I think this shows that we are more alike than anything. We are both protective of those we relate to and fighting against the evils engrained in society. We just happen to see different parts of it but they are both there.  You are right that sweeping generalisations should not be made. It is something that we all do, you and I included, and I think it stems from fear and anger. The problem is that we are allowing the evil minority to override our thoughts and it feels like they are more prevalent than they are. Obviously a man will get upset when society says that all men are misogynistic or only after sex or worse, rapists etc. Just like women will be upset when society says all women are gold diggers, or have no valid opinions or should stay at home with the kids etc. It's something that we all need to learn to stop doing. I believe it is probably used as a cheap shot against those we perceive as wronging us when we don't know how to actually fix a problem. I like that we've ended this conversation like this. It feels productive and like we've connected.  You may not think it but my whole life equality has been a main moralistic goal for me. I have spent my whole life learning about the negative aspects of people's lives, women's included, and I have empathised with them all to the best of my ability. So it hurts when there are huge movements against men and when everywhere you look you see that men are evil and bad and that the patriarchy benefits no one but men. The vast majority of men don't actually benefit from the patriarchy. The 0.01% of men that control it do. So, considering I've spent my whole life being as decent a human being as I can and honestly treating everyone equally to the best of my ability, I am now facing a society that I honestly don't feel I can live in. It's a society that actively seems to hate me when I have done nothing but try to love it. But worse, it's a society that seems so full of hate and vitriol that I just want to hide from it. It's scary, threatening and overwhelming.   To reiterate, I very much acknowledge and empathise with the comments you made about the struggles you, and women, have faced in society. And I have presented just a few of the more obvious but equally insidious ones that I, and men, have had to face.   I guess it's easy to feel jaded when you spend your whole life recognising and personally addressing the issues women have faced and then have it thrown in your face when you too ask for change and help. It feels like people are wanting to help and change the world to make a better place for women but that it's not reciprocated and that's hard to deal with. I honestly feel like the world hates me for being a man and I have done nothing but be a nice, kind, caring empathetic person to everyone I meet.   But that's because people don't see those everyday decent men in society, they see the evil men. Just like people are often too distracted by the evil women to see the decent women who actually want an equal world whatever that may mean.   We are in a situation where I think people are too hurt by society and their life experiences to take a step back and actively listen and accept that one doesn't have it worse than the other. And most importantly that it really isn't gender that defines you! I still believe that there are fundamentally no differences between men and women and I personally will always treat them the same in every way of life. But it's increasingly seeming people want to create a bigger divide between genders and it breaks my heart and scares me more than anything.   I think the defensive manner you find on any 'rights' site is a direct result of attack and because evil men are under fire in society at the moment, innocent and kind and caring men are getting caught up along the way resulting in barrier building, self defence and sweeping generalisations. And then the pendulum swings and we've got both sides of the spectrum defending themselves when in theory they're actually wanting the same thing. Of course you're going to get actual women haters and actual man haters but..... screw them! They are what's causing the evil, hate and dissonance in the world and unfortunately they are winning. We need to nullify them and start focusing on the nice people who are looking for peace, love, harmony and equality. I suspect there are more of them than the other. The others' just have bigger mouths.  Not that you need my validation in any way but I hope that my acknowledgment and understanding of the hardships you've faced goes at least a small way to making you feel heard today.   And well done if you managed to read all that! 😆   Thanks for being open and honest. It was refreshing to read and I'm glad you wrote back.	1643333981.0	huiuqp4	t3_sckpih	t1_huiiyhv	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huiuqp4/

3nrxdp	> The Duluth model does not make these claims about men when I look it up.   I don't know where you looked, but it's right on their web-page.  Check out their wheel of power and control.  * https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PowerandControl.pdf  And their FAQ is clear enough.  * https://www.theduluthmodel.org/what-is-the-duluth-model/frequently-asked-questions/ * **Why don’t you use gender neutral language to describe domestic violence?**  * The battering of women by men continues to be a significant social problem–men commit over 85% of all criminal assaults and women are killed 3.5 times more often than men in domestic homicides. Not naming this gender disparity, and the continued underlying social, cultural and institutional structures that support it, keeps us from naming the social problem for what it is. While we do recognize there are cases of domestic violence other than male perpetrated violence against women, even in those cases the perpetrator’s sense of entitlement to control or dominate another remains the predominant cause of violence. Do women use violence as often as men in intimate relationships?  * When women use violence in an intimate relationship, the circumstances of that violence tend to differ from when men use violence. Men’s use of violence against women is learned and reinforced through many social, cultural and institutional experiences. Women’s use of violence does not have the same kind of societal support. Many women who do use violence against their male partners are being battered. Their violence is used primarily to respond to and resist the violence used against them. On the societal level, women’s violence against men has a trivial effect on men compared to the devastating effect of men’s violence against women.  * Battering in same-sex intimate relationships has many of the same characteristics of battering in heterosexual relationships, but happens within the context of the larger societal oppression of same-sex couples. Resources that describe same-sex domestic violence have been developed by specialists in that field such as The Northwest Network of Bi, Trans, Lesbian and Gay Survivors of Abuse, www.nwnetwork.org.  * If we ignore the power imbalances in relationships between men and women and power imbalances in society we miss the opportunity for real societal change. By naming the power differences, we can more clearly provide advocacy and support for victims, accountability and opportunities for change for offenders, and system and societal changes that end violence against women.  I'm tending to doubt you have a degree if you can't so simple research. But then, what does one learn in the so-called social sciences?  > As for the law, US law uses language that empowers men to report women for DV and sexual assault.  Tell that to Johnny Depp.  As for men calling the police, they are more likely to be arrested than helped. Thanx VAWA + Duluth Model.  Male DV victims have tried to get help under the VAWA, but there's no help for men there. Hell, the default assumption is that any man seeking help is an abuser trying to get access to the female victims.  Look, if you leaned nothing in college there's no hope that you'll learn anything from anywhere else. Nor does it look like there is any hope, no matter how small that you actually care what men's issues are, you apparently believe feminism, not men.	1643334541.0	huiw1yg	t3_sd90ty	t1_huh28hm	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huiw1yg/

If a woman thought you were too tall, would you consider chopping a section out of your legs to accommodate their desires at that moment?  Women's desires are also fickle and can change on a dime, so it's not rational to change yourself in an irreversible and compromising way just to please them in the moment. But because womens desires are so variable, it's likely you will find women who don't care about the presence or absence of a foreskin.  This does raise another issue of the pressure for men to change themselves to be what women want in order to get access to sex. Whilst sex is important, it's no reason to change yourself, perhaps irreversibly and with consequences to your ongoing quality of life simply to please a woman in order to obtain sex: she can change her mind at any time and you potentially have a lifetime of regret missing what you had but sacrificed for nothing, and anyway, there are other ways to sexual fulfilment that aren't held hostage to women's desires, they aren't the only option.  I think its a tragedy that society is still portraying relationships with women as the only path to a proper life.	1643335066.0	huix9o1	t3_sdqgzw	t3_sdqgzw	/r/MensRights/comments/sdqgzw/considering_circumcision_someone_help_m_15/huix9o1/

j2emgu4a	Let’s talk military because you just love talking about how honorable men are for defending their country and sacrificing themselves to keep poor fragile women safe. (The very concept of which is incredibly misogynistic and stupid. Sure, men were stronger back when spears and swords were used, but with modern weaponry, it doesn’t really matter how strong you are…a tiny woman can still kill a much larger man with ease)  The very institution of the military was sexist by not allowing women to serve (although women worked around the resurrections in WWII by being pilots and field medics). Sure, it’s getting better, but when it was announced that women were going to be allowed in combat, men lost their shit. “Oh no way some girl could carry me out of combat!” So again, from source: me, a woman who went through military training. I, as well as other women, were able to carry men with ease, when utilizing proper carry form. The arguments are stupid, and tired. MRAs love to hang onto this point like it’s some kind of magic trump card. The biological differences of men and women are real, I will not deny that. However, women can get really fucking strong by weight training. It’s society that tells women they need to stay weak. Actually, it’s men. Don’t believe me? I once spoke with a woman from my mother’s Pilates class. She was really into weight training, but her boyfriend didn’t like that her muscles were bigger than his. Even though she enjoyed having the extra muscle mass and strength, she joined Pilates to become more lean and less bulky.   There has been a steady increase of women in the armed forces, but the rates of sexual assault, rape, and murder that women face are insanely high. Look up the murder of Vanessa Guillén, there’s a reason why women fear joining the military, and it’s not just going to combat…	1643335704.0	huiyr1z	t3_sd90ty	t1_huiuuzb	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/huiyr1z/

46a6opwn	However, in this case, would society consider adopting out to the elderly who have already had their reproductive turn, when younger people are clamouring for adoptive children? There aren't enough children available for adoption even for the young.  I'm sorry those people are mourning the loss of their son, but children aren't simply products for gratification and comfort to their parents (or grandparents): their lives may have positive spinoff consequences to others, but they should be foremost being created for themselves, to experience their own sovereign lives.  Having said that, I think it is just as objectionable for people to go to extreme lengths of fertility treatments because they want a child for their own reasons as it is for those elderly parents to want a child from their dead son to ease their grief, as it is to create a child to be used as spare parts to improve the life of another child: it's all selfish instead of considering the life of the child that is being created as the reason.	1643336509.0	huj0mae	t3_sdppb4	t1_huinlqi	/r/MensRights/comments/sdppb4/parents_who_retrieved_soldier_sons_sperm_after_he/huj0mae/

Amount of hair person has, rather than whatever those sick fucks are looking for. Also I don't give a shit about diet culture. I'm not fat, I was never fat, I know what to eat and I won't let anyone police what I eat. You can be thin, eat a healthy diet and not partake in dieting culture. Your standard for sexual harassment is being glanced at, so I'm not going to take your claim seriously. Also you've never addressed any points I made about men. You know that men have their own beauty standards, which are in some ways similar to women's. Men are also supposed to have clear skin and upkept hair, including facial hair. The beauty standard for men requires you to go for days without food or water so your muscles and veins can be really defined while you flex. How is that realistic and not dangerous? If beauty standards were manufactured by patriarchy to please men, then why the fuck would anyone care about men's looks? Men don't look at other men, not the same way they do as women, and yet standards for men exist.	1643336584.0	huj0sgp	t3_sb9oli	t1_huipvxj	/r/MensRights/comments/sb9oli/what_do_you_guys_think_about_the_male_gaze/huj0sgp/
rmldk	Based and hard facts.  Let’s be real here, a lot of women do not like to admit that they like attention and want to flex on their girlfriends. So when a guy is casually walking past or zoning out on the squat rack and looking in a woman’s vague direction, they’ll happily go running to tell their girlfriends that either A) the cute guy is looking at them or B) the creeps are looking at them.   Obviously A is better than B in their social hierarchy, but B is still something they want to humblebrag to their friends about.   (Btw, this isn’t just a woman thing, this happens with guys too. Except the vast majority of guys either never get any attention or we just don’t notice it. So when we do get that attention, it’s almost never going to be considered a bad thing.  Have you ever noticed how in 99% of cases, the people spouting this shit about evil creepy men are either white knights or 8s and below? You almost never see 9s and 10s starting these bullshit arguments *because they already get the attention and everyone knows it.*	1643336601.0	huj0tw6	t3_se4lmw	t1_huig2gu	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/huj0tw6/

4b5zd12y	"only women get this"  No. She was literally gatekeeping being scared while you're alone. You know who else has to worry about someone larger than them hurting them? Everyone, other than the biggest person on earth... And a gun, bat, machete, etc still wins... So the point is moot. Not only is your point moot, but it shows the sheer lack of empathy your line of thinking has towards men. We are just hulking beasts to you. It's disgusting. I didn't hit puberty til a month before my 17th birthday. Women actively used their physical strength to overpower me. Then shamed me for being able to do so. I have a hard time going out in public AT ALL(mostly from the abuse? Bullying? Not really sure what to call it, that I had at the hands of my step family, two women, one man). The very thought someone might be looking at me, and thinking about all the reasons they wish I would just kill myself, because they hate me so much, for just existing. They know NOTHING about me, and probably just hate me by looking at me. Why wouldn't they want to kill me? Why wouldn't a woman, if anyone else just slice my throat wide open? I might have cash in my wallet. I'm dead, they gained a couple bucks, win win.  This is downplaying men's issues. This goes beyond not caring about them, beyond not caring about men like me, but going as far as to say I don't get a voice. This goes beyond downplaying, it says men don't have fears of being attacked... Fucking ridiculous.   this would be like me taking a picture of my cousin writing a check to "child support" and saying, "only men will get this." Then some guy getting mad when women tell me how wrong that is... With real life statistics(also in this analogy men actual got custody 50% of the time... Not 15%)... And he tells THEM not to make it a competition.   Plus she didnt even do it to the guys making those comments, she went to a men's rights board and told them how to behave...  All the ways your analogy is wrong:  1. Me complaining about parental leave, something that actually happened to me =/ me going out of my way to belittle mens fear in society  2. The girls video is a blatant lie. I would be telling the truth in your analogy  3. Nothing about what I said was sexist  4. I wouldn't be making men and women's problems in society a competition  5. This was 2 separate women. One who was being outright sexist. And one who was defending her and projecting the whole competition narrative.  6. Another man didn't get mad on my behalf and go tell a bunch of men how to behave, them hide it behind the guise of "not making this a competition", while avoiding any actual conversation, particularly on how she was being hypocritical.  If I said, "I have more goals than him." I made it a competition.  If someone replies, "no, I looked at the scoreboard stats this year, and he has 3 more goals than you." He is not making it a competition, but merely pointing out how that is inaccurate.  If that guy replies, "no way, I definitely made more goals than you." He is joining that competition (basically, they were both actively keeping score, to try and outscore the other player). But, if my mom, pulls the second guy to the side and says, "hey it's not a competition. You should be more polite with your behavior." How is my mom not just coddling me?

13g70j6j	Your stance is trash and against the standards of being an MRA. That's not "diversity of thought", that's you attacking the movement you claim to support. Specially when you attack it when the issue doesn't interest you that much like this one which shows your intentions. You're treating this case as if men are predatory by nature and should be checked all the time. If people like you actually cared about safety, you would have feared lesbians too, even more too, knowing they're the ones showing the highest amount of aggressiveness in domestic abuse. As I have said before, men too face creepy interactions from women at the gym and even worse that those interactions aren't punished at all. Men have spoken up about this before and I have asked some men about it myself, and lots of evidence show how women in gyms have not only taken pics of men before but also straight up touch them sexually. Making this issue, naturally, an issue bother genders face. Men as usual were taught to not speak up about this and to even like it hence the silence. So is your concern really to fend off creepy people? Or simply to defend sexist laws that treats men the absolute exact way white people treated black people?	1643337898.0	huj3t6p	t3_sdarcs	t1_huj1yzy	/r/MensRights/comments/sdarcs/connecticut_supreme_court_womenonly_gym_areas/huj3t6p/

j2d0c0x3	Well, gosh, I have to write back, too. That was all eloquently put, and it saddens me to know that you've had such violent experiences and that you feel so hated. I see strength, though, in your vulnerability and your big picture perspective. We disagree on some details, but we're still able to agree on a lot of other important things, like how people need to treat each other, and that's great. Why would everyone agree on every policy idea and its theoretical framework, anyway? Disagreement is the stuff of democracy!  I appreciate that you listed out all of your experiences struggling as a man, without delegitimizing mine. I wish that I were seeing more men doing this in this kind of nonjudgmental way, because I want to read these stories, and I want them to want to read the same kinds of stories from women.  It's sad that there aren't enough resources to go around, as scarce resources seem the real root of the competition between the sexes, not hate. I hope that if we can just get resources figured out to where everyone feels like they have enough, that's when we'll see things like sexism really start disappearing. Maybe, haha.  Until then, and I don't know about you, but I'm not sure that day will come, we can only keep trying by doing what you said, focusing on the people who have opened up their minds to being wrong sometimes. And we can do that while still disagreeing on some of the details.   In regard to that man hating language that you're hearing, it definitely is unacceptable because all hate is unacceptable. I don't know if this helps, but for me, when I feel like venting that way and generalizing about men, it's usually stemming from genuine fear in that moment as I think about the state of women's rights in some other parts of the world, and the historical ownership of women, and I genuinely worry sometimes that it could happen here, or it could happen again, and then I fear for my safety from men for a minute or two. That kind of fear easily lends itself to hate on a bad day. I'm not saying it's totally rational, and I'm not saying it to villify men as dangerous. Sometimes it's just a hard fear to shake with the news stories I read about women's rights in the world. So I'll remind myself that fear is not an excuse for hate, and I hope that you'll try reminding yourself when you hear those comments that those women might be speaking more out of fear than actual hate, if you aren't already.  We're definitely in a time of huge social tension, and it's wearing on all of us. I can admit that I didn't expect to have the several engaging conversations I had today on this sub (I did think I'd get maybe one, lol), and it's been refreshing for me, as well, so thank you! I hope you also felt heard. Let me know if you have any final pressing thoughts about what I said, and if not, I look forward to possibly crossing paths again! I wish you the best.	1643338372.0	huj4w3i	t3_sckpih	t1_huiuqp4	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huj4w3i/

Did you see the article I posted about how Alex Jones' wife was recently arrested for domestic violence after he made the phone call?

As soon as Andrew Yang saw ANY pushback on being against male circumcision he capitulated and removed it from his website and platform. He now says he supports circumcision.  He thinks he can use us, and he thinks he can pander to get our vote.

46a6opwn	Just because numerically aspect A is greater than aspect B doesn't mean it is unreasonable.  Seeking to achieve numeric equality must come with a compelling reason, because equality itself is meaningless: there's no actual point to the same number of men and women doing the same thing when they don't actually want to, for example.  The most important aspect of different numbers is why they exist and whether that reason is itself a problem.  If men are convicted of serious crime in far greater numbers than women, it's either because they are performing more serious crime than women, or the criteria for conviction are biased against men for the same crime. If performing more serious crime, then either they are more "criminal" than women, or their circumstances encourage greater wrongdoing in response. If there was a famine and food was deliberately withheld from men and only given to women and children, it would likely encourage stealing by the men for survival and they would be deemed criminals, yet there is a reason for that behaviour. It would be different if the men chose to give all the food to women and children and sacrifice their own lives, but when others make choices and create circumstances for crimes to reasonably occur, it shouldn't be termed criminal and added to those different statistics.  It's tragic that society doesn't facilitate the sexual fulfilment of every adult, but instead leaves it to chance and manipulation. The end result is crimes from desperation and envy as well as evil. It is not reasonable to require men sacrifice their sexuality and have it held hostage to the wants of women by facilitating no other avenue and the crimes that occur as a result are not unexpected (or unreasonable in the strict sense of the term).  It's kind of like the spurious gender pay gap: women earn less than men, however that is not necessarily because they are paid differently for the same work, which would be unreasonable, but that they don't do the same amount of work (because of child commitments, personal choice or other factors) and/or they work in activities that pay a lower hourly rate.  We can lie convincingly with numbers and distort the situation if we don't understand how they were derived or if that derivation was prejudiced.  Society is also losing the idea of perspective, relativity and rationality: just because women are dying from domestic violence more recently doesn't make it more important than women or men dying in greater numbers for other reasons.	1643341047.0	hujaxus	t3_sea5x9	t1_huiv8it	/r/MensRights/comments/sea5x9/i_hate_how_people_say_because_one_gender_has_more/hujaxus/

43erj2an	The ordinary meaning of the word noble is simply, "distinguished, esteemed, of high rank, good social class." So it refers to one who is esteemed by society. Now, given that almost everyone in our society is a feminist, we should expect that woman would be the more esteemed, more noble, sex. But is her nobility earned? I think not. I think it is contingency of the prevailing liberal political ideology. Women are esteemed because they aren't Trump. They aren't the evil orange man. Their nobility is therefore empty and vain, based on a one-sided distortion.	1643342835.0	hujes8m	t3_se4lmw	t1_huje6k4	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/hujes8m/

46a6opwn	The reality of biology and its drives to procreation mean that everyone is equally entitled to express their natures. In a civilisation, however, no-one is entitled to express their nature in opposition to anothers entitlement: men aren't entitled to sexually assault women and women aren't entitled to hold men to ransom over expressing their sexuality for what women want.  The issue is in civilisation not facilitating the expression of nature in ways that are not oppressive. Unfortunately I believe society has harnessed the inequity of market theory as a guiding path along with its issues when there is effectively a monopoly on supply when the demand is being driven to obtain a fundamental need.  The solution is conceptually quite simple: respect sources of supply but satisfy demand from more than one source, if we continue to base relationships on market theory. In market theory, that is the concept of competition to remove supply bias.  Sadly, instead of facilitating supply from more than one source, society actively dissuades against alternate sources: prostitution is effectively controlled and limited; taboo and homophobia suppress mens exploration of their own erotic potential and the possibility of expressing sexuality with other men, even if they might wish to or have a smidgen of curiosity; and simulacra are suppressed for objectifying women.	1643343707.0	hujglea	t3_sebg5y	t1_huivbn3	/r/MensRights/comments/sebg5y/mens_feelings_of_entitlement_to_womens/hujglea/

67mofgzp	>I think it's a fair argument that many men are overrepresented in higher paying degree subjects (with exceptions) because they are usually socialized as boys to have a greater interest in those careers, and often get a headstart with toys tailored towards learning helpful career skills.  It is a fair argument. Doesn't mean it's entirely true though. We are basically down to the "nature vs nurture" at this point. Yes, socialization do have an effect on kids, but let me ask you this. Have you ever tried to give a child a toy he/she didn't want to play with? Boys and girls have different interests, the differences in their behavior can be observed long before any kind of socialization could take place.  https://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations/AAI9219513/#:~:text=Girls%20were%20significantly%20more%20likely,of%20maternal%20behavior%20and%20affect.  The David Reimer case for example suggests that no matter what you do, if you raise a boy like he is a girl, all you get is a confused boy, who wish to play with toys other boys play with, and do not understand why he can/should not.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer  Men and women choose different careers for a plathora of reasons. Social/cultural factors are among those many. Generally speaking though, men are interested in things, women are interested in people. When you allow people to choose according to their desire, they will be more, not less likely to choose according to "traditional" standards. There are less women in the traditionally male parts of STEM in nordic countries then in countries where women still face discrimination and oppression, like Cambodia or Turkey.  https://youtu.be/tn3yqmiwKAk  The point i am trying to make is that the issue of the gender pay gap is a multi faceted and complex problem (like virtually all social issues) and any approach that intends to describe it in a bidimensional way (ie. discrimination of women by men or childhood indoctrination/culture) is doing a disservice to the cause. If you ask, is there discrimination/bias against women? The answer is yes, there is. But is it systemic? The answer is no, it's individual (as in company by company).	1643344311.0	hujhtrs	t3_sd90ty	t1_hui2gnb	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/hujhtrs/

The psychologist John Money oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful and as evidence that gender identity is primarily learned.

5662mzz3	I disagree, certain people and cultures can have toxic parts to it, it's criticizing behaviours endemic to groups not saying the group is subhuman. Toxic masculinity is cultural phenomena that men (generally western) have that hurts themselves. For example there's the idea a man is somehow lesser because he has mental health problems. If a man has mental health problems but doesn't share them out of wanting to act like a "real man" that's toxic masculinity because it's an aspect of masculinity that is hurting him. However most of the focus should be on society's which encourage that toxic mindset.	1643345020.0	hujj8uw	t3_s88krq	t3_s88krq	/r/MensRights/comments/s88krq/the_use_of_the_phrase_toxic_masculinity_is_in_and/hujj8uw/

Stick to the topic being discussed...  >Ok, traditionally women are in a caregiver role while a man is expected to provide.   Why traditionally? Dont you think women want or like these rolls anymore for themselves and the men they're in a relationship with?  Tell me why feminism (and you apparently) dont like this type of relationship for men AND women?  I.E:   - The nuclear family must be destroyed… Whatever its ultimate meaning, the break-up of families now is an objectively revolutionary process. *Linda Gordon, Feminist*  - Since marriage constitutes slavery for women, it is clear that the women’s movement must concentrate on attacking this institution. Freedom for women cannot be won without the abolition of marriage. *Sheila Cronan, the leader of the feminist organization NOW*  - Marriage as an institution developed from rape as a practice. *Andrea Dworkin, Feminist*  >In caveman days, men would hunt for food and women would look after offspring.

A large percentage of women still view that as the best life choice they can make for themselves, their children, and the men they choose to have a long term relationship with. For some reason feminism is against women making that choice.  >Men are stereotyped as being tough and unemotional.   Stereotyped by who exactly?  Why look, it's those 'we alone know whats right for men' feminists again...  >Do I need to go in to more detail here or are you getting the idea?  No, I get the idea that you, like most feminists, say you know whats best for men and women, and any disagreement with what you say is just sexism, misogyny, and hating women...   >>Sitting there complaining about perceived sexism and women not being promoted because they're women and not actively doing something about it just smacks of sour grapes."  >I think women are trying to do that and have dramatically increased their numbers in leadership.  And? It's nearly always because they're doing the exact same things as men have to do to get those 'promotion numbers up'. It's NOT happening solely because they're women.   >Ok, now you're just cherry picking the most insane feminist quotes and trying to apply them to everyone involved in women's movements.

2i7hmnu6	Women can like traditional roles and choose them for themselves if that's what they want.  I don't have a problem with that.  I'm planning on being a stay at home mom until my kids are in kindergarten.  Feminism gives women the option to choose a non-traditional lifestyle.    Did you seriously just ask me about traditional gender roles and then when I started talking about them, you start complaining that we're talking about 2021?  You asked about traditional gender roles.  Are you crazy?!?  What is wrong with that is that people weren't getting to choose their lifestyles and this lifestyle severely limited women's agency and power.  Having one person being solely in charge of money creates an obvious power imbalance.  Can you really not see that?  Feminism is not against women choosing a traditional lifestyle.  You're thinking of second wave feminists and only a specific type of them.  You seem to be very confused about what feminism is.  Stereotyped by other people in society obviously.  Do you not know what a stereotype is?  The points you're making are just strange.  I know they're verbatim quotes.

Nevertheless, recruiters respond less often to female applicants. But when they do, they are more likely to recruit women than men.   The goal of the article is to help women by telling them and recruiters how to apply for jobs more efficiently. So, it feels very much like a feminist article.

Because the modern left has abandoned my interests as a male and panders only to females and their interests.

Also, the name says it all: Mathematical statistics. A large part of statistics is almost indistinguishable from the classical pure mathematics which is what I assume you would call “rational”.  Further, modern statisticians involved in research don’t necessarily aim to predict anything. Sure the tools they develop can help with this, but a large part is more the development of rigorous theories and proofs related to that. These are definitely rational.	1643355204.0	huk0fis	t3_se4lmw	t1_hujygeh	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/huk0fis/

They have a policy where male staff, doctors aren't included in this I'm not sure about nurses.... basically lower grade male staff aren't allowed to be alone behind a closed door with a female patient. Even if there's *two* of you it's not allowed.  Of course these rules don't apply to female staff.  In fairness they do tell you that the rules are more to protect you and the hospital from false accusations (which, as we all know never happen) than they are to help the patients......  In spite of these rules in two years I was accused of rape by two female patients. Of course... false accusations never happen.

You're delusional and sexist, and the things that you think are reality are just toxic, ultra-regressive views that *you* have about women.

9yrpo0xl	IMHO this only happened because men had no organized political clout with which to threaten his position with repercussions.   You are blaming him (and right to do so) but it seems like some of you are missing the point:  LOBBIES move politicians to get things done. A LOBBY made him do a 180 on circumcision, as well as on other men's issues. Reading that is like watching a pinball get bounced around. Politicians live and die on political clout. Their profession is not designed for them to go out on a limb. At the same time, lobbyists pretend to represent a much bigger slice than  themselves.  What has to happen is very clear:  THIS is what men as a class need. When we have a nationwide grassroots network that can leverage power, politicians will be forced to listen.  Feminists DO NOT want this to happen because A. The gravy train of public funds earmarked for promoting equality will now have to be divided B. Anything that results in A. Is their enemy.  This is why we need to stand behind our organizations and give of our time and talent to them. No one is going to push this cart forward for us.

1tul5mua	Personally I don’t think it should be banned. I think it’s kind of ridiculous. I think female and male separate gyms should be allowed and if there is a women’s only section in a gym, there should be a male side and vice versa so long as the clientele would actually use it.  It isn’t a discrimination to the other sex, just a level of comfortability for several reasons. For me as a woman, I don’t think all men are creeps at all and I’ve had my fair share of harassment from men. I completely also understand that looking at a woman, especially in the gym when a lot of them (not myself) dress with less coverage, can be a natural thing and is not harassment to a degree. And it definitely also happens women to men. The more significant difference is just that women are less of a physically dangerous threat to men than the other way around. Either way, most men are not out on the (dangerous) prowl. It’s just a level of comfort. Like when you’re out with guys and having a guy’s night. That type of camaraderie that is re enforced and shared amongst the same sex. Or when one just wants to be with her girls. There’s just a different sense of comfortability you can have with people of the same sex.  I go to a female only gym in my state and love it. There is pretty much only one guy allowed and he’s the boss’ teenage son but women are notified in the gym if he’s there or coming and he does his own thing. If anyone is uncomfortable they can say but I’ve not heard of any complaints. It’s all controlled/respectful.   I do think the specific difference with this is that it is a women’s only section without catering to a men’s only section so I would understand that being a problem.	1643364714.0	hukcyhx	t3_se4lmw	t3_se4lmw	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/hukcyhx/

Statistics has many applications yes but it is not the focus of most statisticians involved in mathematical research. (As I pointed out previously)  What would you define as pure mathematics in any case? It is a very much subjective classification considering the origin of things such as number theory (started out as pure mathematical interest with absolutely no applications or intended applications). However in recent times it played a major role in encryption etc.  Topology also never seemed to have much application and is most certainly a branch of pure mathematics. But just like statistics it has quite a few applications all over the place.

Gyms have to advertise using pink colors or curvy logos to imply that they prefer women but would have to accept a man signing up anyway as sex is a protected class and you cant deny a service or membership based on discriminating against a protected class.    However I do like the fact there are gyms that larger people can go to as I understand it can be intimidating for them. But its a shame that they advertise towards women or are seen as women-only gyms as larger men feel the same way in a gym where there are mostly buff people working out.	1643366139.0	hukesss	t3_se4lmw	t1_huh8i40	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/hukesss/

4ut296gi	>In no way did I invalidate you.   You did. This is a very common thing women do, where if something someone says doesn't align with their worldview, they assume the person who's saying it either has something wrong with them, or they are in a unique and not at all common situation - basically, you assume the other person is the exception. In your example (I'm paraphrasing)  'I don't know what horrible women you're surrounded with' = most women are categorically not like this, you just had bad luck.  'Your bad experiences...' = this is a you problem, not a society problem, or a women problem.  Why don't you assume that you're just unlucky, and surrounded by a few bad men who harass and oogle you? Men are not evil. You just surround yourself with a few bad apples!   Does that feel like gaslighting? It is. It's literally invalidating your experiences, because I misappropriate the source of your experiences to a factor within your own control, essentially telling you "it's kinda your fault."  BTW:   >get yourself out of the situation where all the women around you are rude and calling you a creep  Funny how almost all women thought I was a creep when I was younger, cared less about my appearance, and didn't have confidence.

That I did my homework, and I can see what women are like without hatred or discontent? That women are flawed beings, and I can criticize them?   I have no hatred for women as a social group. Maybe momentary frustration.  But when people suggest institutional sexism, the flames of hatred get some fuel again.

c3jcv	The thing is i think  the policy was created to try and stop those who grunt and generally make noise to get the attention of others around them, whether that be from the opposite gender or anyone.   Where it goes wrong is they leave it up to each place to make the decision on defining what it means. It's suppose to create a uniform experience from facility to faciliy but it doesn't. I used two different locations in the same city when I went there and they were not the same. One was chill and okay but the other one wasn't.   The more I went to the not okay one the more I didn't want to go to any of them. So I eventually canceled, which was a pain the the ass.

a1zwaoqm	Thanks again for the insightful reply. I'll try to keep it short this time 😆  And thank you for the kind words, it's really appreciated! And yes civil disagreement and discussion is the only way to achieving any sort of long-term goal (if there was no disagreement we'd already be there 😁).   It's true that genuine resources are scarce. I honestly think the internet has done a huge amount to pour fire on  so many of the world's biggest issues. Unfortunately fear, hate, violence and negativity sell and that is all we see and read about these days. And there is so much conflicting information that one person's search for resources or statistics can easily be contradicted by someone else's search to find the opposite. You can literally find anything online and usually people will be searching for things that back up their already formed predisposed ideas.   I honestly think that the venting that happens from men, regarding women, also comes from that same place of fear. We are hearing about how men should be locked up,  that we are stupid and useless, even that we should be mutilated or killed and whilst it may seem like harmless venting it has created a world of abject fear for us too. Especially when we are innocent individuals. We see oppression around the world and in history too, recognise it as wrong, and fear it happening to us. But with men, the only real movement we're seeing is towards it, not away. And it's really bleak, depressing and very scary. We feel constantly under attack and it grinds you down. Especially when you, as an individual, have done nothing wrong.  So those individuals group together for the only form of support you can get. And eventually people snap, reason goes out the window and it becomes a defensive shouting match about who is worse. I think the similarities in our reactions again pertains to people being the same regardless of their gender or other subcategory. I grew up interacting with women exactly the same as I do with men so it deeply saddens me to have this rift forced between us. I never personally even considered there to be differences between genders, and I still don't, but it feels like the opinions of those who think otherwise are so powerful it's controlling the narrative of our society.  I do understand that people are fearful of men and the history that goes with that but I also do think that the role of evil people who happen to be women is underplayed or at least less advertised. Which is probably why so many stories of evil women pop up on here. It's a desperate attempt to say "see it's not just men, it's people!".   I really hope that the world can stop blaming men and start seeing it as evil people that need to be stopped (regardless of whatever that between genders might be). I honestly believe the vast majority of people, men and women, are decent and well meaning individuals just trying to get on and live a happy life. I think if the narrative were changed there would be so much more progression with stopping the evils of the world. And so much more support. Just one small change in the narrative and the whole world is behind you. Stop evil PEOPLE. That way even if 90% of the perpetrators were men you'd have full backing of the 10% who weren't. And vice versa for women. Let alone if it's only 10, 20 or even 50% of one gender that is doing the wrong. Where does that leave the other portion who are wrongly being blamed? As an extreme, I would hope that the vast majority of people in this sub would say that rapists should be stopped. But they wouldn't agree with the statements all men are rapists and should be stopped. There is no need for the generalisations and it does a lot more harm than good. It loses the cause a lot of support it could really otherwise do with. We rightly wouldn't be allowed to say we have to stop all black people being violent or all Muslims being terrorists. It would be a vile, prejudicial and incorrect thing to say. Statistically it could be argued that violence and terrorism are higher in those groups but firstly, there are other factors to take into consideration and secondly it is unquestionably wrong to blame the majority of innocent individuals that don't fit that label. And that's how it feels for us. I really think to take away the word men, and change it for the word of the crime or wrongdoing, we would go a long way to mending bridges and getting mutual support. When I hear "stop violence against women" it makes me think "well what about violence against me? I'm terrified out on the streets and I need protecting too". That doesn't mean I don't think women should be protected. They ABSOLUTELY should be protected. But it also makes me feel as if I am expendable and my protection doesn't matter. Instead, to say we need to stop violence on the street seems far more all encompassing and relevant. And statistics can still be used. (I'll make them up to use as an example) "We need to stop violence in our society. 80% of women have experienced some form of sexual physical harrasment and 80% of men have experienced some form of physical attack". Something like that. Even if it's 10% and 90%. The figures don't matter for this example. But it unifies us as people that have been wronged and can come together to fight against the perpetrators. We need to stop thinking of Men as the group that are causing problems in the world. It's far too broad a category and doesn't take into account the myriad of other things we need to take into consideration and doesn't allow for the idea that women, as people, are also just as capable of wrongdoing.   I wholeheartedly support any cause that makes the world a better place for women. I wholeheartedly support any cause that makes the world a better place for men. But more importantly I support any cause that makes a better world for people.  I know what you mean about fearing that day of equality will never come but I am also hopeful. I think the invention of the internet has really kicked the hornets nest and things are in absolute turmoil right now. It may not happen sufficiently in our lifetimes but the pendulum is swinging back and forth and hopefully it will settle in the middle at some stage.   Whoops I wrote a stream of consciousness essay again :) happy and interested to hear back from you again if you want to reply or have anything further to say.

31tdvp8k	It's not really like that.  I worked with a lot of people with mental health problems. She's really quite sweet that one in her own way.  I've had far worse in the NHS.  I used to work nights and it's a 12 hour shift so some of the nurses told me that a good place to have a little shut eye on your break is the tea room. So that sounded like a good idea and that night I just went in and lay down on the floor.  There was a nurse having a kip on the couch and she got up, she seemed agitated but I didn't know what was wrong with her. She left the room and a couple of minutes later the matron showed up and started having a go at me. She was *furious*.  I tried to get her to explain what was wrong but she wouldn't say. This went on for a couple of minutes. I had no idea what the problem was. In the end I said to her "Look, I get that I've done something wrong but if you don't tell me what it is then what are you even doing?"  She was *so* rude and aggressive but I eventually got her to tell me that the reason that I couldn't sleep on the floor there was because I might sexually assault that nurse.  It was bizarre because as soon as the words came out of her mouth you could literally see her physically deflate because she knew full well how ridiculous it was.  Now *those* are entitled bitches in the NHS.	1643372243.0	huknkvv	t3_se4lmw	t1_hukl63j	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/huknkvv/

Sounds a bit strange to Imply that being convicted go a crime that is based on an invalid definition should be treated as if they are guilty of something they obviously we're not.  As for the law vs right and wrong. It doesn't play out that way at all. I was accused of assaulting my ex step daughter and fought for 18 months  Entire time the prosecution kept delaying and I had to keep finding more money to pay for legal fees for each court visit.  Eventually I got my day in court and the judge lost the plot at the prosecution, because as she put it. " If, he had actually done what he was accused of then by law and any reasonable definition of assault I would not be finding him guilty, and to make matters worse his accuser just denied it on the stand. You have just dragged this poor man through 18 months of hell over something he didn't do and should never have been charged with".  The entire time I fought it the prosecution kept trying to get me to plead guilty with the promise of a Lenient sentence.   I had the financial resources to fight it....

1ib5l9eh	I don't get what is hard about this, even private entities have to uphold the law. The law states that you can't be discriminated against based on your sex.   The whole debate about 'safety' is a red herring. First and foremost, the whole "debate" presumes that women are somehow in danger any time they see a man. This premise is ridiculously sexist and it has no basis in reality.   Secondly this whole "debate" somehow seems to think that we have some sort of 'right to feel safe'. There is no such thing, nor should there ever be such a thing. Being scared is something highly subjective, things that would scare the shit out of one person is someone else their hobby.   Quite frankly, i really can not give a single shit about women being annoyed by people hitting on them in a gym or where ever. They are free to confront these people or leave if this doesn't have the effect they desired. As long as things aren't physical they'll simply have to endure it, just like everyone else.

a0xsse2g	The problem with this is showing that women (or any other group) really are underrepresented.  I don't know what sort of evidence you're basing this on - please tell us - but this sort of reasoning very often derives from the assumption that every role should have 50% representation of men and women. That's long since been shown to be a goal that simply doesn't represent the desires of the population.   The problem is that because that *is* such a popular and commonplace assumption, not that much research is often done into what sort of distribution of men and women we *would* expect. That would have to be done on a per-job basis and while it probably has been done in specific instances it's certainly nothing we dare generalise about; this is one good argument for pursuing a strict equality of opportunity approach.  But as I say, this depends very heavily on what you mean by "equal in companies." The definition of "equal" in that case would almost certainly depend on the specifics of the job and it's very hard to sum up.	1643374499.0	hukrhqp	t3_seiqxk	t1_hukdfvv	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/hukrhqp/

1tul5mua	Well where are the resources coming from, one. If the government is allocating the resources, I think they have enough to do it for both should the issue arise. Private companies would be a different story.  And two, I did say if they are completely separate gyms, separate companies, I don’t see the problem. I do understand the problem if it was one gym and only had a section that for women and the rest was mixed with no one spot for men. That I can understand. But if they’re completely separate locations, I can’t say I agree, respectfully.  I know with YMCA in Canada when I lived there, not sure about the States, they have a plus membership where in each gender segregated changing room they have a mini gym inside it. So there’s that option in some mixed gyms. Though I guess one could say that’s financial discrimination haha.

j2d0c0x3	Thank you for your thoughts! I absolutely agree. Most hate comes from a place of fear, and I understand your fear of getting locked up. Our nation already had an unhealthy relationship with incarceration and that hurts men most. As soon as we go from fearing the individual to fearing the group, we risk generalizing, But, I don't feel that the huge majority of men I've met have treated me as their equal to the point that it has really affected my life as a woman, and I do believe people who sometimes act as groups are their own phenomenon that need to be discussed, not just people as individuals who act, so my views around gender and the path to equality look different than yours sometimes, and I think that's okay. I can at the same time respect your argument that there are many bad women in the world, and many good men, and it's easy to forget this when we think in groups. I'm a feminist, and for a while now, most of my closest friends have been men. Being a lesbian, especially, it's harder for me to connect as friends with a lot of straight women, and I often relate better to men.   You made some good points about reading resources. I also think resources like food, shelter and money are at the root of inequality, and of hate. We know from research that it's hard to be happy when we feel like we don't have enough resources. If we can find a way to make sure everyone has enough, I think we'll all finally have the bandwidth across all competing groups, like gender, race, and religion, to learn to hate and fear less.  We disagree on some of the theoretical, and I think that's great. We've got to remember these days that diversity of thought and opinion is good for democracy, not a threat to it. The threat is when we forget to respect each other enough to really listen, and decide it's more important to be right. But it's most important to make connections and learn about each other as individuals, and we agree that we've got to do it with listening and respect.  And I totally agree that the Internet is behind a lot of the horrible things happening right now, and it's hurting people more than it's helping, It's comforting to at least know that lots of people see this, and are trying to make some positive policy changes to make the Internet a safer place.	1643375737.0	huktva2	t3_sckpih	t1_hukhwd8	/r/MensRights/comments/sckpih/woman_rips_off_mans_testicle_and_tries_to_eat_it/huktva2/

j2d0c0x3	So I was taking issue with something you still appear to be doing, which is assuming that I don't know as much about you on the nature vs nurture argument, or that because I didn't mention the nature half, I don't believe in it. Thus, when you try to explain these concepts to me, it comes across as patronizing. Also. as for the research, there's a ton on toys and socialization, which I've read and even participated in, and I know your generalizations about the research here are just that, generalizations.  Again, your last paragraph is patronizing. I don't need you to welcome to me to my beliefs, and I haven't asked you to accept anything as fact without proof.  What I said is also supported by research. I don't think you're willing to converse with me without taking this subtle stance of, "I'm more right than you, I know what you think about everything, and I need to teach you why you're wrong." It isn't a productive approach, and I hope you'll see that.	1643376379.0	hukv63m	t3_sd90ty	t1_huk0ft4	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/hukv63m/

55030	>If women are so underrepresented in companies, is it really an advantage to be a woman  Yes because the reason they are "underrepresented" is because they don't apply, or don't have the requisite STEM degree they need, or [opted for fewer working hours than men](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53558250) (disregard the misleading clickbait title) and therefore lack the experience to be considered for more senior roles. Yet despite this, they are preferentially chosen by employers who need to fill their diversity quota more often than men are. It doesn't mean the effect is massive, otherwise there wouldn't be any so-called underrepresentation, but it is sufficient to be verifiable, as evidenced by this article.	1643377118.0	hukwp6r	t3_seiqxk	t1_hukdfvv	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/hukwp6r/

Its inevitable that first we express pain and anger before we move on the more enlightened and informed view points.  It's important that we call misogynistic content without vilifying the content poster, in time this will lead to positive action.  Women have had 60 years or more to process their anger and work out positive strategies for improving their place in society, Men are only now starting out on this journey.  Slip ups are inevitable, so too over speaking and yes occasional slips into misogyny. We're hurting and we have no safe space to process that hurt.  So be real, call out misogyny when you think you see it but don't hate on your brothers, we were all in pain once.	1643377240.0	hukwya0	t3_sejd1v	t1_hukef9s	/r/MensRights/comments/sejd1v/haters_gonna_hate_ill_keep_going/hukwya0/

You say I'm surrounded by bad women, but not all women are bad, and that I should work on myself, and find new company.  Provided I really am just some bitter husk of a man crippled by the abuse of women around me - how is this not victim blaming? Do you go around telling abuse victims that it's their fault they are in an abusive relationship, and that they should work on themselves?   Because according to my moral compass, that passes, because I don't believe every conflict between men and women is cut and dry.

phqhw	Is "how likely to apply" and "how likely to be accepted" really the right way to look at it?  I'd think it's "number of jobs investigated" which is about the same, and "number of applications needed to get hired" which is lower for women (it's just another way of framing that same 16-20% from the chance of applying or being accepted).   I suppose there's also number of offers before accepting one which would be the gap between "number of offers looked at" and "how likely to apply" vs "how likely to be accepted", but it looks like that's roughly even.  .  It'd also be interesting to see a histogram of how many applications it takes to get hired or stop looking rather than just averages. Like, is there a difference at the median, or do incompetent women give up trying faster than incompetent men do?

oy1ko	Not what the article says. On average men take the shotgun approach and apply to a lot of hail Mary positions that they stand almost no chance of getting an interview. Women are more selective and more conservative, in average. So of course the individual success rate for an application from a woman is going to be higher.   If you've ever hired for a technical position you know exactly what I'm talking about. I'll get male dog walkers, frisbee coaches, and felons applying for a job that requires a graduate degree and a clearance.

Maybe it’s a socialization thing, but as a woman, I assume my worth will not be maximized if I don’t meet most, if not all, the job requirements. I was amazed to know men didn’t feel insecurity or inadequacy at applying for a job like that.

j2emgu4a	Wrong, it’s a statistical phenomenon based on the fact that women devalue themselves so much more than men that they wait until they meet most, but usually 100% of the job requirements. Since men feel like they can apply to a job that they only meet 60% of the requirements for, that speaks to male privilege, not the other way around.   “Give me this job because I’m a MAN! I’ll figure out that 40% of the stuff I’m not qualified for on the job because I’m a man! It’s not like that will waste any company money or anything…”   And when women are being paid LESS than men…of course it’s a steal for a company to hire them instead of the expensive, less qualified dude.	1643386078.0	hulimuf	t3_seiqxk	t1_hukvkyg	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/hulimuf/

This is projection of the general female stance that they are entitled to chivalry because it's so damn normal, so since they expect to be treated extra well, they project on men that we are demanding it... as they do.

2is40ijk	Right, I don't want to be wasting my time on you more than necessary....  The "article " states the following:  "To answer that, we dug into LinkedIn data and analyzed billions of interactions between professionals, companies, and recruiters. We looked at how open women and men are to new opportunities, how they browse and apply to jobs, how they interact with recruiters, and how likely they are to get hired after applying."  This is not a source. Go read an actual peer-reviewed scientific article which reference their source. **That** is something you can use as a source, not a blog post. By the way wymyn, if we go by your dogma then the fact that this article was written by a wymyn, who's most likely a feminist... 2 + 2 = ?  My question to you had nothing to do with what OP was saying. You said "*As a woman*, I was shocked when I found out that men apply for jobs even if they don’t meet all the requirements. Maybe it’s a socialization thing, *but as a woman*, I assume my worth will not be maximized if I don’t meet most, if not all, the job requirements. *I was amazed to know men didn’t feel insecurity or inadequacy* at applying for a job like that. **I think this speaks to male privilege**, rather than any kind of female privilege, like the OP seemed to be searching for."  Applying for a job that you don't think you're absolutely qualified for is not a sign of "male privilege". You know what is privilege though? Getting less of a prison sentence for the same exact crime, just because you're a wymyn.	1643388285.0	hulom1e	t3_seiqxk	t1_hulmxqb	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/hulom1e/

j2emgu4a	Yes, getting out of a sentence just because you’re a woman is indeed privilege and sexist simply because women are seen as less threatening than men. Idk why you MRA’s love to point out shit that you feel will “shatter” the feminist narrative, old-school feminists see this gender-preferential treatment toward women as patronizing and SEXIST. Treat us the same as men, dammit. If I murder someone and go to jail, my vagina will not prevent me from reoffending anymore than a penis will.

f153moet	The f knew he didn't want to do it. The only reason they were asking him if he consented was to badger him into agreeing once they decided he was wasted enough to be vulnerable to their suggestions.    At no point did the f say B isn't interested in that. Stop badgering him'.   She never said ' hey man, you've had too much to drink.  This isn't a good idea  why don't you go home and sleep it off?'  She didn't even say on the phone ' sorry,  busy tonight,  see you some other time'.  The laws and rules of consent are not only to prevent predators raping and sexually abusing people.   The unspoken  idea behind asking for consent is not an @rse covering exercise, nor is it an excuse  to coerce someone into doing something they don't want to do.   It's to make sure that everyone taking part doesn't feel ashamed,  $hitty and used afterwards.

j2emgu4a	Male privilege is a lot. It’s the respect you get simply for being a man. When I buzzed my hair, I would experience your world for brief glimpses. The “hello sir, what can I get for you” was 1000x more respectful than the “hi, what can I get for you” I normally got wherever I went.  Your every waking moment is filled with this male privilege. People listen when you speak, simply because you’re a man. People move out of the way for you, because you’re a man. People pick up your job application first, because you’re a man.  I’m sorry that you all have convinced yourselves that you have it so hard because other men are beating you down and women are “forcing you” into marriages.

6m65a77y	>I was amazed to know men didn’t feel insecurity or inadequacy at applying for a job like that. I think this speaks to male privilege, rather than any kind of female privilege,  We men still apply because we know that if we meet at least meet 50-60% of the job, some employers will meet halfway and train us on the rest. No candidate is ever going to be 100% qualified for any job, regardless of gender.  Men also know we have the burden of performance and obligation to provide for our families so we don't have the luxury of being super selective when it comes to job searching.  If you want to talk about privilege, I work in Marketing and you have no idea how many interviews I've gone to where the hiring manager (e.g. Marketing Director or Marketing Manager) is a woman and is not only underqualified, but she got the job and didn't even have a Marketing background.

3ma5q	Im sorry for some of the flippant half ass responses.  But I think youre overstating male privilege here.  Its not that men dont feel inadequate or feel shame or ever feel "icky"....its that other demands on them force them to take that up regardless.  Women make men feel icky just for existing all the time.  Thats just part of the male experience.  Theres almost no scenario where your presence is wanted or celebrated so its not unusual for you to have to get over that initial "ickyness" everyone feels about you because of your gender and work your way up from there.  You have to put yourself out there anyway.  Women dont.  Thats male privilege right there.  Id wager women probably never feel that and so they are averse to situations that might make them feel unwanted.  Amazingly, thats also male privilege.  Because see women have the oppression of nothing being their fault or privilege.  Thats all on men.  Like you probably have never applied for a job that didnt specifically say they really want women to apply to it.  Like please god can we just get some colored vaginas in here to really help us!  Id find it ridiculously patronizing and bigoted but women apparently eat it up.  Well its the opposite for a man.  Ive never, not ever, applied to anything that really wanted me because of my skin color or gender.  I know if they hired me its because I was leagues ahead of everyone else such that they didnt have a choice.  I know when I get hired on that someone in HR had to choke on my white male privilege and that some hiring manager isnt getting their bonus for diversity.  Thats my privilege.  And knowing when I walk in that Im starting a few steps behind because most of them are going to feel icky and I have to work to overcome that?  Thats just icing privilege on the icing cake.  At least they know Im fucking competent though because if there was anyone else of any gender or skin color that wasnt a complete fucking idiot I wouldnt be there.  Thank you affirmative action for that at least.	1643391573.0	hulxj1w	t3_seiqxk	t1_hulkqox	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/hulxj1w/

fu0usbef	Good on you. I myself have been trying to give careful, and dare I say reasonable, sound, advice for a week now on reddit. Often in relationship threads where people are so quick to condemn men and scream red flag and "BREAK UP" over the smallest things.   I try to offer insight, tell them to communicate their issues to their partner before listening to strangers that have nothing invested in the relationship.  But I just get absolutely roasted and downvoted. I keep my calm but I get insulted and nobody even listens to what I write if it in anyway threatens the narrative that the woman is the victim.  I even tried to ask for my own relationship advice (have a GF that holds what I think is downright misandric content in high esteem) but immediately people jump at me from left and right and project the most absurd things onto me, vilifying me etc.  I can't even post in some threads because my karma is so low.

67mofgzp	>I was taking issue with something you're still doing, which is assuming that I don't know as much about you on the nature vs nurture argument, or that because I didn't mention the nature half, I don't believe in it.  Ma'am with all do respect, i am not the one making assumptions here, and this time my wording was clear too. I didn't say "you know nothing about nature", i said "you didn't mention it". Objectively, there was nothing, not a single word about nature in your response. What would you have me say in a debate scenario? I know nothing about what is in your head, i haven't the slightest clue who you are, the only thing i can work with is what you write down and that's exactly what i did.  >I do think that you made assumptions about my views with statements like this.  I asked you if you tried giving a toy to a child he/she didn't want to play with, yes. This was an enquiring question, because i was curious to know about your experience. According to what i know (i studied some developmental psychology) you can't force children to play with stuff they do not wish to play with, or have no innate interest in playing with, for a prolonged period of time. I asked you this, because you worked in childcare, whereas I studied about it but have no significant experience. Then i went on to describe my standpoint, so you can either confirm or refute it with your experience.   >I know that part of the argument here boils down to my belief that boys ultimately have a competitive edge, and your belief that that's not the case.  No offense, but who is making the assumptions? When did i ever say that i do not believe in this? Boys were, are and will be more competitive compared to girls. No doubt, it is the case. But we didn't even touch on this aspect up until now.   >I wanted to make a point that I believe, and the research reflects, that PART of why men and women choose the careers we do is because we were conditioned for them through play, and that men get the advantage over women of conditioning for high paying careers often enough that it's part of why we see a pay gap.  Yes, and this is exactly why i said that you can't force kids to play with toys they have no innate interest in playing with. I disaggree that this is where the crux of the problem is, but i do not exclude the fact that it does have an effect, as you said, we only disagree in regards of the effect size.   Alltogether, I think social expectations from adult men and women are far more important in this regards. Men are expected to provide, women are not. Society (both sexes) still see men as providers and women seek men who out earn them.   Here is a study to prove this: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/%3famp=1  Like it or not, many decisions a man makes (especially young men) he makes it so in order to have better mating options. Society EXPECTS men to out earn women, while also taking issues with the gender pay gap, despite the fact that 80% of consumer decisions are driven by women https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy.   Generally speaking, women prefer men with higher income then themselves,  https://news.ubc.ca/2016/10/28/marrying-up-despite-more-education-women-still-choose-husbands-with-higher-incomes/  on the other hand, women (especially college educated) complain about men making money. Now tell me if this makes any sense to you, because ot doesn't for me. But perhaps i am missing something.   >but I do think it was okay for me to give my thoughts on a piece of the puzzle and not have to dive into my thoughts on the whole of the puzzle.  Yes, it was 100% OK. Just as it was OK for me to reveal other pieces of the puzzle in a debate that is also public.   >You say I "started the debate," but you started debating with me [...].   Correct, i confused our conversation on this thread with our conversation on an other thread. I do apologize.  >You engaged by telling me that feminist gender pay gap theory is debunked and the majority of the gap can't be explained by discrimination. Certainly, we disagree on the "majority" bit  That we do. I would need to see proof for that discrimination and proof that it happens on the sole basis of one's gender and not other factors to move my standpoint on that. As i said, individual discrimination does happen, bias is prevalent, i have no doubt (the amount of anecdotal evidence can not be ignored), we should raise awareness and minimize it as much as possible. But i just can't see proof for systematic discrimination.  In my opinion, social expectations are far more important then any other reasons. Generally speaking, men do what women want them to do. If women would select for men best at walking on their hands, you'd see a bunch of men jumping around on one hand (paraphrasing dr. Warren Farrell here). If we attempt to change what men do, without changing what we are expecting them to do, the result is mass confusion.	1643394616.0	hum5rrw	t3_sd90ty	t1_hukv63m	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/hum5rrw/

j2d0c0x3	I'm going to skip all the word parsing this time because it's turned into a silly contest. You're not perfect, nor am I, and I'm going to settle on, "We both made assumptions, and it's okay with me at this point if you don't see yours as assumptions."  I think your last couple paragraphs are what really matter to the argument here, and the bit before that about how we disagree on where the crux of the problem is. We do disagree because we disagree about the existence of systemic sexism today, but I think we've had a spirited discussion and are ending things in a good place. It would be unrealistic to think either of us could change the other's mind completely on the real root of the disagreement between feminists and MRAs (at least as I see it), which is whether or not systemic misogyny exists in the US today. I know there's at least some progress we can make, in policy and conversation, even while disagreeing on something so major. Like you said, for example, we agree that we should raise awareness and minimize gender bias on the individual level. That's a great start.  I don't mean to draw out the conversation, just wanted to leave my side on this note.	1643395645.0	hum8j0g	t3_sd90ty	t1_hum5rrw	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/hum8j0g/

I don’t mean to take away from your point because maybe you’re right, but imagine this *was* the other way around (I.e. like it has been historically), would it be reasonable to say ‘women clearly aren’t trying as hard to be good candidates’ as opposed to looking at a ‘proper’ reason? Maybe it’s because men now only make up ~40% of higher education places etc etc.   Instead of men not trying hard enough that is.	1643396291.0	huma9x4	t3_seiqxk	t1_hulhvbr	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/huma9x4/

America cant even manage to socialize the 3 most perfect institutions for socialism: healthcare, education, and incarceration.  No. You're wrong. You clearly dont understand socialism. Also, acting like the US court system is inherently anti-right-wing is a joke. Kyle Rittenhouse committed premeditated murder, but the judge unilaterally decided all the obvious evidence of premeditation was too damning to be used in court. After all, an honest and fair trial would have landed the right-wing darling in jail!  I want to be on your side of the argument about HR departments because I have been a victim of women deciding that they were justified in discrimination against men because feminism told them it was necessary. But your language strikes me as someone with the tradcon victimhood complex. I can't help thinking there is a chunk of the story that's missing. Specifically, a chunk that indicates why firing you was not unlawful termination is conspicuously absent. Because if the story is this simple, you should be suing them for sexual discrimination, unlawful termination, creating a hostile work environment, and retaliatory actions toward an employee who reported harassment. So, what gives?  Women will always assume manhood is easy. They will always think being a man is just inherently easy, so our complaints that they dont care about us will always fall on deaf ears.	1643398043.0	humeyaj	t3_sewvip	t3_sewvip	/r/MensRights/comments/sewvip/hr_depts_are_populated_by_women_who_show_no_mercy/humeyaj/

1hh8d8by	Ok. You can see that you hopped around a lot there. You have to write in a stepwise logical way or I can't follow your reasoning. We're not in the same room, I can't see your hand gestures or slow the thought down. Just small incremental points. Our communication is different. Lets help it along.   Also, don't assume how I think or feel about anything. It's insulting. You don't know me, you don't know how I feel about men. I'm on a men's rights forum to listen and I'm not saying the people here hate women or are disgusting. It's nasty dismissive language that I'm not using on you. Be civil. I'm being respectful and I expect the same back. You make yourself look base when you speak like that. It doesn't help if we both go immediately defensive and offensive, though it can be hard at times not to.    So my point was simply - if someone says this hurt me, it's not appropriate, in that moment, to interject with how someone else hurt you more in a different way. It has to be similar, they want people to empathise with them when they have revealed something about how they feel. It's derailing. They made the post to talk about something they are afraid of. That's fine. Let people express their fear. You're not attacking women. It's not about you. It's about them and how they feel.  We do this all the time in life. We know it's not appropriate to interject on other people's suffering unless we are trying to empathise with them. We always have to be mindful of not drowning out the people who had the courage to speak up first and make the post. And even then, language is so important. People can have completely different perspectives and both still be right and valid.   It sounds like you have gone through a lot of really difficult things. Now, it would be inappropriate of me to say, at this point, well this happened to me etc etc. I could. But this forum is about men's rights and you get to talk here about things that affect you. If you made a post about it, here, people would give you advice and empathise. Hopefully. Listen and share their stories. People will listen but you have to be vunerable and choose the right safe ways to speak up. This group might be a good one to make a post about it so more people could read it than me. I'm not a therapist.    But I would say if you had that experience at such a young age, that therapy can help with that. It sounds like life has put you through the wringer a bit with bullying and child support. Some one on one support is really helpful. I've done it myself, I have male friends who have too. No one regrets therapy. Oh, 7cups is an excellent resource, I use it myself. If you're interested.   I wish you the best. I don't think we'll agree over the video but in time more and more people will speak up about their experiences and maybe then the point actually will be moot!	1643398559.0	humgbrq	t3_sd61uj	t1_huj30tq	/r/MensRights/comments/sd61uj/the_way_to_raise_mens_right_and_awareness_is_not/humgbrq/

As regards socialism - you have to understand that the way socialist parties behave in the EU is not something you are familiar with in the USA. Like most Western EU countries - we have two parties - the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. Christian Democrats in my country may be a little conservative but they are excellent when it comes to the environment, the economy and just plain common sense when it comes to human / worker rights. Socialists often focus on 'civil liberties' and abandon everything else. When they rose to power in 2013 we suddenly got gay marriage, state financed sex change operations, a minister for women's rights, a minister for the rights of the 'disadvantaged',	1643398599.0	humgfk4	t3_sewvip	t1_humeyaj	/r/MensRights/comments/sewvip/hr_depts_are_populated_by_women_who_show_no_mercy/humgfk4/

9c2ivz	Here is a word of advice in these situations. Document everything when it happens and be as detailed as you possibly can when it happens. You want to document the time, place, how long the encounter was and who was there to witness it.  The other thing is NEVER go in to any meeting that is close doored with a single person. If you are forced to do this then record the entire thing and explain to them it is to protect everyone involved. If they have nothing to hide then it won't be an issue.   If your work place has gotten so bad that you feel you are always being attacked or whatever, then check the laws for your location and start audio recording your entire day on your phone or whatever. This will further allow you to document things if you ever need to go to a lawyer.  I am not a lawyer but if a work environment is hell I would consider recording my day regardless of the law and then allow the lawyer to figure out what to do with it when you are forced to sue.  It sucks to have to go to these levels but you have to protect yourself first because companies and evil people can permanently ruin your life if you don't protect yourself.	1643399302.0	humiaf8	t3_sewvip	t3_sewvip	/r/MensRights/comments/sewvip/hr_depts_are_populated_by_women_who_show_no_mercy/humiaf8/

719fd	One company I worked for, when we were recruiting, we'd get about 200 male resumes and maybe a dozen female for every position.  HR gave us a policy that EVERY female resume would get a phone screening at minimum.  We had a special form to follow for their phone screening that included "recommend for in person interview Y/N".  If we said no, you had to write a detailed justification why not.  There's was no similar form for male phone screening.  What this did was automatically give a massive advantage to any female applicant, just by getting screened.  Male resumes we'd sort though giving a few seconds to each one.  As a result  every time I interviewed a female applicant, I found myself asking myself "would this person even be sitting here if she were male"?	1643400877.0	hummfc0	t3_seiqxk	t3_seiqxk	/r/MensRights/comments/seiqxk/new_report_women_apply_to_fewer_jobs_than_men_but/hummfc0/

Both sexes reacted less positively to the male-favouring differences, judging the findings to be less important, less credible, and more offensive, harmful, and upsetting. Participants predicted that the average man and woman would react more positively to sex differences favouring their own sex. This was true of the average woman, although the level of own-sex favouritism was lower than participants predicted. It was not true, however, of the average man, who – like the average woman – reacted more positively to the female-favouring differences.

What i am up against is the current zeitgeist, according to which tgere is only talk about how men must change so all responsibilities of change is on men (i am not saying that you are part of this). It is socially acceptable, as it should be, to draw out issues where women were discriminated against by men, but there is public enrage or at least invalidation if the opposite happens, about 90% of the time. We talk about tixic masculinity but we dont talk nearly as much about toxic feminimity, in fact, if a women acts toxic, we call that toxic masculinity as welk. Besides, when there is talk about gender issues, and men are criticized, most often there is no admission of achievements and men are constantly being put on the defense. Just like in a romantic relationship, this attitude is toxic in my opinion.

1tul5mua	No. I said work on yourself because you clearly have issues with me saying not all women are the type to call every man a creep for no reason. I did not say work on yourself because something is wrong with you. I’m saying get out that situation. And I would tell someone abused the same, to get out of the situation. Don’t surround yourself with an abusive person.  You have serious issues to have taken it so far as to say I’m victim blaming and putting words in my mouth. Additionally, I do believe in women’s rights just as I do men’s. But I am not using any tropes here. You are straight up just going out of your way to look for any way you can possibly twist words to suit your odd need to feel hated by women. That is what you need to work on.

j2d0c0x3	That isn't the "only talk." It's just the talk you're choosing to see, which you did acknowledge a bit when you said in parantheses that you're not saying I'm part of that talk. I see a lot of similar talk by MRAs on this sub about women, but I know not all men or all MRAs think and talk the same way. I think if you looked a little closer for the evidence, you would see more feminists who aren't saying men are the only ones who need to change, doxing men, ridiculing them, et cetera. That behavior happens on both sides, and isn't ever appropriate, right?  Also, I talk all the time about toxic femininity. It's why I struggle to make friends with women. And I struggle to make friends with men because of their sexism, as I perceive and experience it. At the risk of possibly overgeneralizing, I'm not in the camp of feminists who are describing problematic female behavior as a form of toxic masculinity. Generally, when I see these arguments, they don't make sense to me and seem unfair. I also see a lot of MRA arguments as unfair and not making much sense, so I think it happens equally on both sides.  For my conclusion, I would say that if we want to move forward and improve our society, both genders have work to do, but men have more. I say this because of that big point of disagreement on systemic sexism and what it even is.	1643404382.0	humvk0n	t3_sd90ty	t1_humrav1	/r/MensRights/comments/sd90ty/we_dont_need_feminism_and_we_dont_need_the_male/humvk0n/

For his trouble, the corporate press has held him up as an avatar of toxic masculinity.

1tul5mua	No. I am usually willing to have conversations on this sub and go out of my way to talk to/understand the perspectives and needs, respectfully. But if someone is going to spin my words and prefer to stay in the state of finding every way to blame every woman he comes to contact with, I think that is not conducive to anything and is the exact reason a lot MRAs don’t like feminists ..because they generalize and associate horrible behavior with all men. Like the *some* of the subject matter of this post; all men harass women and so women need a separate space but not men.  I said he was surrounded by odd women so should probably surround himself with better women. That, apparently, was victim blaming and I also shouldn’t have said not all women are like that because that’s a typical radical feminist thing to say.  With men are placing women and misogynist replacing radical feminist: I said she’s surrounded by odd men and should probably surround herself with better men. That, apparently, was victim blaming and I also shouldn’t have said not all men are like that because that’s a typically misogynistic thing to say.   It’s just not a conducive discussion at all. It’s like arguing with a radical feminist set in their ways. There are better people to have these conversations with, with better results in valuing one another as men and women. I don’t need to get angry or annoyed at men because one wants to twist my words to suit the way he wants to wrongly perceive mine. You know what I mean?  Otherwise, yeah I love having conversations on this sub and have successfully had them that’s why I’m on it. I just thought it important to point out to this man in particular that that is not general female behavior; we’re not all like that. It was also important to point out that many instances of harassment are actually harassment. One should not generalize that they are all lies because he’s had an experience otherwise. You can be “innocent until proven guilty” but take at face value and investigate the matter further. But to insinuate they are all outright lies is just plain wrong.	1643406368.0	hun0o1v	t3_se4lmw	t1_humuady	/r/MensRights/comments/se4lmw/in_60_decision_connecticut_supreme_court_finds/hun0o1v/
46c0ul2t	Trans rights is it's own thing and needs to be addressed separately. However if someone is recognized and treated as a man they can certainly be affected by mens rights. Everyone deserves respect and dignity and not to be met with discrimination or unfair treatment because of their membership to a protected class(or what should be a protected group). So I'd personally say trans men do have room to be included.	1643406396.0	hun0qii	t3_sec08g	t1_hum548g	/r/MensRights/comments/sec08g/does_mensrights_include_poc/hun0qii/
7mqb9y6c	Disagree. Abuse is abuse. "Degrees" of abuse are entirely subjective. As in, one person might stub their pinkie toe and identify the pain as a 10, on a scale of 1 to 10... "The worst pain of their lives". And another may break a leg and limp into the ED with a 7 on the same 10 point scale. Pain and suffering has no empirical number on the scale. Pain and suffering are entirely "subjective" on an individual basis. That's why every doctor, in every ED, hangs a "Pain Chart" and asks every conscious patient what their 1-10 "pain number" is. They'll ask for that number multiple times during every evaluation, to check for progress or decay in a patients pain.	1643406405.0	hun0rcp	t3_sec08g	t1_humdzwe	/r/MensRights/comments/sec08g/does_mensrights_include_poc/hun0rcp/
