You are the one who came here to bitch about your ideals and when people point out that the reality is not made of ideals you start weird rants and assumptions. If I were to assume stuffs about you, maybe you should go back to your cuck of a partner who is henpecked and bitch to him how all men should be a cuck like him instead of giving sermons about how others are haters while you are the Messiah of love.

9xisz247	Feminism at first was a good thing. I would've even called myself a feminist if I was around back then. Women should have the right to vote and the right to stray from traditional gender roles.   I hate gender roles and stereotypes more then anything. A core reason I'm so against feminism is that they perpetuate negative stereotypes for men. (Men are stupid, drunk, sex pigs, and clueless privileged oppressors.)  Maybe if feminism put a little more attention into breaking the negative stereotypes of men, rather than encouraging them, I'd be a lot less hostile.	1641077820.0	hqv20yl	t3_rtluch	t3_rtluch	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtluch/is_it_sexist_to_oppose_old_classical_feminism_do/hqv20yl/

Patriarchy also benefits uglier women to find such fulfilling child raising family relationships because men have a harder time hooking up casually, so more men decide to settle for marriages.  What these half brains don't realize is destroying the patriarchy is destroying the family but forming a family is more like a sacrifice and settling for something proper instead of messing around and having fun for men so it's a compromise and they can and do very well do without it but the majority of women end up miserable in a society where forming stable families is discouraged or frowned upon.	1641082482.0	hqvcvvt	t3_rtfgzm	t3_rtfgzm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtfgzm/least_pathetic_modern_feminist/hqvcvvt/

runoh	I believe that women and men should be treated equally under the law. But there are also biological natural differences that lead to different behaviors, outcomes, and choices.  We live in a society where literally everything has been designed to undermine anything male to the point of horrific discrimination against men in school, the professions, and certainly in the law. That's not healthy for society. And it's not healthy at all for women. And I believe the vast majority of women are quite happy in traditional roles of gender and sexuality and marriage.  That's the irony here. Yes I think some elite like university type feminists have gained a little bit.

1x6rbyhc	Well, most bugs in games come from predominantly female teams, so there's that.  Lower standards for joining campus, does in fact mean subpar abilities. Statistics are exactly what I'm using here. The High School exam is a standardized test to determine where students land in the bell curve in question. Therefore, unless you're claiming that women are lower intelligence lifeform compared to men, setting a lower standard/bar for them is favoritism (this is a fact). Based on this, it is logical to say they have sub par abilities. There are not more boys, not in the world, not is school...heck, there's no species with more males than females. So your statement: "If the standards are lower that doesn‚Äôt imply subpar abilities it just implies that standards are higher for males because there‚Äôs simply more of them." Makes absolutely no sense, not statistically, not quintessentially.  To say that the scores for women are adequate, is frankly just an insult to the collective intelligence of men. They're not adequate, they are sub par, the par here set by thousands of years of male engineers, and decades of effective computer coding standards.  This sub par standard of admission, is a product of the gynocentric project, a product of feminism. I stand firmly against it, not just because I utterly abhor feminism, but because the logic of opposing it, is sound. Gynocentrism has no place in a civilisation seeking to progress itself. If you want all individuals to be equal, then equal standards must be applied to all of them. This is not a question of gender politics, it is a question of the very purpose of learning institutions. If the standard for joining school, is feminized, then all men might as well forego school, and take apprenticeship opportunities with fellow men. Otherwise, schools, and learning institutions must be kept fair.  You, my dude, have lost perspective, on the purpose of this forum. Even worse, you have lost perspective on the actual purpose of tertiary learning institutions.	1641110894.0	hqwvnyc	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqkthrz	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwvnyc/
3sl19poy	Bell curves are skewed by higher populations so if there are more men that enter the field, the standard has to be higher to put the bell curve back in the middle. It‚Äôs like the economic concept that in order to get more companies entering into perfect competition, the prices for the product have to lower. That doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs lower quality, it just means that there‚Äôs shortage. Also where is your source that most bugs come from female teams? If you would link me the article that you‚Äôve read that or where you found your proof then I‚Äôd like that. Also yes, statistically more males enter stem subjects than females just because more women exist does not mean that there are more of them entering stem. You even conceded to the fact that for decades, engineering and computer science has been male dominated so of course there are more men entering stem.	1641111447.0	hqwwdbm	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwvnyc	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwwdbm/

Clementine Ford is the epitome of classic feminism. She is a misandristic and misogynistic refuse dump of animated hatred.  She is a hypocrite and a cunt of the highest order. The fact that she is a woman means absolutely nothing to me. I'd say the exact same words if Clementine Ford was actually Clayton Ford.  I made a post 8 months ago [where she excused women who commit infanticide as victims of depression and of men being the abusive monsters that drove them to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/n05se9/famous_and_prominent_australian_feminist_believes/).  She finished with the assertion that **ALL INFANTICIDE IS A PROBLEM DUE TO MEN.**  A sincere message from all men and women with any sense and with any compassion to Clementine Ford, should she ever read this:  # FUCK YOU.	1641113474.0	hqwywg9	t3_ru3a6d	t1_hqwukl0	/r/antifeminists/comments/ru3a6d/what_are_your_thoughts_on_australian_feminist/hqwywg9/
1x6rbyhc	You do realize that here the discussion is about joining campus, not choosing a course. Even then, standardization is not something to be pushed around to favour the intellectual capacity of anyone. Wanna join stem? Get the grades, this is not sport, you don't shorten the metre so women can be taller. Also, an economic concept, is not an economic fact. If a company wants to compete, in a free market, you let the market decide.  The regulation of pricing are not for the benefit of the company, they're for the benefit of the consumers (citizens). In the same regard, it is deplorable, that because of the whining of some people (feminists), consumers get sub par people working on their products. Bug ridden games and apps, with horrid stories an UXs. Badly edited CGI in films, with an inexistent entertainment value. Faulty phones that explode on charge, because someone though it looks good with the battery fitting the frame. Range rovers with neither range nor rove, that also have a terribly "small" driving experience. Ineffective governments, with leaders who cannot think with their heads. A global society of "the learned" populated with PhD holders, good...except the PhD is in online sexual harassment and other such majors. A civilization of people afraid to say what they truly think about things, because some wide hipped apes, have a tendency to brigade them out of their freedom of speech. A legal system, built to favour certain people, in every possible way; just because they have more holes. Thus stands the matriarchist planet, engulfed in abject terror, choked by the silicone tits of the neo-fascists; the feminists. Yeah, gynocentrism really improved the world, huh?  As for the article, I'll look for it when I find time to do that. For now, I think I'll take a break from this, before I get too frustrated by your lack of perspective.	1641113606.0	hqwz2it	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwwdbm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwz2it/
3sl19poy	Okay but you hinted that you went to this school that the commenter was talking about. What school is that exactly where they have the set of parameters? Besides I didn‚Äôt say it was pushing the intellectual capacity in favor of anyone, it‚Äôs pushing the population capacity. Besides economic concepts are economic facts? The entire definition of an economy is classified as a concept. If I said economic theory that would be different. Besides, until you could provide proof of what you‚Äôre claiming, it‚Äôs really not fact, just an emotional assertion that you have. Besides, I‚Äôm pretty sure history has a more in depth complex history of women being beaten into sexual slavery and denied basic human rights, so I‚Äôm sorry that equality looks like oppression to you but that‚Äôs your prerogative	1641114138.0	hqwzq65	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwz2it	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwzq65/

d1l8v4fn	I think a lot of us *just want to be happy*, atleast that's what I want. Life really gets you down sometimes, it gets your mind going through all sorts of things - how you got here, people that've wronged you in the past, people that are still wronging people in the current day, opportunities you've missed or messed up somehow. It's important not to lash out like a wild beast, saying the worst most vile things you can think of in an attempt to damage anyone reading what you wrote, this achieves nothing. When I was a little kid my mother used to say " If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all ". I've had women come after me on dating apps, matching with me just to send me an essay on why I'm a bad person or how I'm not doing enough. One has tried to get me fired from my job before, another young woman from a dating app has an Instagram account she uses to advertise her Onlyfans, on said Instagram she posts all the profiles of men she takes issue with, basically just venting her frustrations with any feature she took issue with, problem is she was doing it on a public space. I've had one of my cars keyed for turning down a date with a woman. All I was ever looking for really was happiness, someone to commit to long term, but I found a lot of hate and manipulation along the way. Now I'm indifferent to it/them, I can't relate to their way of thinking.	1641114672.0	hqx0dvg	t3_rta2xb	t1_hqtbpf2	/r/antifeminists/comments/rta2xb/what_are_the_rules_for_this_sub_and_are_females/hqx0dvg/

Data also shows that we are more likely to abuse children than men.  Data also shows that women are more likely to murder their own child, and more likely again if that child is a daughter.   Rape of women by men is a horrendous crime, nobody, in any Western culture supports or endorses it against women, it's also been falling consistently since the 1980s as a crime everywhere.   On the other hand child murder, child abuse, child sex trafficking by women as a crime has been increasing globally since the 1980s.

awg1ag7s	I'm especially interested in the area of violent crime victims. How do women get off saying that they're scared to walk down the street out of fear of being raped yet men never complain about being scared of being murdered, assaulted or robbed. Men make up the majority of victims of violent crime so shouldn't we be more scared. My theory is that women are conditioned to be scared. They're only scared because it's fuelled by the media with bullshit like 97%. Mass hysteria you could describe it as. The Sarah Everard case didn't help, with the media fuelling the hysteria.	1641128122.0	hqxh3t5	t3_rsmsmq	t3_rsmsmq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsmsmq/feminism_was_broken_from_the_start/hqxh3t5/

The study was a self identification study, the terms applied to what counts as rape were so loose as being looked at by a man would constitute being raped.   The study itself in its wider context was meant to show the links between men's behaviour and outcomes leading to rape but it just made people who claim rape culture look mentally unstable.

In fact, there are only two. And you wake up after the first one does. By the time that you have woken up, the other survivor in this plane has claimed all of the coconuts on all of the coconut trees, stacked them on their piles, sheltered that pile from all the wreckage from the plane, declared they own it, and they say that they would be willing to give you said coconuts if you throat their cock.

77o6a7cx	If you want to take it literally and assume what she means, then I can too. And what I got from it is, a lot of men don't know how to humble themselves when getting attention they've never recieved before. To me beauty is in the eyes of the beholder so who is anyone to classify a whole group of people as ugly? Which also makes me question why you're okay with classifying a whole group of people as ugly. You can accuse her of being judgemental, you can even bash her for the way she worded it, but the way I see it she's not wrong.	1641160532.0	hqzm9kw	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzky5x	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzm9kw/

evsusrl	I'm not okay with classifying a whole group of people as ANYTHING, other than people.  Okay. What if we flipped it?   Would giving an ugly woman a chance make her so conceited that she thinks she rules the world? I can absolutely guarantee you that Eilish would say no; that means she's implying only men would exhibit this behavior...  But, since that's hypothetical I'll go with EXACTLY what she said and exactly what you said.     "Give an ugly guy a chance and he thinks he rules the world"  For argument sake, let's categorize men into "Ugly" and "Not Ugly". (This is obviously not the case, as I agree with what you stated in "beauty is in the eye of the beholder")   This implies that all "Ugly" men are inherently so low self esteem (like your ex), that if given a chance (Note- she simply said "given a chance", not any sort of specific chance) they will now be so conceited to "think they rule the world".   So what does this mean of "Not Ugly" men? Are Not Ugly men impervious to this conceit? Are they so used to being treated nicely that they don't have that conceit?  As you said, your ex had low self esteem and turned out to be a cheater. So was he Ugly? Or did he just have low self esteem? Or both? Because I know plenty of men that are handsome as fuck and have low self esteem.   In your own words, beauty is in the eye of the beholder... Okay, so that means literally any and all men can be put into the Ugly category, since it's subjective, meaning that any and all men have that in them to become so conceited they think they rule the world.   So are ALL men just waiting for "chance" so they can feel like king of the universe, or is that only the ugly ones?   She throughout a blanket statement over men, not people. This is a sexist statement. You agreed with her argument, because of your anecdotal experience with ONE man.   Perhaps I'm looking too far into it (I did write a novel lol), but do you really not see how this could easily be denigrating all men, implying men are so easily corruptible that as long they are ugly, they can be convinced they are "ruler of the world"?   Sorry about all the downvotes, if you even care lol.   I hope you reply, I'm genuinely curious about your take.	1641162137.0	hqzqe39	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzm9kw	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzqe39/

77o6a7cx	I do see what you mean. People who want to take the word ugly and adhere it to people who don't fit the societal norms is horribly judgemental and wrong. The way she worded it was horrible. As I see it, is the way I worded it. If you give someone whose not used to good attention and gain a lot of it at once, they aren't gonna know how to act, now mix that with an abundance of confidence and testosterone... Not to say if the roles were reversed an equivalent wouldn't happen, but usually the equivalent would be something like "the hoe phase". I do see the blanket statements though, usually blanket statements are horrible but from my own personal expirience, it is very much true except for the use of the word ugly. It's more about the attention or lack there of, then looks.	1641163733.0	hqzui2p	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzqe39	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzui2p/

evsusrl	Ah, I can see what you're saying as well, though I do have the complete opposite experience.   The thing is, I've experienced something similar with women multiple times, even to the point of being abused. (After the giving of a "chance", although I hate looking at it that way), but I would never ever agree with someone saying something like Ellish did, about men or women, or anyone for that matter. I find it despicable frankly.   She's said many other sexist and denigrating things that absolutely DO apply to all men, so perhaps I'm letting bias affect my view. It's entirely possible.   With that said, I can agree with most of your argument. I appreciate your reply.	1641164370.0	hqzw48j	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzui2p	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzw48j/

If I had remembered before commenting some of the shitty things she's been saying I probably would have had the same thoughts as you, but when I saw this, my first thought was when you give someone something they're not used to, they're not gonna know what to do with it and it's about a 50/50 chance they're gonna abuse it.	1641164795.0	hqzx72a	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzw48j	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzx72a/

But now I think that's a good thing. I still find women amazing . But I am willing to be with one now ? I don't know... For example something very stupid,I can't picture a woman cooking for me . It seems weird but that's my case . There also things I can't picture,holding hands , kissing, hug . I simply can't picture myself having these moment with a woman .

tffxn	I am huge anti-feminist in terms of wester culture, but this smell little bit, it is pretty much generalization and it is false information. Many people generally like confident people, maybe people who are little bit intimidating, because that is what "confidence" and "dominance" mean in the most basic meaning. The other things come around and said ladies do not know any difference between the positive and negative way of said terms. You know the truth when they say "I can not find any good guy" and similar things, when it is all about abuse..you know.      And this has nothing to do with feminism. Many ladies are feminist, but I do not really know the term? Passive feminist? Like those who preach stuff but act the whole different way.     And that is why I am saying it, that sub is the wrong place to ask, because most of those ladies are maybe feminist, by the definition, but really are just passive ones for the social and internet karma, nothing else.	1641168899.0	hr07hzx	t3_rsvbv7	t3_rsvbv7	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hr07hzx/

They put their signs up, you follow traffic and follow the signs and deal with it yourself. Plus most construction nowadays is done by machines and equipment anyways.

But if there's a person who is crying about being discriminated against, but only does the easy job, then I 100% think negatively of them.   And guess what, I am right. Because as you know, the most dangerous and difficult jobs are all done by men. Where are the feminists who campaign for "more women in Garbage collection, coal mining, construction, plumbing, electrician, etc"?

6dr1ijt7	If you have equality in your marriage, it means you both have an individualistic mindset.  Essentially, turning it into a transaction where each person needs to do a defined set of household chores or other duties to balance things 50/50.  (And even then one could argue that it still isn‚Äôt ‚Äúequal‚Äù in their mind and create conflict.)   Women also tend to get spousal support if they are earning less so basically she gets to rob her ex-roommate/husband.   As a man, if you‚Äôre smart you‚Äôll find a woman who will let you take the lead, respects your authority, will do the household chores without being told to do so (you can help occasionally and do the more physically intensive tasks) and sees you as family instead of a roommate.	1641187395.0	hr1dgs0	t3_rurutr	t1_hr1a3hl	/r/antifeminists/comments/rurutr/anti_feminism_should_be_about_equality_not_about/hr1dgs0/

1x6rbyhc	Equality is having the same standard for both. Different standards are a hallmark of favoritism. There's no history of women being beaten into sexual slavery and denied basic human rights. In fact for the 50,000 years of sapient humans being in existence, women have had far more "rights" than men. The whole weaker sex system, is meant to ensure the protection of women. Men have always been seen as tools, and if your mindset is anything to go by, I'd say that's not going to change. What I have stated are lived experiences, and are facts. This is an set of logical sequences, not emotional assertions. Economic concepts are not facts, the very term "concept" shows this.  What you have continuously attempted to deny, is the fact that the lower standards for women to join tertiary learning institutions is an illustration of gynocentrism, and a result of feminism. You have also denied and attempted to justify the result of this (sub par labor-force). This attempt to misdirect the core subject with nonsensical illustrations, concert tickets and such, is rather pointless. I have alluded to experiencing a similar system, not the exact same.   I think you know that a lower standard illustrates gynocentrism. You are thus attempting, like all feminists, to justify it and beatify it. You have lost the plot here, and in doing so proven what everyone knows. Feminism stops, when true equality is demanded. The statistical evidence, the real-life experiences and the logical sequences; have displayed the nude favoritism that feminists, and indeed women want. It's nothing new, 50,000 years of evolution (cultural) has made you what you are. Accept the facts, and quit trying to mould the data into something it's not.	1641199534.0	hr1vo5o	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwzq65	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1vo5o/

I‚Äôm sorry my dear but the list goes on. Also you‚Äôre claiming your undeniable logic, but you keep failing to provide sources for what you‚Äôre referencing. I‚Äôve got sources on hand. I hate to break it you but logic isn‚Äôt subjective. Plus, all I‚Äôm doing is illustrating the population statistics example of demand curve. Let‚Äôs apply it to a different group of people then. You being from Kenya, know that there are many brilliant students there that go to study abroad in America, but not as many of them apply to American colleges as Americans do, so in order to ensure that more of the exchange student population gets into these American schools, they make the test score standards for Americans slightly higher so that less of them get in.	1641200083.0	hr1wd3e	t3_rix4o6	t1_hr1vo5o	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1wd3e/

1x6rbyhc	Articles and data in the UNWomen.org forums is international. Sourcing the information therein, shows that this lowering of standard to ensure women join campus; is indeed an international phenomenon. What this essentially means, is that the global population of educated women, is only as such, because of gynocentrism, not because they actually put in the work. The said uneven distribution, is not because women did not have the right to join campus, it's because they want the benefits without the work.  A lowering of standards for women is one thing, but increasing standards so that less men join is another. And it happens. The reasoning I have received from education stakeholders, is that there's "not enough space." Essentially, giving away places to women, while ensuring boys do not have equal access to education. This is feminism, this is women, this is the gynocentric dogma. IT's fine to increase the standards, it just means smarter men. But to go and also attempt to push the same gynocentrism to companies, that's an overreach (guess it comes with having an ovary each).  Furthermore, placement in American colleges does actually have "equality" quotas. I find it weird that you would attempt to defend this by simply omitting facts that are available online. Of course, America is very broken country, so I expected such idiocy to exist there. Problem is when it's the entire planet playing gynocentric simp, that's a disaster waiting to happen.	1641200388.0	hr1wqo1	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwzxln	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1wqo1/

3sl19poy	No I said the placement system that you referenced does not take place on an international basis first of all. In most American schools, placement exams only exist using what you‚Äôve applied to. That‚Äôs what I was saying doesn‚Äôt exist on an international basis. Sorry you misunderstood. Also do you mind linking me these specific articles and data? You also say that men aren‚Äôt having equal access to education when computer science is offered at 86% of American schools including on the two year levels and certificate levels, so no the access to education is still equal. When did I ever say women did not have the right to join the campus by the way? That is not what I said, I just said that there are less women that want to join the campus than men, that‚Äôs what a skewed bell curve is caused by.

5bz207z4	I don't think that's the case, yes I agree when the economy broke in 2008 we saw an explosion in blame, there were in fact hardly any news reports related to race and then in 2008 the news media owned and controlled by the wealthy pushed a narrative of hate towards race and towards men in general.   So yes I agree with you on that point, I am not so in agreement that fixing the economy is the answer to the underlying issue.   I think then in reality the news cycle gave rise and vent to the massive undercurrent of hidden hatred towards men and traditional women and traditional values and I don't think that's going to go away, even fixing the economy isn't going to push these things back to the fringe because they have become too mainstream for too long.   Certainly long enough for the general public to accept this is the way it is.   I think in reality the only thing that will stop it is women themselves, of course that's asking women to speak up for men, yes and it's about time, those women who enjoy men, those women who want men must speak up and shit down those who demonise all for behaviour of a few, men speaking up get silenced because it's an easy win for feminists to do, they are nothing if not willing to take the easy win, however it's much harder for them to take down a woman, to have a woman who they claim to speak for speaking against them.  As men we have to remember one of our greatest weaknesses is to try to fix things, to fix an issue whenever a woman says something is a problem, that's has been used against us for too long, the problem is that we cannot fix the brainwashing that happens to feminists, many are openly mentally unstable and claim that being with other openly mentally unstable people and targeting their hate towards others helps them. They have already made up their mind about men, we have a penis and balls, or maybe not depending on your viewpoint, but we are men and by nature of being men we are warmongers and rapists and no amount of truth or facts will change their views, that they benefit from and openly enjoy benevolent sexism and do not see the hypocrisy is irrelevant.   It's not them who we need to change but those who's views are open to change, that is usually those who are listening, undecided, that's where good women speaking up can make the difference because try as we might speaking up does nothing but get us shut down.  The end result though is always going to be a race to the bottom, too many women enjoy men and enjoy the collective of feminism, too many enjoy the benefits of benevolent sexism and enjoy the sense of belonging to a group calling themselves feminists who will not speak up but at the same time will claim they actually don't hate men.   Then of course there are the women who don't hate men just some of the things some men do, goes the same for some women, they will not speak up because they believe their views are irrelevant, inconsequential and don't want to face the accusations of being a pick me.  Eventually the squeaky wheel gets the grease and these women will lose out, data shows its already begun to happen and will get worse, when it crosses that tipping point who will they have to blame, you guessed it.	1642515840.0	ht6gkeb	t3_s5kzpp	t1_ht69ut5	/r/antifeminists/comments/s5kzpp/i_cringed_so_hard_after_seeing_this_shit/ht6gkeb/

cuje14s5	Yes, feminists love to say mysoginy and the patriarchy hurts both sexes. Thats their fallback after you list all men's issues. So now the feminist goal is to dismantle the patriarchy all over the globe.  The issue is, the patriarchy didn't actually exist. They're chasing a Ghost. But they think they're fighting the good fight. They dont realize they're creating more tension and more issues with their movement. Because "how could feminism be wrong, its about equality".   No miss, this kind of thinking is authoritarian and borderline fascistic.	1642520557.0	ht6s0vp	t3_s70461	t3_s70461	/r/antifeminists/comments/s70461/argument_against_societal_norms_cause_the_wage_gap/ht6s0vp/

737crz7b	I have been speaking about this for years. About 30 years ago I attended a state university in NJ that has a women‚Äôs college (can you imagine a state university that uses taxpayer dollars having a male college?) and I dated a woman who was an RA at one of the dorms. One afternoon I was visiting her and some young women came in with a concern. The first-year students had to take a mandatory women‚Äôs studies class and the professor told them that if they wanted to be feminists they had to be lesbians. These women wanted to be feminists but they were heterosexual and didn‚Äôt want to eat at the Y. I stayed quiet but, when asked my opinion, I suggested that they complain to the department chair and the dean because that wasn‚Äôt education‚Ä¶it was indoctrination. This is when I started to look around and realized that the feminist movement wasn‚Äôt only anti-men it was also anti-heterosexual.   Straight women who allowed lesbians into the feminist movement assumed that they had something in common because they were all women. What they didn‚Äôt realize was that the two groups had completely different experiences when it comes to men. Straight women wanted to improve their relationships with men while lesbians wanted to replace men. To that end, lesbians acted just like men do when they want to take a woman away from their man‚Ä¶.they listen to their complaints, show sympathy, offer a shoulder to cry on, provide tokens of affection, etc. Straight women see this coming when it‚Äôs done by men but they don‚Äôt see that they‚Äôre being seduced when lesbians are doing it.	1642521442.0	ht6ucbe	t3_s6tfla	t1_ht5tgdh	/r/antifeminists/comments/s6tfla/what_proportion_of_feminist_ideology_is_pushed_by/ht6ucbe/

cuje14s5	Look into the John Money experiment. Look into more egalitarian societies (like Sweden) and what occupations do the 2 genders occupy. Ask the hard question: why are feminists obsessed with occupations with power? Why dont they seek equal representation on all levels of workforce? Why dont they seek equal representation in electricians or plumbers?  Because they dont seek equality. They dont do that for the same reason they never bring up any men's issues. Feminists dont work for equality. They work for superiority. Dont let them talk with their words. Look at their actions and those actions will speak for themselves.	1642522209.0	ht6wbol	t3_s70461	t1_ht6uxw8	/r/antifeminists/comments/s70461/argument_against_societal_norms_cause_the_wage_gap/ht6wbol/

dmwlt5jl	You're forgetting an essential element, a lot of physical labor employers flat out refuse to hire women (even if they have an outstanding resume in the field), mock and discourage them from continuing their application, and even when they get these jobs, they are often mocked or treated differently, they are given lesser roles because they aren't seen as 'capable'.  Feminist are and have been fighting for women in those workforces. Only to be told that's 'not where women belong, what did you expect'  You want more women in these fields? Help stop the stigma around them not being women's jobs. Advocate for the women already in those fields, advocate for women trying to get into those fields, let employers know that women are just as capable, speak out against the hostility that is directed towards those women.  If you're not contributing to making an environment with less stigma and bias around the job then you're part of the problem.

dmwlt5jl	No it's health care in the way that they are sometimes required for certain surgeries, it's required to be on other medications (like acutane, sometimes treatments for other diseases), they are used to treat many different conditions, diseases, and issues.   Acne, endometriosis, cysts, cancer, I could go on.  And sometimes it is just used to prevent pregnancy and that's ok too. Because for some people pregnancy is life threatening, there are a million situations and all of them are health care.   It's not equivalent to lip fillers because that is a surgery purely for cosmetic reasons with no health intentions behind it. It's optional the way that an inhaler is optional. For some people it's the difference between life and death, and for some people it just makes life a little more comfortable, and there's a whole range of reasons and reactions between those two.	1642695620.0	hth39bm	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hth1qjd	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hth39bm/

dmwlt5jl	Yeah you can feel however you want about that it's a tricky topic,  Bottom line is people are going to do what they feel is best for themselves, and birth control isnt some secret feminist plot to hate on men.

Nevermind.  But yeah, don't waste time in making these Feminists learn.  For example, I did try, and got doxxed on all Indian Feminist subreddits instead, also got falsely accused for some matter (one of my post summarizes the situation)  Also even on an Exam related fun subreddit I just said Feminists are bad, whole Feminist woke gang started bashing me, the mod banned me and deleted my comments, and them ?

35c0i	Then why don't they give similar the healthcare to men rather than push sexist legislation?  Lets look at what they did in Obamacare around this area...  https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/  All women's birth control including tubal ligation, female condoms, IUDs, etc are free by federal law. As you can see, vasectomy, male condoms, and any future male pill or vasogel is explicitly not covered.  We opted for the safer, simpler, more reliable, lower cost, lower risk of complications vasectomy. It cost us a $1k deductible, while my wife could have gotten a riskier, more complicated, less reliable, higher cost, higher risk of complications tubal for free. IMO that is discrimination against men and forces reproductive responsibilities onto women in families of lessor means. No one cares about men, but women may be heard on that second point.  https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/  Preventive care coverage also has three categories. Adult, women, and children.  Domestic violence screening, STD testing, and smoking cessation programs are free for women, not adults. There are free cancer screenings for women (PAP, mammogram), but none for prostate cancer (PSA).  If states have mandated that insurance plans cover vasectomy or PSA without a copay, you can no longer get a high deductible plan in compliance with both state and federal law in 2021 because vasectomies/PSA cannot be considered free preventive care like tubals/mammogram/PAP.  See:  https://www.apbenefitadvisors.com/2018/03/08/irs-vasectomies-are-not-aca-preventive-care/  https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/irs-transition-rule-hsas-male-contraception.aspx	1642696962.0	hth6wed	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hth1dv2	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hth6wed/

5n5yiqb1	It irks me how.words have seemingly lost their original meaning.  Feminism was not this idea that one gender deserves more privilege than another gender.  It was about having the same platform to climb from.  Same rights, same consequences, same opportunities.  Equal treatment and equal footing.  The thought that a movement of equality is now a movement turning into anything but equality is horrible   I would love to see the real feminists of this world reclaim that word and bring it back to what it was meant to be.  I'm all for equality across any group of people, but the shit I see these days is not that.	1642697633.0	hth8qdi	t3_s8lkd8	t3_s8lkd8	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/hth8qdi/

Personal experience: a family friend was in a SUPER abusive marriage. Her husband was one of like 5 of the small town police officers. She was pretty stuck. She ended up pregnant. He told her "get an abortion, or I beat it out of you". In that case getting the abortion was the best thing she could do for her own safety.

e6yjqcmd	Give her my time and resources upon knowing that she's a feminist? Over my dead body sir! And marriage? Now that's funny sire.  But in all seriousness, the problem is that a whole lot of modern women are chameleons in this regard. The deceit, the subterfuge, the dishonesty, that's what you better look out for. They can say just about everything that you would want to hear before marriage, then the true color would be revealed.  That's why dear Men, and this is advice from a prominent public figure who actually cares about Men: Close your eyes. Close your ears. Just look at the actions of women. What they do or did, the choices they made, how they're moving through life. You'll have a pretty (or not) clear picture of the woman you're dealing with.

We never do it back through, we respect women (only the good ones) with respect  You as a feminist might have got my respect, but you are a troll, I have seen enough of your comments since months...

5x9r4ntn	Do you mean the left-wing ones that abandon liberty at the first sight of it being a hinderance? Or the ones that until recently were considered far-right, and actually upheld the values of liberty? If you read about the second ones they were one of those groups that the left was created to oppose, and have a completely different philosophical framework that rejects Rousseau in favour of Locke. Evidence agrees with Locke, and he has been the inspiration by US Republicans used to fight a US democrat enacted set of laws known as "Jim Crow Laws".  That is the same tactic as feminists saying that they are the women's rights movement, when they actually hindered it.   The critical flaw is upstream so arguing which proven liars are the good guys, when we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that none of them are is pointless.	1642700333.0	hthg9s0	t3_s8370g	t1_htgvw8e	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8370g/proof_feminists_dont_actually_care_about_women/hthg9s0/

9l7rdcfg	If a woman desires to show more body parts in public, then surely she is trying to look sexy and therefore wants sex (And not with her boyfriend if she's going to a party like that). A dress like that is fine for in the house to impress your partner, but presenting yourself in front of others dressed like that really shows you have no dedication to your partner and want sexual attention from others. Think about it. You know I'm right.

dmwlt5jl	Ok I just assumed that "The South" was pretty commonly used to refer to the southern part of usa as I have seen many people in and out of America refer to it that way and I assumed you would infer what I meant (which you did). So I apologize.   My intelligence is just fine thank you. I had a full ride academic scholarship and am a fully functioning adult, but that aside I don't really understand what good insulting my intelligence does, especially since you were accusing me of using personal attacks.   If you obsessively read my comments as much as you say you do then you'd see that I also support men's rights. I have spoken out for and done a lot of action involving men's rights. I have researched and written papers getting to the root of many of those issues.   I have never spoken against men's rights, I have only spoken for men and women's rights to be side by side.   >We never do it back through, we respect women (only the good ones) with respect  This is very easy to prove false. I see sexist trolls every day, this isn't special occurrence. You literally made an entire post just to dox me lol. I see all men as inherently good and all women as inherently good. It's not for me to decide who is good and bad, who has value and who doesn't. I make it my goal to treat everyone with respect unless they have done something specifically to disrespect me, then I will stand up for myself.  I will continue to stand up for the things near and dear to my heart, but I will never hate men just for being men nor would I hinder any progress towards men's rights. I will however continue to stand up for my own rights and my own philosophy that I have based on my beliefs and ideas and persona experience.   I hope you genuinely put work into trying to make the world a good place.  Peace out.	1642700876.0	hthhrrg	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hthemff	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hthhrrg/

(I guess not STEM, of yes, then nice)  And well, In India, most University/College seats in STEM are taken with MERIT and HARDWORK (All India Ranks) by Men, the women don't, although they themselves choose not to take up STEM  Yet wanna know what women get ? They get reserved seats in colleges... Even with lower ranks...  Some lower scoring girl snatches away the man's seat because of her gender  The society and politicians say this is to "equalize the number of both genders to give equal chance"  And now my question, what about fields where women are more and not men ? So men get the same vice versa ? NOPE.  Also in the west, 60% seats of college are taken by women... Tell me, now, do men get the same reservations ? No right ?  Why the hell there are special female laws which you goddamn people take as "rights" which is actually discrimination against boys ? Huh ?  Well typical Feminist  Fight when want something  But don't wanna give back anything if they have something in excess  Feminists want 3 things :  1. Power of a Man (without Merit and Hardwork btw lol)  2. Privilege of a Woman (Society and laws favour women worldwide, exceptions being terrorist countries)  3.

What goes under in this never ending debate of abortion is that it hands women ALL the rails and takes away all responsibility that falls on *just* them. Want to have sex? You can (accessibile casual sex)! Don't want to deal with the consequences? You don't have to (free access to abortion)!  When it comes to men though? You want to have sex? Weeell... risk of rape allegations, me-too fears, but yeah you can have sex. Don't want to deal with the consequences? Too bad for you, if she gets pregnant you're forced into fathering the child or paying child support, if you WANT to keep the baby, you can just hope she wants to keep it to because you have no say in her abortion.

Globally: In India people are protesting making marital rape illegal, let that sink in; letting women drive and have passports and travel in places like Saudi Arabia; gender targeted violence all around the world, especially bad in places like south America; genital mutilation; forced abortions; forced sterilization; "virginity tests"; female genital mutilation; disrespect within careers especially if they also have children; hiring bias; sexual violence; the ability to do things without a man's permission (ex: reproductive surgery, driving, passport); bias against women workers in the medical field; bias against women in manual labor jobs; not being taken seriously when it comes to health concerns; harmful stereotypes; lack of respect   >Well may I know which degree are you pursuing ? (I guess not STEM, of yes, then nice)  Why do you assume I'm not in a stem field? That seems like an unnecessary comment to add. I am pursuing a plant biology/botany degree with a focus in sustainability, environmental impact, and genetics.  >And well, In India, most University/College seats in STEM are taken with MERIT and HARDWORK  Are you assuming I haven't earned my place through Merit and hard work? I was selected among 50 people across the entire country based on my grades, community service, leadership involvement, ACT score, and application essay. From there we had a first round of interviews, where they selected 20 candidates to continue to interview to earn the scholarship. From there was another round of 10 interviews where they pick five people to give a full ride. I was one of five people who worked my ass off hard enough to be accepted. If you are insinuating I got my position because of anything other than my ability you are mistaken.   >Also in the west, 60% seats of college are taken by women... Tell me, now, do men get the same reservations ? No right ?  In the west more women apply to college and more men go straight to jobs right after highschool.  I agree that while all the reservations and whatnot had good intentions behind them, they aren't the way to promote equality and carry out the real necessary goal, which is encouraging more women in these fields and tearing down actual (very real ) barriers preventing them from doing so. But like I said I agree that this is not the way to do it. Bandaid over a bullet hole kind of solution that only harms everyone.  I want 3 things:  1) to be respected and seen as capable like a man is and to be given the same opportunities to put in the work  2)  to be not automatically deemed irrational for being a woman and to not have someone hate me just because of my gender  3) to be seen as an adult and to be treated like an intellectual equal who just shows up, does my job, and gets my shit done. I want to be seen as a freaking person because some people really truly don't view me that way.	1642703458.0	hthovrs	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hthjm2b	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hthovrs/

71v4lvfl	I would argue that men are more effected by rape. It's not really a contest though, but being told it doesn't effect men is just stupid. When your body enjoys something, but your mind is screaming kinda fucks ya up. Then there is being forced to do something by someone, it hurts your personal identity and is rather hard to recover from. I wouldn't know the effects on a women, but I can say it really fucks up a guy.   Then look at talking about it. Women at least have a support structure, and aren't constantly told how they are lucky it happened. Other men assume they would like it because for some reason everyone assumes it's a good looking women that you find attractive.   What about when a man is raped and a child if formed. The rapist has full control over that decision, and can then use you for child support. Even if you were a child when it happened. That won't cause any issues either right?	1642704314.0	hthr8g7	t3_s8h3vk	t3_s8h3vk	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8h3vk/the_vocal_minority/hthr8g7/

dmwlt5jl	One of the many reasons I went on birth control for a little bit was because I lived on a college campus. Break-ins were pretty frequent in my dorm/ campus. I lived next to a parking lot called 'rape alley'. I had late night classes and had to walk 20 minutes home in the dark. If something happened to me I wanted to be safe and know that I wouldn't have the burden to my health, education, and mental health that a child would be at that point in time. Shit happens, it's just looking out for myself. Point is, people don't always have sex willingly  >It's only health related with sex. No sex, no need for birth control  This is just not true people have so many reasons and uses beyond controlling birth even if they are average and healthy.  My roommate: is not sexually active and has never once been sexually active in her life. She's on birth control to regulate anxiety/ depression and they go with her medication for those, and ovarian cysts.  Her sister: on birth control for repeated problems with ovarian cysts  My friend: was required to go on birth control for a minor surgery  My roomate's friend: was on it prescribed by her dermatologist for acne medication  My other roommate: on it for regulating her periods/ acne/ to take with other medicine  These are all examples of normal healthy people who have been on it for many reasons and examples of why so many people do take this medication. It is health care. This isn't even taking into account the women who use it to treat cancers and many other diseases and ailments.   Even if it is to prevent pregnancy. Thats still health care. As I said I was on it for a bit and one of those reasons was to prevent pregnancy. I am in a long term happy relationship with someone I plan on having kids with in the future. We were not in a place to have kids, we had other important things in life to get through.   Some women literally need to be on birth control because a pregnancy would be dangerous or life threatening.   Many people are in relationships but aren't ready for kids. Family planning is health care. But sex is an important part of many healthy relationships, so to say just don't have sex wildly overlooks a lot of experiences.	1642704410.0	hthri8q	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hthleqg	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hthri8q/

ih121btv	>Then what the fuck is it?  Feminism is an ideology first. Consider the -ism. It is a set of theories about how society is constructed. This is what egalitarians, MRAs, and antifeminists oppose; their set of theories.  >Because last I checked it's about equality between all genders, and was created by women for women to achieve equality.  You do not use dictionaries to understand ideologies. It is not the purpose of a dictionary to teach you such things, to teach you sociology and theology. Its purpose is purely linguistic. You are looking for an accurate definition of feminism in the wrong places.  Wikipedia is also heavily biased in favour of feminism, a platform controlled and edited endlessly by feminists such that it gives readers nothing but a positive picture of feminism.  You do not learn about feminism from any dictionary, let alone a biased one, or an unreliable, corrupted website such as Wikipedia. You learn the true definition of feminism from feminist literature, discourse and advocacy written by its most celebrated theorists.  Feminism is not an ideology seeking 'equality'. All the feminist literature, discourse, advocacy from the late 1800s and early 1900s to the current day has mainly focused on hating men and infantilising women. Feminism is about hating men and infantilising women. This is the true, accurate and impartial, definition of feminism.  >And ngl we kinda need feminism especially if places like this sunreddit exist specifically to bash women and their beliefs.  No MRA or Anti-feminist will seek to hurt any women. They don't need to.

Said that only woman in politics can make a change, won't watch movies made by men, only by black woman.

You think being fucked in the ass by force wouldn't affect someone. Then you have then idea of sadistic women who could be rapists.

4wku7w	Which reminds me: lunch break at work with a colleague. Just chatting casually about politics, as we knew we had quite opposed views on many subjects. This feminist female  sits next to us and all of a sudden, when she heard me mentioning Jordan Peterson, starts screaming that he is a fascist and he enables incels. Oh, sorry little girl, but I'm not having it. So I start to ask her what exactly she knows about his work and what is the reason he thinks of him as a fascist.  I wasn't really in the mood, but since she wanted it... Challenge accepted. She tried to tell me how incels are dangerous but I kept asking her how is JP a fascist and how he enables them. After another sentence or two she got all red in her face, trembling and she told me full of hate that she doesn't want to talk about this fascist because it makes her feel ill. "Imagine how those poor bastards felt fighting real nazis". I retorted. And she got out of the room immediately.

5nwqhfks	Depends. Feminism has become such a broad umbrella that anyone can call themselves feminist, whether or not they fit to definition. This is purposeful on the part of the movement, basically you can‚Äôt fight something you can‚Äôt define, but I digress.   If a girl I was dating said she was a feminist, we would need to have a serious talk about what she believed and if she was open to hearing my view. Depending on the outcome of that talk, if she‚Äôs willing to hear me out and potentially be convinced, or if she can provide enough facts data and statistics to convince me I‚Äôm wrong, although I‚Äôve done lots of research, then she and I might continue dating. If she‚Äôs not open to discussion and dismisses my research and data, then out the door.   But feminism would immediately be a stop drop and roll moment for the relationship. Differences on such a fundamental level lead to relationship failure if not immediately addressed.	1642710092.0	hti5r8g	t3_s8ka0o	t3_s8ka0o	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8ka0o/would_you_guys_still_marry_a_female_if_you_found/hti5r8g/

There was a case about an I think 11 year old girl who was raped and had to carry the baby to term (causing extreme psychological and physical damage to her reproductive system because that's what happens when children are forced to carry a child that young) because she would have had to have the permission of her rapist to have the procedure.  It's not fair for anyone to be legally tied to their rapist for the rest of their life.  So when things like that are allowed to happen.

3bxjt84	You‚Äôre implying that men and women‚Äôs bodies are equally sexualised, when that‚Äôs just blatantly false. Women are by FAR objectified way way way more than men are. Even when mens bodies are objectified, it‚Äôs not even for women but other men - eg. Marvel movies, the big muscular superhero physique is there for other men because it‚Äôs the male ideal body type, not for women to lust over. Most women aren‚Äôt attracted to that at all, and are more often attracted to men‚Äôs personalities and lust over men like mr darcy or other literary men who are romantic, caring and kind. This is obviously way different to how women are objectified EVERYWHERE we look, and it‚Äôs purely for the pleasure of men. For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve seen naked women‚Äôs bodies used for decoration, but not the same thing with men. Surely you can recognise that this problem of objectification is VERY one sided ?	1642713093.0	htidudo	t3_s7gvb2	t1_htgc8kk	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7gvb2/i_say_a_what_yall_say/htidudo/

He said that she poly shamed him. The guy just has morals and knows perfectly that he should not mess with a taken person. And he had asked if he is on the wrong and if she has the right to be offended. I wanted to write him that she has no moral and no right to be offended. It was lousy by her side to offer herself to another when she's in a relationship. But the post got removed and comments were locked. What the hell is wrong with that sub? The guy didn't violate anything. And he got banned for sharing that he refused sex with a married woman?

She was not on birth control. She later admitted to him that she just wanted to have a baby and didn't care who it was with.

9nq1	Allow me to make this simple for you.   You want something from me. Specifically, you want me to change my opinion about something. You don't know what my actual opinion is, because you haven't bothered to ask, but you think you know it, and you want me to change it.   I don't want anything from you. I don't care if you change your opinion about anything or not.   So, if you want something from me, but I don't want anything from you, how exactly are we supposed to make a deal? I'm not going to give you something for nothing.   You could, I suppose find something you have that I want, and offer it to me, but you don't know what I want, and I don't know what you have to offer. So that would take some figuring out.

djxsshev	There is evidence of the mods on that sub being traditionalists and not actually interested in furthering or supporting men's rights.     This explains why they have for so long allowed feminist and tradcon trolls to come in and harass any men's rights activist posters, ban MRAs that speak out against such trolls, and retroactively remove posts that go against a traditionalist agenda:     [https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro\_Male\_Collective/comments/qhxoqa/misandrist\_bigots\_that\_lie\_about\_selective/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro_Male_Collective/comments/qhxoqa/misandrist_bigots_that_lie_about_selective/)   [https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro\_Male\_Collective/comments/qbg2rf/exposing\_the\_rmensrights\_mods\_terrible\_behavior/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro_Male_Collective/comments/qbg2rf/exposing_the_rmensrights_mods_terrible_behavior/)  [https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro\_Male\_Collective/comments/rdmzju/posts\_like\_this\_being\_allowed\_on\_the\_rmensrights/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro_Male_Collective/comments/rdmzju/posts_like_this_being_allowed_on_the_rmensrights/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pro\_Male\_Collective/comments/ro55rq/theres\_no\_reason\_for\_rmensrights\_mods\_to\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pro_Male_Collective/comments/ro55rq/theres_no_reason_for_rmensrights_mods_to_be/)  [https://np.reddit.com/r/Advancing\_Male\_Rights/comments/rpz3rp/clearest\_evidence\_yet\_of\_rmensrights\_mods\_being/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advancing_Male_Rights/comments/rpz3rp/clearest_evidence_yet_of_rmensrights_mods_being/)  [https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro\_Male\_Collective/comments/s5xmq9/rmensrights\_mods\_remove\_post\_while\_allowing/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Pro_Male_Collective/comments/s5xmq9/rmensrights_mods_remove_post_while_allowing/)     Unfortunately, r/mensrights is the biggest men's rights activist sub. This can change, but it will require MRAs realize r/mensrights mods aren't serious about men's rights activism and them making their own subs to compete with the sub.     While that sub has pretended to support free speech, it removes the comments of and bans members that speak out against trolls or hijacking of discussion topics, demanding that all posters take the higher ground no matter what. Obviously the men's rights movement and its subs are going to be ineffective with such an approach.	1642724859.0	htj5tvc	t3_s81vz7	t3_s81vz7	/r/antifeminists/comments/s81vz7/the_mensrights_sub_seems_to_be_turning_feminist/htj5tvc/

fnidh4yr	Feminism is about equality, and as a feminist we push for women to have choice. If a women wants to spend her life as home with kids and serve her husband, that‚Äôs fine if that‚Äôs her choice, but people just want to make sure that those women are aware that sometimes them making that choice is because of years of conditioning. There are some people who call them selves a feminist who will make you feel bad for that, but they aren‚Äôt really feminist if they don‚Äôt want all women to be able to live freely and safely with their own choice. But there is a big difference between between having an opinion and invalidating people lives. If your ‚Äúopinion‚Äù is that other women shouldn‚Äôt be able to do what they like, then thats not okay and of course people won‚Äôt be happy with that	1642730813.0	htjjmgs	t3_s8lkd8	t1_htjhs70	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/htjjmgs/

dmwlt5jl	Overall, no. I understand this probably sounds harsh, but from a constitutional standpoint it's a bad idea. This is a question that has been brought to court and was found to be unconstitutional. Like it sucks and I'm in support of being able to opt out of child support payments, but it violates the mother's rights to privacy and agency over her own medical decisions to have to have some one else's permission for her own healthcare choices. That's not a power that should be put over anyone, and the second you let that happen it goes down a slippery slope from there and it could continue to branch out further and further into violations of the mother's constitutional rights.  https://www.findlaw.com/family/paternity/fathers-rights-and-abortion.html	1642731348.0	htjkuix	t3_s8m6zb	t1_htjivzw	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htjkuix/
djxsshev	The posts I linked show evidence of the mods' traditionalist stances and agenda. It explains everything about how they act: from how they show leniency to trolls in the name of "free speech" (while banning those that speak out against those trolls), promote and pin traditionalist talking points, hold men to higher standards than women, retroactively remove posts that don't push a traditionalist outlook and ultimately discourage any real progress on equality for men if it goes against their concept of "masculinity". Traditionalists act exactly the same way.  It seems from the start, r/mensrights was a traditionalist forum masquerading as a men's rights forum. That IMO largely explains why it has made so little progress on men's rights and allowed others to come in and derail any MRA discussion.  You should check out the subs:  &#x200B;  pro\_male\_collective, promalestrategy, advancing\_male\_rights, pink\_pill\_watch, MenInMedia and NothowMRAswork for more effective MRA subs (also check their discords if they have any). While you may not be cheered for making generalizations about women like the ones you made in your screenshot, there is at least zero tolerance for trolls and anti MRA people that try to derail discussions on those subs, unlike on r/mensrights where such people are welcomed and allowed to hijack discussions.	1642731567.0	htjlcoy	t3_s81vz7	t1_htjg5u9	/r/antifeminists/comments/s81vz7/the_mensrights_sub_seems_to_be_turning_feminist/htjlcoy/

They will choose men they want for a casual hookup/FWB. They will choose men who will play the role as the lifestyle provider AKA the "safe guy".  They also have the man that acts as a therapist/relationship counselor, and the one they go to for quick, the backup guy, etc...  That's why they absolutely CANNOT STAND the absolutely fucking AUDACITY for a man to decide to have his own standards, or when he refuses to cooperate with the role he was designated.

I could not get the point through if you try to do something to benefit X, but it harms Y, that's not treating them equally, it's causing harm to one party to cause good.  That's literally unfair.    I was using this as a point to say focusing on what dead people did, and that has nothing to do with people now, to favor someone while it hurts the other is not how you go about achieving equality.  Absolute refusal to let go of the past.	1642744857.0	htkd0qr	t3_s8370g	t1_htfgz5i	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8370g/proof_feminists_dont_actually_care_about_women/htkd0qr/

I've never been oppressed for being a woman.

Not because disagreeing with the political opinion of others makes me cut them off, I view having different political viewpoints in my circle as a good thing, becoming an extremist starts when you isolate yourself. It helps me with viewing the world from other points.  But, when it comes to a partnership,as the one in which I am currently. I need to align with the other person politically. Your political opinion is usually a strong signal for the way you think and view the world. Meeting a radical feminist would end up in arguments incredibly often, I can't keep my mouth shut about political opinions I dislike, and as long as I am not proven wrong, I will gladly continue to argue. This would ofc lead to a very toxic relationship.  Then theres the option of meeting the, moderate feminist. "Not all feminists are like that" kind. Where I also wouldn't want to be a part of that relationship due to the way that person would view things. For example, the majority of these feminists would have their opinions based in emotional reasoning, instead of logical conclusions. Which isn't what I want, I wish to have a person that can match me in thinking. I disagree often with even moderate feminism. If the feminist possible partner is someone who is in the 1st or 2nd wave of Feminism, I would probably give it a try.  Currently, me and my partner both have a laundry list of reasons why we hate feminism. Ranging from issues of not enough attention being given to men's issues, to how this weakens our society militarily, or even the history of the 4th wave feminism which stems from a infiltration program by the USSR. I recommend looking up Yuri Bezmenov for more on that.  In summary, I wouldn't date a feminist, I need a person who can ideologically match me to be my partner.	1642746099.0	htkf438	t3_s8ka0o	t3_s8ka0o	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8ka0o/would_you_guys_still_marry_a_female_if_you_found/htkf438/

fvm6rs7n	It is relevant in a number of ways.         Before answering your question, I am going to throw some statistics at you that will I hope help start making the connection between feminism and Jews.   Jews make up roughly 2% of the population in the US. In the UK, they make up 0.2% of the population, in France its roughly 1%, etc. Despite making up insignificant minorities in all of these countries where feminism was born and constructed then spread across the globe, Jews form the majority of the founders, leaders and financiers of feminism.   Most of the founders of the feminist movement are Jewish; Betty Friedan, Robin Morgan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, Simone Veil etc. Jews also played an important role in the early women's movement e.g. the Jewish League for Women Suffrage. They played an operative role in injecting in feminism its anti-Christian sentiments.   All of the Marxist theorists who pushed the idea of feminism in the 1800s were Jewish, Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Mosses Hess. The founders of the feminist sexual revolution, that revolution that has spread sexual degeneracy across the globe using it as a weapon to enslave, exploit and dull populations, were Jewish. Wilhelm Reich and Sigmund Freud the godfathers of the feminist sexual revolution were both Jewish.   Most of the most anti-male, radical  feminists have been Jewish: Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Gayle Rubin, Elizabeth Gould Davis, Sally Miller Geaarhart etc. etc. etc.   There is clear correlation between Judaism and feminism, but what causes this correlation? Why, of all people, have Jews played a significant role in the formation and rise of the feminist movement?        The answer to this question is very simple.   Judaism is made up of many branches. The largest branches of Judaism are those of atheistic Jews (Jews that do not believe in God, but are born racially Jewish) and Reform Jews (Jews that believe in a liberal approach to interpreting Jewish texts.   Reform Judaism is the largest branch in Judaism. It is heavily influenced by Marxism, communism and feminism. Reform Judaism is essentially feminism in the form of a religion. They believe in and promote the exact same ideas and principles as those of feminists. They believe in and promote the feminist interpretation of patriarchy, they believe in and promote the idea that gender is a social construct, that men have throughout the ages oppressed women, that sexuality is a social construct, that abortion is a right, that there is nothing wrong with sex outside of marriage, that consumption and production of pornography is normal etc. etc. etc. Reform Judaism, the largest branch of Judaism in the world is feminism and feminism is Reform Judaism.          I must note here that Judaism is a dogma that is unconventional. I would not even call it a religion, but a racist ideology. Let me elaborate on this. In Judaism, you don't have to believe in Judaism to be considered a Jew. In Judaism, so long as you have a matrilineal Jewish lineage i.e. you are born to a Jewish mother (note that Judaism is extremely matriarchal. It is from Judaism that feminism borrows many of its anti-male theories surrounding sexuality and gender etc), you are considered a Jew. In Judaism, you are considered a Jew so long as you are racially Jewish, even if you reject Judaism. They also believe that they are God's chosen people. Combine their racialism and their belief that they are God's chosen people and they are rendered a racist ideology.         I have just touched briefly on this topic here. If anyone has any questions, ask. Note that I am in the middle of exams at the moment, so my replies might be delayed.

5x9r4ntn	It's an ego thing. It's very hard to admit that you supported a group that has never upheld the values they claimed to uphold. Very few people are willing to admit being wrong.  Same problem in politics: all left-wing movements are based on lies and delusional logic - hence will never have a profoundly benefitial outcome on a 1000+ people scale. Feminism is one of those.  If you want I can link to a comment of mine where I have references to neurological and psychological research pointing out that it is men's biological nature to care about women + a few other things (almost everything is open access). That points out that the entire premise that feminism is based on and "patriarchy theory" are abnormal from the point of biology hence cannot be applied to the vast majority of men.	1642747119.0	htkgq0e	t3_s8370g	t1_htkd0qr	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8370g/proof_feminists_dont_actually_care_about_women/htkgq0e/

Judaism by the admission of some of the highest Jewish authorities in the world has played an operative role in the rise and spread of feminism. Take icon of Judaism and Professor of Government Sandy Meisel as an example. In this following citation he notes that Jews have led the feminist movement in America from the 1970s onwards.        ‚ÄòFrom the early 1960s, Jews served as advisers, political operatives congressional staffers, ‚Äúidea men‚Äù and powers behind the throne. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Jews rose to political prominence in the civil rights and anti-Vietnams War movements. From the 1970s on, Jews led or were influential in most, though not all, of the political reform, feminist, consumer rights, gay rights, environmental and other public interest groups and related foundations and think tanks that came to dominate the Democratic Party.'

In Judaism, you are considered a Jew so long as you are racially Jewish, even if you reject Judaism. Most Jewish sects also believe that they are a chosen people. All also promote the concept of racial nepotism, a concept that renders them extremely tribalistic i.e. they work together, regardless of their beliefs, to push and promote their own racial interests. Combine their radicalistic views and nepotism with their belief that they are a chosen people and they are rendered a racially supremacist ideology.

In fact, I consider it dangerous, as it can "burn" professionals who get too involved into their service users issues.   However, I think it's important to understand people, especially those who live with me. So I was always interested to learn as much as possible about my partners. And use this knowledge to make them feel comfortable and valued in the relationship. And loved.   But, of course, there are a lot of women who prefer to play the victim card and complain that their partner doesn't understand them.

2b47v3o5	I have a son who is almost 2 years old. We all know what mothers go through during pregnancy and child birth. When my wife was pregnant, I made her food every day. She ordered pre-packaged meals meant to help the baby grow that I prepared 2 to 3 times daily for about 12 weeks. I looked after her when she was unwell. I did the groceries, cooking, house cleaning, dishes, etc. I gave her massages wherever she felt sore or just to help her relax. I did what I could to take the burden off her. All this while studying full time and working part time to make ends meet. It was physically and mentally exhausting, but I did what I had to do because that was ***my*** role.  I'm sure most men do this for their partners and it is almost always overlooked. All my female friends say "*she had to carry the baby so she has more rights*". I don't like this since it undermines my efforts. I didn't carry my son for 9 months, but I did my best to ensure they were both looked after. My wife and I both suffered and endured in different ways, and we both love our son equally.	1642759020.0	htkwtat	t3_s9074n	t1_htkplbz	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9074n/the_woman_usually_gets_most_of_the_sympathy_even/htkwtat/

The "life" inside her has no value, it is something that hasn't born yet, it doesn't have feelings, it doesn't have a conscience, it doesn't help the world in any way. You care about it for what it could be, I "care" about it for what it is and it is a fetus.	1642768989.0	htlarxs	t3_s8m6zb	t1_htklwkw	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htlarxs/

49s1vwb5	Legit question.  How is she wrong? If she's taking care of everything at home, that allows him to focus on his career.   Considering many men these days have garbage jobs with crap pay,  requiring the wife to work too. But it doesn't end there for the wife.  When the wife inevitably gets off work, she goes home to take care of the kids, clean the house, cook the meals, run the errands. Women who are put into those types of situations by their partners are better off being single moms: one less child in the home to clean up after.   If you want a 1950s housewife, you have to provide like a 1950s husband.

5hpt95wu	When, exactly, does it become a baby human? Upon leaving the womb? Naturally or via cesarean or does it not matter? What about premature births that require months, sometimes as much as 3, of ICU neonatal care? Since these premies are technically less viable (and kept basically in medically contrived wombs) than babies born at full term does that make them less valuable? Does the fetus become a baby when it first breaches into air or only when it's fully emerged? Can you kill/abort a baby when the cord is still attached because it is technically still attached to the mother? Since you define a life's value as being determined by feelings and a conscience does that mean it's ok to abort people in comas, under anaesthesia or even asleep? If you're against aborting sleeping people what about fetuses who are proven to experience REM sleep at 26 weeks. Is that the exact point they become human babies in your estimation? Is it ok to abort the fetus a few days before that? A few hours? A few seconds prior to 26 weeks post conception?	1642773902.0	htlkk86	t3_s8m6zb	t1_htlarxs	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htlkk86/

e13pa32v	well also  the majority of MRAs might be us men, and majority of feminists are indeed women, but the fact you said is 100% right  but there are 2 reasons I would think of why it happens :  1. Women antifeminists come here because they are tired of forced victimhood feminists play, false fear they portray, but most importantly the misandry of feminists makes women sympathize to men, and thus the caring women come here in MRA circle, and in return get the respect back (which they deserve), but we men never ask for anything else in return as payment from antifeminist women 2. Male feminists on other hand have been fooled by the system since ages (I was one too), and they think females are above them, but most importantly, they want sexual pleasure and have an urge to get laid, thus they bootlick feminist agendas blindly  Thus this actually proves that male feminists are the "real incels" and not us MRAs as the feminists portray lol, their hypocrisy and double standard is killing me XD	1642777742.0	htltpi7	t3_s8lkd8	t1_htlkgad	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/htltpi7/

If calling someone born a man a woman makes a person happy - fine.  I have the same.argument for.most anything.  If my life, my health, and my rights aren't hurt, do what you like to be happy.  I won't be a problem.  What I dislike is the attitude that fosters this "walk on eggshells" movement.  If someone doesn't know what you identify as, and you attack them for getting it wrong, then don't expect support from them going forward.  You embarrassed them.  Why would they support you now?  I don't see enough of this.  I see immediate aggressive behavior.  That's not going to win allies or enable acceptance.  I think if people were kinder both ways, things would be a lot easier.

9hsftuhi	It's really simple, feminism is a women movement, in which only women can be real feminists.  Same happens with anti-feminism, but here, only men can be anti-feminist. Why? Really simple, feminism doesn't have anything against women, it's our fight not yours.   The "I'm female and I care about men bs" or "I'm female and I'm against feminism bs" I don't belive none of that.

f60p6v4a	It's already happening! There is a huge, albeit quiet, movement of young women denouncing modern feminist ideals and yearning for a traditional identity. We (late teens and twentysomethings) are witnessing the failures of the generation of women before us, and spiritually arming ourselves against making the same mistakes. I have a lot of hope for the future! There are always more and more young ladies waking up, looking around, and making better choices.	1642783318.0	htm8ebl	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htm51k9	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htm8ebl/
h64yio9y	A brigade is where users of one sub will post offensive or rule-breaking content en masse in an effort to either attract attention to moderators or just derail discussion.   ‚ÄúJailbait‚Äù is slang for pictures of underage girls in either bikinis or skimpy clothing. Not exactly child p*rn but definitely creepy and against the rules. Subs like AHS has raided subs they wanted taken down with these images to try and get them banned  Peter Bright (aka DrPizza) was a blog writer and in 2019 was arrested for soliciting a minor who was actually an FBI agent. Just looking up ‚Äúdr pizza arrest‚Äù will give you a bunch of articles about him. What the articles don‚Äôt usually point out is he was very active on Reddit and r/IncelTears (the last sub before their old one was deleted by the original mod) He would constantly bag on incels, conservatives, basically anyone he disagreed with just like much of Reddit. And it makes the jailbait raids makes sense too.

5ccw4cmh	https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape  There are multiple studies and statistics which show that men are much more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape. I linked one, which is a quick and easy read, above. I am also happy to send you more studies if you were like. Statistically men are more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape. While data may not be perfect considering a lot of rape (and I am guessing false accusations too!) cases go unreported, it is not a minor statistical difference, and so very clearly true, even if the numbers are not absolutely exact. I am glad there is a subreddit for victims of false accusations and I do genuinely believe it is a problem, but (statistically) it is very clearly not a bigger problem then sexual assault, and considering the rarity of being falsely accused, it is not something anyone should be concerned about randomly happening to them (I guess unless they are a celebrity for whom false accusations are often more common).   I‚Äôm referring to percentages. Yes, I entirely believe that some people‚Äôs lives have been ruined by false accusations, as you said, we can see this by all the reports on that subreddit. But more men‚Äôs lives have been ruined by rape then being falsely accused of rape. This is not to say that the number of people who have been falsely accused are negligible, of course they are not, we are on a planet of over 7 billion people.   1 in 6 American women are a victim of rape in their lifetime, and 1 in 33 men. Do you mean to tell me that for every 33 men you know in real life, at least 1 has been falsely accused of rape?   Not only all of that, you are **15 times** more likely to be falsely accused of murder then falsely accused of rape, yet I much more often see people worrying about getting accused of rape (or other sexual assault) then murder.	1642783829.0	htm9so7	t3_rv8j3r	t1_ht184l0	/r/antifeminists/comments/rv8j3r/does_doing_that_stop_false_sexual_harassment/htm9so7/

wo721	I think it depends on the feminist.   The FDS type would look for and *expect* you to do those things. Because she views you as a slave who must grovel at her feet for a chance at her hallway coochie. Or just ghost you because she got her free meal and not even thank you.   The blue haired haired feminist will screech at and bemoan you for perpetuating toxic male supremacist behaviour of domination and belittling because she could obviously open the door herself and she doesn‚Äôt need a man or any gender to do it for her. But you‚Äôre right, she‚Äôll take the free meal. But, like university, you pay a class you don‚Äôt want. She‚Äôll tell you how sexist it is for you to pay for her steak meal and how being a man means you are inherently a rapist and are only barely holding your true nature back as you stick your card into the machine.	1642787640.0	htmk8dp	t3_s8ka0o	t1_htimbdu	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8ka0o/would_you_guys_still_marry_a_female_if_you_found/htmk8dp/

11lf14	I know how depressing it is to look at. Things have gotten better, but it may not seem like it considering how slowly things have gone.   Feminism has lost a tremendous amount of ground over the past 20 years and they are continuing to lose ground.   Equal rights equal lefts went from being seen as unacceptable extremism to a mainstream idea. Lawsuits from due process violations are starting to seriously damage schools and men are starting to check out of higher education en masse. The cdc is finally recognizing female perpetrators of sexual violence and found a near parity in male and female victims. The law will do what it has always done and follow the overton window.   I know the dating market really fuckin' sucks right now, and waiting 5 to 10 years isn't exactly a solution for those in it now. The only solution I see happening there is sex bots becoming a thing since the women who never grew up will will always have simps to siphon money and approval from.	1642792024.0	htmw0ex	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htmw0ex/

empa4mmt	I'm not sure how promoting your only fans is anti feminist.   Sorry to use this word but im not surehow else to sum it up, being a whore especially for money isn't anti feminist.   Some feminists say they reject the notion that their value is Inherent to their physical form or as them being an object of desire, but many just seem to assert the notion that because their value is inherent in their desireablilitythey should have increased social power because of it to the degree that it can be monetized.  It's weaponized feminism.	1642793848.0	htn10jg	t3_s9iqe3	t3_s9iqe3	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9iqe3/serving_my_purpose/htn10jg/

egbd6agl	Reply to your dumb ass comment where you told me off myself and got removed:  What have you done? You're spewing hate like a pissed off teenager. Stop and think for a sec, what are you accomplishing? You're only doing your part to give this movement a bad image. This kind of talk pushes people away and makes us look like we don't deserve support, because we're just a woman hating cesspool of bitching and complaining. Look at what people on other subs are saying about this sub. They think we're full of shit only looking for excuses to express our misogyny. If that's what you're doing, do it somewhere else cause you aren't welcome here. People like you do nothing but prove them right, and give the world more reasons to not take us seriously. What kind of fucked up mental gymnastics are you doing?  People like you are what's holding society back from overcoming all these issues. You could be spreading awareness and trying to get people on our side, show people the fucked up issues we're facing, put light on the empathy gap and the horribly skewed statistics that everyone thinks are legit. Spewing hate only gets you more hate. If you wanna keep being a miserable fuck, then you go ahead and do that. Just know that you're a fucking leech and you're just as bad as the most toxic feminists.   What you're doing is actually harmful to everyone and I'm just calling you out on that. I don't think that makes me a "little pacifist bitch" but you're free to have your shitty misguided opinions.   I can only do what I can but I'm sure as shit not gonna hate on the entirety of the opposite gender just because I'm jaded about what the feminists have done to society. You're right that feminism is winning, and that's why we need unity. Hating on women isn't gonna achieve that, it's just gonna make us stagnant at best and move backwards at worst.

d1h4a	Okay.   First, there is within some of us the desire to fight, and fight, and fight. And then fight some more until we are too tired to fight, at which point we go to sleep -- so we have the energy to fight again the following day. This is something not often acknowledged but it helps to explain why we keep fighting even in the face of impossible odds. If we can, we should try to get such people on our side of the fence.   Second, the reason Western feminism is impossible to take down is because it is being supported by Plutocrats who use it to distract from class and to keep the peasants divided. As the plutocrats become more and more powerful this will become unnecessary, at which point the whole IdPol thing will serve only to vilify the Plutocrats themselves, since they are White males. This is when things will turn around. At that point the Plutocrats will drop the whole IdPol thing -- or better yet, turn it upside down -- and the feminist shit will recede. I give it ten to twenty years before this happens so if you are young, hang in there. If you are not young, take comfort in the fact that future generations of men won't have to put up with the same shit we are currently up to our necks in.	1642796836.0	htn9952	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htn9952/

3s4lioa6	No they‚Äôre worse. Many incels are know for commuting violent acts. Elliot rogers is a really famous. He killed 6 people I believe. He was trying to get into a sorority house to kill more people, but his access was denied. His crime also inspired another incel to take a van and kill 10 people. Like I said before, in not a feminist or anti feminist, but with SOME feminists, even though they make a lot of really stupid comments like kill all men, that‚Äôs never actually translated to violence against real people. And most of the time, even though men don‚Äôt have domestic violence shelters, most people in the real world would shun those who are abusers, men or women.	1642797163.0	htna66y	t3_s7o03u	t1_htmyat6	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7o03u/an_interesting_quote_and_point_against_feminism/htna66y/

71ellra9	Want some examples?  Currently trans men and women can be excluded from the military because they're trans. They can be denied medical insurance and medical treatment from hospitals. Trans people can be excluded from political position for being trans. And trans men can be denied pre natal treatment due to the fact that they identify as men not women.   Additionally until the 1980's it was completely legal to kill trans people due to the some specific laws excluding them. In the 1990's the US had banned trans people from being a part of the military outright. Across the sea in Asia if you're trans you can be murdered and have no protection against it. In Russia trans people are treated like lepers, and can also be legally killed.

How I identify isn't anyone's business besides my own , I'm not going to be offended if someone accidentally misgendered me . However if they do it on purpose just to see if it offends me I'll just walk away from them , there's no point in fighting someone over how I choose to be seen in my body . Because their opinions on my life doesn't matter because I'm not hurting anyone , they aren't helping me build my life , and they aren't paying my medical bills for it so it doesn't matter.	1642802896.0	htnq35z	t3_s9awgo	t1_htm16cb	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htnq35z/

You didn't literally mean it (though I feel a very trolly response coming on this).    I don't care about it enough to fight against them.  Someone wants to be something because they feel more comfortable in their skin, what business is it of mine to fight them on something that really doesn't Impact my life?  So long as they are not taking something from me, or saying they are better than me, I don't care to fight them.  I tend to try to be as nice as I can when it comes to this stuff.

A hard working man who despite everything at the end of the day took time to ask me about my day . He was a family and never met a stranger , only a friend . He was wise and taught people different things . He was strong and never allowed me to do without . He was someone who didn't judge as long as it wasn't hurting anyone . He taught me things like how to be strong in the worst of times and laugh in the best of times . Sadly I lost him in 2014 along side my aunt . So my idea of a man is my papa , a good , honest , hard working man who was kind but also firm when needed, but always cared about his family . Basically what feminist say is a toxic man .

It if only hinges on that aspect then what about people who are born with both sets of genitals . Here's the thing there are really amazing men that never father a kid , and don't have that choice so basing it on if you can have kiddos or not is not a good argument due to alot of good men can't father kids .	1642806930.0	hto0qw5	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnzmjq	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/hto0qw5/
aebs2hfc	Lol yeah I wouldn't worry about it too much. Despite the feminists trying to convince themselves and others otherwise, men and women have very different innate natures.  Just think about it. Despite all the encouragement, privileges, positive discrimination and the reverse for men, women aren't really doing anything near what men are doing in tech, business, media, art, sports, industry, science, you name it. Women just aren't drawn to competition, they just make a big fuss of the little they do.  This is one of the reasons feminists are so angry and aggressive all the time. They know they're fighting a battle that they cannot win because women just aren't interested. They are really interested in getting attention, social maneuvering, manipulation and the like but in men's world, they simply aren't producing or creating much if anything of value.  Now this isn't to say normally women wouldn't be contributing to society, they would and still do in womanly ways, but to feminists' dismay, not in the way of taking over men's domain of competition for direct power. It's just something that they're neither capable of nor innately interested in.  So don't be fooled. They're trying to make it appear that way but feminism hasn't won, women have nowhere near wrestled control of real power from men and they can't. It's just a lot of noise they're making.	1642807068.0	hto13hd	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/hto13hd/

6cs90s1n	You are lucky to have had such a strong role model and you keep him alive and honor him with your love for him.     I do have a problem with the way gender dysphoria is being treated but understand it's the best short term solution (as gender expectations/roles are slow changing societal vehicles). But to me putting all eggs in the "gender" basket will lead to a quick relatively easy fix for a large portion of people but these solutions will always be subpar.     I wrote something about it which I hope you would read:     My problem with the way gender dysphoria is being "treated": The route that is currently being pursued is a band aid solution that will always be far from perfect. Gender dysphoria exist solely because of the existence of perceived/actual gender expectations.         At a certain age (usually starting from a young age) people will feel than the expectations that are placed on them because of their sex will feel extremely claustrophobic/hard for them to adhere to. This because the social expression that comes natural to people is certainly NOT binary; there is considerable overlap between how both sexes would like to express without social norms being in place.        The more the "natural/intrinsic" expression of the individual lies at the far end of the normal curve (towards the opposite sex) the more this individual will be considered abnormal from a social standpoint (gender norms). In general; the more tension exists between gender expectation and the natural temperament of said individual the more this person will want to transition (to make his appearance match the social construct of gender).        Wearing this "costume" will always be subpar at best (mostly because the dysphoria is not an actual rejection of the original form/body but of it's social expectations). Destroying the husk because of the claustophobic expectations society places upon you simply by merit of your birth sex is a damn shame imo. I can eleborate further but this is not the main focus of this post.        But what would the best possible solution be? What would be a cure to this problem?        The cure would be fighting for the right of INDIVIDUAL expression; gender IS the enemy not sex. Sex only dictates the mean of the "normal curves" of expression but every expression is valid as normal curves are extremely wide and have extreme (in this case almost complete) overlap. If we can stop shaming people for the way they express or deeming them to be less/not feminine/male because of the way they behave we will cure gender dysphoria and all the non-binary, demiboy etc. nonsense at the same time (nonsense because it's a solution to a problem that does not have to exist and siimply exists because we as a society keep taking the easy route).        So in the end I symphatize with you; for how society has made you feel like your expression/believes etc. did not fit your "skin". I also realize that for you as a individual this is probably path of least resistance (fighting against  societal norms every day seems exhausting). But on the larger scale; your treatment perpetuates the toxic mindset that we are not free to express ourselves in any way we deem fit regardless of birthsex.	1642809877.0	hto85t4	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnvseh	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/hto85t4/

6cs90s1n	To me a man is simply a man because of his sex. Gender is the enemy: societal expectations and gender roles are highly toxic.      So while I do not agree with his tone; I do agree with the notion that a man is simply a man because he was born a biological male. I also do not think being man or a woman for that matter hold ANY major weight beyond that simple factuality (from a sex perspective; I reject gender).     You can express in the exact same way as your grandfather and be equally worthy of praise and admiration while having a female form and calling yourself a woman. The notion that being a man/woman holds any intrinsic weight beyond the superficial biological aspect of it is highly toxic.     So define what a woman is: XX; holds no weight whatsoever it's simply a clinical observation (beyond the reproductive/romantic aspect)     So define what a woman is: XY; holds no weight whatsoever it's simply a clinical observation (beyond the reproductive/romantic aspect)	1642810412.0	hto9h10	t3_s9awgo	t1_hto0qw5	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/hto9h10/

But I've also seen and heard alot more women these days that are becoming abusive too. Probably more better at being emotionally abusive to their partners and other people than men are. It's pretty scary. Men commit more to physical abuse. Although, in saying that... women can get away with alot more and I've seen a woman take a swing at her partner once. No one said anything. Go figure.  For me, I support no group, people are arseholes. I rather just support myself and the people that actually give a damn about me in return.	1642810818.0	htoah99	t3_s9ks4s	t3_s9ks4s	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htoah99/

6cs90s1n	I do have a problem with the coddling mentality though. Not because of hate, but because I think not questioning the need for the movement to exist in the first place will lead us down a dark path of increasing boxed thinking and ultimately less humanity and freedom of expression for people that do not want to transition to "new boxes" non-binary, demiboy etc. But also do not want to feel like pariahs because the do not fit the ever narrowing traditional boxes.     I notice and increased emphasis and even narrowing definition on the traditional male/female gender roles and therefore inevitably more dysphoria. This will cause an increasing number of people to experience dysphoria in the binary; and an increase in (social) transitioning to non-binary, demiboy, the opposite sex (trans) etc.     re eloborate take of this as a response of this to beniesixx98	1642811445.0	htoc0qg	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnt8ps	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htoc0qg/

I don't get the hate for feminism, I get the hate for fascists but pointing fingers at feminism feels like looking at someone getting beaten by a cop then blaming criminals for making cops violent.	1642813707.0	htohify	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htoghmp	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htohify/

Unfortunately that will not be happening anytime soon, not in our lifetime. So many feminist parents are brainwashing their kids into being feminists, I literally see feminist mothers on instagram and tiktok, dressing their sons up like girls, and making their young sons wears "the future is female" t shirts. The future generations will be even more brainwashed, and it will keep getting worse and worse. Nothing will ever be normal again, the feminists have too much power and they will continue to do more damage with 5th and 6th wave feminism. Castration at birth will probably be a thing in the future and we don't have a say in anything, so many companies and brands are even pandering to feminists.	1642825296.0	htp8fqx	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htp8fqx/

d8fsxtys	You‚Äôre a pathological liar as most female worshippers are. For starters RAINN uses self-report studies with small samples of women often over phone. I will now site you a wall of information debunking your hate speech against men:  **Studies demonstrating roughly gender parity in sexual assault victimisation**  *The CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys.*  Here's one everybody in the MRM knows. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys. I've seen feminists try to cite this as evidence for their "rape culture against women" narrative, but they completely ignore the evidence of gender parity in victimisation in there. While the lifetime stats show a larger gender gap, if you look at the (more reliable and relevant) past year numbers for rape and made to penetrate from the NISVS, all the reports show that in the year prior to the study roughly equal proportions of men and women were forced into sex.  [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs\_report2010-a.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf)  NISVS 2010 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.  [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf)  NISVS 2011 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.  [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf)  NISVS 2012 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.  [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf)  NISVS 2015 showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 and 2 on page 15 and 16 respectively.  In each of the years the case count for male rape victims and female victims of made-to-penetrate were too small to provide a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  You can see that the estimated proportion of male victims of made to penetrate each year look very similar to the estimated numbers of female victims of rape. So if made to penetrate happens about as often as rape each year then by most people's assumed definition of rape (forced sex) then men are approximately half of rape victims.  (Also, if there is any doubt here that past year figures are more reliable than lifetime figures, [this](https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/13060) source notes that "Research tells us that 20% of critical details of a recognized event are irretrievable after one year from its occurrence and 50% are irretrievable after 5 years", which suggests that lifetime prevalence is less accurate.)  [Study on Child Abuse: INDIA 2007.](https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/sites/default/files/documents/4978.pdf)  Not only that, gender parity in sexual abuse and assault is not restricted to the West, as this report on child sexual victimisation in India shows. The major groups studied in this report were child respondents in the age group of 5-18 years, comprising three separate age groups 5-12 years, 13-14 years and 15-18 years. The second category of respondents was young adults in the age group 18-24 years.  The report breaks sexual abuse down into two main categories: "Severe" forms of sexual abuse (which includes being sexually assaulted, forced to fondle genitals, forced to exhibit private parts and photographed in the nude) and "other" forms of sexual abuse (which includes forcible kissing, sexual advances made during travel and marriages and exposure to pornographic materials).  Of the child respondents, 23.06% of the boys surveyed reported being subjected to one or more severe forms of sexual abuse, compared with 18.58% of the girls. 51.86% of the boys surveyed reported being subjected to one or more forms of other sexual abuse, compared with 49.57% of the girls.  Of the young adult sample, 60.58% of males reported being subjected to one or more forms of sexual abuse during childhood, compared with 41.12% of the females.  In some places like Delhi, boys are about *twice* as likely to experience sexual abuse than girls.  [Prevalence of Key Forms of Violence Against Adolescents in the Arab Region: A Systematic](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30399-9/pdf) [Review](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30399-9/pdf)  A 2018 review of the data surrounding violence against adolescents in the Middle East. It provides a thorough summary of available evidence on violence against adolescents in the Arab region. It has this to say about sex differences in victimisation:  "When results were disaggregated by sex, reported rates of all forms of violence, **including sexual abuse**, were usually higher among males compared with females. This was reported in Palestine, where physical or psychological maltreatment was reported by 1/2 of males and 1/4 of females \[42\]; in Egypt where over 1/2 of males and about 36% of females were physically punished \[29\]; and in Lebanon where males reported significantly higher rates of sexual harassment/abuse than females \[49\]."  [Prevalence of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse among a nationwide sample of Arab high school students: association with family characteristics, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and quality of life](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-010-0311-2)  This 2010 study found among a sample of approximately four thousand Kuwaiti students that there were no significant gender differences in the prevalence of sexual attacks and someone threatening the subjects with sex. The prevalence of someone sexually exposing themselves to the students and unwanted touching of sexual parts was significantly higher among the boys.  [The Rates of Child Sexual Abuse and Its Psychological Consequences as Revealed by a Study Among Palestinian University Students](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222884781_The_rates_of_child_sexual_abuse_and_its_psychological_consequences_as_revealed_by_a_study_among_Palestinian_University_students)  While this 2001 study is chock-full of feminist blathering about "patriarchy", its results are interesting.  The study aimed to achieve the following two objectives: First, it sought to examine the rates of sexual abuse in Palestinian society at three ages (12 years or less, 12‚Äì16 years, and 16 years) by three perpetrators (a family member, a relative, and a stranger). It used a sample of 652 Palestinian undergraduate students, and used Finkelhor‚Äôs (1979) scale for measuring sexual abuse.  Thirteen different acts of sexual abuse were presented in the questionnaire. Participants were asked to indicate whether or not they had experienced each of the acts by three different perpetrators, that is, a family member, a relative from the extended family, or a stranger, at three age periods (i.e., under the age of 12, from the age of 12 to 16, and over the age of 16). Responses were based on a dichotomous scale (0 ‚Äúno,‚Äù and 1 ‚Äúyes‚Äù).  Similar rates of sexual abuse were found among female and male students regardless of perpetrator or age, and this pattern of symmetry existed for even the most severe forms of sexual abuse (forced sex). The study notes that "the current research findings indicate that the rates of the problem are similar among female and male Palestinian students."  **High rates of female perpetration**  [Women's Sexual Aggression Against Men: Prevalence and Predictors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024648106477#/page-1)  "In this study, we investigated the prevalence of women's sexual aggression against men and examined predictors of sexual aggression in a sample of 248 women. Respondents reported their use of aggressive strategies (physical force, exploitation of a man's incapacitated state, and verbal pressure) to make a man engage in sexual touch, sexual intercourse, or oral sex against his will. ... Almost 1 in 10 respondents (9.3%) reported having used aggressive strategies to coerce a man into sexual activities. Exploitation of the man's incapacitated state was used most frequently (5.6%), followed by verbal pressure (3.2%) and physical force (2%). An additional 5.4% reported attempted acts of sexual aggression."  [Sexual Assaulters in the United States: Prevalence and Psychiatric Correlates in a National Sample](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-012-9943-5)  This is a 2012 research paper using data from the U. S. Census Bureau's nationally representative National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 2001-02). It found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of selfreported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‚Äúever force\[d\] someone to have sex ‚Ä¶ against their will,‚Äù 43.6% were female and 56.4% were male.  [Sexual Victimization Perpetrated by Women: Federal Data Reveal Surprising Prevalence](https://malesurvivorbop.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StempleFloresMeyer2016femaleperpetators.pdf)  "A 2013 survey of 1058 male and female youth ages 14‚Äì21 found that 9% self-reported perpetrating sexual victimization in their lifetime; 4% of youth reported perpetrating attempted or completed rape, which, again is defined to include any unwanted intercourse regardless of directionality (i.e., respondent reported that he/she ‚Äúmade someone have sex with me when I knew they did not want to‚Äù). While 98% of perpetrators who committed their first offence at age 15 or younger were male, by age 18‚Äì19 self-reports of perpetration differed little by sex: females comprised 48% of self-reported perpetrators of attempted or completed rape."	1642844847.0	htq4i0d	t3_s4zbug	t1_hszbd7o	/r/antifeminists/comments/s4zbug/this_subreddit_is_pretty_depressing/htq4i0d/

d8fsxtys	You‚Äôre a liar if you say the government / organisations are always providing accurate long term results for sexual violence gender ratios.   For starters these are the same groups of people who set up undeniably anti male policies and undermine the rights of men & boys. They also defined the rape definition to specifically exclude female-onto-male forced penetration meaning almost all cases of women raping men do not count without an object being used. It‚Äôs a little odd to claim women get raped more then exclude men from rape statistics, isn‚Äôt it?   Governments also set up male only drafts and female only allocated DV shelters that discriminate against men.

Denying this is in the interest of the feminist agenda because they want to push forward the idea that men and women are only different by nurture(it's because of the patriarchy and capitalism!!!) and there aren't any innate natural differences that may have caused different roles in society that men and women have.

6cs90s1n	I find it is extremely difficult to have a non black-white conversation about this topic online. I feel like most people are conditioned, from their political leanings, to simply take the stance their political hivemind dictates without having ever challenged their views (not even with an inner dialogue); To me people that so strictly opt into the far left or far right "brand" are simply echo-vessels and I will be able to tell what the person thinks about a subject simply by their political view      I refuse to believe EVERYONE on the far left (if they would not have been exposed to cult thinking) is intrinsically:   \- pro-choice     \- pro neopronouns    \- pro trans females competing with biological females in sport   \- pro the idea of cultural-appropriation   \- etc.  Yet everyone I have spoken online either opts into all the above or none of the above depending on their political background.  It is understandable though: insisting the world is grey will leave you to be a bigot in the eye of the left and a tree-hugging poof in the eye of the right (though I have to say there is still a bit of grey to be found on the right, the neo-left is mostly all black/white). Individuality is lonely in a world that is becoming increasingly polarised; a world were you have to choose sides or be deemed the enemy.     Also the majority of people are not intellectualy capable or as capable as they would like to convince themselves they are. Reiterating a stance (that the group has decided for you) will make you feel empowered and capable. So internalizing these intellectualy capable sounding dogmas and convincing yourself they are your own is extremely tempting.     All of the above makes it increasingly tempting to be a hive minded drone; there is little pay-off to being a critical thinking individual. But at the same time the only true conversation can be had when critical thinking individuals interact and collide.          I am not concerned about the downvotes; it simply a by-product of me bumping against/challenging the internalized coding/protocol of one of these zombies. Their biggest fear is waking from their stupor and being ripped from the comfort of their collective madness: realizing they are still alone and stupid, because they never developed any or were incapable of having any thought worth having on their own. Those poor unfortunate souls...  *I'm looking forward to having a conversation with a self thinking human.*	1642851500.0	htqdnzm	t3_s9awgo	t1_htpr6ki	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htqdnzm/

cjj0rhnu	As Business Management student, this is the best outcome they could have choosen  Quite a lot of men have basic knowledge of repairing minor issues in car and performing maintenance. So men are more likely to need assistance in a case of breakdown. And less likely for a punctured tire, which is difficult during night time. So supporting men and potentially sacrificing all their female customers would shut their entire business down.  Now by openly saying they support woman, anybody who opposes this is seen as woman hater. And it's not a new info that law and justice is a woman's bootlicking sidekick so they will most probably turn a blind eye. Also "feminist organisations" or better termed "non-lethal terrorist organisations" will indiscriminately file petitions and lawsuits for "woman protection".

ioivqs6b	Would u believe if I showed evidence of rampant false cases?      "Of all the rape cases that are registered, only 1% is genuine," says    Gupta's lawyer, Vinay Sharma, who regularly defends men accused of rape    in Delhi.  "The rest are either registered to take revenge or to take advantage of the person in some financial matter," he says.        [https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/alarming-rise-in-false-rape-cases-need-to-be-dealt-strongly-delhi-high-court-7457488/](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/alarming-rise-in-false-rape-cases-need-to-be-dealt-strongly-delhi-high-court-7457488/)     Even courts say alarming rise in false rape cases     53.2% rape cases are false according to womens commision of delhi. not to mention so many which police say they are forced to convict, thanks to pressure from u feministsüòä.   [https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/false-rape-cases-in-delhi-delhi-commission-of-women-233222-2014-12-29](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/false-rape-cases-in-delhi-delhi-commission-of-women-233222-2014-12-29)     Look if u are really for equality for men and women, u have to realise there are rampant false cases, in fact here in India there are some womens groups, which specialises in helping women file false cases.      And u know what this does? Takes up precious times of courts, hurts the daughters and wives of those accused. And women aren't taken seriously because of these false cases. I hate rapists as much as those who falsely accuse of rape. And I want to fight both.     But ur stuck in trying to hate men so much, u don't want the truth of false cases to come out. which ends up hurting innocent women.

Good job Feminists, this will make men paranoid, and good women would have an extra burden to prove themselves to men (just like men to women, currently) and woosh now both sides need to prove to other he/she ain't bad... And love ? Nah, that would be lost, competition would be the motive, lead by the hate for the other gender....  Nice Feminists, clapping for your dedication to destroy natural love, Bravo üëèüëèüëè	1642870653.0	htrg10r	t3_sa19w8	t1_htrc5zs	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa19w8/antifeminists/htrg10r/

If Feminism means women shall work, why the hell aren't they encouraging girls to pick up STEM field jobs or get into sport or join army ? Oh I see, that takes effort and hardwork (but Feminists just want freebies, no responsibilities)  I am sad that how many girls will fall for this shit... I wish they were taught to get a good respectable job, maybe become CEO of some company, but nah...   Do sex work, then bash men for being sexual beggars and Incels and what not, and then cry on media "why aren't we paid equal in (traditional) jobs ? üò≠"  Disgusting.

More feminists are there amongst women, making men paranoid, then men think each girl is a potential falsely accusing feminist  At the same time, women are made to believe each man is a potential rapist  And now both become paranoid, both never talk, both hate each other, both now have political agendas  And boom, real love ? That's gone...   So as a result, no relationships, no marriages, then no children  Then finally no future generations, humanity ends...

e13pa32v	Well as you see from my name, I am into No Fap  I know the ugly truth about porn industry  Porn industry is indeed dehumanizing women, but it also dehumanizes Men by an even larger extent  I saw pornstar info webpages, for the girls, there are 1000s of articles written in 1000s of words (literal essays mentioning big boobs, big cunt, bouncy, jiggly and countless demeaning terms)  For men ? Lol, men don't even get attention, all he is expected of is to be a large heavily built six pack abs dude, having 6 feet height, an 8 inch cock, and making absolutely no fucking voice... We are just shown as living Dildos there... And yet they make lesser money in porn than women... Plus men are given drugs to last longer...   Also, these articles are written by Feminists themselves (mostly Feminist men), lol these men are the real Incels, sexualizing women all the time, not us...  I have written this countless times on MensRights, but even they disagreed with me... C'mon guys, can't you see the truth ? How porn preys on men's views to run their businesses (all porn is intended for men watching it mostly) plus the male performers are given zero recognition ?   Where is the feminist outrage for helping male pornstars ?

e13pa32v	Always has been  If you have heard (or even read) the book Sapiens, there the author describes perfectly of how, when humans became more advanced, their lower body structure became a big more streamlined, allowing them to stand up rather than walking on 4 legs, their hips became smaller, but their brains were being a lot more developed, the size of the babies heads were increasing.  As a result, there was difficulty in women giving birth to children. To fix that, nature evolved us into being in a premature state when we get born, and after that, learn the basic skills of life while growing fully (as a child) and then work after that phase...   Thus, women started to look for safer men (so that the child gets to live) and started choosing stronger and smarter men... Also the fertility rate fell...  And 40% men didn't even get a chance to mate...   Also this leads to women becoming more valuable for society, even sexually, as they got scarce and men were seen as being disposable. Another reason to why men see more porn and get hooked onto that as compared to men, it provides a super stimulus to the brain (a response from brain when it gets something in abundance, which is also necessary for survival, mostly sex and food, thus same reaction happens when we eat a pizza or a burger, they have higher fats, so higher storage of food for future, and thus eating more)  Feminism or the Woke culture actually NEVER fought against this system, instead they amplified it even more... See Western societies as a matter, wokeism is more there, feminism too, and obesity as well, also porn watching rates and young sex relations and spread of STDs...  That's what Feminists did, they made us go back to being jungly Hedonists, not successful Universe Conquering species...  Plus they used Hitler's tactics to say lies louder more and more and louder and louder, so that at one point it becomes the truth, Feminists are the very thing they swore to destroy (as per definition)	1642873716.0	htrnx2l	t3_sa19w8	t1_htrm4hf	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa19w8/antifeminists/htrnx2l/

4rdw0737	I honestly respect your opinion on this , because personal definition has different views on a subject . I don't you are a bigot , more like misinformed on the topic of trans people , but not a bigot . I have opinions on being trans that not alot of trans people will agree with and while i appreciate your take . You have understand that my take is my own experience. But I do have to mention that trans people aren't born with the chemicals in our brains that identify with our bodies . For example I wasn't born with a brain that recognized the body I have as my own , it's always felt wrong and still does . It got worse after my miscarriage to the point I would bind my chest in unsafe ways begging to be myself . But I'm also poor right now and can't afford it . So I have to make do . And what's sad I came from a traditional home that were actually bigots . And I see your point on having kiddos but honestly with how the world is going do you honestly want a child growing up in the madness when suicide rates are so high and the cost of living getting worse by the day not to mention how bad the government system treats everyone? I definitely don't want that , and another thing innersex people are born with both sets of chromosomes they actually have to pick their sex . It's more then just black ,white, and Gray. Especially when it comes to being trans , but you have people who aren't just willing to talk about it , they want to fight about it and for what , just to be heard ? Meanwhile more and more trans women and men are being killed and raped just because That's their identity . It's really fucking sad	1642874305.0	htrpf3t	t3_s9awgo	t1_htqdnzm	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htrpf3t/

ub8mbpz	I see your point but I dont think its useful to argue who has it worse in the porn industry. Yes the female stars get more "attention" but they are also expected to do more degrading acts and be abused more often. Just because the women are focused on doesn't mean they are treated any better.  If anything Id say that men are abused by the porn industry mainly by being the intended consumer of it. Props to you doing nofap cus porn is an extremely addictive and psychologically damaging product and not enough people talk about that.	1642876270.0	htruibm	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htrktik	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htruibm/
e13pa32v	Talking of OnlyFans  Well, there's discrimination too, lemme ask you something...  Who will earn more money and gain more attention  A female nudes poster, or a male nudes poster... Whom do you think ?  Answer is obviously a woman... Hence discrimination in this field against boys...  What do men do to earn for college degrees then ? We clean the streets, work in shops, do construction work, etc.  As a result more men die in workplaces... Those who don't get jobs (men) do this for life, they stay broke  Now most girls (Feminists) don't like a broke man, he grows into depression (another thing that males are more depressed)  And as a result more suicides (76% suicides are men)  Otherwise, they join army to pay.... (99% war deaths are men)  Then also, retirement age for women is much lesser, for men it's higher... Plus in the West (where most of the OnlyFans models are from, aka developed countries), 60% college seats are taken away by women and not men...  Yet no one focusses on this issue  Also, a man would have to do dirty jobs to make money, costing physical strength and actually still keeping him broke and depressed  But, a woman has the privilege to just sell nudes and earn thousands of dollars, throughout most her life, then using feminism, just marry a any successful man when they approach 30)  You see ? It's all inter related...	1642876405.0	htruvc7	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htrr4ig	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htruvc7/

Their body selection requirement criteria is much more hard (sometimes impossible) to achieve as compared to much normal ones as intended for women...  Plus you don't see the "drugs" point ? The injections, and the pills, given to men, to forcefully create a sense of "men should last long if he's a real man" which is totally against nature's law ? Also ask him to ejaculate as soon as the director tells him to ?  Isn't that proof of male exploitation ?

ub8mbpz	Your first argument is a great point..for some reason feminists think the rampant abuse in prostitution is just some accident of culture or poverty or whatever, as if we can regulate the industry enough to stop the abuse.  In actuality abuse is inherent in any industry where someone is literally objectifying and selling their body.  Here's another argument: what other job carries a risk of pregnancy? What other job entails swapping dangerous biohazards like semen, saliva, and urine with zero oversight or protection?

6cs90s1n	I am not of the opinion that a person is without merit without having kids; having them should be up to the individual entirely. Kids are a big responsibility and therefore noone should feel like having them is mandatory.     The intersex argument that keeps being repeated is extremely flawed:  The vast majority of intersex people have a phenotype matching largely matching the sexual dichotomy and their gender expression also largely matches this phenotype. This is because the Y chromsome will cause an embryo to develop as male regardless of the amount of X chromosomes: so XXY is male and therefore people with Klinefelter are male. As a medical doctor I have met people with Klinefelter and their appearance is simply male and they usually identify as male same as XY people.       Also I do think you were born with a brain that wired more akin to that of a biological male. At the same time I do not believe is the reason you reject your "birth form". The thought that in a vacuum; were you are the only person that has ever lived (and therefore never met the opposite sex) you would look at your body it did not belong and should be modified seems ridiculous. To what would you want to modify your body if you would have never even seen a biological male? I do not think there is some kind of inner eye that would know what the male form is and would therefore cause you discomfort not fitting this almost religious entity at that point.     To me this thought experiment demonstrates you are not dysphoric because of your body; but because of the gender expectations that are inevitably associated with the body you are born with. In our modern world noone lives outside of the grasp of it's culture and your brain makes you want to express in a way that is considered to fit the opposite sex too a MUCH higher degree. The important distinction being; that while I fully believe you rejected your birth form it is not caused by biology but because the expression your brain deems most comfortable does not match the social construct we have created for your birth sex.     Furthermore I do not condone violence against anyone. I am sorry your life path is so difficult and you have not received the support you deserve.	1642878246.0	htrzlkv	t3_s9awgo	t1_htrpf3t	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htrzlkv/

4jxw6vf	You don't know me. I have good reasons to be antifeminist, and they're not more or less legitimate than yours. It's rather you, by being rude and judging people without knowing them, who deserved the cause.   Username checkout, actually it's my based Leorio sigma stare profile picture that triggered you. You're just jealous that my flag looks cooler than yours. And my transphobia is not related to my sexual orientation, you LGBTphobic.  No, seriously, I'm not transphobic, and super straight is not transphobia. It's just a troll response to the morons who call as transphobic the straight people who are only attracted to the opposite sex (so almost everyone). So if they call you transphobic, you can call them LGBTphobic, since they insult you for your sexual orientation. While the whole thing started as a joke, they couldn't stand the paradox so much, that they chose to call super straight transphobic too. As if they didn't understand that you can't solve all your nonsense by putting phobic words on it.

3aq77j7x	I feel like pornography could subject humans to indignities. People who watch it and fap to it alot will probably be suffering from porn addiction. If people profit from showing nudes or drawing hentai they will earn money from the simps and most of that porn will have females. If more and more people get addicted to porn it can make females feel unsafe. I'm scared that video game or other communities will be well known for their unofficial pornography, especially the furry fandom. I have seen way to much porn from furries and I don't like it. I feel like they are trying to profit from it or get people horny.  If porn industry rapidly grows then people might get horny and help porn stars profit and even teenagers or children could get horny. They just don't care that much about age restriction and they say there 18+ when it spreads from media to media to media and minors are still vulnerable to seeing this type of stuff.   I don't expect anything good from the porn industry.	1642880457.0	hts56da	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htrktik	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/hts56da/

9ojyvtfr	No, it really isn‚Äôt. Men commit rape because they feel that sex is a need for them, they feel entitled to it. There is a reason they are almost always perpetuating it.

So yes, it‚Äôs a misogyny issue. https://endsexualexploitation.org/violence/#_edn1 [from above link]: Committing Sexual Offenses and Accepting Rape Myths:  A meta-analysis of 46 studies reported that the effects of exposure to pornographic material are ‚Äúclear and consistent,‚Äù and that pornography use puts people at increased risk for committing sexual offenses and accepting rape myths.[vii]	1642883950.0	htsdq6g	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htscvh1	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htsdq6g/

fvm6rs7n	All leaders of the feminist/women's movement have had serious psychological problems, each and every single one of them without one single exception.  Mary Wollstonecraft, a woman from the early women's movement that lived in the 1800s the lifestyle of contemporary feminists, one that contemporary feminists celebrate as an icon of their movement, suffered from a myriad of psychological problems foremost of these chronic, clinical depression so severe she attempted suicide two or three times throughout her short life. Icon of early 1900s feminism Charlotte Perkins, author of the Herland Trilogy, a work seminal in feminism, like all other icons of the feminist movement was also diagnosed with a myriad of serious mental health problems. She suffered from hallucinations throughout her life. She was diagnosed with psychosis and depression. She was throughout her life deemed clinically insane. Like many of her feminist compatriots she wound up committing suicide. Simone de Beauvoir, icon of mid 1900s feminism, was a chronic depressive. She was throughout most of her life addicted to drugs. She was also an alcoholic. She died from cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. Kate Millett, icon of 1960s/70s feminism, was clinical diagnosed insane. She was extremely violent and psychotic. She was by order of a court locked up in a mental asylum from which she escaped before joining the feminist movement and becoming one of its foremost leaders....  I can go on and on and on, but I think I have made my point.  All icons of the feminist movement have have had serious psychological problems and/or chronically abused drugs. Test this claim of mine for yourself. Look up any icon of the feminist movement then search their medical history. You will find that they have a history of serious psychological problems.  Insanity is a prerequisite to feminism. Those that aren't insane before they join feminism are turned insane by feminism.  In my previous comment I mentioned an icon of feminism that was recently found starved to death. This would be Shulamith Firestone one of the biggest icons of the feminist movement. She is considered a mother of radical feminism. She was in adulthood, after living feminism, she became extremely psychotic. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Feminism literally drove her insane. In 2012, she was discovered dead inside her own flat. Her cupboards were all empty of food. She was suspected of having starved herself to death. Her corpse lay undiscovered in her home for weeks, until its stench reach the doors of her neighbours who informed authorities who then broke her door down to find her dead inside. She was totally abandoned by her own sisters. None of those women in her movement who called her their mother and sister cared to check up on her. She died alone and out of food in a miserable condition. There is no better example of the devastating impact of feminism on an individual than the life and death of Shulamith Firestone.  You won't find information such as this on YouTube or anywhere else in the world of feminism, a world full of people living in near total ignorance.

cytmev70	Funny thing is, domestic abuse has all kinds of abuse.   Control  Physical Abuse  Sexual Abuse  Emotional Abuse & Intimidation  Isolation  Verbal Abuse: Coercion, Threats, & Blame  I'm a victim myself. My ex wife completly and almost instantaneously switched as soon as we got married. From verbal threats and degrading me in the bedroom to expecting favors in return for sex. Well kind of. If I wanted sex, I'd have to fold laundry, do dishes, and just general household chores. Not, *hey I'll let you fuck me if you do the dishes tonight.* it was, *you're not fucking touching me, unless you do those god damn dishes.*  And if I ever didn't finish a task because I worked and had other projects, she'd take her little toys to the shower and get herself off. And if I ever was caught jerking it, it was the end of the fucking world. From anger and screaming at me to crying and playing victim because "I didn't want to fuck her anymore".   We ended up getting divorced less than a year after getting married(her choice). Her excuse for a divorce was because I changed, or wasn't the man I was when we were dating. Come to find out, she got knocked up by some married dude she worked with. Good riddance to her, and good luck to that dude.   I'm married again now, and have a wonderful wife and three beautiful children, I'm a stay at home dad, and she loves me being home with the kids and not in some daycare where they may be ignored or bullied etc.   My ex wife blocked me on all social media's but I ended up finding her sister's Facebook a couple years ago, and omg, she is huge, with like 5 kids. Like, I'm glad it ended when it did, because she did want kids with me. Who knows how long it would've taken me to hang myself.	1642888452.0	htsorwu	t3_sa5srs	t1_hts1qe2	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa5srs/uk_feminist_charity_womens_aid_petition_against/htsorwu/

And because of it they go as far as causing nerve damage so doctors will cut that limb off . And as soon as it's gone the person because happier and say they feel normal. That's how it is being trans , the more we live in the wrong body the more we hate ourselves , until we can get the surgeries done alot of transgender individuals have shown signs of better life improvement as well as being alot happier in life overall especially since they have to see at least for 4 doctors to make sure this is what they want .As for me I don't allow my dysphoria control my life , however it's there but I Aleve some of it by presenting myself as male , dressing more masculine , acting more masculine so much I've already changed my name and address myself as a male . My partner and my mom both help where they can if it is a bad day of dysphoria. And that's all I can ask for.

8w6m5	>I can get sex if I want sex.   Umm.. Okay?   >I'd like higher conscoiousness stronger women that expect as much from themselves as they do their partners adn are capable of viewing thier thoughts feelings and motivations as being primitive and animalistic and needing to be risen above to create the kind of life and relationships they are seeking. I'd like more capable women.   That's more of a social thing and who you interact with. There are many women providing the main household income for their family and adhere to their partners emotions and concerns. If you're not finding "capable women", you've got your sights set on narrow and you're not looking very hard.   >I beleive that as well as opressing women our society has coddled them and I'd just like someone who views their mind the way I view mine and expects as much from themslves as I do myself.  This isn't uncommon. But moreover, what makes your views better than their views? They're also looking for someone to view their minds the way they do. You're painting this like it's women that are the problem when men do the same thing.   >An example, I'd like a woman who is strong enough to see a man being vulnerable emotionally and if she feels a hint of revulsion at his weekness, to be awoken enough to see past that as a primitive thing in her own mind, and recognize he may not be vulnerable due to weakness, but perhaps as an act of strengt and deliberate choice because doing so is what creates the closeness and connection that SHE craves as well as him. Some women seem capabnle of seeing past that to begin with and caring for a man as a human, but man, one little hint of that feeling of revulsion at weekness and most just think its because he is weak and don't even consider where that comes from in themselves.   Really sounds like a you thing. Or at least the people you converse with. This honestly just sounds like someone hurt you by this on the past and now you just expect women to be horrible people that can't convey meaningful emotion with men. You're using words like primitive to describe how you think women will react, which says more about you than what the issue is.   >In my relationships I have done more than my share of emotional labor   "more than my share" sounds like you're blaming your partner isn't putting enough into the relationship. If your partner isn't reflecting what you need, then it might not be a good relationship for you.   >which has been admitted to by all my exes,  I'm sure.   >but then after I stop trying  Key words here.  >they text me and say how much they miss the connection etc but just seem to want me to commit to creating it in return for their presence in my life.   Wait what? Isn't that what you're asking of them too?   >Them shouldering a truly equal share of the responsibility is something I just need not for my ego or feelings but because it just doesn't work well otherwise.   Very valid and it goes both ways.   >Its a social norm women get and need more emotional support and it's just silly and many women can't even consider that could be real.   And why is giving women emotional support a bad thing? We do it for men all the time. Ever been to a gym? Boys be constantly supporting each other and telling each other that they're yolked and looking swol. So isn't there also a social norm to boost the emotional ego of men as well? There's a lot of strong women that don't want your emotional support, in the way you're thinking, all the time. I've been with women and men that get annoyed if I coddle their emotions too much as well as the opposite of not coddling enough. Find the right person for you. Emotional support goes both ways. We really shouldn't be depicting it as a weird social norm.   >I don't think you and I are going to be on the same wavelength. I wish you the best. Enjoy your freedoms.  We're probably not. I see women losing their rights and access to their own body while the men in here are complaining about social norms. It's not the same game.

Also you still have not been able to argue why if sex work is work there is any moral jeopardy for the person paying for the sex, when buying sex is as buying a coffee then cheating with a prostitute isn't cheating, unless you're will to argue that a man dating a woman cannot buy a tyre change.

No actually I'm expecting it to be we both are commited to creating it in return for the other person being commited to creating it as well.   &#x200B;  How are women losing access to their own body? Someones making you wear chastity belts? Access to birth control and abortions isn't accesss to your own body. You may have a right to those things but they are not your body they are medical procedures. Your body is the thing that creates the pregnancy with a man's sperm. You can argue having a right to those things but you cannot argue they are your body.   See the thing is, this si the first time I have said anything invalidating about yoru experience. Everything you have said has basically been arguing and invalidating my experience while the things I have said are more explaining my perspective without invalidating yours. What does that say about the gender dynamic? That my feelings and perspective are treated as valid by women or society in general?  &#x200B;  You are right emotional support goes both ways.

5hqucc9c	I was a policeman in the 70's and 80's. We attended many, many domestic violence calls. Something I noticed was that overwhelmingly, the violence was initiated by the female. Usually by throwing things at the bloke. Eventually the male would respond and inflict greater damage (obviously). When we turned up, the woman would have bruises and the man would be arrested. But when we went to pub-brawls, the first question we asked was "who threw the first punch?" That's who would be arrested. I was only a young bloke but I could never figure out why the different standard.  The real downside of this though was that it skewed the statistics regarding DV. The feminists could claim "99% of arrests for DV are men". That didn't tell the real story IMO.	1642893174.0	htt0fjs	t3_sa9ora	t3_sa9ora	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa9ora/what_feminists_dont_realize_when_men_say_if_were/htt0fjs/

6cs90s1n	You are talking about body integrity dysphoria. The current theory being they have a lower amount of grey matter linked to the mapping of the body part that feels foreign to them. I believe the same or a similar mechanism is not likely in the case of gender dysphoria; I believe it is simply as the name states a dysphoria of gender (not meeting social expectations because your "wiring" and gender expression do not match the cultural expectations that are being placed on your birthsex).    This in turn gives rise to rejecting the physical characteristics that are associated with our binary and are the distinguishing features between sexes. eg removal/modification of the penile tissue, binding/amputation of the breast etc. Removing these features allows one to more readily be perceived as the opposite gender; which in turn causes the environment to place less expectations upon you regarding your biological sex and more of your gender (opposing sex in the case of transgenders).     So while I do think gender dysphoria feels the same way to you; the mechanisms at play are totally different. From a very young age gender expectations start to "infect" the body and in particular the ones associated with the birth sex, When the mind is in harmony with these expectations an individual develops normally. If the mind rejects these expectations multiple possible scenarios unfold;    \- The individual resists and rejects the gender expectations and is able to claim the expression he/she wishes, while also claiming his/her birth sex. Insisting it is the world that is at fault for creating the burden of these expectations  where only freedom to express in any way should exist. Thus purging his/her soma of the infection of gender. Only sex remains and the individual is truly free. (This is the utopia, it requires a combination of either/both an extremely strong individual or a society with very mild/no gender roles)   \- The individual experiences moderate/mild dysphoria and drags on. Puberty and the bodily changes associated with it form a second test were all of the listed outcomes can occur again. Later in life as social expectations tend to lessen dysphoria might decrease or even be alleviated in total.   \- The individual experiences extreme dysphoria and wishes to transition as quickly as possible.     So while this might feel the same as body integrity disorder to the individual the implications of the different pathways are vast.     **Gender dysphoria pathway**   biological alteration in the brain (or simply an individual with a gender expression lying on the far end of the normal curve; towards the opposite gender) **->** Exposure to culture/gender roles **->** Physical traits become associated with gender roles (especially the sex organs in the broadest sense) "the gender infection stage" **->** Gender expectations not matching the way the mind wants to present **->** The gender is rejected and therefore the body that has become one with the gender (through infection) is rejected (**at this stage, which starts from a very young age; the condition, to the individual, is indiscernible from body integrity disorder** **in it's presentation**. One of apparently rejecting the biological body. But in the case of gender dysphoria looking at the mechanism we can still see it is actually a rejection of gender)     **Body integrity dysphoria pathway**   Biological alteration in the brain causing the individual to not recognize the limb as it's own/feeling off/foreign **->** The "target" limb is rejected      The importance is the way both conditions can be treated. In gender dysphoria we could, in theory, get rid of gender and it's expectations and cure new occurences of gender dysphoria overnight (But sadly it is not that simple culture is very resistant to changes; but it can be done if we want to and would probably face less backlash than the current agenda).    What we do now is treating the symptoms; you are a victim of gender roles and because you do not fit the claustrophobic box you were initialy placed we try to peel away your skin; put your bones in a new bag and place you in a new more fitting box.       In body integrity dysphoria we can only remove the limbs that are being rejected; which is controversial and no other treatments have been reported to have been succesful with a high degree of scientific consensus.	1642893625.0	htt1i25	t3_s9awgo	t1_htsp7g0	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htt1i25/

83tk0jof	Yeah I'm not so sure about the rhetoric here, as you can reasonably have a campaign on issue A, when issue B is also important. You don't have to talk about every issue at the same time, or people aren't going to campaign on every social issue that happens to exist.  Now I think violence against (often) young males is an important issue, despite the fact that the perpetrators of the crimes are normally going to be other young males. Obviously that doesn't change the fact that it's completely unfair on the victims a lot of the time.   And sure, there may be a bias in what gets more of the attention. The political left tends to be soft on crime, except where it's something like *violence against women* and then they apparently believe in strict enforcement all of a sudden.  I think it's also noteworthy that so much violence is committed by men. I don't think that gender is purely a "social construct", but rather, there are just real differences between the sexes and men are hardwired to be more aggressive. Obviously most men can still behave themselves and aren't criminal thugs, but yeah, higher average aggression.	1642895140.0	htt564a	t3_sad34d	t3_sad34d	/r/antifeminists/comments/sad34d/the_un_and_the_pope_advertise_ending_violence/htt564a/

Or sex work is work, sanctioned by society and not immoral and no different to any other purchase, pick your poison here but you get one or the other but not both. The person paying for the performance, or massage as you've put it considers the person providing the service no more than they provide the service.   If sex work is work then there is no moral issue, a married man can buy or rent a woman for as long as he wants, no different to paying for a massage, your words, so given that paying for sex by your own words being nothing more than buying a performance, paying for a massage or in my words buying a coffee, why attack the John, for paying for a service, especially if he's married, marriage means nothing, other than a joint enterprise to potentially reduce costs or raise children, love is nothing, meaningless and of no consequence, marriage vows and laws have no meaning.   Or sex work is immoral, not valid work, a prostitute is then somebody worth more than the situation they currently find themselves in, efforts should be made to help them find a way out.

How is an abortion not involved with a womans body? I know what you're trying to say by definition but it's just ignorant. Not only did they ban abortions from clinics, they made it a crime to do so on your own. People can turn women in for going out of state for their own abortion. This had nothing to do with the state or the government. This is her body. You're literally telling women that they're not allowed to remove a potential "parasite" from their body. Some women don't want to sacrifice 9 months of their life attending to something that's just going to feed off of them both before and after pregnancy; especially if it's there without her consent.   >See the thing is, this si the first time I have said anything invalidating about yoru experience.

I'm sorry you don't have the chance to prove me wrong?   >You seem to have nothing to offer or share other than telling me I dont know what I'm talking about and my impression of you is one of lack of substance in you and instead a fcous on your rights and freedoms with little of meaning shared for what thats like for you.  Where are you getting this from? I asked a question and responded to some things you said. What do you want me to offer? You've literally spent this whole post and the last one telling me that I've just been cruel to you while you bash into me. Little meaning for what freedom is to me? Jeeze...   >The bigger thing is, I go through life constantly econsidering my thoughts and feelings as possibly being the results of ignorance or primitive drives that no longer serve me.   That's rough, to say the least. This is something you could maybe talk to someone for. Sounds like anxiety maybe or repressed memories.   >women don't seem to analyze and second guess themselves in that way  They most certainly do on some levels. It's not good to assume how other people think or what they're thinking.   >Like if you suggest perhaps their wanting men to compete for their affections does not serve them, they feel like you are trying to control them and stifle their freedoms and oppress them as part of the patriarchy because they should be allowed to be promiscuous. To consider that perhaps the ways they have men compete are irrelvant and unrelated to what it is shes looking for in a partner is not something they are willing to do. This is where the word primitive comes in.    >Mens primitive nature is to fuck everything that moves right?   No... Kind of. Women also like sex. But we, as a society, decided it was wrong to force people to do that. I certainly know some women, and men, that will talk a ravage game about a guy they want to bang. They don't do it, because it's wrong.   >We've been rising above that for centuries,   Yes; we, as a society, have risen above it. Or at least tried to.   >what is the female counterpart  What? Everyone is in this together. Are you expecting a medal or something because you're male?   >how can or should women rise above it?  Rise above it? Some are. Just like how some men are. I'd dare to argue both. But women at this point aren't really the problem in terms of overly forceful sexual assaults. Men are typically larger and stronger, so it's easier for them to do so. Thus, men tend to commit sexual assault at a much higher rate than women. Men are sexually assaulted more, and that's not argued. But men are also the ones to typically do it.	1642897547.0	httb37l	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htsvazs	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/httb37l/

1897ohi	>Yeah I'm not so sure about the rhetoric here, as you can reasonably have a campaign on issue A, when issue B is also important. You don't have to talk about every issue at the same time, or people aren't going to campaign on every social issue that happens to exist.  The problem with your take here is that issue A is literally the only issue that is given exclusive attention and it has been that way for a very, very, *very* long time, whereas issue B is barely an afterthought despite being the objectively larger one when it comes down to numbers and statistics. If there was ever a back and forth between the two your argument might hold some weight, but that is not, nor has it ever really been the case.	1642903935.0	httq3io	t3_sad34d	t1_htt564a	/r/antifeminists/comments/sad34d/the_un_and_the_pope_advertise_ending_violence/httq3io/
wo721	Leto‚Äôs son, Paul Atreides, is next in line to take power of their house. Leto is never once portrayed as bumbling, idiotic, neglectful, etc. I can‚Äôt remember specifics but he was the exact opposite of the stereotypical father in feminist-influenced media. Leto is strong, brave, courageous and stoic. While also leaving room for emotion and caring for the emotional state of his son and what he means for the future of their house. He has this absolutely fucking *amazing* scene with his son in their family‚Äôs graveyard. Again, can‚Äôt remember specifics for the life of me. But it was everything that feminists *truly* fear about men. That men aren‚Äôt just emotionless rocks out to use everyone for their own gain. That a patriarch, which he is, is not inherently evil. He is an ideal leader, and the supporting cast show this with their *earned* loyalty to him - not blind fanaticism/zealotry. There is a severe lack of role models like Leto, at least to me, for young boys in both fictional media and real life.   If I have this all wrong or someone has a different take on Leto‚Äôs character, please feel free to add on. My analyses aren‚Äôt the greatest, just writing from my shitty memory and nonstop stream of thought.	1642904800.0	htts2qz	t3_s9vako	t1_htstwhi	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9vako/we_all_silently_agree_that_this_is_also_a_problem/htts2qz/

No Fap isn't forced, but yeah I get it, if you get happy, do it.... fapping/sex might be alright, but porn is NOT. (again in my opinion)   and I am not religious, I am an atheist...

Since I couldn't FAP, I looked to have sex to get off and that made me much better at getting women.       The only thing I'd say is, you're 17.  Go and enjoy yourself.  Get fit, gain knowledge, and go outside.  I wouldn't have been caught dead going back and forth with people on a website when I was 17.  It's one of the best times in your life, enjoy and develop it.  You should be making your own mistakes and coming to conclusions from life experiences, not what some idiots on a forum tell you.	1642914712.0	htue769	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htucdd1	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htue769/
kwzqf	Nothing you said relates to anything else you said.  You can still FAP and build great things.  Accountants, doctors, engineers, scientists, astronauts, military personnel (I can promise you we FAP a lot) ALL FAP.  The amount of sex workers pales in comparison to all the other occupations out there.  It's not like we're taking our best and brightest and turning them into sex workers.  The people that are suitable for other jobs will still do other jobs.  I agree we need to combat poverty and teach people, but that has nothing to do with this conversation.  I really think this is an age difference and a culture difference.  I didn't grow up in the digital age, yet FAPPING to sex workers (magazines) was still done as much as today.  Do you think people are ignorant of greedy companies?  That's all anyone complains about.  Instead of blaming shitty companies, promoting the good ones or building your own are the only real alternatives.	1642915195.0	htuf7w3	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htudpzz	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htuf7w3/

8ynspnfb	I don't have anything against sex work. If she has such low standards that she will do anything to make money then that's enough of a red flags for me. It's very hard to live in this world and social media influence us a lot to buy expensive stuffs that we don't need and it's obvious that many of us aren't smart enough to understand this propoganda and take a stance against it. So people would eventually resort to any job to make money. Such people who do sex work just for living a luxurious life disgusts me.  However I'm not against people doing sex work just to pay their debts or student loan and then quit immediately. I respect such people because they didn't get corrupt by the easy money and gave up the job after the goal was achieved.  People's past is always important.

Still, yes, 88% of porn does depict this, just from the first few pages I haven't seen anything degrading. Moreover, just because there's aggression during sex, doesn't mean it is specificly woman-hating.  And plus, porn users don't actually make porn, nor do they criticize and say shameful remarks about the women (well, nothing too serious like telling them to die or something, only commenting on their body which IS misogynistic, but it IS a porn site sooo..)

5bz207z4	Feminists in this regard are directly responsible for creating their own misery, and increasing the misery of millions of women.  Another example of the dangerous ideology that it has become.   Do all prostitutes hate what they do, I suppose not, I suppose there are some who enjoy it, revel in it even but they are the exception to the rule not the general case which in my view invalidates their view when we know the vast majority of women do not like what they do, do not like what they have to do, would wish to be anywhere else doing anything else.   However if sex work is work, then they create a sword of Damocles over every single sex worker, first off they objectify themselves, so cannot expect to be thought of as anything other than a sex object where they are of course the object being sold, second they can say they hate what they do, what sympathy do they garner, most people hate their job, if sex work is work then they deserve no special consideration nor treatment, do we offer help, advice and protection to leave the industry for a train driver, a doctor, a software engineer, a lawyer, a road sweeper.   If sex work is valid work then the billions worldwide being spent to protect women who are caught up in the trap of prostitution goes away, justifiably so because no other job gets the same consideration, no other job gets the same protection.   They also by their demands trap many more women into that life who are currently trying to get out, these women hold their money until they have enough to leave and make their lives comfortable while they arrange to get the help they need to move on, that will of course be ruined by them having to declare their full income for tax purposes, reducing their income through taxes and as we all know taxation being a bigger issue for the poorer in society taxation is responsible for keeping many in a poverty situation, this will inevitably force many to continue in that life for far longer and face far more risks.	1642928453.0	htuzion	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htt9ouy	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htuzion/

9ojyvtfr	Thanks, I really appreciate these conversations too. I understand how it might seem like in a perfect world, rapists would be punished in the industry, but sadly that isn‚Äôt the case. In the same way that drug cartels continuously operate despite being illegal, so do rapists.  I highly recommend reading this blog post, it has lots of great information with sources:  https://artemis-the-protector.tumblr.com/post/669540544643530752/yeah-because-you-can-totally-tell-how-smart-i-am  Some key takeaways from it are the realities of the porn industry. Human trafficking, child sex abuse, rape, coercion, etc. are rampant in the industry. This often goes unpunished due to lack of regulation and the victims not being taken seriously. You can see this in the testimonials from real porn actresses in the linked post. Because that‚Äôs what they are‚Ä¶ actresses. Of course they‚Äôre going to pretend everything is fine when the camera is rolling.  You can also see the misogynistic attitudes. Yes, most of those aggressive acts are directed towards women. You have titles like ‚Äúdirty teen whore gets anally destroyed‚Äù and similar. Very misogynistic in nature. You said something about how men might make degrading comments about women in porn but it‚Äôs ok ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs porn‚Äù and I ask‚Ä¶ why does that make it ok? Isn‚Äôt it worse that saying degrading things about women and their bodies turns you on? If you weren‚Äôt a misogynist, why would porn appeal to you when most of it involves women being tossed around, slapped, choked, and generally just treated like objects?  Also, there‚Äôs this:  https://artemis-the-protector.tumblr.com/post/670758316208685056/blackswanenthusiast-we-know-that-tell-that-to  This post contains links where men who direct and buy sex talk about women. You can see the misogynistic attitudes plain as day. You also have to consider that by supporting this industry, these men are also supporting the rampant rape and trafficking of the industry.  So yes, I believe porn is inherently misogynistic. The subject matter itself glorifies the degradation and pain of women, and the industry itself routinely exploits and abuses the women working in it.	1642931477.0	htv3csb	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htuxzu7	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htv3csb/

As a man it is out of pure pleasure. And if a man can't be raped and if he is he probably liked it so it is not raped. See what I'm getting at here. Even if men or boys are raped by women.

99cker03	Ah yes a another feminists taking one issue that goes throughout humanity and turning it to women based off of their own feelings about it. Shut the fuck up bitch. Just cause you got raped doesn't make it a woman's only issue. And not everything with men revolves around sex. Feminists think more about sex than the men they batter. And plus when most women want sex they can't take no for an answer. Have you ever had someone trick you into having a child with them.  Hmm well I have, that is literally only a man's issue. Yet you'd probably make it into a woman's issue. Has your mother tried to kill you cause she didn't want a son no but I have.  Have you been called sexist for not wanting to be with a woman 200 pounds hmm probably not cause men having preferences is shamed apon like we can't have morals. Have you gone to court and damn near went to prison for not paying child support for a child that isn't yours nope cause thats only a man's issue. Have you been accused of rape for denying a woman probably not. Have you been feared just because you are walking down the street. Have you been pepper sprayed for walking into a store probably not. Have you been raped by your fucking teacher at the age of 15 and told you probably liked it screaming inside whole your body is enjoying something while your mind wants nothing to do with it PROBABLY FUCKING NOT. Then told you probably enjoyed it and that women got no consequences under the law. And guess what I've been raped 2 times in my life 1 my teacher female. Two my uncle. Hmm funny but its only a woman's issue right. Yet I can state more man's issues than I already have. Bitch just cause women deal with it doesn't mean it only women.	1642933739.0	htv694s	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htsdq6g	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htv694s/
59y3ty09	Govt. Is not going to listen to MRAs demands. Because that's not a popular opinion (due to media) & Simping for woman will get them more votes. Due to media feminists & simps (99.99% of men), MRA issues/concerns will never become popular with general population. On top of that most young kids both (m&f) are feminists due to indoctrination at schools and social media.  So your best way to success is to hurt govt in unusual ways for their Simping. By not getting married, not making kids & living in a minimalistic way, you are actually creating issues for govts. Since 99.99% Indian men are simps, they don't give a shit about men's issue, they will laugh at MRA's. So let them suffer from these laws. When they get trapped in a false case, then they (not all) will learn a lesson. But it will take decades. That is the reason to support marital rape law.  This protective mentality (to save humanity) is good in an ideal society. But in a dysfunctional society (where we live), it's a simp mentality. So having that is not good for the you right now & in future. If you try to help a woman who is getting assaulted. Some will say thanks, some will say nothing, some will file fake cases. So best thing for you is to look after yourself & your family. You a have a lot to lose if you get trapped. There are a lot of example out there. Give these feminists what they always say. They say they are empowered, strong blah blah blah, so let them deal with that. Give them freedom. If someone asks why did you interfere, then tell them Men & Woman are equal. Enjoy the shitshow. Humanity only exists in social media &  in public it is reserved only for woman. There is no incentive for us.  After I left MRA, I never supported a single person who is suffering from false cases by wife. That guy agreed to all of these when signed on the paper. If he didn't read terms and conditions, then it's his fault. So he deserves no sympathy.	1642933749.0	htv69n5	t3_sa19w8	t1_htux265	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa19w8/antifeminists/htv69n5/

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

1x6rbyhc	Oh it does. I mean think about it. If the statistics are that women suffer more gender based violence, then the question of who initiated the violence calls into question their victimhood. So that if a woman slaps me as hard as she can, and I punch her as hard as I can, I am the victim, but she's the casualty. Nobody thinks the Nazis were victims for getting punched really hard by the allies...so why would anyone think women are the victims.  Your experiences, regardless of the gynocentric makeup of legal systems, illustrated a fundamental flaw in their logic. If you slap me, I am the victim, if I defend myself, you become a casualty. So the data that states the victimhood of women is false. In fact men are the victims, the difference is, they are not the majority casualty.	1642936669.0	htva3gg	t3_sa9ora	t1_httvqs4	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa9ora/what_feminists_dont_realize_when_men_say_if_were/htva3gg/

Women are a lot of things, but they are SIGNIFICANTLY less frequently violent criminals when compared to men yet are frequently still the target of violent crime.

Secondly it means that I treat you as I have been treated, as all men are treated, you do not get the tight to special consideration, women first is a historical idea, now it's every person for themselves, if you fail then it sucks to be you.  If your scared to walk home alone at night well you get to experience what we sometimes have to and no you don't get to ask any man to help you out.  It means true equality, not the kind feminists claim to want but the actual kind where women get only what they earn, take full responsibility for their choices and actions and bear the full consequences of them.	1642939535.0	htvdv7m	t3_sa9ora	t3_sa9ora	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa9ora/what_feminists_dont_realize_when_men_say_if_were/htvdv7m/

1x6rbyhc	Blame. That's such a female thing to do. Attribute is more like it.  Starting with your point about society, it is a collective of being sharing a similar culture. So, culture then. Culture is a series of norms based on habits refined over time. Habits are actions by individuals. The individuals in question are female, so the gynocentric culture is rooted in the actions of females. One can only act in accordance to their nature, so female nature is at the root. This is not misogyny, and you cannot scare me with such foolishly feminist tags.

However, lots of these FDS women call something that is not to their own personal preferences for red flags, which doesn't really make sense as what's not one person's preference can be another's persons preference.   Like, just cause I don't wanna date someone who's religious myself doesn't mean that being religious is a red flag. For someone who's religious, dating someone else who is religious is a green flag.

7xo29s8e	Jimmy?  I thought we were discussing feminine choices.  I can already tell where this is going.  You'll keep tap-dancing around the core issue and deflect any blame or criticism from any single woman or group of women because...survey says...women can't be wrong ever!  People like you should work for or with charities or non-profits and have to humble yourself and serve others so you not only see the world from a different perspective, you might \*gasp\* work alongside horrible, evil men and understand we're punished and made to face the consequences of our choices \*all the goddamn time.\*  And on the subject of choices:  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that American men are forced to sign up for Selective Service even though the draft hasn't happened in decades.  Women?  Get off scot free.  To say nothing of the advantages women get in terms of alimony, child support, sometimes free housing when they're pregnant, getting men arrested in domestic abuse cases even when the woman is the perp, and in a situation I was involved with, filing false police reports and nearly getting an ex boyfriend shot because a borderline personality suffering lunatic couldn't handle anyone else having differentiating opinions from her own, and so she'd get the police involved to handle arguments she started and nearly got her first boyfriend shot because she claimed he was going to hurt her and her kids.  At the time she did that, btw, he was helping out his comatose mother.  Clearly a threat.  And about choices?  The way the world is now men have absolutely no reproductive rights.  The only protection we have now is self-protective isolation or a vasectomy, which can be irreversible.  Your gender is so ridiculously privileged and chock-full of choices.  Want better men?  Be better women.  And that starts with being better to people.	1642948059.0	htvs1mp	t3_sar60q	t1_htvq41l	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/htvs1mp/

I think we can all agree that it is primarily MEN who kill men and also MEN who kill women.  Does this in any way negate the fact that the vast majority of their victims are also men? Whenever I see this rhetoric it baffles me that people don't realise they're essentially victim blaming.  Lesbian couples have a disproportionately high levels of domestic violence - actually the highest out of straight couples and gay male couples - but since it's women abusing other women, that effectively cancels it out and doesn't really matter?

9j0zm0dh	* women get more money from the government than they pay in taxes (proven by studies) so the whole system just redistributes male tax money to women to finance their single mother lifestyle * most women are financed by men, either directly as husbands or indirectly by taxes from men ... you practically already pay alimony to women you have never met and pay child support for children you did not father * this is just slavery with some extra steps to cover it ... men work, women get the money ... that is the definition of slavery * women change the language to "re-educate" / brainwash the society ... "the Patriarchy" is just the same scapegoat mechanism the Nazis with a made up, imaginary "Jew1sh world C0nspiracy" to justify their atrocities  * they already had success with it ... they changes the laws with their false narrative that shows them as "victims" although statistics and facts prove otherwise ... (Example "domestic violence": statistics show that 70% of DV attacks are initiated by women - mostly because they think there would be no consequences ... statistics also show that lesbian couples have the highes rates of DV)  we are currently in a very similar situation like in 1933 Germany ... the Nazis were successful with their narrative to portrait Jewish people as parasites and "harmful to society", people really were convinced that Jewish people were destroying and exploiting the Germans, the Nazis used their own language like "Dolchstosslegende" and imaginary "Jew1sh W0rld C0nspiracy" to brainwash everybody. Beating a Jewish person, locking the up, killing them ... was considered beneficial to society. Currently we have the same situation with the narrative about men: feminists popularized "men are murderers and rapists" or "kill all men" ... a women can beat a man on the open street and get him arrested on made up charges without anybody intervening or helping ... this is the same situation as it was with Jewish people in 1933 in Germany.   If you think it's "harmless" I can tell you ... it's not ... it will slowly get worse ... if people don't fight it ... it will slowly get to a point where you will have "curfews" for men (already proposed) to make the streets safer for women ... or you will get areas where men will not be allowed ... if it gets even worse the next step will be "male ghettos" which you only can leave for work   if you think this is impossible ... this already happened nearly 90 years ago with Jewish people  feminist will not be dumb enough to build "camps" in the end ... it will mostly stay on the level of ghettos or they will lock up huge portions of the male population in prison ... their goal is what it always was: male slave labor/money without giving anything in return	1642952681.0	htw2fg5	t3_sat1ns	t3_sat1ns	/r/antifeminists/comments/sat1ns/feminism_is_about_equality/htw2fg5/

8sz8knes	You've completely misrepresented the headline. Petitioning for funding specifically for women is not the same as petitioning against funding for men.

8sz8knes	I can defend it easily. Women's aid isn't asking the government not to fund gender neutral shelters, they're just petitioning to make sure funding is not taken from single sex shelters in order to do this.   I fully acknowledge the need for gender neutral shelters, as they benefit men, and mixed gender families fleeing DV. However, I also know that particularly  female victims of sexual violence often require a sex segregated space to recover and be safe.   There needs to be funding for both, and funding one at the cost of another is not a solution.

wo721	I agree. Unfortunately my father wasn‚Äôt the best role model. Not downright bad but not great either. He had a really bad temper and would occasionally take it out on my brother and I. But luckily those moments were few and far between. He was definitely very passive and has a seemingly avoidant attachment style. I think a lot of that stemmed from a resentment of giving up his career to be a stay at home dad. My mother wasn‚Äôt make as much as him when I was born, but she was on a path that would have her making *much* more than he would ever. While my brother and I have enjoyed the fruits of her labour, we are extremely well off and we both very much appreciate her and all her sacrifice, she has confessed to me that she would have very much preferred to have been a SAHM. She was seduced by the idea of a high-power, high-earning career and didn‚Äôt think of the consequences of working almost every waking hour of her 20s-40s. She managed to convince my dad that her earning double his projected salary cap and him staying home would have been better than him working and earning his still very much middle class salary. Recently, that reality has hit her. How much of our lives she missed in favour of board meetings, cubicles and the synthetic nature of the corporate world. The physical consequences of working a nigh 24/7 desk job has *certainly* caught up with her as well.	1642955062.0	htw8eev	t3_s9vako	t1_htvw5xv	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9vako/we_all_silently_agree_that_this_is_also_a_problem/htw8eev/

4c9h0	>What‚Äôs wrong is you are actively disparaging women for their clothing choices, which is the opposite of you being happy with everyone living their lives any way they see fit.  This discussion originally begin with a conversation about whether it's okay for a man to leave his girlfriend because she wants to go to a party dressed like a prostitute. First, people like yourself were arguing that makes him a sexist.  Then I argued that if women have the choice to dress however they like, men should have the choice to not be in relationships with women that dress like hoes, because that's equality. Isn't that what Feminism was fighting for?  Then, people like yourself asked me to explain why I wouldn't be in a relationship with a woman who dressed like a prostitute, and thus we ended up here. In other words, the goalposts have been moved. I do think everyone has the right to live life as they see fit. This includes that women can do whatever they want, and men can do whatever they want in response. Based on my experience, good men aren't going to be in relationships with women that dress like prostitutes, for reasons I've already explained. [Sexual objectification hurts women](https://wp.nyu.edu/steinhardt-appsych_opus/the-effects-of-sexual-objectification-on-womens-mental-health/), this is a fact that has been proven over and over again and cannot be denied. It doesn't make any difference if it's the woman sexually objectifying herself, in fact that's arguably even worse.  You're free to disagree with that. But honestly, the fact that so many people have been upset with what I've said (good men aren't going to be in relationships with women who dress like hoes) means I've struck a nerve. People don't become emotionally invested in a conversation like this unless on some level, they know there's truth to the claim being made. All you're doing is proving my point.  &#x200B;  >Plenty of women who wear revealing clothing are in happy, healthy relationships so you making a blanket statement like that is not only inaccurate, it‚Äôs just laughable.  I don't know any women who dress like prostitutes who are in happy, healthy relationships, nor do I know any good, high quality men that would put up with that when they have plenty of options of women who have self-respect and dignity and who do not treat their own bodies like an object.

8sz8knes	I think it is really unfortunate that there are very few options for men who need shelter in the UK. However I don't think the solution is to take essential funding away from women's only shelters or force women's only shelters to become gender neutral in order to keep funding.   Surely any reasonable person can admit that there is a dire need for both women's only shelters, (which despite existing 'everywhere' are being forced to turn women away because they can't meet the increasing demand caused by the pandemic) and gender neutral shelters.  You're fighting the wrong battle by attacking women's charities for trying to keep the funding they need. You should be demanding that the government provide ample funding for both gender neutral and single sex women's shelters.	1642959334.0	htwjh3t	t3_sa5srs	t1_htw8495	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa5srs/uk_feminist_charity_womens_aid_petition_against/htwjh3t/

3s4lioa6	I‚Äôd say that initially this doesn‚Äôt seem like such a bad idea, but the thing is, this paper misses two really crucial things. Those things being that consent can be withdrawn anytime and neither the man or woman using contraception. As far as consent goes, I know a lot of times people in here like to just claim that women will change their mind afterwards, but that‚Äôs not the case a lot of times. Does it happen? Yes it unfortunately does. But a big problem is that people don‚Äôt understand consent isn‚Äôt a simple yes or no. I see that you have a checklist of activities and that‚Äôs a good start, but as I said earlier, consent can be revoked any time during the sexual act itself. This is because many times partners try something new and the other may find that it is not comfortable. If the other partner is comfortable with is, then there‚Äôs no problem, but if they find an activity physically painful and the other does not stop what they‚Äôre doing after being told to, then yeah that is classified as rape.   As for contraception, both men and women have been found to tamper with it. On this form, both partners could easily lie and say yes. And at the same time, contraception is is not 100% effective especially if used the wrong way, so even if you do use contraception, getting pregnant isn‚Äôt necessarily a give away that holes were poked in the condom of that the pills weren‚Äôt taken.   Not saying that it isn‚Äôt a good thing to get consent written down, but when it comes to one of the partners not stopping an activity that is harmful, then yeah that‚Äôs where this paper falls down hill.	1642960971.0	htwns0x	t3_say46k	t3_say46k	/r/antifeminists/comments/say46k/must_use_this_form_before_sex/htwns0x/

Women are genetically more risk averse, more sensitive to the elements, and have less aptitude for physical strength than men. Socially women are currently taught mostly that they should be allowed to do anything they want with no fear of consequences with an opposing social doctrine that they women should face consequences for their actions.   The opposing social doctrine (anti-feminism) has been growing for a while, and is slated to continue pushing both feminist and generally gynocentric social doctrine back.	1642962642.0	htws60d	t3_sar60q	t1_htvdywp	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/htws60d/

4jxw6vf	>You‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt know you. But even a glance sends tradcon / right winger red flags.  How about, instead of digging through my profile, you start a civilized conversation, like an adult, to find out what I think? If I were as nasty as you, I would say that it's typically a leftist behavior, but I won't. You just stick me with questionable labels, hoping that I will defend myself for not being on this or that political side, while I have my own way of thinking. There is no wrong in having some right-wing or conservative ideas. Everyone has good reasons to think what they think, and each point of view is defendable.   The trap is to join one of the extremes, and to reject everything that is not of your political side. I hope this is not your case, because if you want to talk about red flags, you also send some too. Not to mention the way you seem to view the right wingers, the simple fact of having the word "trans" in your username suggests that you only define yourself by your gender, and that you support intersectional movement, which is just an extension of feminism. Nothing forbids you to listen to diverse opinions, to accept some and to reject others, whether they are from the right or the left.  >You have the word ‚Äòtriggered‚Äô in your bio which is used by misandristic anti-SJW‚Äôs  I hope for you that there is not also some trans people who said that word, by generalizing like that, you could end up saying that being trans is misandristic and anti-SJW. So yes, I use anti-SJW language like "trigger" because I think it's appropriate. I've lost count of the number of times I've been banned from subreddits because one of my jokes triggered a moderator, so I put it in my bio. There are still some labels that can fit me, I like the "anti-SJW" one, you have to be blind to not see the alarming rise of the woke ideology absolutely everywhere. But "misandrist", seriously? That's probably the dumbest thing you could've said about me, I'm literally here because of misandry.  >You also have super straight in your pfp and are ranting about ‚Äòtransgender people forcing me to date them.‚Äô  Now your interpretations go way too far. You're literally twisting my words to try to stick me with your stereotypical definition of super straight, that you must have learnt in some extreme trans activist meeting. Although not that extreme, considering the influence they have today, we could almost talk about a new standard. But hopefully, common sense still exists. I'm only talking about some stupid extremists, not about all trans people, as you would like me to do. Like I said, super straight started out as a huge troll to mock the idiots who invoke transphobia at the slightest inconvenience. On a lighter note, it's also for me a satirical way of making fun of the people who put their sexuality or gender flag behind an anime character on their profile picture. And unlike them, my flag is based and is not seem everywhere.  >I wouldn‚Äôt date a tradcon like you even if I was paid for starters so stop ego-lifting.  I didn't ask you anything, take a breath. Even if you were a biological woman, I'm not attracted by the hysterical ones.  >Kill all men is also claimed to be a joke from TERFs to deflect criticism for hate speech / declaring malecide against men and they use your same talking points. It‚Äôs a mind-numbingly stupid excuse.  "Kill al men" is very explicit, feminists are the ones who gave this meaning to these words, while super straight only reflects a reality, that some extremists label as transphobic, by giving it a completely twisted definition, that you're using right now. Let me quote my own comment about what super straight is originally:  >It's just a troll answer to the morons who call as transphobic the straight people who are only attracted to the opposite sex (so almost everyone). So if they call you transphobic, you can call them LGBTphobic, since they insult you for your sexual orientation. While the whole thing started as a joke, they couldn't stand the paradox so much, that they chose to call super straight transphobic too. As if they didn't already understand that they can't solve all their nonsense by putting phobic words on it.  Super straight is only transphobic because you want it to be, but it doesn't work like that.   >your right wing nonsense makes men‚Äôs rights movement and true anti-feminism look bad  You made up an idea of who I was based on my profile picture, which is basically just a troll/joke, so you could insult me without reserve, by putting tradcon/right wing labels on me, that only reflect your own extremism. With a mentality like that, who do you think is the more harmful? You have no legitimacy to talk to me like that, but since I don't have your arrogance, I will not tell you to get out like you do.   Now, if it's to come up with such a narrow answer again, it's not worth my time. I will continue to be antifeminist, whether you like it or not.

It is mind blowing to me how women can not grasp their advantage is in their 20's pretty much as a default, then they absolutely waste the world being at their fingertips, get to a point where it's gone, and they have nothing to show for it and have a litany of voids to fill.    Instead of telling other women to NOT make the same mistakes, they just double down.  Talk about fucking yourself over.	1642966982.0	htx382k	t3_sangko	t1_htvm1n8	/r/antifeminists/comments/sangko/what_happened_to_equality/htx382k/

h2jt1i58	> What would the man get in return?  Most women can not answer this question anymore as they have brainwashed themselves into thinking this whole "strong and independent" shit is the way to go.  I asked a girl in Hinge a few days ago what made her unique as that was her big selling point to me.  Like magic the convo completely died and a day later she unmatched.  She literally got stumped by a question she promoted.  I feel like I am seeing more and more women unable to actually tell a men what she brings to the table or what makes her so great.  They say it all the time, but being able to articulate why is getting rare at a rapid pace.  It's sad too because it's trickling down to women who are not feminists.  Feminism is absolutely ruining dating and it's painfully obvious.    Like if you're strong and independent, great, but realize you are going to STAY independent, that's the down side.  It's the exact same reason they say men staying alone can be a bad thing overtime.  It applies to women too, humans gunna human after all.	1642967507.0	htx4jv6	t3_sangko	t1_htv3s19	/r/antifeminists/comments/sangko/what_happened_to_equality/htx4jv6/

hqrq3oku	Yeah for me it's the opposite when it comes to tempers, my mom, God bless her soul (don't worry she is still alive) was loving but had a temper that got to the point of me recoiling back when she goes to my face, it mainly comes from her hitting me, and of course I come from a country that isn't exactly advanced so to speak, we still live on the "hit if they misbehave model" to the point that when you get bad marks on a test the teacher would slap your arm with a stick, hell I've seen kids who misbehave get hit with a big PVC pipe, the kid, who I've never seen get even after taking punches, came back sobbing.    and so because of her hitting me, I kinda built a reflex of recoiling if she's mad and near me, of course she stopped, but that wasn't the only issue, she also loved to mess with me in a not fun way, now I'm gonna admit I have a short temper with games, so I get vocally mad, so she teases me, and I tell her to stop and I get more angry slowly, so she then gets mad when I'm raising my tone, the worst part is when she tells me, and excuse the translation as she says it in another language, "if you're raising your voice now, what are you gonna do when you grow up, hit me? You're gonna abuse me?" Just the fact that she dares to think that I even imagine laying a finger on my own mother.   now of course I had some bitterness towards her but I learnt to forget and forgive, yes what she did is extreme but I can only blame it on this country's terrible traditions (most kids born in the 50s to 90s grow up on beatings and yelling), and besides, holding a grudge to my own mother is just something I'm not looking for, I'm not one for cutting people off and generally I'm not a fan of keeping around old memories, it was terrible but Hey, that's life, and she stopped why she does and knows better, I say that learning to forget and forgive and to not good grudges is something important in life   keeping old wounds open is only a road to more pain.	1642977289.0	htxu0ve	t3_s9vako	t1_htw8eev	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9vako/we_all_silently_agree_that_this_is_also_a_problem/htxu0ve/

awg1ag7s	My theory on sexualisation is that it stems from sex work. I believe that when a woman gets too involved in sex work, clients start to see her as an object more. They think that she won't mind being sexualised because of her work and will treat her that way. The solution: ban sex work. It's not real work and the women are just disrespecting their bodies by hawking it off to different people.	1642986474.0	htyh6ad	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htx1xy0	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htyh6ad/

e13pa32v	Love making is accounted as sex, it is loyalty, by not doing that, aren't you promoting cheating ? Cheating is another thing which feminists do, a LOT.  I am Indian, in marriages, now the Fiance's of the groom go away with their boyfriends, and chest on the Fiance. How are there 2 guys you may ask ?  Well, actually, in India, a girl can easily find a guy to marry, a rich guy for life, if the boyfriend ain't rich, they now stay underground, and cheat on their partners, shit even have babies together and ask the other innocent guy to pay. But that info is not revealed.  When the cheating is caught, there's a direct court case logged by the woman, by article 498a of our constitution, in the charge of Domestic violence. That's a false accusation, but now on the husband and his entire family.   Also, as a matter of fact, this domestic violence law is highly messed up, firstly, it's only made for women. Second, it's 85% of the times FALSE. Yup. That's the situation.  Another law biased towards women, aka Marital Rape law, is  on its way, now people men will have to sign this maybe to prove innocence. And Feminist women may manipulate the guy by saying "why are you signing this, don't you trust me huh ? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫" And boom then anytime she can come, even after 10 years, that the husband raped her or hit her....  That's the situation now.  Thus, Sex is love. Nothing else. If a girl sleeps with 10s of guys or maybe even 30, and doesn't study properly or build a career, and then goes to choose a virgin lonely guy, who is btw rich, she can easily do that. Here, all girls are seen as innocent. Thus, sex is love making, not mechanics...	1642988075.0	htykycb	t3_say46k	t1_htxxaow	/r/antifeminists/comments/say46k/must_use_this_form_before_sex/htykycb/

37whekn5	I wouldn't imagine it would work in the courts, neither would the consent apps.  The loophole i can already see in that document is the absence of a sobriety clause and a slot for names and age range. Even if you put the 4k'est quality camera with verbal confirmation while she signs it there is always the arguement of "being forced to sign" or mildly under rhe influence of date rape drugs during signage. Plus she can claim she said "stop" in klingon at negative 2000 decibels during intercourse but you refused.

dsa9cr2s	Well India is a long ways away so that doesn‚Äôt really affect me but‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of domestic violence that goes on in India. If that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about. Tons of violence against women and they get so despondent that they basically put gasoline on themselves and light themselves on fire or commit suicide some other way because they are in such a desperate situation. People all over the world are suffering from this and it‚Äôs man against women and women against men. Traditionally more men against women in the patriarchal societies. It makes me glad I live in Canada. Honestly it‚Äôs not like I see huge groups of feminists marching down the streets of the city I live in.  It doesn‚Äôt affect me or anyone I know men or women. Doesn‚Äôt affect us at all. In fact the word feminist I used to hear all the time in the 60s but I‚Äôve never heard it until the whole red pill movement. I have to be honest I think sometimes it‚Äôs a lot of men who are looking to point the finger of blame at someone because their life didn‚Äôt turn out the way they were told it would or they thought it should so they‚Äôre looking for someone to blame. But society is just shifting and that‚Äôs just the way it is. You have to try to live your best life.

ioivqs6b	MP Jess Phillips laughs at men's rights debate request "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRWUsn4yyJI   She literally laughs at male suicide, when someone brings it up in the parliament. Now, I know u would say she is an extreme feminazi, but she was actually supported by feminists after this and the actual issue was never adressed. Instead it turned into, women get harassed bla bla. I dont condone harassing her, but lets be real it was just to turn attention away from actual problem.    Which was never even adressed by these feminists     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXGkVsMdXxE , Feminists protest against men's spaces calling it sexist. Meanwhile want specific spaces for women     A very good comment from this misleading video by feminists     A more accurate title would be  ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights activist sue feminist funded womens spaces over the exclusion of males and male spaces‚Äù   If men are not allowed to have their own spaces over laws that say it‚Äôs discrimination which was lobbied by feminist, then  technically women having spaces just for women would be discrimination.     See the difference in framing that title?    Men‚Äôs rights activist are not trying to exclude women‚Äôs spaces from existing per se they are trying to demonstrate those groups blatant sexism in not allowing men to have their own spaces, if that happens to simply shutdown a sexist feminist class or group its not men‚Äôs rights fault those groups decided to be or happen to be blatant sexist and therefore removed, that‚Äôs feminist fault.	1643005355.0	htzlur0	t3_s9ks4s	t1_htx50gx	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htzlur0/
ioivqs6b	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLFIsv7ATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLFIsv7ATE) This video is by a female MRA     In short one good point from it, more women are going to college now than men. But They still get affirmative action and support from government. Back when women were less, there were much calls to improve the gender ratio.   Now that men are lesser in colleges, why are feminists not helping to get affirmative action for men?? In fact there are still much higher support for women and affirmative actions for them. It's like they simply dont care about equality     Also, one very good point about feminist hypocrisy as said by Dave Chappele. It is a woman's right whether she wants to have an abortion or not, and men should have no say in this. Then men should also have say whether they want to pay child support or not. And if IM wrong, then perhaps we are all wrong. According to feminists, men should have no say in abortion of their child, but should be forced to pay child support. Not to mention there are so many cases of men being forced to pay child support, for a baby tthat wasnt even theirs.     **And these are just some basic hypocrisies from feminists, and why feminism is rotten at it's core. And just check r feminismstopswhen subreddit for how they pretty much are hypocrite about everything.**	1643005783.0	htzmiav	t3_s9ks4s	t1_htx50gx	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htzmiav/

ye627	And let's be more explicit, many women do have violent rape fantasies. That doesn't mean they wish it to happen, nor that it is enjoyable at all. They are *fantasies.*  A teenage boy can fantasize on their own older teacher, and even believe they loved it when they are coerced into sex. This still can cause trauma in a developing adult, or condition them in orher future relationship where they are abused.	1643006414.0	htzngza	t3_sb74vy	t1_htys3pq	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/htzngza/

Oversexualized? Or perhaps you just hate male sexuality. Why can‚Äôt men admire women? Men can think and feel whatever the hell they want bigot. People believe boys are losers and innately stupider than girls because they are male. Kindly stop speaking through your anus feminist. Stop making excuses for that fact that women are lazy and leech off of men. Women are and always have been more than free to take on workplace roles that men have, you are just embarrassed to admit you leech off of men so you blame them. You are a misandrist. Misogyny doesn‚Äôt exist. There is no anti-female laws or any of it, there is systemic misandry though and countless evidence of. You don‚Äôt have an argument, you just cited an article of girls being raped. Guess what? Everyone of any demographic gets raped sometimes. Women aren‚Äôt special and don‚Äôt deserve special attention when they are victims. And how bold of you to make such an argument when the laws in everywhere but 6 countries don‚Äôt include female-onto-male forced penetration meaning it‚Äôs impossible to charge women or count them in statistics unless they used an object. In Africa 40% of boys report being raped, mostly by female perpetrators. Incestious pedophilia crimes are very common and thousands of cases or more get called in weekly to child protective services weekly. ‚ÄúWoman can barely exist without her husband.‚Äù By which you mean woman can‚Äôt leech off of anyone without her husband? She can go get into employment. The idea women can‚Äôt in many countries is a myth as I‚Äôve explained. ‚ÄúWomen were just barely even able to drive in 2017‚Äù and men in first world countries still can‚Äôt vote unless they‚Äôve registered for male war slavery (selective service.) women are privileged anywhere. In genocides terrorist groups segregate the sexes let the females run off and burn the males alive. There was one country where they slaughtered 70% of the male population I remember.

We dislike the kind of women I mentionned as an example, but we wish them no harm. We will mock them for sure because its entertaining to do so, but that is it.   >Are you seriously claiming that the few thousand women who have been selling a few nudes and bath water in the past 10 or so years, are the reason the female gender have been underrepresented in the fields that ‚Äúcreate‚Äù for the entirety of human history?  I stated these as an example, they are not the reason for the under representation of females in certain fields, but they and social medias in general are responsible for the crazyness that has been going on for a decade now.   As for the under representation you speak of, lets talk about that, and equality and tell me why you rarely (almost never) see a woman working in "sewer" jobs, electrician, mechanic, road building/building work or even as bin collecting employees? I thought you gals wanted to be equal to men? Why no woman do these jobs? Why is it men fault they are under represented there?	1643018655.0	hu03bwc	t3_sar60q	t1_htzoypo	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/hu03bwc/

71rkq7bz	I‚Äôve seen it too. All I have to say about that is‚Ä¶ My ass. The only thing feminism has ever done in terms of making male victims unheard of is **encouraging** it.   In 2010, feminists in Israel **opposed** changes to rape laws that would make it so that women could be convicted of rape. In 2013, feminists in India pressured the government into rewriting rape laws so that only men could be convicted of rape.  More importantly, why isn‚Äôt there any feminist outcry against male rape victims and female rapists? Oh right‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs only an issue if the victim is a woman and the perpetrator is a man.  And yet, people still think feminism will fix it. Considering the whole mindset feminists have about looking at only one side of gender-neutral issues, it **won‚Äôt** unless oppressing male rape victims and defending female rapists even more is what you‚Äôre talking about.	1643019874.0	hu04snp	t3_sb74vy	t1_hty36xl	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/hu04snp/

35c0i	You can't stop quoting biased rape statistics in your quest to make men out to be rapists? You can't stop blocking gender neutral rape laws? Really?   For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**   You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g.   Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206  > > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and   > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.   2010 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  *data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*  And non CDC study...  *A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  *a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*  And another non CDC study...  *National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‚Äòever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,‚Äô 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.‚Äù*  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  *when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù‚Äîeither by physical force or due to intoxication‚Äîat virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*   If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.    Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women‚Äôs rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn‚Äôt empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims‚Äô fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1643025859.0	hu0cqhp	t3_sb74vy	t1_hu0cg6o	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/hu0cqhp/

iyzp8vjo	You stopped helping and protecting women because they like philosophy and to think logically?  1. Everything you do is decided by your brain.   2. When you are born, your brain is programmed to react in certain ways to certain situations.   3. You have no control over how your brain is initially programmed, as it is a result of your genes.   4. There are 2 ways through which a brain can change itself: By doing it on its own, in which case it was programmed to make that change from the start, or because of an input from the outside world.   5. You can't control the outside world. The only way you can change anything in the outside world is if your brain makes the choice to do so, because it was programmed to do so.   6. There's no way for you to change your fate, from the day you are born to you die, every decision you make is based on the initial programming of your brain and the world you were born into, nether of which you have control over.

Only ~7ish % of people support feminism, by making them look rediculous in the eyes of the "normies" and showing that a better alternative to feminism exists feminism will go further and further past the  breaking point, following the same path as the KKK in the US. The KKK is an accelerated scenario and follows the same tragectory as the rest of left-wing movements (not exclusive but invariable). Same path just at different speeds. Feminism is roughly the same point as kkk was around the civil rights movement in the US.	1643029300.0	hu0ib0p	t3_sbjq2r	t1_hu0fwml	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbjq2r/the_recent_misogyny_on_this_subredditaccording_to/hu0ib0p/

7bjndvbl	I get what you're saying and I can agree with a lot of it.  There is a difference between anti-women and anti-feminist. Anti-feminist doesn't mean wanting to get rid of women's rights, and definitely doesn't mean hating women. A lot of anti-feminists have been personally negatively affected by feminism and they should be allowed to vent and rant about their experiences. Anti-feminist women aren't the priority for this kind of thing, it's both men and women. Sure, we can be affected by it, but we're not the only ones. A lot more men are negatively affected by it.

5x9r4ntn	The movement for equality is egalitarianism, with men's rights and women's rights being branches of it addressing men's and women's sides of issues.   For the most part majority of the issues that have priority for egalitarians are men's rights issues as they are much more agregious than current women's rights issues. This can be summed up to feminism has and is pushing for depriving men of basic human rights such as due process rights in court, presumption of innocence, legal definitions that exclude the possibility of female perpetrators, being forced to pay child support for someone else's children.

Once women have to actually accomplish something they tend to quickly fall behind the men of the field in terms of skill.   Even if we ignore that, my argument against the whole "girls can do anything better than boys" is: then why don't they? If girls are so much better at everything then why haven't they accomplished anything on their own? Why haven't they made a better version of penicillin? Why haven't they developed stable nuclear fission energy? Why haven't they terraformed Mars?

55zca6ng	Same with this milder story from my own life a couple of months back. I was waiting in the hallway for class, and a girl, a year older than me in 11th grade started leering at me. First stared me in the eyes, made an exaggerated smirk, then looked down at my groin, and made another, more exaggerated and suggestive smirk.   For several months, she did some milder things. She would stand very close to me, less than a foot away, even when she had space somewhere else. I also caught her staring at my phone even when I turned away and clearly signaled for her to stop.  Now it is very mild, especially compared to other incidents I hear of, but imagine if, instead of an junior girl acting this way towards a sophomore guy, a junior guy did this to a sophomore girl.	1643046566.0	hu1nh4v	t3_sb6fkg	t1_htz80u8	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb6fkg/amys_tale/hu1nh4v/

99cker03	The thing is you need to frequently watch porn for a long period. Continuous frequent watch of porn will cause desensitization of anything you would find sexually appealing.  Yet you need to be full on hard core addicted to porn for that... If it was the case porn in general. just about all men and women would be affected by watching porn. Plus not I say again not everything regarding men revolves around sex. And maybe if thse women weren't so frustrating to deal with men wouldn't watch so much porn.	1643047051.0	hu1otuk	t3_sblvo9	t1_hu1c8xv	/r/antifeminists/comments/sblvo9/fds_at_it_again/hu1otuk/

The other one is a bit more highbrow and morally superior  You called me an incel which is funny because you've aces my worth as a human on my ability to get a woman for sex, you have just simultaneously sexualise me and objectified any woman, placing my human value as a sexual being and placing a woman's value as a sexual object, you are the very thing you claim to fight against.

It‚Äôs also possible that the reason why boys have lower grades than girls on average is maybe related to mental health since it‚Äôs mostly other men who hold men to a ridiculous standard of not expressing themselves.	1643049194.0	hu1um1x	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu11xxv	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu1um1x/
99cker03	By law women cannot be considered pedophiles and rapists. Thats why. See in the eyes of the law a woman fills a child out of pure love and compassion in want of a relationship. They pity her for her bad deeds. Rape of man from a woman is not even deemed possible because men are stronger that women by average. Plus their is this stereotype where a man can't get hard unless he wants to. Basically meaning rape of a man for a woman is impossible because be git hard meaning he liked it. When actually guys get hard as a reaction to something attractive. Even if you don't want to it would/could happen. Notice how sometimes a guy gets hard without even noticing it prime example. Which actually gives a extreme severity to male rape. Your body is enjoying something while your mind is screaming no. Tbh as a victim of rape as a man... That ficks you up in the head... bad...	1643049318.0	hu1uxub	t3_sb74vy	t1_hty4kv3	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/hu1uxub/

3s4lioa6	Eh men having more mental health issues isn‚Äôt quite right. I‚Äôm a woman on the autism spectrum and the reason why men get diagnosed more often than women with the disorders that you listed is because early research was only done on guys. Now it‚Äôs becoming more common for girls to get diagnosed. Back like 10 years ago it was thought that girls couldn‚Äôt have autism so I would have probably been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder or something. I‚Äôve also heard that statistically women attempt suicide more often, but men use more lethal ways so that‚Äôs why their commuted suicide rate is higher. Suicide is definitely a big problem for guys, but I hate that people say that women only attempt suicide for attention because men probably have more access to guns and at the same time, even the least deadly method can leave you in critical condition. I think women tend to use pills, and even though they may not kill you, they really can leave you brain damaged. And if someone does do that stuff for attention, that‚Äôs a mental health concern it self.

imdju7u6	Why was it believed that girls couldn't have autism though? I think because it's less socially acceptable for men to expree themselves and show emotion, and men guess sympathy for mental disorders, the effects of autism are more apparent, and they have more social consequences, in men than women.

35c0i	The rates of partner homicides didn't used to be that far apart. Then women got help and resources and the rate they killed their husbands dropped a lot. Men didn't get DV shelters they could use to protect their kids from their abuser without getting kidnapping charges giving the abuser an upper hand in custody, government funded help to allow them to get easy restraining orders, DV intervention public policy and programs that favored them, etc. Therefore the rate that husbands kill their wives hasn't dropped much. Maybe if we want to eliminate the desperate husbands in mutually abusive relationships killing their wives, we should give them better options. That would probably save a lot of women's lives just like doing it for women has saved a lot of mens lives.  "Gender Differences in Patterns and Trends in U.S. Homicide, 1976‚Äì2015" by James Alan Fox and Emma E. Fridel. The data comes from FBI statistics ("FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports, SHR").  https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vio.2017.0016?journalCode=vio&  Here's part of the conclusion that the authors came to:  > Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.  Here is a graph of intimate partner homicides by sex over the years from the study. Notice the trend for women as they got help vs men that didn't?  https://m.imgur.com/a/6Hx9dJt  God forbid we help men, even if it would save womens lives.   "The reason women need these resources and men don't is because more men kill their partners. We need more one sided services."

3s4lioa6	It was because back like 70 years ago the only test subjects being used for disorders like ADHD or autism were boys only, therefore the criteria for the disorders was based on boys only. As far as the symptoms go, men having more apparent symptoms isn‚Äôt because of mental health, it‚Äôs because of the fact that like I said the criteria for mental disorders was only based on boys and then there‚Äôs the fact that autism symptoms show up differently in girls. There‚Äôs studies that show that men and women with autism can camouflage their symptoms, but for some reason girls are better at it. But even though women can camouflage symptoms better, they often have more trouble with social interaction and behavior problems. So it‚Äôs not that mens lack of expression for mental health disorders makes their symptoms a more apparent. It‚Äôs more that it‚Äôs a gender difference in how autism presents. Some of the autism difference between the genders is attributed to the fact that women are more expected to be social. Like for example boys are expected to play with trucks and for girls it‚Äôs dolls. In a way, women are also the ones that are more expected to be quiet and submissive too. I‚Äôve heard that that‚Äôs also often the reason why they may not ask for promotions at work too.	1643052957.0	hu24nux	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu21ar4	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu24nux/

imdju7u6	But males with autism get ostracized by their peers and stereotyped as "loners". I do think it has to do partly with the empathy gap. Men with disorders get far less sympathy from their peers and they even get bullied for it. I think that's part of the reason why autism goes undiagnosed in women vs. men. Because it has less social consequences in women.	1643053369.0	hu25qpk	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu24nux	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu25qpk/

vw89l	Women are higher in agreeableness. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/)  This basically means they are more inclined to go along to get along. Let's not go making this a black and white issue either. Women TILT more towards agreeableness than men that doesn't mean every woman is more agreeable than every man.   Jordan Peterson describes it like this.   If you put 50 men and 50 women in a room and I asked you to pick the most agreeable person, if you picked a woman you'd be right 60% of the time.   Women also score higher in neuroticism (negative emotion - fear, anxiety) to about the same rate as above.   Seems to me these things go hand-in-hand. If you're more nervous, it's easier to go along to get along. You could also say that the more agreeable you are the more likely you are to go along to get along which would cause lower negative emotion due to the safety of the group and not standing out.	1643054489.0	hu28og1	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu1xcsy	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu28og1/

Those who are successful believe all women can be them, and it's not the case, otherwise they wont be  successful.    The reality is that Feminism is another excuse to shift the blame on others other then ourselves. And funnily enough, most over 30 single feminists are looking for exactly what they advocated against in their 20s ; to stop working and living at home and being provided for.   So yeah, The Patriarchy is an over inflated idea which doesn't exist anymore in the West. Otherwise, the 99% of men wouldn't be struggling as much as they are to be able to exist.      The Word "Patriarchy" in reality should be "the 1%", but since they dont seem to have a problem with billionaire women, then they make it about Men, and thats why they are completely and utterly wrong.	1643119600.0	hu5jlwr	t3_sc8fgi	t3_sc8fgi	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5jlwr/

5nwqhfks	A woman is very obviously someone whose genetics define that they are female. Archaeologists can identify females and males in long-dead societies because your gender permeates your entire being. It‚Äôs your identity. They can‚Äôt necessarily know what they thought in their head. You don‚Äôt get your own pronouns because you don‚Äôt get to dictate the rules of grammar. You don‚Äôt get your own adjectives, like I could under your model say that I identify as smart and good looking, and you must use those adjectives whenever referring to me. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs insisting that everyone bow at the temple of your feelings. And that‚Äôs horribly dangerous for everyone, but mostly for the one making the demands.	1643120107.0	hu5kpip	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5huek	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5kpip/

Your argument literally says that it's wrong to be trans specifically because of archeologists, language, and feelings are bad. That's genuinely what you said.

Bottom line is you feel whatever you want, but I do not need to bow at the altar of your feelings. Feelings don‚Äôt reign supreme, facts do.   Grammar changes from time to time but only at scholarly consensus. It has not actually changed significantly from the 90s, anyone who says so clearly has not studied the topic.

53xcxr4	A critical step in accessing the validity of any idea, is to consider possible risks, and whether those risks are acceptable both in terms of likelihood of occurrence,  and eventual impact... trust me, I know... I'm a man.  We've already seen reports of this happening in quite a number of settings, i.e Women getting raped by people who identify as women. So yeah I'd say the risk of occurrence of this negative side effect is pretty significant.  Also, thinking 'coolness' is a prime consideration when considering changes (even changes in collective reasoning) that could impact on the lives of other people just proves that you don't really understand the implications of the change... or you just don't care really... Or you're a child.	1643120802.0	hu5ma33	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5he3p	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5ma33/
9yqx6c0x	Patriarchy theory is the framework invented by feminists to showcase a perspective on why they feel that men are oppressive. When they say that "the patriarchy" is the cause of all of what they stand against, they mean that the society that they exist in has a oppressive structure fueled by masculinity, not necessarily men (that's why most non TERFs view TERFs as part of the patriarchy).   It also assumes that any dynamic between a masculine person and a feminine person, the victim is always the feminine person, and the perpetrator is always the masculine person. That's why they can sew very easily argue against the realities of violence of any type; it's not that they're correct, it's just that their worldview makes it to where any evidence to the contrary is irrelevant to them.	1643120870.0	hu5mfnw	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5giwb	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5mfnw/

5bz207z4	I've read your comments and can see what you actually mean by patriarchy and in the sense you mean it no we actually do not believe the patriarchy exists in your sense...   A contingent of men hold power and through that oppress women.   No it's not the case, you're taking a subset a 1% of 1% and extrapolating that to represent the whole of the male species of humanity.   The world doesn't operate in that way, you cannot take a fraction of a fraction and say see that applies to the group as a whole, if we could then we'd be justified in saying women are more dangerous to children and society because a small minority but growing number have had sex with children, because the data shows that women are more likely to murder their children than men and that number is greater again of the child is a girl.   That doesn't work though because we also know most women want a child, in fact most women, the general rule is that women who don't have at least one child by 35 desperately want a child enough that it becomes their main thought.   The patriarchy that feminists talk about is a boogeyman for the same reasons we don't label all women as dangerous to children, a fictional monster to generate funds that is all it is because that's all it is.   What they are aiming for with their boogeyman is to shame companies into promoting women at the expense of promoting men, here's the question, which ties into the fictional pay gap, if women are cheaper than men and producing the same quality of work then why does my team only have one woman, why am I employing whoever is the best fit for the job and not only employing women.   A patriarchical structure exists in most cultures simply out of historical context, before the Victorian era, women worked the fields and mines alongside men, they often died far earlier than men at this time, the reformers saw this as wrong and that women should be protected from a cruel world not exposed to it to suffer and die.   However way back before that men were still the dominant force in society purely because of competence, when fighting between tribes broke out it was the men who would fight, in some places women, but mostly it was men, simply because men are built for fighting.   Now what we have as a result of thousands of years of history is not so much a patriarchy but a heirarchy built of competence.   From an early age men know that we have no inherent value to society so we have to create it, we play as children to learn limits and what we are good at and not good at. We have to learn to be competent at things and grow knowledge and skills in those areas to advance.   That's why the majority of places have men at the top, because we have to, from and early age develop the skills and drive to rise to the top otherwise we have no value, we have to be competent at things and progress, as children we have a natural drive to be better than other kids and that competition forms and shapes us as we grow.   So you'll see more men at the top simply because we are playing out the way we learned to be when a child.   That doesn't mean any man wants to keep a woman out, sure there are some, but most are acting on competence levels.   Also you have to ask yourself this, if there was such a thing as the patriarchy doesn't it strike you as a little odd, I mean we men don't seem to have done a good job of it so far, women can vote, drive, work, earn their own money, they can file for divorce and get the better deal, avoid fighting in wars, claim assault and automatically be taken seriously, run a company.   I mean then in a patriarchical structure that exists to raise men up and oppress women where's the oppression when any woman can choose anything she wants to do and not be held back because she's a woman and in fact expect help from men along the way.   A woman running a company can choose to employ men, would men who want to oppress women work for that woman. A woman can fly a plane, would men who want to oppress women board the flight, when was the last time you got on a plane and wondered about the gender of the pilot or were you more concerned they wouldn't crash the plane.	1643121146.0	hu5n1ys	t3_sc8fgi	t3_sc8fgi	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5n1ys/

I read what you wrote. Kinda seems like you didn't read my response got mad and wrote this.  Ur a facts and logic person right? Lemme ask this, do your chromosomes 100% define you? Are you 100% the gender you were assigned at birth? Do you 100% act that way with no flaws or questioning? Because if so you've proven me wrong, but if not then I might just be right here.  Also do intersex people not exist then? Yknow the people who have three sex defining chromosomes. With that in mind whose to say they have to be 50/50 man and woman. What if it's 70/30, what of its 60/40.   Now if that is possible, do you think that it is at all possible for a person to be born with a brain hardwired to be a different gender, than the gender they were assigned at birth? Would that be at all possible or is it just all made up?	1643121324.0	hu5ngh3	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5m3vd	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5ngh3/
71ellra9	So here's the thing right. I decided to look up what you said. And the people who have done that, who identify as female to assault someone like that, I've found 3 cases, you make it sound like there are millions.  Now I will not deny there will be people who take advantage of it. But the people that do take advantage of it normally get punished for it. You ignored that part.  Also another thing, you said that I am ignoring the implications of change. When I'm embracing the change. Almost as if I know that there are consequences, it's almost like I know negative things can happen.  It's almost as if I'm a human like you. Listen I was pointing out that I said, someone identifies as a woman, and you immediately jumped to rape. All I pointed out was that's kind of an odd thing to jump to when someone talks about a trans woman.   Like what is that all you think about is rape? Because of so that's very weird. You didn't imply that you wanted a conversation about consequences you literally just accused anyone of identifying as a woman of being a rapist which is really shitty.	1643121630.0	hu5o60p	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5ma33	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5o60p/

5nwqhfks	Really? Well, if you‚Äôre an English major, then you should know that grammar has not changed significantly from the 90s. Colloquial English has, but that‚Äôs not the rules of grammar. Colloquial English is used in places like Reddit where it‚Äôs not always convenient to be completely grammatical. That doesn‚Äôt mean the rules change, just that there‚Äôs an exception.   > Do your chromosomes 100% define you?   Yes, because that‚Äôs what chromosomes are and what they do.   > Are you 100% the gender you were assigned at birth?  My gender was not assigned, no gender is. My gender was determined before my birth by my chromosomes, and discovered by doctors and my parents when I was born or slightly before thanks to ultrasound.   > Do you 100% act that way with no flaws or questioning?  Now this question is nonsense. You‚Äôre using a false dichotomy here. Being your actual gender does not demand perfection, like you demand it. Everyone has flaws. But there‚Äôs a scientific consensus on what make a man a man and a woman a woman. There are distinct features that distinguish the two. Features that so far you have completely been unable to quantify in any sense whatsoever. What is a woman? Well whatever you want it to be. No, that‚Äôs not how it works. If you‚Äôre an English major, then you should know that you can‚Äôt just simply make up grammar rules on your own. I can‚Äôt just decide to use periods wherever I want, or have a comma in the middle of a word. But what if I really deeply feel that the word ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù should be spelled ‚Äúgner,osti‚Äù? If I wrote every single word like that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand me and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand you. Basic rules must be at play in order to allow communication, or the function of grammar. Similar thing with gender. Basic rules must be at play in order for society as a whole to function.   As for the other examples you list, those are exceptions to the rules. They are exceptions because they exist in 1% of 1% of cases. It‚Äôs sad when they do exist because the person is unable to live a normal life, but the exceptions do not define the rules, and never should. Who‚Äôs to say that there should be a 50/50 genetic split? Biology. There‚Äôs two chromosomes that govern gender. You either have XX or XY. You can‚Äôt just have some random assortment. There‚Äôs only two possibilities. You seem to have forgotten the contents of your high school biology textbook. So no, a 70/30 gender split isn‚Äôt possible because there‚Äôs only two chromosomes. And no number of your opinions are going to change that.  So again, I ask you. What is a woman? What defines a woman as opposed to a man, or anything else you‚Äôd like to pick?	1643122556.0	hu5qdj9	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5ngh3	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5qdj9/

8c464qdh	Nah, that's your imagination. Patriarchy is pretty clear on its meaning. It's a statu quo, basically.  A system of social constructs. Understanding Foucault and Derrida makes a huge difference when it comes to avoiding confusing and applying wrong meanings to certain contemporary concepts. You don't need to like their thinking but you need to understand it.

3vspql5	Oh no, A patriarchy of sorts exists, maybe... depending upon how you define it. But if it does, it's one based upon competence more than power.   It all hinges on definitions. If you look at how much people make money-wise in society, and see all the men at the top (and bottom) compared to the lumping of women mostly in the middle, and you're a feminist, you assume patriarchy (by only looking upwards - i.e. wage gap).   But that ignores that the most and least competent people tend to earn the most and least amount of money. And that competence tends to skew in line with IQ. And that IQ distribution is broader for men than women, leading to more male geniuses and morons than female ones.  And that leaves you with a great hypothetical excuse for not being a genius/at the top if you're a woman (and also ignores men at the bottom), but doesn't actually prove the existence of a patriarchy.	1643123755.0	hu5ta87	t3_sc8fgi	t3_sc8fgi	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5ta87/

5x9r4ntn	On physiological response of males to crying females (in open access):        [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00111/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00111/full)   A quote from that paper's abstract: "Environmental experiences and genetic characteristics are associated with adult males' physiological responses to socially meaningfully stimuli."   It would be impossible to have this response if "patriarchy theory" or the "declaration of sentiment" of 1848 Seneca Falls Convention were anywhere close to truth.  The behaviour ascribed to men by "patriarchy theory" is generally ascribed to psychological and neurological abnormalities - i.e. not descriptive of the vast majority of people, men in particular.

860r8g8e	Many feminist support equal drafting. And the biggest reasons why feminist don't support equal drafting isn't because of the drafting itself but because [women are extremely likely to be sexual assaulted in the military.](https://nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/Military%20Harassment.pdf)  Especially since women are [twice as likely to get PTSD as men](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_women.asp).   It's not that women shouldn't be drafted, but the environment in itself. Women aren't being treated equally in the military so why should they be drafted equally? And the people who aren't treating women equally are men.   On top of that, even if women were drafted, [the standards of acceptance are fitted for men and](https://mwi.usma.edu/women-arent-problem-standards/) most women wouldn't drafted anyway.  Even more so, [more women support women being drafted than men supporting women being drafted.](https://sachsmedia.com/poll-americans-want-women-included-in-military-drafts/) So really, the people who are holding back an equal draft are republican men, as more [democrats support drafting women than republicans do.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/15/congress-might-require-women-register-draft-where-do-republicans-democrats-stand/)   So you're extremely over simplifying a huge issue.	1643135782.0	hu6pcwm	t3_scioy7	t3_scioy7	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hu6pcwm/

zlpln4o	I think you're leaving some things out that do speak to the inequality in the Selective Services.  As it stands right now, a man has to register for the Selective Services before the age of 26. If he does not, then he faces a felony charge and possible jail time. I think most people know this. However, what I see missing from this "huge issue" debate is everything else that comes with registering for the Selective Services.  Here are some of the other things that men miss out on when they doesn't register...  a.)**The ability to gain a security clearance.** Security clearances are not restricted to government employees. Most jobs with firms that support federal work require them. It's also one of the first questions on almost any clearance application supplied by the OPM.  b.) **You cannot work for the federal government**. Unless you have a legal exception, or can prove you weren't avoiding registering, you are barred from holding a job with any federal agency and some state agencies as well.  c.) **No federal grants\\loans**. This includes student loans and grant programs in 31 states.  This should be the heart of the debate surrounding this "huge issue" IMHO. Women are granted these "rights" at the age of 18 without having to register, whereas men have to to make a symbolic gesture to die for their country to gain the same privilege.  I am not saying that your points are invalid, but I am saying you're missing a big chunk of what the Selective Services actually does.	1643137904.0	hu6uz30	t3_scioy7	t1_hu6pcwm	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hu6uz30/

fvm6rs7n	Islam opposes all of the fundamental principles on which feminism is based. Feminists principles, are all without one single exception considered great sins in Islam. Islamic principles are all considered sexist in feminism. Islam and feminism are two ideologies diametrically opposed.  Feminism and the women's movement preceding feminism have been at conflict with Islam for over 200 years. They have justified intervention and wars in the Middle-East, Asia and North Africa as well as colonialism in these parts of the world, wars and colonialism that have cost the Muslim world millions of lives.  The war in Afghanistan is a great recent example testament to what I wrote above. Feminist NGOs and feminist organisations were very effectively used to justify that war. Under the guise of fighting for the rights of oppressed women in that country, feminist organisations like UN Women justified the war in Afghanistan, a war based entirely on lies driven entirely by ulterior political motives. 'Silence is violence' feminists cried out loud in support of the war on Afghanistan and its Muslim culture.  Feminism has never liked Islam and Islam has never liked feminism.  So what is with this feminists like Islamists nonsense that we sometimes hear in the West? Well, look to the source of this propaganda and you will understand it. Most of this propaganda originates from Jews/Zionists, Jews such as for example Lauren Southern aka Lauren Simonson. They have a vested interest in inciting hate against Muslims, hate which serves their political interests in the Middle-East.  This idea that Muslims like feminists and feminists like Muslims is nothing but Jewish/Zionist propaganda aimed at stoking hate in the conservative anti-feminist communities in the West for Muslims, hate that serves the interests of not anti-feminism, but rather the tribal interests of Jews.  I have been researching feminism for close to fifteen years now. In so far as religions are concerned, feminists have hated no religions more than they have hated and warred against Christians and Muslims. In these fifteen years, I have found feminists allied to only one religion of people Jews. Feminists love Jews and Jews love feminists.	1643138776.0	hu6xa4r	t3_scl334	t3_scl334	/r/antifeminists/comments/scl334/feminist_like_islamist/hu6xa4r/

If yes, provide a source to back up the claim.	1643139225.0	hu6ygzj	t3_scioy7	t1_hu6xtwy	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hu6ygzj/

8c464qdh	I get your point. But I am not sure the majority are as stupid, really. In my case, male, I'd say I do see the patriarchy as negative because I've seen staff. It took me a while to understand certain things because I don't experience them myself and women only tell you when they feel comfortable and intimate with you. Feminist girls or otherwise.  They either share them from their hearts and you get a chance to understand or they'll avoid talking about those not so cheerful stories; or use them as bullets against your antifeminists unsolicited arguments. Which cannot end up well as that's already a fight and you'll tend to argue against rather than empathising. It's like kids when they eat vegetables unwillingly: they won't like the taste even if it's literally tasteless. Willingly, they very well might and actually probably will when they get to be more mature.   Like I remember the fear I used to have when walking through a dark park by myself when I was a kid. There was a constant potential threat of violence or being subjugated. Now I am a 1.90m adult male, that's only a distant memory. But the change was immediate as soon as society started treating me like a man; it's not so related to be stronger and such. Now, following that logic, is it that difficult to understand that women never magically lose that fear? They are still threatened, basically. And it doesn't matter how many studies you show a boy of the real dangers of crossing parks at night or how unlikely it is they'll be killed or mistreated. That would go against their personal experience, you see. Social constructs of gender determine many conducts.  So, my point is it isn't easy to properly empathise with the feminine struggle when you are a guy. You actually have to make an effort. If your attitude is the exact opposite, making an effort to refute their perspectives, then you are basically doomed. Pretty bad strategy, particularly if you're heterosexual or enjoy the company and intimacy of women (half of humans) in any other way. Also, fighting against progress does never end well. You'll most probably be more of a feminist in 20 years than now, as society changes. Exactly as you probably are now more of a feminist than your parents. Otherwise, you'll live a very angry and extremist life when older; and that's too stupid and too much of an effort. So you will most probably adapt. Be water my friend and all that.   Just ask women about their subjective stories with an open mind. You'll always hear pretty horrible stories; even when they don't end up in actual rape, murder, getting paid less than a male colleague, etc. You wouldn't want to experience that; and you won't. Which can be a huge revelation that changes your approach to reality in many daily staff. Only after seeing multiple subjective stories you'll start seeing a pattern and understanding how it's a society's structural problem. And well, it also helps to at least watch an academic lecture about Foucault at least. Particularly if you use the expression 'identity politics' or follow media that push negative narratives around it. Again, you don't need to agree with Foucault. But it's fundamental in contemporary society. There wouldn't be a trump or Peterson without him either.	1643142834.0	hu7859r	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu6x939	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu7859r/

3wjd9	Actually, it was spesifically this difference in law that feminism was created to ensure existed. It's the original reason for feminism in the first place. See, back in the day when men got voting rights, most women did not want it cause it would force them to apply for the draft. Feminist was created because some women wanted to vote without registrering for the draft.  And they spesifically wanted it only for women, and for men to still be forced to register. It's why many did not support them. In fact many groups like socialists at first wanted stop work with women, but since these feminist women spesifically wanted inequality in that they wanted men to be forced to go die on the battlefield but not women.  It's the dirty little secret at the heart of feminism they don't want you to know; the very core, it's foundation and goal of creation was to ensure inequality and sexism towards men.	1643145136.0	hu7eb4m	t3_scioy7	t1_hu6vcvo	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hu7eb4m/

5fmhr4f0	PART TWO: We can point fingers in modern society and blame this or that segment of society for all the problems we want, but factually that‚Äôs folly.  The reason things like Patriarchy or Matriarchy happy have very little to do with sexism or men seeking to control women.  They are related to major changes to all of society, and trying to judge the actions of one part of the whole society in some kind of vacuum, without consideration for the larger issues of the lifestyles humans have chosen by necessity or by careful consideration, is ridiculous.  Women participated in creating the thing they are now calling the Patriarchy, as much as men did.  In fact, women probably participated more because they lived longer to pass on that culture as mothers and grandmothers.  So why is this crap happening now with feminism?  It‚Äôs happening because of the Industrial Revolution.  No matter what we think about our rapid pace of change, humans take a LONG TIME to change their ways.  Women were the ‚Äúperfect workers‚Äù when the Industrial Revolution started, and in the United States and most places in Europe, earned more than men, who were mostly stuck still working at farms.  It immediately changed their status in society.  We are only a couple centuries into the Industrial Revolution.  We can expect that women and men will be affected by the industrialization of society in ways that agriculturalist society wasn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs not a surprise.  When everyone is now a single person from the point of view of governments and businesses, that means family units are less important than they were to agricultural society.  That‚Äôs why our marriages don‚Äôt last and many traditional cultural standards are breaking down.  Feminism is a byproduct of a completely predictable change in society.  The reason it is irksome is that it claims to seek equality, while very obviously promoting unequal outcomes where women are placed in charge of society to a greater degree than men are.  Why is this wrong?  The answer is obvious if you have the historical and even prehistorical perspective that this is just an opportunity for egalitarian equality where age is much more important than gender or sex or marriage status, from the standpoint of most of society.  People are all looked at as universal cogs that can be male or female or have any gender expression they feel like, because it makes no difference to industry who they are at all.  Feminists are missing the point that getting back at men for perceived wrongs during millennia of agriculture, ignores that vengeance in general for things that happened generations ago, is pointless‚Ä¶and more importantly they are genuinely ignoring the status they now hold in society, which is often more valued than men‚Äôs position.  The very fact they have won so many battles for things like the vote and ownership of land, and control of nearly every aspect of their lives, is evidence that they clearly HAVE the power they are claiming they don‚Äôt.  More products are marketed to them, and made for them, than for men‚Ä¶which is a pretty significant measure of status in an industrialist society.  They win more often in political and social battles, I think at least those on this subreddit can agree.  This means feminism goes too far.  It is not asking for equality, but for a change back to the prehistoric standard of Matriarchy.  I would support feminism if it was actually about equality and it wasn‚Äôt blatantly sexist and even more obviously gender-biased.  Society doesn‚Äôt need a movement to push the pendulum harder in the direction it‚Äôs already going.  It‚Äôs perfectly okay that industrial and technological society doesn‚Äôt demand the same things agricultural society did.  We don‚Äôt need to destroy all culture so that women can feel they won, or so that they can revenge themselves upon men of the past they feel wronged by‚Ä¶we simply need to treat them with fairness and equality.  I honestly think we DO have this situation already, or if not, that it‚Äôs inevitable we will‚Ä¶UNLESS society shifts back toward the days of agriculture or we find some enormous innovation again to change all of society with some new way of life, different from the Industrial Revolution (or the Technological Revolution).  I can‚Äôt help but take a snipe at Karl Marx, and say he was one of the worst (self-professed) anthropologists of all time, for claiming Communism and Socialism are inevitable.  They clearly weren‚Äôt, or we would not have the endless battles that we have had between Communist countries and Capitalist countries.  Marx sought to frame an argument between Communism (which he made up), and Capitalism, but the world has always been largely Capitalist‚Ä¶especially if you include barter and use of bulk commodities as capital.  Communism is an imaginary red herring that was thrown into the reality that is Capitalism, which doesn‚Äôt have an easily framed or defined standard form like Communism must in order to exist.  No one is required to insist on Capitalism for it to work, but Communism is constantly enforced by harsh mandates.  If it were inevitable then it wouldn‚Äôt require any enforcement.  If you look at the way Patriarchy and Matriarchy are compared by feminists, you will see that it is much like the false argument Karl Marx made about Communism versus Capitalism.  He tried to frame Communism as the answer and the opposite to the problems of Capitalism, but really Capitalism is the natural state and Communism is the unnatural state he wanted to impose on people.  Matriarchy or the (actually unequal) feminist vision of Equality is not natural for our society at this point, because our society isn‚Äôt set up in a way that would make a feminist‚Äôs dream utopia possible.  We aren‚Äôt hunter/gatherers who live in tribal bands, but instead we are individuals who MOSTLY isolate ourselves in our own houses and our own small family units‚Ä¶Many of us, partly because of feminism, avoid the entanglements of even having a family.  This is a result of feminism for both males and females‚Ä¶Males, because they are forced to ‚Äúgo their own way‚Äù rather than submit themselves to women who seek power over them, and females, because feminism and the overarching society that promotes feminism, tells women to demand dominance wherever they go.  This insistence on domination is unrealistic in a society where there is no unit to dominate except the self.  They are fighting imaginary ghosts from the past, but by attacking the men of this time and place, who have no connection to that past unless it‚Äôs by historical accident.  Men must not accept this kind of insistence on domination, because beyond our mere shock at its unfairness, it‚Äôs also completely not in proportion to our modern reality.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if women want to revenge themselves or demand equal treatment, etc, because we aren‚Äôt all just living lives according to our own perfect volition.  We are all affected by the facts of our modern lives.  If we invented something tomorrow that made being in groups of 20 ideal for success in society, then people would live in groups of 20 and it wouldn‚Äôt matter what sex or gender they were‚Ä¶because that‚Äôs what our lifestyle would demand.  Women can‚Äôt demand what feminists demand because it‚Äôs unrealistic for what actually makes the difference for how society chooses to live.  The most they cause by claiming they want equality and actually insisting on dominance, is that they cause endless pain and suffering for those who want to adapt to the facts of our life in the present, and not stir up endless hatred for the people of the past, who were only responding to the conditions of their own time periods and lifestyles.  Feminists believe the Patriarchy exists, because they largely invented the term and they imagine it to mean whatever they want it to mean.  They don‚Äôt believe it exists for a good reason, at all, because they think it exists simply to cause them to be subordinate.  Their beliefs are not an accurate reflection of the reality of our society, but they use them for political gain, forcing changes that are not promoting equality, but are instead simply promoting women over men.  Nothing about that is something I can stand behind, and I feel fairly certain that in the long run they will be shown to be just a historical footnote to the people who realize that genders and sexes are not the most important thing defining us in an Industrial and Technological Era.  I just feel sorry I have to live through an era when many women take this misunderstanding to heart, and act on this poor misapprehension of the world‚Ä¶leading to great unhappiness for most people, male and female, across all of the social spectrum.  No one wins when feminism pushes people to abandon their seeking a social homeostasis within modern life.  Feminism pushes people apart and gives no answers for how to solve life‚Äôs current necessities.  That is why I am an antifeminist.  I can see it is nothing but harmful for the current state of the world.	1643145282.0	hu7ep30	t3_sc8fgi	t3_sc8fgi	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu7ep30/

5fmhr4f0	PART ONE:  I want to give an educated answer to this, if I can‚Ä¶to the best of my ability.  I studied Anthropology and I did Archaeology for the British Museum, so I have an answer that I think is based on knowledge.  The Patriarchy (or what is called that by feminists) is simply a product of the Agricultural Revolution.  Humans were matriarchal for MOST of human history on his planet, in a SENSE‚Ä¶Males have nearly always been chiefs and tribal leaders, but women have generally had more control in the balance of society, because the elders were normally female because men died earlier.  Women would -in essence- ‚Äúelect‚Äù the male leaders.  That was the balance in horticultural or prehistoric times.  Prehistoric times lasted from 7 million years ago to about 20,000 years ago, roughly.  Do the math.  Women ruled society to a significant degree for hundreds of times longer than the modern agricultural time period.  Agriculture was forced on humans by stresses caused by resources being occasionally scarce.  The most stressed populations started agriculture out of necessity, and it was an innovation that wasn‚Äôt a huge jump from horticulture, which they already understood, but it involved living in one place.  The relatively Matriarchal but egalitarian balance was shifted when agriculture began, because society required an enormous increase in labor, and one man can father many children.  This made individual men a more significant resource to society than the women they married or paired with.  Traditionally, women were the ones whose family name was given to the children.  That was true almost everywhere on the planet, at least the majority of cultures.  This is because people who didn‚Äôt do agriculture didn‚Äôt have as much of a need to know who their father was.  He was important to them, but they belonged to the clan of their mother, and most of the time her and her male brother or other relatives would teach the child.  After agriculture began, men needed to be in the equation because they did more physical labor requiring strength and labor was all done with muscle power, not mechanical power, so having muscles mattered.  Men also died because of working with animals like horses and oxen who pulled plows, etc.  The NUMBER of men was reduced beyond what it had been when they had been during hunting and gathering days.  In all societies everywhere, the numerical balance of men to women always has been very significant to which sex is more valued in society.  Men became more valuable according to the economic principle of scarcity.  There were less of them, and they did a significant proportion more work than women did, physically.  It may not be politically correct to have to accept this reality, but that‚Äôs why men became more significant in the system, to the point children were named after THEM, not women, and they were seen as the leaders of each family unit.  In addition, the family unit became more important to all of society because it was the logical unit for farming, because farms don‚Äôt work collectively (just look at the way Communist countries have repeatedly failed when they seek to collectivize farms).  Farms cause individual families to be separate from other families by way of having a particular house and a particular area of land to farm (or at least a proportion of the total land related to the work they do).  When families were living and working separately from other families, the male was the logical center of the family.  Often his labor was the thing that got the family their proportion of the grain they ‚Äúearned,‚Äù and the male head of the household was the one who made the most difference in that equation.

18q1w2ti	The issue I have with this is that it only focuses on power as who has wealth. Even when women largely had unpaid domestic roles they still had plenty of power in society, it was just a different power. Women organized the community and had social roles that effectively functioned as positions of power. The issue is that everyone's bought into the hyper-materialistic feminist definition of "power", which ultimately ignores or obscures the positive and special attributes that come with femininity and being female.	1643150175.0	hu7r58c	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu61miw	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu7r58c/

You can view the world through many lenses. You can think no one knows how rough you have it because you're a jew, or an arab, or a survivor of childhood sex abuse etc etc etc.   &#x200B;  If you can't see your own life through more than one lens you really are living in a fantasy world, reassuring validating and gratifying yourself out of being in touch with reality. If you have multiple lenses you see the world through, but cannot see it through anyone else's, you just don't have much capability for empathy and there are huge limitations to that.   &#x200B;  So yea, patriarchy is real, but it is not the defining characteristic of western society. Far from it.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  The rights of the induvial in general are under assault. Personally I don't give a shit about your rights to have abortions, if you're only allowed to because, just like the fetus, none of us have any rights as people.

The world's best chance to have a society that is not controlled by authoritarian forces lies with the democracy of America, but only ifnits people get their heads out of their assets, stop seeing things through just their lens, and see the bigger picture and what's at stake. If we stop letting them divide us they cannot tyranize us. Feminists will wake up to this more and more, as are we all.

This is the path people want and the best thing you can do if you disagree with it is to remove yourself from that path for a while and hope people wake up to how crap it is, or it changes in other ways.

35c0i	Let me know if you need more than this. Highly suggest you listen to the radio interview and read both the Scientific American and The Atlantic articles.   For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**   You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g.   Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206  > > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and   > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.   2010 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  *data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*  And non CDC study...  *A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  *a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*  And another non CDC study...  *National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‚Äòever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,‚Äô 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.‚Äù*  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  *when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù‚Äîeither by physical force or due to intoxication‚Äîat virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*   If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.    Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women‚Äôs rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn‚Äôt empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims‚Äô fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1643164076.0	hu8otpc	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu8nk4m	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu8otpc/

3hkm5mhu	What you have to understand is that it doesn't matter how much freedom there is for individuals in Nazi Germany if you are a Jew.     As a male, you are a second class citizen in the west, so that's what you have to weigh against any overall restrictions on your freedom, and then align yourself according to your moral point of view.     I enjoy alcohol every once in a while, but to me it's worth giving up to be treated with a little bit of respect.     I'd say in most Eastern European countries you will find better equality and freedom to do what you want.     At the moment my freedoms are restricted in two ways, both because I'm a male and because I refused to take the jab, so there are a LOT of countries that would provide more individual freedom for me, Albania for example.  For you it might be different based on what values you have and value.	1643166105.0	hu8tlg3	t3_scrxa1	t1_hu8i1ai	/r/antifeminists/comments/scrxa1/how_many_people_are_making_plans_to_or_have/hu8tlg3/

fnidh4yr	Because it‚Äôs a waste of my fucking time. You‚Äôre going to sit here and pretend the information I share is bullshit anyway. Yes, feminist do spread awareness for men being abused by women, they help break down the stigma and shame that men feel around it (breaking down toxic masculinity) Yes, we have pushed for NEW women only domestic violence shelters‚Ä¶meaning that there is still plenty on shelters for men and only men. Every mother I know has chosen to not circumcise their children and pushes for others to do the same. Feminists literally started the ‚Äúrape is rape‚Äù movement to change the description of rape under the law so it included men. Feminism pushed for paid paternity leave and got it for millions of company‚Äôs. We‚Äôre constantly trying to shine more light around rape culture and dismantle that, that involves men, especially men in prison. We‚Äôre fighting for outdated masculinity standard to be obsolete, this helps men just as much as women. It gets rid of these ‚Äúmen are tough. Men don‚Äôt cry‚Äù ideals, making more men feel comfortable to embrace their emotions and help with men‚Äôs mental health and suicide rates. Men want to spend more time with their kids? Great. Help get rid of this bullshit suburban ideal of men needing to take care of women, and help more women have a higher employability rate, then they can stay home with the kids while the woman works. It‚Äôs really an endless list. But misogyny runs deep and I doubt it‚Äôll make a difference	1643174991.0	hu9bzaf	t3_s8lkd8	t1_hu96w3q	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/hu9bzaf/
90r51b93	>Idk why feminism became the opposite of what it originally meant  Well hear me out on this one  Feminism was never meant to be equality for BOTH genders  It always meant equality for ONE gender  To give them what the other gender was getting, meanwhile completely ignoring what the other gender's problem was  If feminism was there for equality, they would have been focusing on both gender's problems equally  And also Egalitarianism wouldn't have been a thing in the first place  Its so infuriating that feminism even tho meant for female superiority (heck even the name has the word 'fem' in it) people still believe its for equality of BOTH gender, while its actually equality for ONE gender  Thanks for coming to my little TED talk, we might meet again someday	1643175414.0	hu9cqen	t3_scl1s1	t1_hu720c7	/r/antifeminists/comments/scl1s1/even_tho_im_a_feminist_what_happened_to_equal/hu9cqen/

3hkm5mhu	I can only speak about Australia because that's where I'm from, so using Albania as an example, you can enter Albania and leave if you haven't had the jab, In Australia you currently have to beg the government to let you out.  You can also speak freely about different treatments that aren't pushed by the jab companies.  I also might be loosing my job pretty soon, Albania has none of these restrictions.     On the feminist side, in Australia we just had a guy go to jail for 5 years because the woman who sexted him and begged him to come to her hotel to have sex supposedly changed her mind mid thrust because he had an Uber waiting to take him home after the act.  Albania is still Islamic to an extent so you can imagine their laws are very fair to men.     All those things are pretty big to me.  Bodily autonomy, employment, freedom of movement, freedom of speech and the ability to have sex without risking a prison term.     If you can point anything out about Albania that's restrictive please do, but once again, there might be something but I doubt it will conflict with my personal values.     I've also used Albania as an example but there are many other countries in Europe, South America and even in Asia that have more freedoms than at least Australia.  No sure about the USA.  Maybe that will depend on the state, but certainly if you want to get married and have a family you are a moron if you do it in the USA as far as I can see.	1643176008.0	hu9drh5	t3_scrxa1	t1_hu93czm	/r/antifeminists/comments/scrxa1/how_many_people_are_making_plans_to_or_have/hu9drh5/

There's absolutely zero chance America will be invaded externally, it has no enemies at the border and if someone decides to invade most Americans would be happy to pick up guns and defend it, so as it stands any war they have every been to or will be is ideological / money grab by the military complex that you'll never see.     So if the degenerate in chief you have currently decides to go to war with Iran because women can't drive there, you'll have to fight and die.

Check reliable news sources for the latest details on it.  But that's what the entire "controversy" is all about.  Women/feminists fighting for decades to be "equal" to Men.  Then they throw a fit whenever they get their wish, but only when it's not in their favor.  ***You can't have it both ways!***  This proves they don't *really* want "equality" but preferential treatment which, ironically, they've always had anyway.	1643184356.0	hu9q2t0	t3_scioy7	t1_hu9pd1l	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hu9q2t0/

i3qu67mg	Maybe one day the feminists will find out, that it's not worth fighting through a mans-world, elbowing, and want to relax and let themselves go and be caught in a strong mans arms. And feel feminine, feel soft like a woman.   Choice is completely overrated. Yes, I can choose a life 10x as hard as mine, just to prove that I'm able to make decisions. And what have I achieved then? I'm exhausted and have not seen my kids grow up. Feminists call this a choice. Haha.  Thanks for the thumbs up.

But it is not all black and white (in two literal senses)  Having a spot "just for the boys" or "Just for the gals" is in my personal opinion harmless, because both sides gain some community in their respective groups without basing their lives around these spots.

fvm6rs7n	This post deserves far more upvotes and far more attention that it has gotten so far. It exposes the manipulative and deceptive strategies that feminists use to promote their interests, interests that trivialise and justify, and therefore promote inequalities, sexism and violence, the opposite of what they claim to promote in public.   She has written this article of her's in such a way as to be as vague as possible. This strongly suggests that there is a lot she is hiding.   One of the most interesting 'strategies of containment' that she has highlighted in this scandal of an article, is 'brining male victims of domestic violence within existing services'. Why would they do such a thing? How does this serve their strategies to maintain domestic violence as a women's issue. Well, this can be done in a number of ways. She has indirectly referred to one in this abstract of hers. Namely, 'nothing the troublesome line between perpetrator/victim for women'. As in, they get men to use their services and portray them as victimisers and their victimisers as victims, passing domestic violence afflicting men at the hands of women as domestic violence afflicting women at the hands of men. This is evidence that feminism is actively engaged not only in corruption, but also in protecting and facilitating violence, as well as in manipulating statistics.	1643194110.0	hua25e4	t3_sb0itu	t3_sb0itu	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb0itu/feminist_paper_admits_that_feminism_has/hua25e4/

8qfga	Hey, thanks. I try to focus on how feminists who have institutional power have actually fucked over men historically and continue or at least attempt to do so. It cannot be defended just by saying it‚Äôs a Twitter feminist or ‚Äúvocal minority‚Äù. Though I do enjoy seeing posts calling out the average feminist.  You make a good point by reading between the lines and I agree with your thoughts too. Another disgusting thing is how these actions are portrayed as heroic and necessary. We could have had shelters for men and women but all they‚Äôve succeeded in doing is secure funding for one gender. It‚Äôs not surprising that ‚Äúobstructionist‚Äù men fought against their lies and manipulative tactics. This is not something feminists should be proud of in any way.   Mary Koss was and influential person behind sexual abuse statistics. A person who does not think a woman can rape a man. It‚Äôs where the 1-in-5 college campus females have been sexually assaulted or raped came from, to try to frame it as a gendered problem. I believe UCLA used her same methodology for men and found that it‚Äôs ~20% of males.

3qwrldat	It's impossible to logically disprove (or prove) religions and conspiracy theories.  The main element of both is a god or a secret society, with shared attributes:  1. You can't objectively find God, lizard people or "the patriarchy". You can only believe in them.  2. The believer themselves decides what are the attributes of God, lizard people or "the patriarchy", what powers they have and what are their intentions.  3. These attributes are intentionally chosen to explain something real.  4. The believer sees that the entity they imagine   5. If another believer chose other attributes of the entity, and came to other conclusions, they can be pronounced "heretics" or "not real feminists".  Example 1: Zeus is described as someone who lives on Olympus and can create lightnings with his hands. Then, actual lightnings are used as the proof of Zeus' existence.  Example 2: "The patriarchy" is described as a society of men and it's main purpose is to oppress women and benefit men. Then, actual differences between women and men are used as a proof of the conspiracy's existence.	1643198962.0	hua8zjx	t3_scqc8n	t1_hu8n0cq	/r/antifeminists/comments/scqc8n/theyre_predictable_like_clockwork/hua8zjx/

fvm6rs7n	Nothing lasts forever, u/ExMuzzy and evil is always self-destructive. It hastens its own demise. You can be sure the dirt will come out.     Fifteen years ago when I first started this journey of mine in gender politics, I remember people scoffing at the idea that feminism is bad. Today, most people are willing to entertain this fact, this thanks in large part to the sacrifices of people in the anti-feminist and men's rights movements that have slowly exposed feminism and its evils to the world. Feminism is responding to this exposure with more lies and other such abuses that are greatly serving the anti-feminist/men's rights cause.     I wrote this following passage a couple of days ago under a post pertaining to domestic violence. For some bizarre reason, it does not show to anyone but myself. it is relevant to this post of yours, specifically to the point that you raised about feminism promoting sexism in services pertaining to domestic violence.     Feminists have since the 1970s opposed domestic violence shelters for men. They have waged a very successful war on multiple fronts against any and all services dealing with domestic violence dedicated to men. These efforts of theirs have cost men their lives.   Take for example the story of **Earl Silverman**, a story which you might already know. Earl was a Canadian victim of domestic violence at the hands of an abusive wife. He sought shelter, but struggled to find any that would welcome him because of his gender.     After leaving his wife, Earl set up a charity and shelter for abused men in his own home, a shelter and a charity he was forced to finance himself. For 15 years prior to creating this shelter of his, he had campaigned for funding from the Canadian government. He was refused that request by institutionalised feminism. Feminists fought his efforts to fund his charity every step of the way. This article that you posted here explains why. They clearly find men's groups a threat to their hegemony.     In 2013, after spending the entirety of his savings on running the charity and after being driven to financial ruin and losing his house, thanks to a culture of ignorance towards men‚Äôs issues and thanks to feminist oppression, he took his own life.     Following his death, a feminist journalist wrote a now famous article titled **‚ÄôFeminism didn‚Äôt kill Earl Silverman‚Äô** in which she blamed his death on demons in his life. Such is the criminality of feminism. They weren't content only with denying him shelter from abuse, standing in his way, denying him the right to finance his own, driving him to financial ruin and killing him, no, they went after him and his reputation, as to save their own, even after his death.     If you haven't heard of Earl's story before, I urge you to look it up.     From the 1970s , feminists have successfully campaigned to have domestic violence shelters ban men. They did not stop at banning men from using domestic violence shelters. They included in their ban all boys, if I remember correctly, over the age of 11. Yes, they even banned male children from seeking shelter from violence. It gets worse. Here in the UK, they extended their ban to work as well. They banned men and male children from working at domestic violence shelters. These are all little known about facts.     Men and boys are often not only forbidden from using domestic violence shelters, they are forbidden from working in them and feminists are the main architects of this discrimination. They accomplished these efforts of theirs by successfully changing the laws in the countries in which they operate such that they would allow discrimination against men, but forbid discrimination against women as in for example through the falsely named Equality Act 2010 of the UK, the first law in the UK that legalised discrimination.     Individuals such as Erin Pizzey, founder of the first domestic violence shelter in the world, tried opposing these changes. Feminists destroyed her life for these efforts of hers. They picketed her lectures, surprised the publication of her books and even threatened to assassinate her. No, I am not joking. A feminist, British terrorist organisation, involved in bombings in Britain in the 1970s and 80s threatened to bomb her home.     Using terrorism, feminists managed to eventually drive Erin out of Britain. She and her family immigrated to avoid getting killed by feminists. She returned to the UK after spending fifteen years in exile. Hardly anyone knows about these issues.     Point of interest: Women's Aid, one of the largest feminist organisations in the world, has for decades successfully opposed gender neutral services for domestic abuse.   Feminist corruption in domestic violence does not only affect men , but women as well. Women's shelters are full of violence and sexual abuse. Rape and violence by women against other women is common in these shelters, many of which largely operate in secrecy and underground, away from the limelight, away from accountability.   Not many people know this, but domestic violence shelters operate largely underground and in near total secrecy. This acts as a cover for any abuses that go on inside these shelters.     I hope that men and women never forget what has been done to them by feminists, that when the time comes for feminism to fall that people remember what was done to them by this ideology of ruthless, sociopathic, psychopathic cretins, that they punish them hard and perhaps for the first time in human history impose a system that holds bad women accountable for their transgressions, a system of accountability the absence of which I do not doubt contributed significantly to the rise of feminism.	1643200535.0	huablh5	t3_sb0itu	t1_hua6bpo	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb0itu/feminist_paper_admits_that_feminism_has/huablh5/

I remember at one point, people bashed men for getting on "ladies" only coach, but there wasn't - and still isn't - a dedicated one for men.  There is "Pasarnita", where women are given the opportunity to do business, but none for men.  Even the education is slowly poisoned with the ideas of how women have it hard than men, when that's not the case anymore, and it's actually the other way around. There are less boys in class and universities, and yet women are still the focus, because it's less work to deal with a non-problem.

1fax70th	You literally cannot change your genetic configuration in that manner. If gender is a matter of self-identification, and by your own assertion, can be changed and altered, then *how can it be changed and altered?* Because if I identify as a "man" then certain things must be variable in order for me to identify as a "woman." (Change and alter)   Also, if gender can be changed or altered, then anyone who is sexually female but identifies as male can choose to stop identifying as male and identify as female; also anyone who is sexually male but identifies as female can choose to stop identifying as female and identify as male. This means that gender is a personal choice.  If gender is a personal choice, how can it be a social construct? It's an individual construct at that point- meaning that society cannot determine for you or for me what gender is or means. That is why you cannot define what a woman, or a man, is. And if those words are as non-descript as posited, then they serve no purpose in the discussion writ large.  However, if they do, then gender must be something definable and the usage of the words "man" and "woman" must serve some descriptive purpose that defines two different sets of characteristics used to define two different categorizations of people.

Considering if you sit there, you can take your hijab off because there are only women for example. They do this in restaurants in the Gulf as well, among other places.

a7dxasqy	>The trial is still ongoing...  I don't know what you mean. She was [fully acquitted of all charges](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thesun.co.uk/news/13392966/mum-cleared-sex-boy-onlyfans-hate/amp/).  >Men have more rights tf, rape culture caters towards men in most countries far more than women, where'd you get that idea from?  Manifestly wrong. Look at the relevant legislations in most countries. Chances are, the laws and public polices pertaining to sexual violence are gender-specific, some more extreme than others.   Take India for instance, where virtually all sexual offences concerning adults are gendered. Men are not recognised as possible victims by default, solely because they're male and regardless of any other circumstances.   Take a read at this [appalling case](https://www.opindia.com/2021/08/teenage-girl-gets-pregnant-after-forcing-younger-brother-to-have-sex/). A 16 year old girl who was addicted to porn forcibly raped her 13 year old brother repeatedly and got pregnant consequently. Inexplicably, her younger brother (who is rightfully the victim) was sentenced and thrown into a juvenile detention centre whilst the rapist was deemed as a victim.   Contrary to popular narratives, relevant literature has found remarkably high prevalence of male sexual victimisation and female perpetrated sexual violence. In fact, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), which suggested the famous "1 in 5 women have experienced completed or attempted rape" statistics also continuously found rough gender symmetry with regards to the proportion of victims and perpetrators by gender (previous 12 months prevalence).   NISVS [2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.  NISVS [2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.  NISVS [2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.   Do note that the headline rape statistics are often [misleading](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/) as the CDC classifies forced penetration (rape) and forced envelopment (made to penetrate) as two distinctive types of sexual assault, notwithstanding the fact that 'made to penetrate' scenarios also constitute rape under US federal laws. This means that female - male rape is omitted from such datasets.   Strong scientific evidence estimated that **at least** [1 in 6](https://1in6.org/) men have been sexually abused or assaulted. It is also well-established that while sexual violence is one of the least reported type of offences, male victims are relatively much less likely to report their victimisation. Among many factors, male victims are less likely to recognise that they have been sexually abused.   For instance, a [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-03012-005) found that only 16% of men with documented histories of sexual abuse considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of women with documented histories in the same study.	1643205962.0	huamb6o	t3_sd4n19	t1_huah4jk	/r/antifeminists/comments/sd4n19/women_dont_need_feminism_i_guess_they_have_100/huamb6o/

3vspql5	By dictionary definition.  >1 A social system in which the father is the head of the family.  >2 A family, community, or society based on this system or governed by men.  >3 Dominance of a society by men, or the values that uphold such dominance.  Obviously Feminists use number 3 or inspired it. But what does 'men dominating society' mean?   **Men controlling the vote?** One person one vote, and there are more women than men.  **Men in power?** Women voted to place them there.  **Men in economic power?** Women control somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% of domestic spending, so that isn't it.  See, the problem is in what you mean.It quickly devolves into things like, "Women feel less safe in society." Which on the surface seems right, until you realize things like:  Majority of violence is committed against men.   Rapes, when properly defined as unwilling/coerced genital contact regardless of penetration, happen equally to men and women.  Prison sentences for men for same crimes as women are longer.  And so on. That's not the earmarks of a society dominated by/for the benefit for men. Women are coddled, their feelings given primacy over facts. **They may not have visible, elected leaders in equal numbers as for men, but society runs for the benefit of women way more than it does for men.**	1643208708.0	huaspn5	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5u4nb	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/huaspn5/

iz5lf7m4	More to the point, if he asks again, wouldn't she just lie again? Somewhere along the way he should have realized something was wrong and walked away. But the whole thing never happens if she doesn't lie. This story and others like it are why I don't advocate for online dating. It is too easy to be deceived and put in an awful situation. He should have been smarter. But brains do not fully develop until 25 or so and to me that should be the legal age of an adult. 25. I hope he learns from this and makes wiser decisions. And as to keeping kids off of the internet that is what parents are for. And making sure your kids have good friends who protect each other. 12 year olds should not be on dating apps.	1643211544.0	huazxo0	t3_sd4n19	t1_huaxkir	/r/antifeminists/comments/sd4n19/women_dont_need_feminism_i_guess_they_have_100/huazxo0/

7fzfkpaa	Before I respond, I wanna say, those aren‚Äôt rights. If you think they are rights, show me where in the Bill of Rights or the Constitution it says anything resembling ‚ÄúMen may walk to their cars at night while women may not.‚Äù  -I can‚Äôt walk to my car at night. Women seem to think men aren‚Äôt afraid of the dark. And that mens‚Äô skin can deflect bullets. I‚Äôm just as scared of going out at night as you are.    No, but you don‚Äôt either.    I literally wear the identical outfit every day with maybe a change in jackets. So yes, but not for the reason you implied.   Yes I can. And so can you.     Women get paid less on average. If you want to raise the average, get a higher-paying job you‚Äôre uninterested in and will hate.    Yes they are. That‚Äôs the only thing I concede to you up until this point. Though that isn‚Äôt a right.    Sorry, can you elaborate on the sterilization thing? I‚Äôd like to know more.    You think birth control should be covered by insurance?    Not just the draft. There are two. The other one is circumcision. Constitutionally, (and I‚Äôm referring to rights, not privileges) girls can‚Äôt be circumcised. But boys are routinely and traditionally circumcised. Female circumcision type 1 is the same as male circumcision. But that‚Äôs still banned. Go on r/circumcisiongrief and you‚Äôll see all the depressing stories the people there tell about their circumcisions. It‚Äôs saddening that men have to live with the fact their parents paid someone $500 to strap them down and ruin their sex life forever.

This dude somehow looked at her saying she is 16 and went yeah checks out.  You can ALWAYS find out someone's age. Idk what point you're making but she was raped and that's it. Are you saying that he should face absolutely no reprocussions even though morally and legally he raped this little girl?  Or the example you gave, they could've checked everything to make sure she was an adult and yet they still fucked her.

5jkmzj6q	Right i said personal freedoms not just rights. Its not just about what rights you have on paper but what personal freedoms you are afforded  Yes you might feel the fear of being robbed or shot but thats only in neighborhoods where that occurs. You also wont be blamed for crimes you fall victim to. Women will be. ‚ÄúWhy were you alone at night‚Äù   Women are forced to wear makeup. You can be fired for it and theres nothing women can do about it. Its legal to make women conform to a companies beauty standard.  Women are not afforded that luxury. Back to the companies beauty standard. Women have to conform to different dress codes than men. Some companies still dont let women wear pants.   No women cant run with headphones in. Because if someone decides to attack her the first statement will be ‚Äúwhy did you have both headphones in?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou need to be aware‚Äù back to that whole women are to blame for their assaults  Women are paid less for the same positions with the same qualifications. Like thats not something that will change with a career change. Heck now judges are blocking people from being allowed to change jobs.    Women cant be sterilized if they dont already have children. Even if they have children they have to have their husbands sign off on it. Even if the women have ovarian cancer getting the care they need is almost impossible. Women are more likely to be ignored in the medical field in general. Its horrible but women constantly have their problems dismissed as being hysterical or over reacting to their issues and end up dying from heart related problems at a much higher rate than men. Honestly the medical field is really really bad for anyone who isnt a white male. Medical text books often over look symptoms that are common in female and poc patients. Womens symptoms are often much different than mens.    Im sorry but if viagra and erectile disfunction treatments are covered by insurance treatments for women‚Äôs issues like pcocs and heavy periods which can be treated by birth control should be too.    Fgm and circumcision are different. Fgm is the complete removal of the clit and often the stitching of the vaginal opening to cause pain in intercourse. The facts on male circumcision in lots of forums like that are heavily misinformed. You do not lose size while hard only flaccid. Which i guess is something if you are insecure but the size of your penis while hard is the same whether or not you are circumcised. Sorry i know that‚Äôs disappointing for a lot of people who need someone to blame for size. Size is nothing to be ashamed of and there are tons of ways to increase sensitivity. Circumcision has medical reasons for men. My husband had to be circumcised as a teenager because of his head not being able to come out of the foreskin i forget what its called but it caused a ton of pain and he had to deal with a ton of pain as a result of the later in life circumcision. I made the choice to prevent that happening to my son because disorders like that are genetic.	1643213879.0	hub67c2	t3_scioy7	t1_hub1vh3	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hub67c2/

Regardless of if she lied there are many different ways they could have checked. You know like going through the legal system instead of just trusting what's in front of them.

She had a valid Florida Drivers license with her photo on it and a birth certificate.   > They raped her and that's morally and legally.  She was 16. He was early 20s. That is legally rape in Florida.   Morally? Nope. She went out of her way to defraud a porn company and sent a poor guy to prison through no fault of his own. If I remember correctly, the judge was leinient and he only got a few months which I'm sure you think is just a case of another rapist being treated too easily though.	1643214439.0	hub7r5v	t3_sd4n19	t1_hub6z19	/r/antifeminists/comments/sd4n19/women_dont_need_feminism_i_guess_they_have_100/hub7r5v/
7fzfkpaa	That‚Äôs cool. Sure you said personal freedoms. But I asked you for rights.   Yes I will lmao. I don‚Äôt go outside at all - not just in the neighborhood.   You‚Äôre ‚Äúforced‚Äù to do that? That sucks. Do you have a link to like an article about it or..?   Oh yeah huh. That sucks. But also, that‚Äôs not a right or in this case a lack thereof - it‚Äôs a company policy. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt work there.   So you think men have a force field around them that prevents them from being attacked when they aren‚Äôt paying attention? Also, you do need to be aware. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs your fault though.    Oh. Can you give me an article link to that?    Oh yeah my sister told me about that. She said that‚Äôs also the reason men (boys) are diagnosed with autism. ADHD, and shit that at higher rates. Girls have different reactions and symptoms but we use the template we use for men because we assume everyone is the same.    Fair enough. I concede.   Female circumcision type one, as I said before but you seemed to ignore, is the same as male circumcision. It cuts off the hood of the clit.    You actually just tried to defend circumcision and you did it to your son. Wow. I thought if you wanted equality, you‚Äôd at least admit circumcision is a barbaric practice done on literal babies with the excuse of medical purposes. But no. You mutilated your son. You cut his foreskin off and removed 30% of the sexual sensation he would‚Äôve felt otherwise. His penis will become shriveled because his foreskin isn‚Äôt constantly lubricating it. He‚Äôs gonna develop a callas from rubbing the head of his penis against his clothes. You claim you want equality when you‚Äôre part of the problem, you‚Äôre part of the reason men have less rights than women in the first place. And the worst part is, you forced your son to be a victim of it. But you‚Äôre still gonna claim it was medically necessary. Because it doesn‚Äôt affect you and you don‚Äôt wanna believe you tortured your son. All it matters to you is whether you prefer cut or uncut.    What your husband had is called phimosis. You can use creams to get rid of it. There‚Äôs no need to mutilate your genitals. Your husband got scammed into ruining his sex life.	1643214573.0	hub84bn	t3_scioy7	t1_hub67c2	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hub84bn/
5bz207z4	Ok so for anybody who is interested in what mgtow is, this comes from somebody who is mgtow  It stands for men going their own way  We only have a few rules, which to be fair aren't hard and fast rules, each man choses for himself  No marriage  No cohabitation  Do not raise another man's child  Do not support women with time or resources  You are the sovereign of your life, in control of it and responsible for it, success is by your hand so is failure, you are not a victim.   These rules apply in a very loose form, there are many mgtow I know who are married and know if this one fails they won't marry again.  There are many mgtow who we call monks, they have totally opted out of society and have buggered off into the woods.  There are the greatest number of mgtow like myself who date women but refuse the idea of marriage or living together due to laws being what they are.  Living with a woman in many parts of the world carries the risk the state can claim a marriage of sorts and then a breakup often leaves you liable for costs well into the future.  Getting married, well if you're a man and don't know the laws as they apply in your country you should, but when men in their country do find out the laws most reject marriage anyway.   Look at it this way, divorce rates are between 50-60% of all marriages in the west, 80% of those are started by the wife, 97% custody is awarded to the wife automatically leaving the father having to pay thousands just to get to court to ask for access.   We say awalt meaning all women are like that, of course not all women are like that but given women don't wear a badge telling you their intentions, given social media is awash with messages telling women they should be like that and government uses divorce as a way of actually making money it's best to treat any woman as though she is like that until she has proven otherwise.  Let's ask the men of this sub then, would you buy a car where the moment you've signed the contract the car will break down on its own decision 50-60% of the time. If it does you will loose the car no matter how well you treat the car. The car can decide it no longer wants you as the driver and if it does you'll have to go to court, the costs of this are at least half your income, half your pension.   Would you buy that car, of course not so why sign a contract to get married when the costs are so much worse.   Think also on this point, every man who goes through divorce, every man who's ever gone through a divorce whether he treated his wife well or not always thought she'd never do that to me.   That's what mgtow really is, taking a logical cost benefit analysis of the state of relationships and the state of the world and choosing a different way to live, not accepting the rules society places on people to get married, to start a family or to support the children of another man..  So the biggest question here is this, why is this acceptable for women but not for men.	1643214610.0	hub87zl	t3_sd4qvx	t3_sd4qvx	/r/antifeminists/comments/sd4qvx/dont_know_if_im_allowed_to_post_this_but_if_i/hub87zl/
71ellra9	Yeah it is holy fuck that's horrendous. And if they are that dumb to not go further to check then they shouldn't be making porn in the first place.  Morally anyone having sex with someone underage is rape no matter the circumstance. All rape is rape and it should be treated as such.  And "poor guy" nah why does he wanna fuck a teen if he's in his twenties? That's insanely gross, he should've looked for someone his own age now someone who is 19. It's HIS fault that he raped a 16 year old, no ifs ands or buts about it.	1643214664.0	hub8d6g	t3_sd4n19	t1_hub7r5v	/r/antifeminists/comments/sd4n19/women_dont_need_feminism_i_guess_they_have_100/hub8d6g/
5bz207z4	I made a post to better explain mgtow.   People live to see us as a hate group, yeah we do get those types but they are usually in the rage phase, their relationship has failed and they are being reamed by the courts and they find out nobody gives a shit, that does tend to make people angry.  We generally band together to help them vent and then figure out other ways to live their lives and find happiness.   Usually you'll find after that passes mgtow to be quite a chilled out relaxed bunch who just want to live in pace and do our own thing.	1643214741.0	hub8krj	t3_sd4qvx	t1_hub6v41	/r/antifeminists/comments/sd4qvx/dont_know_if_im_allowed_to_post_this_but_if_i/hub8krj/

tj5u7	Because women from antropology standview are designed to get and men to provide sexual fulfillment. One must give something for another to receive. That is why men with rich sexual life often induce sense of grief (?) from other people (cause it looks cringe for one to brag about how many girls he did or not have) and women with rich sexual life have an inflated ego to an astronomical degree.  Therefore, when something is missing in male's sexuality - ppl are making fun of it but when some woman is not fulfilled seuxally there is a serious brainstorm coming like as if it was life threat for her.  Taoists have known this 2 thousand years ago.	1643215401.0	hubaflh	t3_scn4jq	t1_hu88rg8	/r/antifeminists/comments/scn4jq/oh_no_imagine_father_showing_her_daughters_dildo/hubaflh/

Tell me, man hater, do you also lay the blame at the feet of men who have sex when they are drunk even if the woman is sober or equally drunk? If rape is rape period, then again, lying to have sex is coercive rape according to how feminists wanted the law written.

Pretend you are male thinking about all of this. Pretend you have to view the world with the absurd level of due diligence you think is necessary.

But you‚Äôre ignoring it to push your narrative that it isn‚Äôt the same thing.    Also, what do you have to say about the doctors in literally every other part of the word except North America and Africa that male circumcision has no benefits? Even if it did have benefits (which it doesn‚Äôt) it‚Äôs not your body. It shouldn‚Äôt be your choice. You should‚Äôve waited until he was an adult. But it doesn‚Äôt affect you anyway, does it.

h2jt1i58	Feminism = benefits women, excludes men  MRA = benefits men, excludes women  Egalitarian = benefits all, excludes no one  It's not possible to strive for equality while favoring, it's literally not possible.  Feminism is about achieving things ("rights" or what have you) *specifically for* women.  That's not equality.  The male version is not either.  You can not be treating things as equal when you focus on one more than another, it's fundamentally and literally not equality.  If you are fighting FOR equality, you *treat* all equally, feminism fundamentally does not and never has, in fact no singular movement ever has.  Example, abortion. It's not equal to only focus on one side of the issue, which is what feminism does.  While you look at MRA's who are still fighting for men specifically, not women, still hold the notion of fix it for *both* men and women, while feminism ignores men's issues in that area.  Feminism will say "our body our choice" and it basically ends there.  While MRA's tend to say "Your body, you're choice, but also my life/wallet, I want a choice too"  Exact same topic, one is being significantly more considerate than the other, but it's still to favor and focus on men despite being fair to women.  If feminism were about equality, they would give weight to what men say about their issues that are also wrapped up in women's issues, but they flat out do not at any level.  It's rare a feminist is cool with men "winning" at the same time as they do.	1643217270.0	hubfpig	t3_scl1s1	t1_hu720c7	/r/antifeminists/comments/scl1s1/even_tho_im_a_feminist_what_happened_to_equal/hubfpig/

If you‚Äôre a feminist, you support bodily autonomy. Why doesn‚Äôt bodily autonomy apply to your son? Because he‚Äôs a male? Because you want to feel powerful?	1643217786.0	hubh6pj	t3_scioy7	t1_hubgww9	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hubh6pj/

5jkmzj6q	Im not a feminist. Im an equalist. Like a legit equalist. Because i know the condition my husband had is genetic and caused him a ton if pain and later scaring because his foreskin was actually attached to the tip of his penis not something that can be solved with a cream as you diminished. Sometimes surgery IS needed. I wasnt going to subjugate my child to extended pain when a small pain he will not remember will keep him safe. Type 1 is the removal of the exterior clit. Thats not just removing a hood. You dont know what you‚Äôre talking about	1643218219.0	hubif4i	t3_scioy7	t1_hubh6pj	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hubif4i/
7fzfkpaa	Oh I see what you‚Äôre saying. You did it because it was medically necessary. Yeah that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm glad you did it to your son before it got worse. I thought you were saying you did it because you thought it posed a significant benefit.    Oh. Huh. I mean I could be wrong but I‚Äôm in public right now, so I can‚Äôt really look it up. So for now I‚Äôll take your word for it.  What about cutting off *only* the hood of the clit? Do you suppose that should be legal seeing as doctors in Africa and the Middle East say it‚Äôs good? They do practice it frequently so they‚Äôd have the most data.    If you do oppose it, do you think circumcision should be legal if only medically necessary?	1643218416.0	hubizbs	t3_scioy7	t1_hubif4i	/r/antifeminists/comments/scioy7/_/hubizbs/

5jkmzj6q	I honestly worry about male health when they are uncircumcised in general. We as a society don‚Äôt prioritize males cleanliness. We just dont and that leads to a lot of bacterial infections that will go un treated until they become a major problem. Both circumcised and uncircumcised men can get yeast infections but uncircumcised men pose the biggest risk to their fertility. Because particles can get trapped and we dont teach young men how to properly care for themselves. With most stds as well.   We as a society put so much pressure on women to clean themselves we even put harmful products on the shelves and tell young girls they should use them. Douce and ph balancing anything is actually really harmful and is likely to cause a bacterial infection than to rid one.   Also something they dont tell anyone but vaginas are acidic. If you dont clean yourself after sex it can cause a whole litany of issues. I mean for guys and its not because the vagina was dirty but because vaginal secretions are acidic.    But we dont support young men the same way. All too often i have heard of men who are uncomfortable touching themselves to clean and its just so bad for over all well being. Not just physically but mentally as well. We have put so much pressure on men to be *mEn* that we dont even tell them its ok to clean themselves.    God dont even get me started on those poor young men in the bible belt where natural feelings and actions are a pariah   Honestly if it wasnt for the childs best interest all procedures should be outlawed. Seriously all of them including ear piercing. Thats so barbaric. If you could shield your child from all the pain in the world wouldnt you? Shouldn‚Äôt you? My daughter is actually tongue tied and they missed it medically. Now shes too old to have it fixed and my heart breaks that we will have to fix it when shes older. Covid make the hospital cut corners and they missed somethigg by that could have been a quick snip. Made me and her suffer for months thinking it was my fault she couldnt latch.

If men cannot be victims under your Feminism why is masculinity toxic. You are breeding masculinity by forcing men into a gender role which cannot be "victim". So you are toxic  You can't even stomach the fact that someone can be against Feminism. Is your Feminism North Korea?   Your feminsm is just a ideology.

Australia still has a proper democracy it's just that the majority of people here don't value freedom, but your elections were rigged and no one with guns did shit there for all their gum flapping, so what's the point of guns then if you're all pussys that won't do anything unless it's government telling you to die in some war.     Imagine having to go to war with Russia, or Iran or even China where you'd actually be treated with more respect as man, so you'll be sacrificing yourself for a child sniffing, election stealing pedo to fight for feminism.

Plot could be:  - we meet a married couple, he works hard, good man, provides for his family.   -wife, not fulfilled, cheats on him  - he finds out, they argue, she decides to divorce him  - he‚Äôs kicked out of the family home and is prevented from seeing his children, yet is forced to support them all financially  - unable to afford rent for himself (yet forced to pay for her), he becomes homeless  - to gain advantage in the divorce, she claims he sexually abused their children, everyone believes and supports her, he loses all of his friends  - with no money to fight a legals defence, he ‚Äúloses‚Äù the divorce. He has no home, no money for himself, and will go to prison if he doesn‚Äôt give his ex money + he can‚Äôt see his children.  No-one gives a shit.   The end.

gi9vo0fa	A white knight has a preferential bias for women. Benevolent sexists. They are essential to enabling female privilege and ensuring women do not take accountability for their actions. Alarmingly, a lot are cops.   They're the type that would try to kill that man in the video posted earlier who was punched in the face by the woman if he legally defended himself. They also have a misandric worldview where women are kind, gentle, and noble who can never be blamed for any of their actions (no agency) while men are abusers whose every action is their fault (hyperagency).   It's no surprise that the people who profit from white Knights the most have no problem with them. To most men, they are extremely treacherous and harmful.	1643314334.0	huhgxx6	t3_se27me	t3_se27me	/r/antifeminists/comments/se27me/so_were_misogynists_apparently/huhgxx6/

No it doesnt. Humans will always be attracted to partners which will grant a mutual benefit relationship. That why most humans are attracted to thin and feminine women and thin and masculine men, its because that is best to uphold a proper relationship in which both sides benefit. It ahows their partner takes more care of their body and is a best fit for their gender role in the relationship.	1643316331.0	huhmcpe	t3_sdu2kp	t1_huhevas	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/huhmcpe/

And there is more poc than just mixed people.  Did you ignore everything else i said? White features doesnt just include white skin. Its on you to simply google how black women especially struggle in beauty industries, its not that complex that i should need to explain.  You‚Äôre seriously acting like ive said that absolutely everyone only find white features attractive. Are you going to pretend there hasnt been a beauty standard? Beauty standards change all the time and normally change with ‚Äòtrends‚Äô that are shown in media. In the 2000s extremely thin women were the beauty standard, in more recent years people want to achieve a ‚Äòcurvy‚Äô body type like kylie jenners	1643317364.0	huhp4qz	t3_sdu2kp	t1_huhmcpe	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/huhp4qz/

Even though feminists propaganda paints men as bad (all men suffer for that) you can say "a few bad apples" all you want but a lot of movies, series and media always have to give a speech about how women are oppresed and men are bad and I don't appreciate it.  Also, "a few bad apples" apply as well to men that are disgusting and rapists. Yet, they speak ill about men in general, why can't we speak ill about feminists in general?

And a very small, western bubble at that. So, allow me to educate you. Western women are probably the most privileged group on the planet. Far more than western men. Not saying this was always the case. In fact, I would say this has been the case for maybe a couple of decades.   > Feminism is about taking one step at a time.  Feminism in this day and age, particularly in the West, has proven to be nothing more than a path toward female superiority and the vilification of men. It is also clearly about self aggrandizing rather than giving a voice to the voiceless, i.e. the marginalized. Feminism during the first, second and to some extent, the third wave, had clear and noble goals, which centered around establishing an egalitarian society.

de2puclt	[from the study one of the news articles linked....](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857885/)  "Another limitation of this research is the reliance of self-reported marital status. Prior research has noted that marital status is misreported; however, it is most often misreported by divorced individuals with deceased former spouses (Weaver 2000). This suggests that the divorce among our sample may be underestimated, while widowhood may be overestimated. In addition, our data does not permit us to observe which spouse initiates divorce."  study is unreliable at best.	1643323089.0	hui4dma	t3_sdu2kp	t1_hug578w	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/hui4dma/

They say they are for women to have the freedom to do what they want, but criticise any women that doesn't choose what they think is best. I'm a man but seen my wife talked down to by every feminist that used to be in my life, all because we choose for her to stay at home. My mom was the absolute worse, and even talked my oldest daughter into that believe. So even cutting her out if our lives, we have a daughter that now does the same stuff. She will say hey mom is lazy as she is driving her to work and back everyday, the logic is astounding. How my wife manages to put up with it, and still do all the stuff for her is something I can't understand either.	1643325370.0	huia4pe	t3_se1fiw	t1_hugclov	/r/antifeminists/comments/se1fiw/lol_i_messaged_one_of_the_modes_of_rmemes_asking/huia4pe/

55vriw4m	I do not think it can be considered slavery if it's a voluntary split of finances between 2 adults. My dad was much happier when my mother took care of all the little details, he just wanted input on big decisions like cars, the house, and vacations. It worked out great for them, they went from white trash to upper middle class in less than 10 years.  Don't rail so hard against feminists that you go completely in the opposite direction. No one is a slave or wearing a ball and chain when it comes to a healthy traditional married relationship. Women are making their own decisions when it comes to staying at home, and men are making their own decisions when it comes to working and letting their wife handle finances. The only place this goes bad is in abusive relationships, which absolutely exist, but they aren't the majority.	1643326918.0	huidwzo	t3_sebpdn	t1_huibff4	/r/antifeminists/comments/sebpdn/its_a_womans_world_women_control_80_of_consumer/huidwzo/

4m1h9cl3	True feminists encourage body positivity for men. Also, men can start their own body positivity campain, but they don't because of toxic masculinity. Patriarchy affects negatively both women and men. Just differently. But I hope men can be comfortable with their body and emotions as much as women.   Also, the reason why there is more homeless that are men is only because they are the most observable. Women are more likely to be invited to sleep somewhere in exchange of sex. That reduces the visibility of women on the street but they aren't less homeless.   I agree all of the issues are really sad for men's reality such as homosexuality and body types. But that is not because women are fighting for their rights, it's because patriarchal society constructed men stereotypes to be strong men and not emotional. That's why homosexuality in men is more likely to be laughed at... By men.	1643329254.0	huijhri	t3_sdu2kp	t1_hugpt4d	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/huijhri/

For example, do you have government stats to back up your claim about lesbians?  In re vasectomies, I posed a hypothetical scenario. However, if you want to get into real-world applicability of that scenario, statistics shows a distinct relationship between population growth rate ‚Äî especially the growth rate of 9-year-olds ‚Äî and the growth of the per-capita GDP. So, all else being equal, a growing population is a wealthier population, which makes it a healthier one due to greater affordability of medical care, which makes it a longer-living one with a higher quality of life. So, yes, there are societal benefits to a reduction in contraception.	1643331292.0	huioe7h	t3_sctxuj	t1_huid7kx	/r/antifeminists/comments/sctxuj/feminists_and_sjws_say_anti_feminist_when_they/huioe7h/

She was a stay at home mom, so naturally she would be the one deciding these things. And men usually don't care about furniture as long as it isn't too tacky. And in all the things you described, how is the woman "reaping the benefits"? I am pretty sure even if the woman decides to pick the vacation, the family will have a nice time cause they're on a vacation.

3zirjxuq	    I was raised this way:  Food and groceries? She neither purchased or served things he didn't like or approve of, same for the furniture and clothes. His clothes, hers and ours.  Housing? My father showed her the options and she'd select from those. She was the one who'd be running it, after all.  My mother did all the research on vacations, groceries, lessons, doctors, clothing, appliances, etc., not only for price but quality, too. If there wasn't already a clear understanding between them on any item, she ASKED him before ever making a purchase.  He kept little for himself because when he wanted something he went to the store and bought it.   That's not slavery. She was the best PA he could have asked for.   He knew it, too. :)	1643340662.0	huja2ux	t3_sebpdn	t1_huibff4	/r/antifeminists/comments/sebpdn/its_a_womans_world_women_control_80_of_consumer/huja2ux/

ix7ont9n	Misogyny is almost non existent?  Wasnt incel one of those terms that appeared with things like ‚Äúchad‚Äù ‚Äústacys‚Äù and other ones i cant exactly remember. And although their definition was something about intentionally not having relationships with women it wasnt just that, its pretty clear their ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô hated women and blamed them for everything, hence why its used against any guy who hates women. I think it became the common idea that it wasn‚Äôt exactly by choice they were virgins or didnt have relationships. Alot of the time it seemed like the self claimed ‚Äúincels‚Äù were bitter about ‚Äúchads‚Äù getting lots of women because of their appearance while they didnt. I suspect it was more to do with their attitude and personality that caused them to not get attention from women though	1643340885.0	hujakqa	t3_sdu2kp	t1_huj73o9	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/hujakqa/

I live by myself and I wish I had someone to spend my money going grocery shopping, because that would save so much of my time and energy.  Picking what furniture goes in the living room had to be left up to my mother, because my dad would probably have gone to the store one weekend, picked up 1 sofa and 1 armchair that didn't match, then never go again. Deciding how to decorate the rooms was left up to my mother, because my dad would be against the idea on its face, but be happy by the time that she was done putting useful shelves and nice things on the walls.  It's not like it was an unhappy arrangement. It was literally what they both wanted. And I'm a woman who has to pay taxes and work 50 hours a week.

e13pa32v	Thank you u/LiaraLynx for helping me at that time.... her and my predictions of subreddit getting raided soon are coming out to be true... I did  alert the mods of r/antifeminists and r/MensRights as soon as I was getting bashed on feminist subs  (also I visited their Indian feminist subreddits, they seem to be lurking and crossposting from this subreddit, and making fun of us guys, especially they target me, and take my screenshots)  at that time, some guy named u/Ok_Prize3551 used to go into feminist girls' subs or DMs and shame them.... I also do it, but I NEVER go to any feminist subreddit, nor do I go and abuse ALL GIRLS in DMs as he was doing...  a girl named "anonymous\_1010\_" (not mentioning her by u/ as this could trigger them raiding us more) accused me of being that guy, just because that guy happened to use MY NAME saying I was his alternate account, idk if she was lying or he was lying (he had deleted the account and she was giving accusations without proof, asking me to bring the proof) (guys don't go to her DMs spreading hate on her okay ? we are not misogynists :)  also, that r/JEENEETards group girls, who bashed me and got me banned, as soon as I gave the stats required (that 2014 surveys show that 53.2% rapes in India were false, 78% in 2015, maybe even 90% above in 2022)... they silenced me by saying "oh incel lol you dont know how much women suffer so shut up" and yet they were NOT banned, I was banned...

is5hrrw7	So I think there are not a lot but enough feminists in Iran the main difference is that they are actually fighting for equal rights our laws are a little bit in favor of men but the thing that bothers me most is they are actually acting like western feminists in recent years where they forget the main problems and are trying to be anti men. Sexism towards men is probably highest here in recent years as the new generation of women became anti men Also as a men you can't possibly have problems all you will here is men up women are treated with way more respect way more that i feel it every day. Being women is counted as being weak so even if you argue with women and she hits you and breaks your arm which happend to my uncle she is the victim !

is5hrrw7	There is also (Mahr) which you have to pay a woman because she married you and sometimes this is in big amounts of money wich results in men not paying it. Then they divorce wich now men is forced to pay it and if he doesn't have that money he will be put in jail. Our society is a matriarchy because married women use this to control their men.  You argue with your wife ?   She will divorce you and put you in jail or give her all you have  That's literally abuse. that's why new generations don't even marry because you are literally controlled by your wife. Idk if it's not sexim what is. Lots of men are scammed as well women just use them and trick them to take away all their money.	1643362706.0	hukagl5	t3_se1fiw	t1_hujqibh	/r/antifeminists/comments/se1fiw/lol_i_messaged_one_of_the_modes_of_rmemes_asking/hukagl5/

71v4lvfl	I let my wife control the money, I just put away for retirement and some cash for me. That is because I don't care even the tiniest bit what is bought, as long as the bills are paid. I think it really comes down to most men not caring or needing much, while women seem to always want something. Buying things more then owning them seem to make women happy. Maybe it's just the shopping, but it's a never ending battle that's easier not to even fight. I don't think all women are like that, but I would say most are. My wife buys stupid stuff just because it was on sale, even if it will never be used. Then brags about finding it on sale. She never seems to know why she thought we would need it, but believed we would eventually.	1643364924.0	hukd84u	t3_sebpdn	t3_sebpdn	/r/antifeminists/comments/sebpdn/its_a_womans_world_women_control_80_of_consumer/hukd84u/

I am antifeminist.... but most just dont care.... I consider even No Fap as being under Mens Rights, it's a self improvement subreddit, not political sub...  so maybe occasionally, if used at the correct moment, you say something about men's rights on No Fap, nothing much happens  but if you mention no fap here on antifeminists and mensrights, some guys will bash you  idk, thats why, lets not mix them or mention them here...   I have had internal argument amongst antifeminists that if porn is good or bad, most dont care, but I do (I think porn is a HELL LOT of anti-men, preying on man's loneliness, others here dont agree though)  again, I dont wanna get bashed by MRAs after having a day being bashed by feminists... otherwise I will feel alienated :(	1643368111.0	hukhg95	t3_sell3z	t1_hukgvt7	/r/antifeminists/comments/sell3z/link_of_the_previous_such_posts_below_be_careful/hukhg95/

d1l8v4fn	OP said he's been trying to date for a year, been on dates and none of them have worked out, now is going to strip clubs. That's why people would be suggesting prostitution - so he can just get what he wants without wasting a year or at this point many more years of his time and effort in trying to date/online date. It's kind of the premise of the post. He's stuck in a loop of going on first dates and having to pay for it and he's not getting anywhere with it - so they suggest instead of paying for dates just pay for a prostitute. None of this is my personal opinion btw, I'm just explaining the motivation.	1643377352.0	hukx6w3	t3_sdnxar	t1_huh6zqm	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdnxar/what_is_the_point_of_dating_currently/hukx6w3/

Probably not healthy either. and no I'm not going to cite some research studies to back up that guess.  To make my perspective more clear I've interacted with people throughout my life who have gone deeper into the research out there and chosen to trust what they say because it lined up with my experiences and other things I've learned and they seemed like trustworthy people to me and I didn't want to go through the literature myself.     A common source for this topic is "Your Brain on Porn". Here's a quick video summary of the book (which also includes some references linked in the description. if you want to dive into the research then feel free to give it a read.

iygqzlz6	I‚Äôm not sure why a lot of anti feminist women happen to like manga and anime. I think maybe part of it is because it‚Äôs cute and unlike feminists we don‚Äôt have an issue with it. I‚Äôve seen feminists refuse to consume Japanese media or content of any kind because they find it offensive for reasons I just don‚Äôt understand. I grew up with anime and manga so I like it quite a bit.  I think that perhaps there might be a psychological reason as to why some women are feminists and some are anti feminists. Like you said, some women are not accepted by the herd of women and are bullied so they gravitate towards men. For me that wasn‚Äôt the case, I‚Äôm a Christian with relatively traditional beliefs. Both feminists and anti feminists will find my beliefs disagreeable for different reasons.

Feminists here as a method to demonstrate to the majority, do all this "we are Christians" drama  All these Feminists behave differently in different countries, to break apart the already running systems in the countries...  And yup they are successful (atleast here, it has crossed 78% above rape cases are FALSE now...)  Idk why, but all in all  All CONSERVATIVE women, be it Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc. Who are truly Conservative, consider themselves antifeminist  That is, mostly right wing women...

18x3ylc2	Classic misandric bullshit. Deny an existing issue and then spun things around to claim women are simply better people. *"Women care about those who find them"* \- like what the fuck?  Not only most of men who commit suicide have previously looked for help (some comment in original post mentions 90% of them going to psychologist/psychiatrist), but there's also an issue of:  1) men knowing that failing in such attempt will only result in getting laughed at and ridiculed  2) men choosing deadlier methods, because for them death itself is usually the main thing they want to achieve, while women often do it to get some kind of attention (e.g. they are desperate for help with some serious issue).	1643398107.0	humf4gh	t3_sewo0t	t3_sewo0t	/r/antifeminists/comments/sewo0t/when_youre_so_brainwashed_by_feminism/humf4gh/

8ewqlnw4	Yes. It is non-existent. You have never witnessed real hatred towards women, and you probably are never going to witness it.  Most of the supposed "misogyny" is just saying: "bitch, whore, sex, slut" and other zzZZz-tier. That is nothing compared to what feminists say: "Men are potential rapists, men are trash, kill all men, I wish men would be sent to war and die, if all men disppeared all would be better, the best man is one that doesn't show vital sings" etc., or the hatred organisations like the Usta≈°as did against Serbs, and other people in the Balkans (beheading them and holding their heads with their hands in a photo, smile while they are cutting one's neck with a saw, burying them alive, imapling their children, etc.), or what the Nazis did to Poles, Slavs, Jews and Roma people. Compared to those forms of hatred, "misogyny" is a handicapped pygmy with Down Syndrome.  In fact, I bet that if you saw a real misogynist, all of you and feminists would short-circuit and would stare at him or the comment in shock.  As for terms like "Chad, Stacy"; those are just descripting terms, that then are iterated and evolve in things like Becky, Tyrone, Gigachad, Gigastacy, etc. And it's obvious you have never been in incel forums, the PUA's get more hate (PUAhate, the place that Elliot Rodger actually frequented) and often say: "it's not women's fault since is not something they can control or chose"; whilst to PUAs say they are a scam. Chad gets even more hate than women. It's just that the internet, the herd, of course, misapplied it after smoking marihuana with a tyre after having an embolism and that simply sticked with that incorrect use.  The personality and status are just cope, that only works if you have good looks. If you are ugly, you won't be perceived as having great personality or be given status, nor will your confidence or attitude be respected. You would appear as a lolcow or involuntary comedy, at best.	1643400872.0	hummevc	t3_sdu2kp	t1_hujakqa	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/hummevc/

Why do you use the worst examples of what has been said to men next to words like ‚Äúsex‚Äù? As if its proof that women don‚Äôt experience anything more than that. Misogyny is definitely not just ‚Äòinsults‚Äô. And to be quite honest if those examples you used are the worst men face then I have some news for you. I think you also need to learn that comparing misogyny and ‚Äúmisandry‚Äù to what the *nazis* did is a terrible debate tactic. Not everything has to be at the most extreme level to be considered ‚Äòoppresion‚Äô or discrimination- because if by your logic it was, then men also dont have any problems because its nothing compared to the holocaust! üôÑ	1643401673.0	humoj14	t3_sdu2kp	t1_hummevc	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/humoj14/

8ewqlnw4	And I'm not interested in "discussing", as in "coming to an understanding with you by the exchange of points"; I'm only interested in proving myself right and on demonstrating my own points.  Why? Because I'm comparing worsts to worsts. I compared the worst that has happened to women to the worst that has happened to men. The worst that women have been told are just that, at best it's "ugly bitch"; "no eggs"; "you are a slut"; to which there are their male counterparts, as in "creep"; "small dick/ü§è"; "incel"; and slut can technically be applied to men too, and its applied in way worse ways than it could ever be applie to women. It is proof that women don't really have any real problem when they complain on things like "mansplaining" and the few problems that could be considered "serious" are memes or false (rape epidemic, rape culture). The worst crimes or things done or said to women are not exclusive to them (genocide, torture) and the things that are applied to them are not serious or harsh when compared to what is applied to their male counterparts, and a lot of those things like genocide, murder, torture, etc., happen to men often by a "reason of gender", in the sense that the punishment is worse if you are a man than if you are a woman, like the genocide committed in the Bosnian War, the Tour de Nesle affair, and if you are accused of a crime like rape (regardless if you are guilty or not) are way worse if you are a man than if you are a woman. You can search Richard Carrillo or in TheYNC in the Underground section you can search "rapist" and see what pops up in the results.  Those are examples that I've used, and don't make me start with the violence done against GBTQ+ men compared to LBTQ+ women.  "If that's the worse that can happen to men, then I have bad news for you" after all I have mentioned, and as explicit as I'm allowed to, what can be worse? Iluminate me, I want to know what's worse than being torn apart, raped, stabbed with a knife in the ass and/or castrated for a crime you probably didn't commit, tortured and genocided... I mentioned you the worst methods used by the Usta≈°as, what can be worse than that and that only affects women. Even the effects of rape were worse for men in wars.  If the comparison, or contrast, more semantically correctly speaking, is accurate, then I don't see a problem and nothing is sacred.  And yes, I know that it doesn't have to be the worse to be considered oppression or discrimination, but have a little bit of standards please. If the worst said to women are things related to sexual content, then misogyny is non-existent. Since not even those things cause hatred nor disgust towards women. At best it makes you no longer wanting to have long term relationships with them but that's it. Compare it to being called a potential "rapist" or a "pederast". Even "misogynist" falls under this category, which doesn't happen with "misandrist". Call me when insults like: "potential child abuser, child murderer, unloyal, disloyal, honourless creatures, beasts, traitorous" etc., are directed to describe women and only women. There you would have real misogyny.  Until then, I don't want to hear any story or fanfiction of how women suffer "misogyny".	1643403837.0	humu5rg	t3_sdu2kp	t1_humoj14	/r/antifeminists/comments/sdu2kp/this_is_feminism_for_you/humu5rg/

ix7ont9n	If youre trying to say that *im* only interested in ‚Äòbeing right‚Äô, you are quite mistaken. It is pointless for anyone to attempt any kind of debate or discussion with someone who doesnt even have enough knowledge on the topic. And is clearly too stubborn to hear what anyone else has to say about these ‚Äúfanfictions‚Äù  Because you definitely dont have enough knowledge if you think any misogyny women face is just ‚Äòinsults‚Äô or..‚Äômemes‚Äô (??) but somehow have plenty of knowledge on the ‚Äòmurder‚Äô and ‚Äòtorture‚Äô of men, that apparently dont happen to women ? Or any of the equally as serious crimes committed against women.  I have a funny feeling you don‚Äôt actually care about gay men or the lgbt community apart form when you get to use their experiences in debates as fuel to invalidate women. If you want I can give you many examples of how lesbian women can suffer just as much, in my own country a lesbian couple was attacked on public transport because they wouldnt kiss eachother for the men attacking them. Im apart of the community too so I find it quite ignorant you would feel the need to compare very serious struggles between two different groups in the community for your own benefit.

55vriw4m	Bro this is a post about married traditional relationships, where the husband works and the wife handles the finances. I think that if a man chooses to disclose their financial situation, share bank accounts, propose, and get married to a woman, then he has consented to the arrangement.  This doesn't men that every man needs to just write a woman a blank check for every purchasing decision, it means that they've created a system that is mutually beneficial. A good wife makes sure the house is maintained, there's food on the table, and there's money saved for the future. A good husband works hard to keep providing all those things, while being cared for by the wife.  Having the woman decide on a majority of the household's purchases is not slavery, except in a very few, very bad relationships. It's how most families have worked since the industrial revolution at least, and perhaps even before that.	1643410060.0	hun9vif	t3_sebpdn	t1_humykr9	/r/antifeminists/comments/sebpdn/its_a_womans_world_women_control_80_of_consumer/hun9vif/
