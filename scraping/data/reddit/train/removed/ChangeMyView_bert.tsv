Again, stop using absolutes. You are just showing over and over again that you lack the mental acuity to actually process any of this. Go get a better education. Yours has failed you.	You seem to not even have the concept of respect right. Respect is not earned. Its given. At the start of this debate i gave it to you. You could see this when looking at with how much care i tried to establish an understanding. But look at what you gave me. You did not care.  So i take away my respect again and you begin to cry your eyes out : ""I dont care! do you hear me! I don't care! I really dont! I dont care! If i say it once more it will become true!""	0.868

It has nothing to do with race, but you didn't care about the actual argument I made then, and you still want to misrepresent it now.	It wasn't my purpose to suggest he was under qualified to have an opinion about the trial or the prosecutor's behavior, which is why I never stated anything remotely arguing that point, and I would vehemently argue against such a view.	0.907
It's such a small % that actually get offended, and in most of these cases, the one offended isn't even part of the "appropriated group"; but rather, acting on their behalf.   I think the entire outrage stems from sensationalism of media, and making clicks for $$$.   The people that "ban" the expression of cultures are likely afraid of media backlash.	<p>I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s why legislation becomes less popular. If you see people from your side and your favorite news channel shit on a bill constantly, it obviously becomes a lot less popular. The idea that if you give a lot of dishonest people a lot of time to lie about a bill will make it less popular is not a valid reason to give a lot of dishonest people more time to lie about a bill.</p>	0.891

Thank you for taking the time and effort to explain in great detail why his position falls apart.  Like you, I do know the answer to who holds the record you mention and where her performance falls in the range of cis women performances, the record for the next older age bracket is faster than hers and was set by a cis woman. Like you, I'm not exactly worried about trans women dominating sports. I'm worried about all the voices like the individual you were replying to causing trans women to be subjected to hyper scrutiny in an attempt to tear down our validity.	The panic of trans women in right wing media is a solution in search of a problem. You almost never hear them share such *profound concern* over women's sports when they ask for more pay, or are threatened by cut funding or institutional sexism, but when *hypothetical* trans villains are at play, all of a sudden it's priority number 1. Funny that."	0.882
This is why humanity is doomed. I wanted to just end the conflict because none of our opinions matter at the end of the day here but you go on to ramble on	And then you described the alignment problem over and over. And over. Yup, we get it. Odds are, we fuck it up and everyone dies. But everyone was going to die anyway. And if you think this is all a pipe dream after all, there's nothing to worry about in the first place, right? So either the alignment problem is important and we need to solve it, or it doesn't matter because AI was never going to do anything anyway. Your argument lacks internal consistency.	0.892
Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options. [Here's](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) a page (with a link to the original study) that shows 90% of women would reject a 5'4" guy for his height. [This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	<p>Indeed, <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-0939-z?wt_mc=Affiliate.CommissionJunction.3.EPR1089.DeepLink"">this study</a> finds that heterosexual women are much less likely to orgasm during sex with men (only 65% of the time) - whereas for straight men it&#39;s 95%, gay men (89%), bisexual men (88%), lesbian women (86%), bisexual women (66%).</p>	0.83

> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.  That is not obvious at all. You are literally here, *in this post*, doing exactly that.	<p>I could be wrong, but I feel like you have a desire to individualise blame in this instance and ignore the systematic issues at play.

Everytime I hear someone going on a rant about “left wing/right wing” all that comes to my mind is architecture and grandiose buildings.   I really wanted to play devils advocate here, but the truth of the matter is you’re exactly right. About right and left being meaningless. It’s just another reason for people to remain divided under the guise of freedom and choice.   Because there is no actual choice. Not in any society. It’s all the same shit with varied marketing and price points to give the illusion of choice.   This applies to consumer goods, infrastructure and our government. And we do it to ourselves.   IMPO of course.	That everything relating to human beings is 'socially constructed' is complete nonsense, doesn't withstand any debate at all and absolutely demands you adhere to several leaps of faith that have no credible science. That a man in a dress should be able to dominate the womens triatholon is absolutely an issue that warrants discussion and debate, but nope!

First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	Sorry Deborah, I know you grew up in an era where your trans sister wasn't considered a woman and you're struggling to come to terms with the idea that a penis isn't actually manhood, but considering there's like 4 billion women on earth, it's time to stop acting like womanhood is some sort of special, exclusive club that you can gatekeep access to.	0.857

What expectation of privacy is reasonable for these women to expect in the investigations? Should we ban older women from attempting to conceive a child, since their age can skyrocket the chances of the fetus dying?  </p>	0.845

My grandma was terminally ill and was of clear mind until the very last days. She spent her last year bedridden and unable to move but completely clear minded. She begged us to let her die and asked the doctors nurses to end it. We had no recourse and seeing her like that destroyed all of us who had to take care of her until her last breath. I think this case was an ideal situation for euthanasia because there is no treatment no remedies for what she has gone through. It was a slow and painful journey for her and all of my family. Doctors were very emphatetic but their hands were tied.	My sister was working on a patient in full PPE gear. The patient was terminally ill from an un-covid related illness. The patient received 2 negative covid test results back. Her supervisor told her she didn't need PPE on anymore for that patient. A few days later that patient passed away. In the notice it said death due to covid. She was shocked not just because of the 2 negative covid test results. But because her supervisor never alerted her of her ""accidental exposure"" to covid. This is a HUGE no-no in the medical field right now because she could spread it to other people in her hospital wing or immuno-deficient patients and essentially take out an entire wing.	0.906
Definitely agree with you on how coopted it has become, but given that “woke” originated in black communities (and i’m white), i’m not really ready to tell black people to stop using language they created because dumbass right-wingers have taken over their language	<p>The &quot;white moderates&quot; would say the same thing. It&#39;s a distinction without a difference. You acknowledge that MLK doesn&#39;t want people putting &quot;restraints on the methods and timing they use&quot; but you think telling black people that they&#39;re racist if they say they don&#39;t want their culture used insensitively is OK. Ultimately, you&#39;re still telling black people how they should respond to racism &quot;the right way&quot;, which is something MLK was very obviously against.

> Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns.  This is just whataboutism being used as a red herring. Nobody is talking about mass shootings here. Mass shootings have nothing to do with this discussion. Literally nothing.  >You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.  So let's be real on a few things here. First of all 2.5 million is bonkers-insane-nuts completely unsupported by facts. There are stats put out by individual cities, and from those stats, we know that the real number can't be anywhere close to that high.  But, as a fun fact, the reason why the CDC doesn't have more accurate numbers, is because it's legally forbidden from sponsoring that sort of research, As our Republican institutions and entities that receive public funding. The NRA lobbied hard for a law making it illegal for us to find out how often self-defense happens relative to other gun actions..  I think that speaks pretty clearly to what the numbers would show if we could actually do that research.  Second of all, 60,000 per year is nothing. That's 1 in 6,667.  Considering that there are 48 lotteries in this country each doing multiple drawings daily, that's roughly how many people win the lottery per year.  If that happens to you, yes, you are a statistical unicorn. That's not misleading; that's fact.   But let's not stop there, because in fact, even that number is wildly inflated by law enforcement statistics being mixed in.  Yes, one in 6,667 of us may engage in acts of self-defense, but most of the people included in that stat are not people in their own house. They are people whose jobs put them in conflict with people, like law enforcement.  That's a totally different scenario.  But don't take my word for it, do this simple search for yourself: Go to news.google.com, pick a large city with over a million people in it, and just search and that city specifically over the last year, for stories about home invasions and self-defense  How many did you find? 10? 20? That's my point exactly. That sort of scenario is super rare. It happens, but it's not going to happen to you. You aren't that lucky/unlucky.    > Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  The only one of us attempting to mislead, is you, with the red herring at the start..   > That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  It can be both. You know the famous Seattle study showed that there were roughly seven suicide attempts and four accidental shootings for every self-defense shooting in Seattle In 1998.  The conclusion from that is pretty clear, that you are a bigger risk to yourself from your own gun, then people who would do harm to you are at risk from it.  That's just facts.	<p>Let me explain a little further. Leftist policies do not refer to...most anything the Democratic party has actually accomplished in the past several dozen years. Making healthcare slightly more affordable for only some of the populace is not a leftist policy. Putting more women of color in powerful positions is not a leftist policy. Massively increasing incarceration, allowing ICE to continue existing, expanding the drone bombings of innocent civilians, doing nothing of note to decrease the enormous wealth inequality of the nation, doing nothing to prevent the impending ecological collapse of the planet, and criminalizing whistleblowers are all obviously not leftist policies.</p>	0.869

First, what is the source of that "a few percent gap"?   Second, unless it has been shown that it really *is* due to discrimination, then *we don't know*, if it due to discrimination or for some other factor that we just didn't think of considering.   Third, your last line is extremely childish. You don't need to be any "denier" to realize that if we're talking about a few percentage point differences, at some point the margin of error comes to play and it becomes virtually impossible to attribute the difference to any cause.	<p>So it really only seem to make sense if youre saying that it is an inter-subjective comparison, of which it is unfair to benefit some but not all who has an affiliated history with it in the past --- but then again you have actively rejected the idea of inter-subjective comparison, leaving me confused what your standpoint is.</p>	0.9
I a so agree with this except I don’t believe the soul is a real thing, unless you are just using it figuratively.

^Lets be really clear here. Women sexually assault men. That it’s rare, and not rape, are separate issues.   Thanks for wishing rape on me though. That’s helpful, and absolutely lends weight to your accusation of rape apology.	Next comes the issue of culture.  It's very clear that there is a culture of rape.  Similar to what I wrote in that other response, we normalize rapist behavior (that is, behavior that isn't rape but if not addressed and singled out as bad, can lead to rape).  We bend over backwards to excuse rapists, and rely on almost a ""boys will be boys"" mindset if it's male rapists, (or outright say it's just not possible if it's a female rapist).  The thing is, if it's true that men are simply naturally inclined to rape, *then men shouldn't be allowed outside without supervision*, and if they aren't naturally inclined to rape, *then we should be focusing on what social factors create such a gender disparity in rape*.  When we look at burglaries, they are most often tied to economics.  That is, the more income inequality that exists, the more economic uncertainty a community faces, the more likely people are to turn to burglary.  To be frank, the people who say that ""watch your drink"" and ""use a buddy system"" are victim blaming are the same kinds of people who want to eliminate economic inequality, to get at the core issues of burglaries.	0.875

This. Everyone on this post is attempting to change the views of someone who has no intention of changing in the first place. The language was a dead giveaway. Things like “problematic”and like you mentioned: “consequences to free speech” are emblematic of a preset of value judgments from a hyper sensitive portion of the population, hell bent on cancelling anyone who challenges their fragile world views.	I do think the body positivity movement is needed, but separating all these movements to create acceptance is really just pulling us apart. Do what you wish with your life, no one is stopping you, but to act like every advocate of racism or shaming has been afflicted directly is ludicrous.  It's the pictures, messages we get. How about we get positive about life? That would cure all of it. We live in a society of shame cuz we are taught our emotions are scary and our ego is more important. We live in a culture of repression.  I mean, who gives a shit if you are fat, the positivity movement can perpetuate a feeling that one should feel oppressed.  Live your life, be love in action, who tf cares what someone else thinks.  Anyone shaming you is projecting their own fear or shame"	0.878

Trans people should only compete with other trans people. If anyone needs proof that men and women are not made equal, google Lucia Riker. Aka lady tyson, the best female kickboxer of all time.

But a man. And he knocked her out. No woman on earth could even touch her. But a man put her to sleep in 3 rounds. Not a pro either. She was way better than he was in terms of technique. But you cant beat nature.

The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	<p>Also, isn&#39;t it capitalism that supports slavery? I think we both agree that sweatshops are basic child slavery? Under capitalism we simply agree to overlook sweatshops, because we don&#39;t want to pay too much for a tshirt.or a phone, or computer, or the cobalt in out batteries. Child labour, and sex trafficking are all at the hands of capitalism. It&#39;s all done to make more money.</p>	0.885

Bro just stop typing up a storm, you’re trying to larp as some intellectually smart person, when in reality your just a crybaby snowflake who’s offended by a fucking joke.  Do you genuinely think Rogan is a racist? If so, that’s why people call you a snowflake. You haven’t ever actually had any real life world experience. In the real world you haven’t yet experienced, people say racist and offensive things as jokes and they’re not racist.	<p>If they shudder at the thought then why did they openly support it? Pleading ignorance isn&#39;t valid here. Hitler was a special kind of evil, fascists are only marginally better, in that most of them simply fall in line as opposed to being driven by their hate.

You're fuming so hard at being called a snowflake and a cracker, in a relevant thread, that you browse my profile and insult me for being queer lmao maybe you're the mental one my friend	In more recent years both liberals and conservatives like to throw it at each-other making fun of how the other side is easily offended (for the sake of clarity it did start from the right - it was commonly used to mock easily offended people, who demand social changes for things that were perceived as meaningless (manspreading), stupid (GTA makes you sexist) or far-fetched (lawns are racist!), later liberals started pointing out, that being so triggered by simple statements is in itself being a snowflake... keep in mind the political aspect of the term is almost exclusively restricted to the internet, very few people use it IRL).	0.831

They are your thought and your thought alone. I am supprised that so many people volunteered to be part of a gene theropy experiment, one that has not been used on humans before. Made by companies who's only goal is profet and those same companies had been fined multiple billion for their fraud, bribes and their drugs killing people.	The comparison is, of course, incomplete. Trump, for all his misdeeds, never got to the point where he was intentionally building industrialized murder machines for entire demographics. But the scope of mass death caused in large part by his administration's failure and outright malice should put him in a similar category with other people responsible for mass death on a truly horrific scale.	0.859

I was simply concerned we weren't going to have a serious discussion as im sure you can understand most people saying stuff like that on the internet are not doing it for serious discussion.	Where did you pull this standard? That's a total red herring and as far as I can tell you just arbitrarily introduced this to the conversation. I would argue this is not the argument we (or anyone) should make. Employers should mandate vaccines to maintain and protect the health and safety of their employees and customers... same reason they can send sick employees home and refuse to let them work. Abortions don't affect the health and safety of other staff or guests, so it wouldn't follow."	0.9

I do not believe in respectability politics where you see a bigot being a bigot (like you) but you cannot call them a bigot (which you are). We need to be able to use words appropriately to be able to communicate - for example, it is appropriate to say that you are a transphobic bigot. If you don't want to be called a transphobic bigot, you should stop being transphobic and bigoted.	I dont really believe in objective morality. It doesn't really exist, so I couldn't care less for what someone considers to be ""bad values"". I find it ironic that you strongly reconciling a discussion on  morality with evidence. There is no real evidence of objective or universal morality. How do I know someone doesn't just consider trans people to be exhibiting bad morality just because they are grossed out by trans people or insecure about their own gender/sexuality? I think for this discussion to be meaningful, morality needs to be largely removed from the conversation.	0.92

following. I'm half Serb. I was too young to understand at the time but my serb family detest the western governments for their faux wars.	<p>When I was in this environment, I didn’t understand why people judged the pro life movement. Now, looking at the issue as a whole, I understand it. Many socially conservative men, particularly politicians, are judgmental, controlling, misogynistic pieces of shit, and their disagreement with abortion isn’t even about the science of fetal development - it’s about shaming women for owning their sexuality. Given the religion I grew up in, I received an overwhelming amount of this kind of judgment. I actually just escaped my extremely controlling &amp; physically abusive father a little over a year ago. I’m now a stripper, and it makes me feel empowered that I’m using my sexuality to be financially independent, live a modest, but comfortable lifestyle, and pay for my college education.</p>	0.813
My view is if you say yes in any state that is a green light. Condom or no. If you commit a crime while drunk you can’t claim you didn’t know what you were doing in court. “I was drunk so didn’t know the implications of drunk driving”. Why should that be acceptable here. Sober you chose to get drunk in that situation and so knew the risks involved. If you are aware of what is around you and can communicate that that is enough even if you are drunk off your ass. The only case this doesn’t apply is if the person is so far gone they can’t register what is around them. So long as they are awake and able to interact intentionally with their environment that counts as consent in my book.   Take for example if a man and woman are both drunk. Did the man rape the woman? Did the woman rape the man? Did they rape each other? After all if you rape someone while drunk it is still rape. The answer is it is just two drunk horny people. Pass them a rubber and leave the room.	Unfortunately, the stochastic nature of the problem makes things difficult to argue.  It's a bit like drunk driving.  Most of the time when people drive drunk, they aren't actually going to kill anybody.  And if they did, we could easily charge them with murder.  Why do we need a separate penalty for where nothing bad actually happens? Because the penalties change behaviors, causing fewer people to drive drunk.  Because empowering the law to pull people over for drunk driving allows us to stop that loss of life before it occurs.  Because we cannot allow reckless endangerment when it isn't simply ones own life that is endangered.	0.906
“Academics and politicians”  Right, because what the peasants think doesn’t matter. It’s not like we elect politicians or anything. The definition of words doesn’t change because of who’s in power. That’s some “alternate facts” bullshit.   Racism is something in your heart. It’s something you believe. Prejudice just refers to any kind of vague preconceived notion about an out group. Racism refers to a preconceived notion specifically about people based on their race.   OPPRESSION is power + prejudice. Racism just means you believe people are inferior based on race.   And don’t gaslight us, I remember reading this definition for racism in like 2014. Not the 60s.	The thing is that unless you're racist, you really don't care that other people of your race succeed, especially if you're not succeeding. And forcing people into that perspective is how you get neo-nazis and white supremacists."	0.884

So you're against killing animals, but arent vegan?  This makes you nothing more than a hypocrite.  Why would anyone place any weight whatsoever in any opinion you hold?  You've made it entirely clear you're against killing animals, but not against animals being killed for you (but you've said factory farming is bad, but also that it isnt?).  And you also have no understanding of supply/demand and fully believe that the meat industry kills animals purely for fun, and then people happen to buy it. Because people reducing demand would have no impact whatsoever on the number of animals killed?   You literally are incapable of logical thought.  Like I truly, genuinely doubt you are capable of following the most basic of cause and effects.  When you played catch as a kid did you plan to hold your hand out and try to catch something at a specific time and place irrelevant of if a ball was thrown? Because that's the level of thought you're putting into this entire thread and it blows my mind that you're capable of reading and writing.	Look at the difference in sentiment to someone killing cows for meat vs someone torturing cows for fun. What's the basis for the disparity, when you get right down to it? You can claim that one has a benefit to outweigh it, but this doesn't hold up - nobody is *outraged* by meat being wasted more than other food, so it's not about that. It's because there's big category-walls that prevent us-and-ours being slaughtered for food along with cows (along with a massive specific taboo against eating people), so we just don't think it's a threat - whereas *recreational torture* isn't confined to species boundaries, and someone who tortures animals for funsies isn't someone you want intercepting your kid on their way home from school.	0.915

I believe that in the US an employer cannot *legally* force you to do so. However, that doesn't mean that the employee won't be aware that they're going to be fired if they don't ""keep up"" or else you might be... ""let go"" due to ""budget concerns.""

No, no. Show me where I said *this:*  >you're saying that it's ok to be racist and sexist   You can't, because I never did. You keep claiming I've said that this what Biden is doing isn't sexist or racist and/or that sexism/racism is ok, yet I've never said either thing.   I can't tell if you're trolling me, confusing me with someone else who did say these things, misunderstanding what I have said, or something else. Regardless, I'm finished with this conversation.  Have a good one!	Because it appears to me you are making a claim that is what I was doing, and it wasn't.

Adding to what you said, I think it's pretty sad that nowadays people still consider good & evil in politics as being a thing.  &#x200B;  People still treat those conflicts as if they weren't just different empires trying to acquire more influence and territory over different regions.	You're right that the candidate *shouldn't* matter.  I despise both Trump and Biden, but a lot of people listen to them, whether you or I think that makes sense or not.

There is a large body of evidence that points to broken family units in the African American community. If I provide said evidence would you even accept it? Do me a favor right now at random look up a black celebrity or any kind of influential black person on Wikipedia I would bet money their father was not in the picture. I would argue that children without fathers is a systemic issue in the African American community that is way easier to prove than systemic racism the latter is so hard t define and quantify while the former is simply a matter of correcting the right data in the right way.

In your original post you said  >What most of them are showing is simply that there are A LOT of military stuff right now, not BUILDING UP of stuff.

No, I'm suggesting that if you're cmv is; *people shouldn't be idolised*, then picking a religion that already not only agrees with that, but has it as a sin, is stupid.  It is actually about what the statue represents just as much, if not more, than the person. Which is why your *metaphorical statues are the same as real statues* position is nonsense.	If it truly is religious and you're worried about some sort of repercussion for using the ""wrong"" pronouns, wouldn't it be safer to trust what they say, thus absolving you from moral responsibility? Otherwise you're just guessing with no real info. Basically assuming they are immoral which most common people have no right to do in any major religion. At least not without proof.	0.9

If someone is offended by science, that is less my problem as it is theirs. Does that mean if a person asks me to refer to them in a certain way I will or will not do it? That depends on the circumstances and our relationship. If they’re a kind individual and sincere about it, sure. It doesn’t bother me.

This is dumb.  If you don't like the taste of alcohol, no one else's opinion or argument as to why you "should" like it is going to change the fact that you don't. There's nothing wrong with not liking alcohol. You don't need someone to change your opinion on it.	Sure, if it's two consenting adults of sound mind (and no power differential) are doing it, it's not inherently immoral, however realistically I don't see any way of arriving at that point which doesn't involve a major moral gamble. The immoral aspect doesn't begin with the act, it begins with changing your attitude towards the other. *Even if* the attitude is reciprocated, you've already irrevocably changed the nature of the relationship. Their decision to reciprocate would be one made with the knowledge that they've lost the previous relationship either way."	0.876

Also if you're not interested in debating ideas, why do you post here?

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	-You’re talking of “bias,” but you’re attempting to discredit “me” based on my education background and not my “points?” Come on… We’re not “finding any evidence” here. Everything we’ve been talking about is textbook biology for 40-100 years.  It’s fairly obvious that this attempt to redefine biological sex isn’t native to biology, but it’s a larger social push for inclusion of marginalized minorities. Whether that is a good thing or not (and my view is that it is), that is TRUE bias encroaching on a field that demands absolute objectivity. And just because this redefinition is a good thing, doesn’t mean that it’s the right or correct thing to do. We depend on science to solve all types of issues, and we need it to remain objective and free of social biases no matter how good the cause is.	0.843

That still doesn't change the fact that Islam declares Muhammad as an ideal man. you're challenging me on my knowledge of Islam but it seems like you know nothing about it.	Not criticising the extremist aspects of Islam actually harms moderate Muslims who are lumped in with the extremists and gives actual racists the opportunity to recruit more people as the perception is that the mainstream left are hypocrites who condemn in Christianity what they seem to ignore or excuse in Islam (I won't go as far to say ""condone"" as I don't think I've heard many on the left say they agree with the more extremist aspects of Islam, but ""condone"" could be used if meaning staying silent)	0.896
Don't have to, it is irrelevant. He is a troll who took another identity and posted under a fake name and then pretended he was a victim.

I’m not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it “the problem of evil”, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can’t exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions. It’s an interesting debate!	Also while you are correct that atheism isn't a religion, it should be grouped in with religions when religion and beliefs are discussed because it is a belief about faith and god. You don't believe in god, I believe in God, we are having a religious discussion. It's going to fall under the religion umbrella because it is directly connected to religion."	0.862

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	The logical conclusion of your ""we need to be breaking down stereotypes"" logic is that ""the rules"" should be just as strictly enforced, except, opposite. Wearing women's clothes because you are a woman and want to dress like a woman is bad and reinforcing stereotypes. Presumably, just as much for cis- as well as trans women. So the only people who should dress like women are men, who ought to do it not to feel like women, but to feel no particular way at all, I guess. Therefore the only ""correct"" way to dress is as the opposite gender that you identify as, but not because you associate those items with the opposite gender, that would be bad."	0.92
With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids. I'm ready to bet, you not gonna help him, you not gonna network with him, you will tell him to fuck off.  One of my best friends turned out to be a pedophile just a couple years ago. I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	<p>I&#39;m confused, because you said this is not the way politics works, but this is exactly what I&#39;m asking for. I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not enough to just say &quot;61% of people care about crime.&quot; You have to analyze how <em>much</em> they care about it, and who do they think will do a better job of solving it. None of the data you&#39;ve presented shows that people care about crime more than other issues, or that they think Democrats are not the ones who will solve it.</p>	0.846

The problem with these numbers is they actually don't include graduates who are unemployed upon graduation. They only account for the number of people who are employed. I've looked into this before. So the wage gap is actually much smaller. Also, you forgot to account for university costs and housing costs too.   &#x200B;  The other problem is that your college graduate salary includes people who attended postgraduate education but you didn't account for the extra tuition cost and opportunity cost.

Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.  The pandemic is over. It’s the politicians and media that want to keep it going for personal gain.

The only time I've seen the one with instagram before is in a case where the guy was commenting sexual things on a girl on instagram he knows personally. Not allowing that isn't hypocritical."	0.773

Nope, you're just acting retarded for no reason. If you're gonna sit here and same the dumbest shit and prefix it with "by your logic" then I'll do the same thing.

True, I agree with your opinion, particularly as fundamentalist Islam carries so much weight in the countries you’ve highlighted, in addition to quite a few others, such as Brunei. I remember when the sultan of Brunei proposed a law to stone homosexuals to death when it introduced a new set of regulations that were based on sharia law. However, he backtracked after global boycotts of Bruneian businesses and protests outside of embassies, showing that perhaps political pressure can work in certain circumstances. However, homosexuals are still incredibly oppressed in Brunei, and I have to agree that fundamentalist Islam is the greatest oppressor of the LGBT community.	<p>And what about where LGBT individuals are persecuted today? I was rather disgusted when LGBT individuals were saying things like &#39;Sharia Law is Right&#39; despite one of rules being to throw gay people off buildings until they died. And Iran executing gay people just a couple years ago. There are at least 10 nations where being gay is punishable by death (as of 2019). Not even including where being gay could earn you a prison sentence. But America is the problem? And not just A problem, but THEE problem that needs to be addressed. </p>	0.858

>Yea this whole take is fucking ape shit.   Though it appears you don’t understand it.   >There's plenty of black UFC fighters who have competed at the highest level.   That isn’t the point. Did you read carefully and with comprehension?  >The reason UFC isn't as big as boxing is because boxing has been around longer and there's more money in it.   There’s more money in it because it generates more money. That’s how business works. The conversation is that it will never be as big as boxing not why UFC isn’t as big as boxing.   >They are completely different combat sports, where boxing favors endurance and striking, and UFC favors wrestling techniques & grappling (thus a different body type is favored), generally top heavy guys with thigh strength.   A non-sequitor that can in no way be mistaken as a real response. Besides, strikers are dominant in the UFC. This right here doesn’t make sense for so many reasons but I’m not going to spend time on it since, again, it’s a non-sequitor.   >But that doesn't always mean 'non-black' as you stated Francis is built like a wrestler. In the lighter divisions, Nurmagomedov was utterly dominant for a long time, and is proficient at wrestling, he isn't a good boxer at all. This entire post is just wrong on all levels.  You’re don’t know what you’re talking about.   >Just looks like some 'black superiority fetishism' post, mixed with some standard homophobia.  If you feel like it a black superiority fetishism post and you disagree then address it. To my understand claiming things to be homophobia is against the rules. Your loaded terms and European words avoid actual and intellectual discussion.	EXACTLY why I didn’t get it! I don’t just buy the UFC PPV anymore either. I have to know who at least 4 of the fighters are on the card (and hopefully one full match) AND like at least 2 of them. People have been rotating in and out so fast and there almost seems to be too many weight classes or too many fights that you don’t get to love the fighters anymore.

They’re weak AF and grew up in a timeline with low interests rates.  By the time they’re in the mid to late 20s we might have double interest rates on mortgage for people with bad/ low credit.  Automation should be advanced enough to replace all the menial repetitive jobs.  Social media has created this illusion that everyone is living their best life….   Covid 19 called BULLSHIT on everyone !! If it wasn’t for the government welfare programs many people would have lost everything.	<p>Now stimulus checks don&#39;t actually do anything besides give free money. They are extremely poorly targeted and most people who have received the covid checks have not needed the money. In general you&#39;d be better off spending more on enhanced unemployment benefits, healthcare, food, and housing. Comparatively some debt forgiveness is good because a lot of people are really deeply indebted which can weigh them down for years. I agree a huge issue with these large forgiveness plans is the doctor, lawyer, mba debt. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous when these folks complain about their 100k+ debt expecting the government to pay. However average undergraduate debt is over 30k and there are millions of people with college debt who never graduated and have no way to pay their debt. That&#39;s why targeted programs in the 10-30k debt forgiveness make a lot of sense.</p>	0.879
When I was on vacation in the summertime visiting my nana and pop, various other family members in the uK as a adolescent - the sun Page 3 girl was quite the story to tell my friends when I got home.	It’s much easier to go calling everyone else racist then to actually do something. I raised money for the Equal Justice Initiative last summer in the wake of George Floyd. I didn’t just post a black square and pat myself of the back for being woke. I, like one of my favorite women in history (Elizabeth Pankhurst) believe in deeds not words. I do a lot of volunteer work, at my local homeless shelter, animal shelter, food pantry, women’s shelter, and other organizations. I play with the kids at a disadvantaged school in my city while their parents are taking English classes. I also enjoy working at this community farm located in the middle of a food desert (about 30 minutes south of where I live.) And yet, some woman on tiktok who doesn’t even know me attacked me for listening to jazz music. She said I am stealing from black culture. And she’s not even black. She’s also in her late twenties, whereas I’m only 17, so it was a little scary to be canceled by her. I blocked her and somehow she found my Instagram, and I blocked her again.	0.713

I'm Jewish. Literally, in the lifetime of living people, 89% of my family were murdered by Nazis. I know their names. All of there names. I work on a project to document all 6 million name's murdered by the Nazis. There are today fewer Jewish people living in the world today still than in 1933 thanks to Nazis.   Any claim that a Nazi is not an extant threat to every Jew is an antisemitic racist assault upon our soul and a flagrant ignorant intentional erasure of our pain from history.   Fuck you.   Kill every nazi.   Damn the consequences	But on to the more substantive issue: Nazism.  Nazism *is* an evil ideology.  Nazism is *actually* totalitarian.  When you call someone or something Nazi, you're drawing an explicit comparison to the nationalistic, oppressive, racist German regime that committed multiple genocides across Europe in WWII.  But the Nazis didn't start out murdering 11 million people including 6 million Jews.  No, for years, they had to be induced to do those things.  There's a popular image of Hitler as this kind of singular monster, the most evil person who ever lived, who murdered millions upon millions of his own people because he deemed them inferior, but that's not right.  Hitler didn't murder millions upon millions of people.  HIS FOLLOWERS DID.  And his followers were not singular monsters, the most evil people who ever lived.  No.  They were regular folks like you and me.  THE NAZIS WERE REGULAR PEOPLE.	0.882

Yeah, no, you're wrong, but by all means keep defending pedophiles. I'm sure you'll find yourself on the right side of history.  It is actually difficult to find the EXACT studies you're looking for.

Probably not, but if I see someone beating the shit out of a nazi I'm not gonna stop them	<p>I do despise the beliefs and methodologies of Nazis, racial supremacists of any stripe, and other hateful people, but meeting their beliefs with violence does nothing but legitimize them. It becomes abundantly clear that you can’t debate them or prove their idea wrong in the public sphere, and instead just have to shut them up. Violence doesn’t make Nazis stop being Nazis, any more than it would stop you or me from believing what we believe respectively. Besides that, we have a right to free speech for a reason, and that right is <em>especially</em> important when we hate what someone has to say. Because otherwise it is only a matter of time before whoever you grant the power to decide speech is violence places something you’ve said on that same level. The goal post always moves. Today it is white supremacist rhetoric which necessitates violence. Tomorrow it is a person saying the n word. The day after it is “marriage is between a man and a woman”, and so on. You might not agree with those things, I certainly don’t on the majority, but do you see what I mean when I say that it’s dangerous? We saw this once with the Sedition Act, and again with the HUAC. Criminalizing speech and thought does nothing to stop that idea from taking hold, and as much as we might disagree or even despise what someone says, the best thing we can do is let them talk and burn their credibility themselves.</p>	0.814

So, you're saying that people are willing to throw away the rational arguments against racism if they know that other people are having racist thoughts that they suppress? To me this is an extremely dangerous situation. We keep the racism in check just by people that have racist thoughts pretending they don't have racist thoughts.

The 40+ hour week dates from a time when the majority of workers lived in families with 1 breadwinner and 1 home naker. That one person earned enough to feed, clothe and house their family. This only lasted a comparatively short period. Pay didn't keep up with inflation / cost of living. Women joining the workforce, automation, robots, computers/outsourcing to cheaper countries all reduced the amount of jobs, and that brought down pay (just to be clear, I don't blame women! I blame bosses / capitalism/globalisation).  I agree with OP that for the majority of people, a 40 hour week doesn't leave much time to live and grow and learn and enjoy.	<p>Also yes, I know most people in the developed world are service workers. But that still doesn&#39;t address the issue: there are poor people.

I totally understand your point of view and I stand by it. Accepting people and not body shaming them is different than idealizing an unhealthy way of living. In fact, in my opinion, being obese or overweight causes a lot more trouble (medically speaking) than weighing less. Yes, EDs are serious, don't get me wrong, but obesity is serious.  Exactly like most things in life... extremes aren't good, always aim for the middle. I'm sorry for the models that have to go through all the pain and tears of feeling not beautiful enough! We're all beautiful in our ways! Love yourselves! And try and give your bodies a little love too by maintaining them inside a weight range that is health wise satisfying :)	<p>A more articulate version of this perspective is: not shaming obese people is good. While obesity is due to a number of intersecting causes, the fact is that each of them are difficult to do much of anything about, and shaming obese people only makes it more difficult for obese people to do anything about them and also makes is less socially acceptable for we as a society to do anything about (since would be helping these unacceptable fat people to whom we owe nothing — according to the perspective of the shamers).</p>	0.903
This is a very dangerous argument I see over and over.  It costs you, and society, everything. Making it socially acceptable, nay, I he norm to agree with delusions and replacing reality with fantasy just opens a Pandora box where the next thing will be worse and worse until nothing you know to be true is true anymore. It is a very lazy approach that enables you to erroneously feel good about yourself	<p>One of the disappointing things you do see from disucssions around abuse and violence is people trying to either make it quite binary, or almost be like they want to &quot;win&quot; the game of who gets abused - whenever someone gets abused, society itself loses and fails itself. We as a society and culture are trying to combat abuse, and in 2021 we still have people, like this post, trying  to quantify &quot;well this one is worse, and this one is better&quot; and divide people. </p>	0.896

Nice let's add kink shaming to the list of things to discredit me for. I've already said I don't know who Jim Marrs. Using his name has no impact on me.   What is delusional about anything I have said? You are using examples of other conspiracy theorist to try to discredit me and it's failing horribly.	<p>Based on your mention of &quot;excluding&quot; stories, it feels pertinent to remind you that I haven&#39;t made any arguments in favor of censoring media. This is analysis of existing media and how it impacts people. And because these are SOCIAL issues — covert, often unintentional — there will never be a clean-cut way to describe the exact nature of this harm. Similarly, there&#39;s no clean answer for how to improve things — it&#39;s about listening to POC about patterns of harm they experience, and working to do better. It&#39;s about platforming more POC and allowing them to tell their own stories, instead of letting our societal view of racism be written by people who haven&#39;t experienced it.</p>	0.897
And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition.

I am often told that I must change my ontology because it hurts some people's feelings.  But I am incapable of changing it for that reason.

You don't want them to live for their sake, you want them to live so YOU feel better about  This emotional rant is for sheer showerthoughts , it cmv  Either you actually start writing intelligent and logical counterpoint, or go back to your misery.	Only an adult mind full of misconceptions can create enough *suffering* or *discontent* to desire suicide when everything else is perfect. When you are young, you don't have a **relationship** with life. You neither like nor dislike it, you simply **ARE** life itself. Therefore the question of meaning or of life being worth living never arises at all. Suicidal thinking, then, is a direct product of specific forms of deluded thinking."	0.865

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	In terms of the police, they are human. People make mistakes. Police are ridiculed, insulted and they are quitting in high numbers. Those three days of riots had every cop working almost 24/7. They had a precinct burned down by protestors and they had objects thrown at them such as bricks, pee and bottles. I do believe in reform, but abolishing is a dumb idea with no plan, which puts a bunch of elected politicians with no experience in charge. In terms of police shootings by MPS, most have been cleared with the exception of Nour. If you want to break it down look at Chicago, Louisville or New York."	0.882
Absolutely. Democracy doesn't scale up very well.   Plus, Minnesota and Iowa combined are like the size of all of Germany. It's absolutely absurd that 50 states all pass the buck up the ladder to the ineffectual boners on the top of the pile.   The founding fathers did not want a congress	<p>So unless you believe that <strong>all</strong> of these countries <strong>simultaneously</strong> had the worst leadership in history, according to the numbers Trump’s America did only somewhat worse than average, when compared to countries that are actually comparable.

People you don&#39;t like are Nazis.  So if someone decides to not mask are they a Nazi?  Or what if they decide they don&#39;t want to get a vaccine?

Duty, Responsibility, Defend, Protect, Serve.  Those are all words that come to mind when I think of what it means to love your country and patriotism.  I also believe a country is more than just a piece of dirt, the country is the people.  To me if you love your country you are suppose to do your part to prevent harm. This means wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!  Here is another thought. Picture an invading military attacking your country. What are the goals of this invading force? Perhaps to harm as many as possible, overwhelm the countries hospitals, and to kill as many as possible. People that help this invading force would be guilty of aiding & abetting, basically reason.  Not getting vaccinated is helping that invading covid force do more harm to the country.  In the US there are now over 900,000 deaths.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed multiple times. Seems to me that the invading force has done quite a bit of harm with the help of those that are anti vax and anti mask!	<p>Yes, you&#39;re trying to give meaning to death, make it seem like a potentially noble and glorious thing under the right circumstances. When countries go to war, they often publish propaganda that tries to convince their citizens that now is the time to fight and die for the glory of their nation.</p>	0.856

Forcing someone in college to go through basic literature classes so that everyone can be on the same baseline is asinine at best.

I won't get into semantics about what you view your character as. I personally would think your character is more than just an argument on reddit but if that's what you want to water it down to by all means. For me an ad hominem would be more akin to "you like chocolate ice cream therefore your opinion is invalid". Citing a separate argument you made to question your motives is not ad hominem, but i'll drop it regardless.   I apologize for attacking your unrelated argument/character in another thread.   However I don't think it's that wrong to question whether you're arguing honestly when in another thread you're making the claim humans can't rape animals. Reddit is full of trolls, I don't want to waste my time with one. If you're not one, great, my mistake. Any further replies should be under my other comment as to not get cluttered.	<p>I mean my justification for consequentialism would have nothing to do with happiness. It would just be that if we have something we think is desirable (be it happiness, or &quot;not-suffering&quot;, or chocolate cake) then we should look at actions in a way to judge their outcomes as it relates to this goal. Not just say they are &quot;inherently bad&quot;. I can&#39;t see a logical reasons not to base our system or personal actions on the outcome. Seems like it leads to less contradictions (like the &quot;if everyone on earth would die but killing one would save them&quot;) thing. It&#39;s not perfect, but I think it&#39;s better, I don&#39;t think any moral system is perfect, so if your response is going to be to give me loads of examples that disprove it I&#39;m  not going to find that very convincing unless they are a) massive or b) you have a better alternative. </p>	0.887

I can't even begin to address the 5 completely different and unrelated things which you've brought up in your comment, i'm sorry. The CIA is not an economic sanctioning body. Fascism is poorly defined in the context of economics approaches. Being ""business friendly"" while applicable to a market economy means literally nothing in a centrally planned communist system. When i say central planning you're talking about counter intelligence and military, which further makes me think you're thinking of something entirely unrelated to the underlying economics which make a capitalist and a communist economy incompatible or poorly compatible."	0.879
I didn’t mean art per say, but arts degrees (could be bachelor of dance, or bachelor of music, or gender studies). Undoubtedly some of these are needed but when you look at the demand for jobs in these areas and contrast it to degrees, many people taking these degrees never get a graduate job and are usually rich young girls studying something they find interesting or someone with a clearly unrealistic view of their skills/talents and/or the job market.  Our taxes should NOT be used to support these people so if we do cancel student debts it should have some sort of criteria that includes familial asset checks, degree type etc.   But people signed up for uni knowing the debt etc and I don’t think they should be bailed out as people going to uni are already privileged ON AVERAGE. Would prefer taxes support the working class in unskilled jobs or trades	If anyone is going to make the claim that women get paid less then men because of their gender and this place is Yale of all places then not taking into account the hours they work will obviously feed misinformation to the public and drive the idea of the gender pay gap in rich countries to still be real when its not. This is the opposite for poor or religious countries but this is Yale. If they themselves have failed in the effort to make an accurate non biased statistic all because they want to prove the gender pay gap is real even after so many times its been debunked then remind me not to go to Yale.	0.873
Yes actually humans can and do cause earthquakes and even cancer. In fact cancer is so prevalent nowadays largely due to human chemicals.   As for natural disasters they are supposed to happen.

I completely agree.  It feels sickening to me that we are born just to have to work 9-5 for the rest of our lives, and live like that.  But at the same time, there's many things you can do. For instance you can save up, or take a loan, then move abroad for some time with that money. And perhaps you find a way to sustain yourself while you are over there, at minimal cost, at minimal effort, or at an effort that you enjoy?   I feel like life has many options, it's just that we haven't discovered them as we are. Rather we settled with our parent's or forefathers way of living, instead of finding new ways.   Im not sure thought, the idea of working 9-5 for the rest of my life seems really awful, when i could just live on an island somewhere tropical for the rest of my life.	however, you only have 1 life to live. and we often waste it working just so that we can in fact live. and I often think that our lives would be more enjoyable if we didn't have to do so. I do believe that we are healthier when we are staying busy. but I believe that what we do to keep us busy should be what we want to do. things we enjoy. unfortunately, we cant do that. not for free.  which is why the secret to happiness for many is taking what you enjoy. the thing(s) that you would choose to do anyway, and making money with it. though that is not easy to do. and many people are not able to reach that goal (so far, myself included).	0.829

> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	Then write this to the OP of the CMV article? I don't think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn't be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can't even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc."	0.883

I would say this CMV is way too specific. It looks like you are trying to practice a bunch of rebuttals so you can pivot taking points when arguing with your liberal friends.  But I will give it the ole college try: The AR is a versatile rifle, but your view is that it “can” be an “excellent” hunting rifle.  Your criteria seems to be weight, ballistics, accuracy, and accessories.  But then you suggest that not all configurations would be ideal for hunting. Any rifle can be modded for any situation with the advent of rifle stock systems.   So comparatively, to be considered “excellent”, and not simply sufficient, an AR would have to be better than an “average” hunting rifle.  Any top brand .308 rifle off the shelf can be reasonably expected to hit 1” MOA with no additional accessories. They all weigh between 4-7 lbs loaded. And most hunting rifles will include sling hard points, bottom rails for bipod and ring mount rails for the scope. Very similar to an off the shelf AR aside from the AR having side rails in most applications.  Out of the box an average hunting rifle, with the same scope, will outperform an AR. Every time.  The AR was designed to put a few bullets on a man sized target from 150-500 yards. To which is excels at. The hunting rifle, perfected over a hundred years, is designed to take down game with one bullet out to 1000.  Your CMV could read: A .50 cal can make an excellent hunting rifle. For the same reasons.	<p>Yes, I do agree that if you asked me what weapon I&#39;d prefer for wiping out a crowd of people, I&#39;d likely pick a semi-automatic rifle over a pistol. But I can think of plenty of rifles that could get that job done that most people who use terms like &quot;AR&quot; would not consider to be an AR. It&#39;s a useless, fear-mongering word. Those weapons are just as much defensive as offensive, yet of course we pick the word &quot;assault&quot; to represent them...</p>	0.883

I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.   I see no ideological framework where the use of the word cracker is acceptable whereas the use of other racial slurs are not.	I would be on your side that we tend to label a lot of things as racist when they shouldn't, though I do not believe this has has any impact on the very real racism, and if it has any, it would be negative as it would make closet racists less able to dogwhistle to other closet racists.

Anecdote time!  I worked at Fuddruckers for like 6 or 7 years. For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.  I understand VERY WELL that parents need a break, but not at the expense of random people I don't know.	But a few months ago, I went to a restaurant with an option for a completely custom burger. Choice of meat, a huge list of toppings, and choice of bun were all offered. My two friends and I all did the custom option. Me and one of the friends went way too hard on the toppings and both of us were somewhat grossed out by our choices. The one friend who kept his relatively simple, sticking mostly to traditional burger toppings and not overloading, was laughing at us as he housed his burger."	0.872

They should suffer the same punishment as the crime they falsely accused someone of if it comes out to be completely manufactured to put an innocent in prison.	Almost everyone forced to give one answer to both questions would come up with the same answer: the person who took revenge should be tried, and if his belief was reasonable (even if untrue) and his revenge was proportional, he should be lightly punished, if at all; if his belief and actions were not appropriate, punished more severely.	0.842

> Lies? Really? I’m responding to OP in a sub called change your view. Don’t insult me.  Yes. Lies. Stop it.  You are linking to a website that is totally false. It goes against all facts and common sense. It goes against what is on the UN website. Against what the US DoD says. Against what the Security Council says. Against what even wikipedia says.  And on top of it all. it outright lies about what Chapter 8 is and what resolution 1973 is. Here's plenty of evidence for that:   It's literally on the wikipedia page for regional organizations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_organization (click show at the bottom, it's in the list).  The US military considers it a regional organization in its official documents https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA445041 "allows a regional organization, such as NATO"  All of this nonsense about "regional organizations" in Chapter 8 of the UN charter is absurd. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-8 Read the chapter. It's like 10 sentences. "regional organizations" never even appear anywhere in the Chapter!  The confusion really stems from a misunderstanding of how the Security Council works. The Security Council can say they are acting under their Chapter 7 powers, https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7, to secure peace. Or, they could say they are acting under their Chapter 8 powers to delegate peaceful settlement to other organizations. NATO has made it clear that it is not interested in being part of Chapter 8 operations because its ability to respond to escalations would be more limited, if it gets involved, it's going to be through the more powerful Chapter 7.  But that's not an issue. The Security Council almost never uses Chapter 8! And what the original story said is a total lie. Resolution 1973 is a Chapter 7 resolution, not a chapter 8 resolution. https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1973%20(2011) It's right there in black and white, bottom of page 2 "Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nation".  I think someone carelessly overheard a NATO spokesperson give an interview and got super confused. Sometimes, they will say something along the lines of "NATO isn't a Chapter 8 regional organization". That doesn't mean it's not a regional organization, because that term means nothing! It's not defined anywhere in the Charter. They're just saying, if you're going to look for a regional organization to get involved, you need to do it under Chapter 7, not 8, if you want NATO involved.  Now, there have been people arguing for 60 years that NATO should switch to getting involved via Chapter 8 not 7. To have more limited operations. But NATO doesn't want to be chained this way. Anyway, consider this: all of these resolutions could have been vetoed by Russia. If they thought NATO was acting illegally why would they allow this over and over again? It's all pretty absurd.	<p>Provide a link to these studies. And please I beg you; don&#39;t let this link go to some crazy crackpot whack-a-doodle website full of flat-earth and other nonsense.

Your instincts serve you well. VAERS already has more than 22,000 death reports from the vaccines, which is needless to say far, far more deaths than every single other vaccine combined. Most vaccines are pulled from the market after just a few dozen deaths. This is absolutely unprecedented to recommend a vaccine to young people, at zero risk for serious symptoms from the virus (not a single kid who didn’t have leukemia died with coronavirus let alone of it), that is potentially fatal. Not just that, everyone by this point knows someone or many people who’ve had bad side effects. My wife’s very pro vaccine friend has had vertigo and other alarming side effects for months after her booster, another family friend went to the ER for heart issues two days after the second shot, and my 37-year-old former classmate from both high school and college died within 48 hours of her second shot. She didn’t want the vaccine but had to get it if she wanted to be involved with her kids at school; she left behind two young children.   That aside, who are you trusting exactly? Big Pharma? Dr. Fauci? All people who get a nice payday when everyone is vaccinated, even though there’s zero medical reason that anyone under 55 should need a vaccine against the sniffles. It’s all scare tactics, the emperor has no clothes. They throw this huge number at you - oh but 860,000 people have died from it!! No they haven’t. Who said that?! 860,000 people perhaps had it at the time of death? Sure, but they didn’t die from it. In fact the average person had 3-4 other underlying issues and that’s right from the CDC. About 3 million people die per year, so yes, a certain number of those people will happen to have Covid because it’s widespread. If you look at who actually just flat out died of Covid, it’s 5% of that figure. 5!! That’s as many people as die of the seasonal flu.   When people say trust the science, you know, I do. I have since the very start actually. The science says you don’t need a vaccine if something isn’t a threat to you. It says right now the vaccines don’t stop infection, don’t prevent the spread, and stop illness but may prevent more serious side effects (if the vaccine doesn’t kill your, of course). The guy who invented mRNA vaccines, incidentally, Dr. Robert Malone, is a die hard anti-vaccine mandate advocate and said that under no circumstances should mRNA vaccines be injected into people. That’s right from the guy who invented the technology. But why trust him, right?! I’m sure he didn’t risk his reputation to speak out for any particular reason.	more people have long lasting side effects that harm them in the long run with covid than anyone has been hurt by the vaccines that have rolled out. more people have died with covid than have gotten blood clots (by J and J) or died from the vaccines (i’m pretty sure only 1 or 2 ppl have died from the covid vaccines but feel free to fact check me cause even if it’s more the chances of you dying from covid is much greater)."	0.893

This is exhausting! You are asking a first year college philosophy question. And it's an ancient apologetics arguement. By (supposedly) clever wordplay, setting up  logically opposite parameters, you attempt to make your strawman God-concept impossible.

I've had this conversation recently and I fully agree with you. People here are trying to argue that power is a broad term, but I say it isn't, because you are particularly referring to the power they have to permanently ruin lives on a whim. The power to send someone to prison is something society takes too lightly.   Others argue that you can counter them with money (equally powerful lawyers) just proves the point. The majority of people doesn't have the kind of money you would need to very technically argue your case. The fact that you have to navigate the law with money just shows that even if justice is blind, it is effected by the smell of money.   Judges do not serve justice, they serve their own whims when they decide someone needs to serve a harsh sentence if they're having a bad day. I am deeply disturbed by this fact.  The solution I came up with is to have multiple judges independently decide if a sentence is just. People will argue that it will be expensive and cumbersome. I argue that if you were in a position where you wanted a fair outcome, you would want the best possible practice.  I have zero faith in the justice system as it currently stands.	<p>If so, then leads to another excuse that I&#39;ve heard for why some people were on the Chauvin&#39;s side. They said that it doesn&#39;t matter what the evidence says but because of massive political pressure to convict him, the jury had no other alternative than to do so as otherwise massive violent protests would have erupted. Their argument is that the verdict was done for political reasons, which they oppose. Again, I&#39;m not of this mind, but this is one of the comments that I heard during and after the trial.</p>	0.895

First of all, the OP doesn't give ANY examples of ANY of the claims he is making. So not sure how anyone would be able to argue this and get a delta. The mods should actually remove his post or ask him to specify what he is talking about instead of making vague and general claims like he is doing.  &#x200B;  OP, just remember, you called him right wing but did not provide proof. If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?

I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	Saying ""violating bodily rights via scientifically tested methods is not the same as violating bodily rights via unsafe methods"" is extremely similar to what a religious zealot would say. Just replace ""via scientifically tested methods"" with ""in the interest of sending people to heaven"" and it's the same picture. The distinction doesn't matter because it doesn't matter to the ""idiots"" who don't want to be vaccinated (or be sent to heaven). Even if the ""idiots"" survive the vaccine (or are sent to the afterlife) they'll still experience the trauma of going through something that they thought was going to kill them.	0.891
You're the one who took it to the extreme by saying things like " no one is below redemption " and " no one is truly bad"  and I doubt you could teach me anything considering you're sophomoric attempt at philosophy.

There is no reply you can give to disprove it. You can ask ""Why is it immoral"" but nothing about morality requires legitimate reasoning.

So you had a car, which many people don’t have. Thanks for agreeing with my point.  It also sounds like you didn’t have kids, since forcing children to live in a car and relying on the slim chance that you get a job that deals with food and lets you have that food in advance of getting paid so you can put food in your children’s mouths is not a realistic path to take. It also sounds like you didn’t have any elderly relatives who relied on you for their wellbeing, who you’d have to abandon if you just took off.  I’m not asking you to feel bad for me. I have a very comfortable life and have no need or desire to get out of my situation. I’m just not so self-centered and short-sighted that I can’t imagine situations that are very different than mine, an ability that you apparently do not possess.	I could have gotten a decent used car for 1K, **maybe**, if I had the time to look. But I didn't.

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	Not in women's sports because people who transition after puberty have a huge advantage similar to that of a person on steroids plus advantages that steroids can't even give you.  It's not about hurting transgender people it's about protecting women's sports and giving the most level playing field possible.  Since this seems to be a common counter of course there are genetic freaks, Micheal Phelps was a genetic freak, but what if he a genetic freak in the men's world decided to compete in women's sports.  Outside of a hypothetical we've seen men compete against women and absolutely destroy them, Serena Williams lost to someone ranked 203rd, us women's soccer team lost to a u15s boys team at 14 they have barely entered puberty."	0.88

In my 30s, unvaccinated. I just recovered a few days ago after roughly 3 days of actually feeling sick.   I don't intend to vaccinate, and I'm open to having my mind changed, but I see the same talking points over and over, and I still don't see the value. I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish. Not to mention, having recovered, I now have antibodies to eradicate any exposure I have in the future.	<p>I don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories about vaccines, I work every day, came from a working class family, i am white, and I&#39;m Christian. I choose not to get vaccines for several reasons. Because I believe willingly submitting to pharmakea (medicines) is to say that God cannot heal you. I haven&#39;t been sick in years, except pneumonia which I recovered from quickly without medicines. (Albeit, in order to soothe my cough I did sip of tea and honey, as well as dayquil. I felt pretty terrible for doing that.) In addition to my faith, I have had reactions to some vaccines in the army and as a kid. Nothing terrible, but uncomfortable. And masks aren&#39;t oppressive,  I agree these people can be delusional. Although, I can see the logic of it as well. Governments of the past have done terrible things starting with something as small as mandating the possession of a shovel and hardhat. Then blossoming that into mandatory drills, which intern led to a militarized civilian force that could easily train brainwashed soldiers more quickly and efficiently. History is a good teacher of how to prevent a dark future. Though thinking of America performing such a feat is a reach. Doesn&#39;t hurt to be cautious.</p>	0.875

Good post mate 😁✌🏻 You aren’t Islamaophobic, you are simply stating the reality of life for countless LGBT living in constant fear under the theocracy that helps govern almost all of the countries you listed. You will of course get non stop “whataboutism” from over emotional hacks, but that being said it doesn’t change the facts. Also, the hypocrisy of these defenders is often times astounding as they will decry China’s treatment of the Uyghurs who are placed in “re-education” camps to curb what they view are extremist beliefs which can (and has) lead to terrorism.. all the while supporting or at least defending throwing gays off buildings and/or stoning them. I agree with neither of those for the record since it has to be said in todays cringe world. There are Muslims like Maajid Nawaz who I respect a great deal as he and many others are attempting to reform Islam and its more extreme beliefs and practices. Also, for the idiots who say “[insert other religion here] used to do XYZ” - yes and they have already undergone their reforms in the past to the point they’ve reached today. Ffs even the Catholic Church, which has had some of the strongest anti-LGBT beliefs, their leader Pope Francis has holds more conciliatory views on LGBT as opposed to the past.  Oh and prior to him they weren’t throwing gays off buildings so there’s that as well.	<p>If you think Twitter&#39;s censorship isn&#39;t politically biased you are either arguing in bad faith or ignorant. Just look at their ruling on dead naming. They don&#39;t give a fuck that the policy they enforce goes against half of the countries&#39; view on those issues, they think they are moral arbiters. The same could be seen from lefties supporting BLM riots and violence, they just don&#39;t face the same consequences. Legacy and establishment media have been legitimising political violence for years, without much pushback from these corporations.</p>	0.858

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	That extra button push you're hearing is the edit key being pressed twice which is required to start and complete an edit, plus of course his strafe keys clacking. That particular player also plays on rather high latency so the timing needs to be even more perfect. Regardless of whether he can be a pixel or several off in his crosshair placement, consistent, large and fast mouse movements are required. Here's a better example of near perfect mouse precision and timing in a controlled environment: https://youtu.be/rhGq7_FGmTY. Watch in .25 speed to see how on 1-5 ms latency he is doing actions faster than the game can process.	0.82

>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.  If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.

Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?

I don't have "pronouns in my bio" and last I checked the cops aren't swatting down my door.

Luckily I&#39;ve been fortunate to distance myself from the platform before this trend came along so I cannot help much in this aspect. However, from what I&#39;ve learned, Facebook allows much of this false news to reach a high level of popularity without making any statements about its veracity. There are tenants in psychology that say that a group mindset will cause people to reach a certain consensus without actually critically thinking thinking about it. We&#39;ve recently found out that this  phenomenon is achievable with bots (powered by algorithms) as well.

Only the biggest lawsuits in history follow these companies get your head out of your ass.   Bet you believe that the flu took a year off too. You just keep repeating "safe and effective" and don't pay any attention to the fact that you were told you won't catch covid if you get the vaccine. Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.   Herd immunity? You really still believe that? Every country that has hit the initial targets for herd immunity is no better than 2 years ago. I hope you realize how wrong you are someday because I know I will never change the minds of people like you   Oh the seat belt argument that's a classic.. I can take my seat belt off whenever I want to no matter the safety to others. That's the same as putting an unknown needle into myself that I can never undo?  They were never intended to stop transmission altogether? I recall hearing from the leader of the free world as well as the cdc and fda that they will stop transmission and you won't get the virus.

Maybe start with who funds and designs what doctor's learn.	<p>You know what might get some off the fence (if possible at all)? Make every single voluntarily unvaccinated adult sign away their rights to seek medical assistance.

Who can't afford to spend 20 dollars on an ID. And fuck off I grew up poor and am barely above that now. We all get things are hard and places are far but you can walk and get rides from people it's not that hard. In the case that it is that hard you caused it so it sucks to be you stop bitching and fix it.	<p>This seems to operate on notion that there&#39;s absolutely no meritocracy in our system and people who have a billion obviously didn&#39;t earn it, while people with only 1000$ in the bank and on the verge of homelessnes obviously aren&#39;t at fault. But I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s that extreme, we have to allow a certain level of consequences. I think it would be fair to say in a lot of instances that it&#39;s not hard to get out of povetry and it&#39;s your fault at hovering on the &quot;one fine away from homelessness&quot; level.

You don't go from voting for Sanders in November 2020 to carousing with people who openly pine for overthrowing the government and keeping anybody who isn't a WASP from voting over the span of 15 months, but you DO you voted for him and moved right if you're a right-winger who wants to spread FUD and other types of misinformation designed and applied specifically to hurt Democratic turnout to the benefit of republicans.

yes. i am appealing to *proper* and *relevant* authority   no i didn't bother to cite a study bc my ad hominem was *valid* and *relevant* and the burden of proof is on the accuser   a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. you're parroting logical fallacy criticisms that you've heard thrown around on reddit without being able to differentiate them from proper usage.    a 2 second glance at her profile showed she lied in her first comment - bad faith debate    another half second showed she is a virgin - zero experience with either of these conditions, talking out of her butt   2 more seconds skimming showed she's a misandrist - she has direct bias in arguing that men's medical conditions are invalid   arguing with her would be pointless and since you already read my comments but jumped on the train I'm guessing 3 seconds of skimming your profile would show you're sexist too.   i don't debate with bigots, the explanations are for others	Do you get it? Your argument is the most oblivious incel take ive personally ever seen in reddit or this sub. If you genuinely need your mind changed about this topic, it is clear irrefutable evidence YOUR PERSONALITY is the problem, not the women.

As someone who has been using a flip phone for the past 5 years, I can honestly say I'm not missing anything. I deleted my Facebook bought a flip phone and a Garmin gps.

Its because you  want to use the concepts that minimises hurt to people.  But that is completely inappropriate.   A defintions whole point is to be able to meaningfully categorise things.  "Yup, I try so hard to understand why people get so hung up on this to the point of arguing that chromosomes and gametes are what matter when literally no one is able to see those on a day to day basis. "   Dont need to , they line up almost 100% with appearance.	<p>EDIT: Most people who disagree tend to see freedom as something that just exists 100% all the time in everyone <em>unless</em> another individual has acted to impose a restriction on it.

Leaves so much out, it&#39;s way less useful than my definition when trying to look at how we should make decisions.</p>	0.868
So you're okay with Russia hypothetically weaponizing and funding white nationalist groups in the US and encouraging them to violently overthrow the government? I mean that's what almost happened in 2021.   Russian trolls on Facebook spreading misinformation about how the election was stolen. Trump being so self-absorbed and an ego-maniac played right into Putin's hands. Culminated to retarded Trump supporters invading their own capitol, chanting "hang Mike Pence".  What unfolded in 2021 showed the world how fragile the US really is. It was a national embarrassment. US adversaries now know the key to the downfall of the US is to exploit the political and racial divisions in this country and pit Americans against Americans. Divide and conqueror.   But hey if it isn't Russia actively bombing the US, then it doesn't matter right?	<p>Then entire 2020 election Trump promoted insane conspiracy theories and misinformation, I assume due to his vanity and narcissism, and did more to unravel our country than any enemy.

I will upfront say that I am skeptical of this conversation going anywhere. Your responses so far have not indicated that you are genuinely interested in attempting to see my view. I will make an attempt though.  I have already explained why this mandate is an overreach. The rationale that was used is something that is not limited to one industry and can used to force almost anything on any industry. It appears analogous to the commerce clause interpretations in regards to its far reaching nature (at least to me).  I am not saying this is the only overreaching regulation. I’m fact it’s has made me start to question multiple other regulations. This was probably the most in your face one though to where it made me stop and think while the others I never really thought about. I am very big on trying to be consistent in my views.  In no way would this be analogous to firefighters. The only way it would be analogous to fire fighters is if I was saying all government services are bad….which is not what I’m saying.	Headlines exist for a reason and personally, going into the piece having read either one of those would affect my impression of the message. This wasn't Merrill's fault specifically, but if I was an employee reading the first headline, I would feel like the entire article was directed at me. I would perceive it as more of a threat than a warning because as I outlined above, Merrill possesses a non-insignificant degree of control. Unfortunately, I can't really speculate much more beyond that since the actual piece is unavailable to me."	0.883

Why would you think id find value in a CNN article when the two news orgs on the list I gave you are known for being not bias and are a gold standard for reporting?  Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1	This point is really slippery and vague to me.  I've talked to people who say this sort of thing before, and every single time I've challenged them on specific examples, I've been able to easily google up CNN reporting on the good thing Trump did they supposedly ignored.  Or, they find me a CNN op-ed which expresses a negative opinion about Trump, even though that doesn't remotely suggest the *news reporting* about him is biased.	0.837
I'm fairly certain the house I bought last year is taxed based on how much my parents paid for it in 1988, but I could be wrong.	>imagine you bought a house for 100k exactly a year ago and now, for some reason, its worth 1 million… so your networth is now 1 million even if you do not have a cent in the bank, imagine having to pay taxes on that million… i mean, you “technically” made 900k that year, don’t you have money to pay taxes 😂???

I didn't say that humans were the same as other animals or that we should be equal.     I said was criticising the beliefs I described.     You're making a sort of slippery slope argument here where by not believing humans are special, we would begin giving other animals Human Rights?  Don't be daft dude.   Humans are different than other animals, they just aren't special or better because they have souls or because they're shaped like a God.	You’re making semantic points within the overall argument and claiming you are correct - outside of the context they were intended in is arguably irrelevant, so there’s that - but you’re also claiming that you can define humanity and I can’t, but haven’t yet actually identified the *only* thing which categorically separates us from animals, which makes me suspicious that you don’t know what it is.	0.886

The usage of ""critical theory"" as a perjorative for ""progressive thought I don't like"" is just an example of a euphemism treadmill; for a while it was ""SJW"", but you can't say that and look erudite anymore, then it was ""cultural marxism"", but that eventually fell by the wayside because it made too many Nazis happy, and now it's ""critical theory"" being used to describe the exact same thing as the other terms were."	0.861

Then small so turn around and make the argument that because the Band-Aids don't work we should just give up on the people we're trying to help.

The Roma whom my gf was translating for were originally from either Romania or Moldova, where Romanian is a common language. Therefore when they move to the UK they can speak their Roma language, and Romanian but not English. There are not Roma translators available so they were tried in Romanian, in which they were fluent.   You're either deliberately misunderstanding a very clear statement to troll or are just really dense.	Now it is true that these countries do broadly speaking create defined ethnic groups we can measure to some degree. So you might argue that people of Anglo-Saxon descent are ""ethnically British"", but what happens if they move away? A German baby raised by French parents in France would not spontaneously adopt German cultural values, so the formation of ethnocultures is typically an accident, not a requirement. When it is a result of happenstance, these cultures are typically welcoming of people from other ethnic groups who are willing to adapt to the native culture."	0.763
Disagree. We should be turning the vulnerable into Soylent Green pet food	Yeah, fair. I think this supports a stance we'd probably both agree on ""food should be grown where it grows best"". The point I was trying to make, which I don't think I made super well was in two parts: 1) everyone eating like vegans eat now probably means crops have to be grown in places that don't grow them well. This was raised as an issue when the whole ""100 mile diet"" fad came around. Growing crops like that is inefficient and pretty wasteful, and might have certain environmental problems. Is it doable? I mean, probably yeah, but it'd be different and that's worth recognizing and considering those implications. 2) Cattle are usually grazed and then grain finished (i.e. they eat grass for most of their lives, and then they are rapidly fattened with grains). Sustainable cattle farming would probably mean all or almost all grass fed (grass-fed beef is currently a premium product, the cattle take 25-40% longer to raise). This would work very well with the idea of fertilizing resting fields, and very importantly \*it means cattle can be fed with land that isn't farmland\*. No one would need to grow any crops for entirely grass-fed cattle, but I'd imagine that would put most beef production into the Midwestern US. Cattle can eat grass, humans cannot. I mean, you can, but it's got basically no calories for us and it tastes kinda bad. Basically I'd say we should grow about as much cattle as we can support without having to plant grains to feed them, because that's inefficient for a whole lotta reasons.	0.737
Prop 13 is the reason both my grandmothers got to live in their homes after my grandfathers passed away. If the property taxes had been reassessed, they wouldn’t be able to afford them. What kind of twisted person are you that you want to tax the poor and the elderly out of their homes?	Sure there was, before Israel was created by gifting the land of Palestine to a Zionist endeavor without their consent. If I took 2/3 of your house and gave it to someone who’s great great grandparents used to live there, and then they started telling you what to do, how would you feel about that? How would you feel if after you got mad at them, they cut you off from more and more of the house until you had to live in the basement?	0.828
Yep, you made a false equivalency that is totally out of line with what the, ya know, science, actually shows, you foolishly equated smoking mj with smoking tobacco.

You definitely caught me not checking your response though, I wish I had, it would have saved lots of redundant and useless dialogue.

Or more likely, pray that if they do, they don’t understand it’s implications and limitations that you weren’t able to grasp yourself.	<p>In terms of political discourse, it is far more effective to post a flat out lie on social media claiming some terrible thing your opposition did as being factual.  People who want it to be true wont bother to fact check it because it is what they want so they just spread it around.  but if you said &quot;my opinion about candidate A is that they are not a nice person&quot;  that won&#39;t get any attention and will be dismissed.</p>	0.88
You're clearly not a good Psych grad, because anyone who was would know that DID has nothing to do with transgender people. And if you actually were a psych grad, you'd also know what gender dysphoria is - something completely separate from DID. And you'd know that the validity of gender dysphoria is only disputed by transphobes, but it's a very real condition.   The fact that you even tried to bring in DID shows that you're here in bad faith.	Anyways, what's your alternative? We're not going to just stop existing because people don't like us or think we're crazy. Would also be a pretty weird coincidence if our brains just happened to resemble the gender that we want to transition to, and doing so seems to be pretty damn good for our mental health. To the best of my knowledge, there aren't any other effective treatments for gender dysphoria, and I have looked for them, dealing with all the bullshit involved in being transgender, internal and external, wasn't my first choice by any means.	0.912

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society). Sure, gender might be important to you, but what will that bring in the end. Ask yourself that.	<p>I feel like this is under-estimated when discussing attraction and intimacy between cis and trans people. It may not be true in all cases, but I&#39;d say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a <strong>subconscious</strong> role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don&#39;t think people are actively saying “I could never date someone who was infertile!” — rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it&#39;s true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it&#39;s rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it&#39;s immediately a given for trans women.</p>	0.862

>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	Saying that there are other ways for a relationship to have a power imbalance doesn't mean that having a power imbalance can't cause problems.  It just means that we are choosing to regulate (either socially or legally) relationships that we can easily lump together as likely to have power imbalance while also choosing not to regulate other relationships that may also have an imbalance.  We regulate drunk driving because it has a very high likelihood of impairing your driving, but there are plenty of other impaired drivers (tired, sick, signing their favorite song) that we don't regulate because it's harder to do.	0.87
Yes, take a chill pill as fundamental truths are torn down and more children become confused about their sex leading to the children committing suicide.

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn.

So let me get this straight you think that minorities usually racial have to conform to the majority usually white names or else be subjected by society but this has nothing to do with race at all. Like even if we pretended you weren't just being racist your arguments idiotic as name has no basis on how good of a worker you are	Furthermore, the ""can't be racist against white people"" idea has made it so that certain people trivialize the experiences of white people who have been subjected to hateful treatment solely based on their race.

'Crackers' were Scottish people who settled down in the Southeast United States. They were seen as poor and low class, even as someone a black slave could look down on.  'Cracker' is a racist slur.	I don't think I agree with that at all.  My point was that systemic racism is a system of keeping poor people down and just blaming the poor for their own problems.  This falls disproportionately on black people because of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.  Was that not clear in my post?"	0.831

I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements.

What a load of propaganda.   ‘Israel is the only democracy…. Bla bla bla….’  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.   As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.    Sorry you chose to ignore the manner in which israel gained and maintains its land and jewish majority, while ignoring the occupation, but that doesn’t make these issues go away.   Your reply is pure parroting of israeli talking points I and everyone who has attempted to discuss this issue has heard ad nauseam.	<p>Population half of that of Israel, 4% of the GDP and no military to speak of.

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>I hate that &quot;recreational drug use&quot; exists. I&#39;ve literally only ever had caffeine and alcohol myself, and I genuinely worry what will happen if I ever end up in hospital and get over medicated. But without recreational use of drugs and people prepared to experiment through history, many of the medical use drugs we have now would never have been discovered. </p>	0.889

Sounds like you don't want to get you opinion changed and you aren't arguing based on logic, more feeling. Good luck with that	<p>My experience tells me otherwise. If you take a quick look at my history, you can see that I&#39;ve gotten a lot of hate when I point the double standards out. Even got banned from a subreddit where I was having a similar discussion with a woman. My whole stance was that women had privileges too, not just men. Who had it harder? There&#39;s no black and white answer to that. What&#39;s the accurate way to measure that? Considering how society fails to realise the legitimacy/severity of men&#39;s issues even to this day, it&#39;s going to be hard to calculate who&#39;s had it harder. The woman called me sexist for saying that, and started throwing insults. I did the same. And then I got banned and she didn&#39;t.</p>	0.859

I think it should be perfectly acceptable and legal to use any level of force or violence in the furtherance of any ideology, religion, social or political position.  Let's see how that shakes out.	“I’m not against the homo lifestyle I just want everyone to be aware of the risks associated with it” - People who use your exact same arguments	0.825
Again, I've supported my arguments and made counters. If you want me to go into more detail. DM me in a respectful way or go to hell. But I'm not engaging with bad faith actors.	You mention politely convincing with the Socratic method. Logical extreme: I am polite I am respectfully asking questions , but I have no interest in changing my own opinion. My curiosity is not to find a deeper truth so I can see what you see (even if we choose to disagree) and you can see what I see, etc, I’m just continuing to search for what will make you agree with me. Now I feel I’m arguing in good faith, I’m polite. You accuse me of sealioning. You aren’t wrong, but I feel like you are just using the word to dismiss my quite frankly watertight case. Did you not realise how good I am at showing the flaws in your reasoning? Sure I’ve been called out as “sealioning” before, but that guy was definitely using the term in bad faith as I was merely inquiring as to some of the subtler details of his initial proposal when he tried to shutdown my line of questioning with an irrational accusation of “sealioning”. And so it is that you accuse me of sealioning or rather you think about calling me out on it, but you don’t want to use the term, because you’ve seen it used in bad faith and you have to admit I stayed calm and politely asked my questions, politely reframed your answers because you were so obviously wrong and I didn’t have to give any ground because you were so much less right than me and that is why you eventually let it drop because you realised I had bested you in the ancient art of debate and that is how you let me think I had changed your mind to my bigoted racist opinion... for shame... you disgust me."	0.872
Actually, I have no desire to change your opinion. You're so far off the reservation that any sort of changing of minds wouldn't be worth the effort. You started by saying that maybe just a little bit "jaded", welp that's the understatement of the century. You're full on a fkn nut job and frankly no one should take you seriously. Your unearned sense of moral superiority not withstanding, perhaps you should get a little therapy.	And it’s maddeningly egotistical for people like you to argue otherwise, which is probably why you feel attacked so often, because you’re doing the exact opposite of what you think you’re doing (staying neutral) while also preemptively shielding yourself from any criticism of your ideology with thought-terminating cliches like “oh I’m not political” or “oh why can’t everyone just be treated equal, that will solve everything.” Like, no, it won’t, because people aren’t equal **right now**, so you can’t start treating people equally and then judge them on the footrace they’re running when a substantial portion of our population is 50 yards behind the starting line with a broken leg.	0.921

If you seriously think that there is enough profit in any of that to cover the cost of keeping large herds of livestock alive and healthy then i can only assume you're lying about your background.	I do agree that if nothing else, we can be smarter about the things we do. But I've yet to see actual evidence that at least cows are an actual sustainable food source in the long term. Its inefficient, causes global warming, and the cows are generally in poor living conditions. Improving these conditions and efficiencies would be a great step, but I think moving off of farming cows altogether would be a much bigger and better step, at no real cost other than losing one tasty form of food.	0.792

I've been banned from lots of forums, largely for breaking their rules, and you know what? I may think that those rules are bullshit (if you're going to allow fascists to blatantly and repeatedly lie in bad faith but will punish anyone who points out this dynamic, _your rules are bullshit_), but it was not a violation of my free speech, any more than it would have been if I had been banned for posting gore and shock images in every thread.

> No, normal people understand perfectly what OP is referring to.   How so? I thought it was nuanced? What you really mean is that "once you examine the nuance, OP's view is compeltely different than what is stated and makes zero sense."  >For the whole year of 2020 there were thousands of people repeating "vote blue no matter who" like a mantra.  And were they doing that because they only care about party of because the "blue" party is attached to public policy they like or because the "red" party was far inferior to them as leaders and people?  >This mentality is pretty common and most normal humans are well aware of it.  So there is no nuance. These people have no political positions and just vote on party lines because they are party lines? They don't care about healthcare policy, rights, or anything?  All these notions fade away once you have a normal conversation with these people.  >Only a pedant who just wants to argue for the sake of arguing will pretend to not be aware of this just so they can flex their useless debating skills because where else do you expect to show off such a skill?  Who am I showing off to? We're the only ones here. You've already admitted this view doesn't account for nuance. You're just arguing with yourself at this point.	Basically every social issue from LGBT right, gay marriage, civil rights movement, anti-slavery, etc. There were always people saying we should do it incrementally with realistic pragmatism and very little progress was made until people stopped listening to them. For the economy it's the same, the new deal wasn't exactly incrementalism. It's hard for people to remember since the Democrats haven't had an effective president since LBJ, but telling everyone on the other side to go fuck themselves is an excellent strategy in politics."	0.849
Yea this whole take is fucking ape shit. There's plenty of black UFC fighters who have competed at the highest level. The reason UFC isn't as big as boxing is because boxing has been around longer and there's more money in it.  Just looks like some 'black superiority fetishism' post.	<p>Boxing has rigorous system in place a a talent pool deeper than any other combat sport by a distance. Mayweather is no longer at the top of that - he’s a middle age man without the appetite to engage in dangerous fights anymore, understandably. However, he still has more than enough to beat both of the Paul brothers on the same night without breaking sweat. He wins this fight by stoppage whenever he wants to, basically.</p>	0.834

Anarcho capitalism is a fundamentally unworkable system. It would at best lead to fuedalism and at worst lead to some sort of plutocratic anarchy hellscape. We've seen the US's original government being scrapped in favor of the current one because it's failure to raise unified forces and others protections offered by tax revenue of the government. The US got libertarianism instead until the 1920s, which is a life version of Anarcho capitalism which failed because even the lite version, libertarianism, is unsustainable due to the fact that people are selfish. However, radical idealists will suspend belief and willfully overlook the fallacies to claim that anything short of mixture of ideas is truly workable.	The right answers to the conundrum are a jobs guarantee and UBI, and you want the former to be more appealing than the latter. You can't run capitalism indefinitely with no social safety net and with no government option and no checks on monopolization, it just starts deteriorating into a giant rent-seeking arms war race to the bottom that stifles growth and innovation, impoverishes the majority of the population, creates civil unrest and allows bad faith actors to manipulate politics with money, and basically undermines the stability of the entire nation."	0.898
I’m saying this is a very very specific situation, and you specifically don’t want an actual person with an extraordinarily unique disability to get paid, even though that person has a degree and works. I think that’s a dickish position, or at the very least, wrong. I personally am happy for them that they made it work, not mad that one of them is getting too much money.	I am saying that I think ""it is what it is"" arguments are unsatisfactory on their face and that we *should be able* to come up with a better system - but in the event that one cannot be imagined, it is ultimately more ""fair"" for the paid party to be offloading as little of the work as possible onto applicants until they are under serious consideration, precisely because *nobody owes anything to anyone yet*, but the status quo (evidenced by many responses here) appears to be that applicants actually owe something to the company.	0.884
Let's face it: if you only award salary based on how much work you can do, aptitude, etc. you'd get prorated down to 10 cents an hour, bud.	<p>The problem is that people will work for $10/day if the choice is that or don&#39;t work and have $0.

First, I said "perhaps you believe"? I didn't accuse you of anything.      I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly. Then why would humans not killing eachother be any measure of us being "special"?   You want to talk about non sequiturs?     Riddle me that.      And don't blame your inability to CMW as my fault?	It's not like there is some fundamental right to owning dangerous animals, we all saw Tiger King and found the people in it to be nutjobs, thinking they can just keep a bunch of tigers and lions as pets and expect anything less than disaster.

Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.	<p>This entire policy wasn&#39;t approved by the Supreme Court until recently despite the Trump administration doing everything to block it.

Attacking a group, any group, because they believe differently than you is wrong. Full stop.

You are no better than those you claim are evil; you are literally doing the thing you say they are doing. See h isn't violence. Ideas are not violence. Action is violence, and if you attack someone because of who they are or what they think, it is you, not the one who you deplore, that are to blame.

>The oldest attested -phobia compound of these kinds in any language is hydrophobia, attested in the Latin works of [Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus). It referred to the rabies symptom where rabid people/animals become dehydrated, but unwilling or unable to drink liquids.   That sounds like exactly what I said. The medical use is the original. Last time I checked, rabies is a medical condition.    >We're talking etymology, where there's no such thing as original meaning. We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written. That gives us the oldest knowable meaning of the term, at least. Here, it's the Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to run".  Nice straw man. It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary. I bet you can't find a reference that doesn't use the word "fear" or some synonym to define it. Go ahead, I'll wait.  Proto Indo European? I want to see your sources on that claim. What is the derived root?   Because I think you just made that up.   [A quick Google tells us](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/%E1%B8%B1ers-) that the PIE root for "run" is "ḱers-" while the [root of "phobia" is from the Greek word "phóbos"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=-phobia), meaning “fear”.	<p>Regardless, it doesn&#39;t even matter. The original claim was that &quot;covid is solved with a shot&quot; and if everyone got vaccinated we wouldn&#39;t have covid anymore. That is not demonstrably true and influenza is the best proxy we have for a similar disease in that it started as a pandemic and is now endemic due to its rate of mutation.</p>	0.778

I completely agree. Parenting isn't a job you graduate from when the kid is 18. Different boundaries or dynamics may have to be placed as the person ages but parents should always be a source of support. In essence it's about building a community together. I want my kids to not fear where they'll get money for food or rent or tuition. I want them to know they can always come home. I want them to have a stress free young adulthood for as long as physically possible so they get to explore and experience themselves as much as they can at the start of their adult lives. It makes for happier, healthier, well rounded and well adjusted adults. Adults who care about other people. The idea that at 18 you're suddenly expected to have everything sorted and survive on your own is a garbage, modern day farce demanded most prominently by capitalism and is not actually how rearing young humans should work. Many people, not because they're lazy or unmotivated, simply aren't ready to launch right at 18. That's normal. That should be ok. They should have a support system.	The only way that changes is by making fathers staying home more normalized and increasing the value society places on fathers. If the kids are being raised by a stay at home mom and a working father it’s in their best interest for the mom to get primary custody they’re used to their mom taking care of them. As long as women are seen as the primary caretaker they’re going to get custody more often it only makes sense. As far as abolishing child support that has nothing to do with women it would hurt children it’s literally money to help take care of your child."	0.887

Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.  Common phrases like "men are trash" and "kill all men" indicate that many people view men as morally inferior people.  Discrimination against men is also accepted in Modern Western Society.  I have read very many stories of male victims of Domestic Violence being arrested rather then helped.  Male offenders get [60% more time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002) for the same crime.	What I see now as opposed to growing up in the 60s n 70s is redefining terms with what seems to be intended results. We talked about racism in the past as hatred based on skin color. It&#39;s easy to see that that&#39;s ridiculous especially since the men who fought and died in ww2 were of every race. It was a beautiful thing even. All peoples came together with others to defeat the philosophy of a master race. A proud moment in american history only to be muddied upon the end of actions and return to civilian life. A very sad moment. Racism still existed we didnt learn our lesson.	0.867
What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.	My other main issue with the prevailing narrative is the vaccine itself.  It is largely being advertised as an effective cure to this pandemic, which is just false.  The virus has animal hosts, and vaccinated people can still transmit the virus.  It will mutate and continue to forever, regardless of which percentage of people are vaccinated.  They also believe that a variant soon will emerge where the vaccine is ineffective.  They've convinced people that the unvaxcinated are the problem, when the reality is that nothing can stop this virus from mutating.  I'm also upset that instead of focusing on treatments, we throw all of our eggs into the vaccine basket, and shit on people who are experimenting with potential treatment solutions.  You likely don't find them credible, but America's Frontline doctors will prescribe Hydroxy and Ivertecimn, and they are certified Dr's, not fox news pundits.  They may be in the minority, but they are qualified experts with a difference of opinion.	0.918

Of course the sloganeering would have you believe that all rape victims have the latter experience, which is silly, but it's equally silly to say that none of them do. Though slogans, by necessity of needing to be short, do tend to oversimplify situations. That doesn't make the slogans right, but it doesn't make them wrong, either. Usually people aren't out sloganeering if there isn't or hasn't been some sort of genuine problem to some degree. The polarization is where things get really problematic.

Elon Musk sold off a lot of Tesla stock in the days before Tesla recalled nearly a half million cars. If that’s not the hallmark of a hero, I don’t know what is.   Edit: *insider trading* autocorrected to *a hero*	<p>It seems to me you still don&#39;t understand how stocks work either. Admittedly, plenty of people <em>buying</em> stocks have the same misunderstanding which leads to many bad investments. Tesla <em>produces</em> things which have value. When you buy Tesla stock you own a portion of the capital and assets belonging to Tesla which are used to generate revenue. You are entitled to a portion of it&#39;s profits/retained earnings. If the price of a stock I bought drops I care only in so much as it represents a drop in the value of the company I own. If I own a company and the price drops because nobody else wants to buy it but it still produces goods and generates revenue and I feel it will continue to do so, I do not give a damn about the price. </p>	0.82
Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.

Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	The difference is that the greater fool isn't necessarily the Redditor. GME was shorted over 100% of its shares. That means that those short sellers increased the supply of GME stocks, and when their options expire, they are required to buy the shares back from the market to ""reset"". So, people are buying up all the shares, counting on the fact that there is a guaranteed ""greater fool"" because the hedge funds are required to take that position. This is only this much of an issue because of the fact that hedge funds took a huge risk shorting this stock this much.	0.888

You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	<p>The real solution is to accept the short comings of socialism and capitalism and merge them to create a better system. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have 2 billion or 3 billion, in both cases you&#39;re insanely rich. So you can easily afford to pay more taxes. Those taxes can be used to assist those that need it. Giving the poor means of escaping poverty. You&#39;re forgetting that people are an asset. So by investing in people&#39;s education, they can become more productive and innovative members of society, which leads to a better economy, which means more taxes which means a better life for all.</p>	0.888

Go to a different restaurant or work somewhere else if you can’t handle it.  How are parents supposed to teach their kids how to act in public if they never bring them out in public?   You’re evidently child-free, so why don’t you go enjoy your water in a place that doesn’t allow children?	Imagine being forced to live as the opposite gender you are now. Imagine your parents forcing this on you. You know that aren't what they keep telling you. You can't express your thoughts or feelings. You have no one outside maybe a couple friends (most people in this situation have little to zero social network) who you can talk to. If you try to do what makes you feel right you are punished, you have your games, tv, phone, etc all taken away because you won't conform. You are confined to your home unless you're with your family, you have zero recourse, you are essentially a prisoner to your own parents. What do you think you'd do after a year? Two years? Five?

> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand. And you set standards which we have no interest or benefit in following then condemn us for not following them. Eat shit dude.

That's not how rational discourse works, that's not how debate works, and that's not how CMV works.   If you make an argument in your OP, it is up for debate. When someone comes along and disagrees with that point in your argument that you can no longer counter, you don't get to say "no no no, I just mentioned that, it isn't actually what I want to talk about."  That is a bad faith argument and you are no longer able to be debated against when you refuse to concede even an INCH of ground from your original topic against someone who makes a rational argument against your initial topic.   You brought up the mandate protests. That makes them a topic that is on the table for conversation. Then, when you ran out of arguments about that point, you just said "no no no, I don't wish to discuss mandate protests any more."   If you want to change the conversation that is allowed to be debated in this topic, then that is a VIEW CHANGE. otherwise, you're just making bad faith arguments that any time you hit a wall against you can then just change the topic of conversation again to steer it away from a point you brought into the debate to begin with.

I’m sorry you went through that. No jokes here - sexual abuse impacts on men, and enforced penetration is as serious as rape.   I hope you get some closure, therapy, and justice.	Next comes the issue of culture.  It's very clear that there is a culture of rape.  Similar to what I wrote in that other response, we normalize rapist behavior (that is, behavior that isn't rape but if not addressed and singled out as bad, can lead to rape).  We bend over backwards to excuse rapists, and rely on almost a ""boys will be boys"" mindset if it's male rapists, (or outright say it's just not possible if it's a female rapist).  The thing is, if it's true that men are simply naturally inclined to rape, *then men shouldn't be allowed outside without supervision*, and if they aren't naturally inclined to rape, *then we should be focusing on what social factors create such a gender disparity in rape*.  When we look at burglaries, they are most often tied to economics.  That is, the more income inequality that exists, the more economic uncertainty a community faces, the more likely people are to turn to burglary.  To be frank, the people who say that ""watch your drink"" and ""use a buddy system"" are victim blaming are the same kinds of people who want to eliminate economic inequality, to get at the core issues of burglaries.	0.883

That’s now widely understood. 2) Cloth masks don’t work, they never did. The reason we were sure of that is because we can read, unlike your side. I read all of the dozens of peer reviewed research studies published from 1981 through 2020 and they studied surgical and N95 masks and still *not a single one* found any benefit against airborne respiratory viruses. That’s because even N95 masks have 0.30 micron holes and viruses are 0.13 microns. It takes just 100 virus particles for infection and millions are propelled into the air with coughs and sneezes. Even blocking 99% of them does you no good. The data confirms this - mask mandates states didn’t have any better infection rates than ones that never had a mask mandates. Masks aren’t for viruses, they’re for bacteria. 3) We said they’d mandate vaccines and create vaccine passports. They did. 4) We said there would be booster after booster. That’s exactly what happened. We called that before the first vaccine was even on the market. 5) We said antibody dependent enhancement was a risk. Studies from Israel show that’s very possible. Even the NYT acknowledged that - more boosters could lower your natural immune function, not raise it.

I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.  Anywho, here’s a delta! Happy Friday!	For the record, all of the weight shit is super relevant to me.  I've always had more strength than mass, and lacking reserves is not so good for extended work.  I was always a sprinter, high output for short times.  135 pounds and deadlifting 600.  Benchpressing 210 like it was nothing.  I'm not like that, anymore, but the extra mass has helped with my tendency to push until burnout.  I literally have more to give with a ""spare tire"" than I ever did as a lean machine.

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	I expressed plainly and clearly from the beginning what it is I’m searching for here: I’m looking for examples of governments who failed to protect their citizens then gained more influence as a result. The status quo claim is that climate change will result in individuals giving up more rights so the government can protect them from global warming, but this claim ignores the fact that the collective might of multiple world governments has failed to protect us.	0.871

>the implication is black people can't look up to and admire white heroes or vice versa.  And it's not like there aren't already a ton of prominent black superheros or anything. The Green Lantern (John Stewart) is probably one of my favorite DC superheroes.	So yes, while I do think recasting Black Panther would be nice, I don't think it's necessary for either of your two main issues. Marvel Studios has a lot of creative independence from the source material, and they could easily work around the unfortunate death of Chadwick Boseman to create additional black male superheroes."	0.831
Isn’t it ironic that they turned their own states into forsaken shitholes where life is becoming impossible and now that the consequences of corruption, lies, no fixed morals, criminal justice insanity, excessive taxation, massive welfare burden, abortion, & socialism have come due they want to leave? I especially think it’s hilarious that the poor ones who voted for these policies are stuck there while the degenerates they elected are protected from the consequences by walls, fences, gates, moats, and armed guards. I think we should take a page from Inglorious Bastards and tattoo a hammer & sickle onto their foreheads.	<p>My point is that we always blame politicians and the people who decided to do this which again they do hold blame, but it also falls on the soldiers and personals who literally did the actions. People seem to ignore that. Which I brought the Nazis argument because everyone blames not only the higher ups like the Hitlers or Goebbels but the german soldiers or nazi soldiers since again lazy people love to just put everyone else&#39;s groups in one and we held them accountable as Hitler and Goebbels so with that same standard we should apply that to the soldiers and military personal.

Do we have national health care? Last time I checked the answer is no. We have a system based on private  for profit insurance.   Such a sad person you are you are to call me a liar over facts you don't like.   Have a great life pal. Good bye.	<p>If your concern is that &quot;look, some of the best doctors only take private insurance and they don&#39;t take medicare because their reimbursement rate is so low&quot;, then a single payer program is actually going to fix that problem. Right now providers can pick and choose how to make their money. If there was only one payer for their services, where are they going to go aside from taking this new Single Payer program? Some may be worried about &quot;brain drain&quot; and we&#39;ll lose doctors to other advanced economies and honestly there is no where else in the world that has that much money in their healthcare system as the US. Where are they going to go? Germany has Universal healthcare, Canada has it too, UK has NHS, etc etc. China? Japan? All some form of single payer system with reimbursement rate lower than what the US has, so where are they going to go to make the big money? No where. They&#39;ll stay in the US because at the end of the day doctors are not robots. They have families, friends, etc here. USA as a global reserve currency also means that the same $ you get paid here, goes a lot further elsewhere if you retire to another country too. At the end of the day, staying here in the USA, even under a single payer system, will be the best pay they will see.</p>	0.875

The whole point of the term is for Americans, Jews, and Muslims to distinguish the male circumcision/genital mutilation they do from the female circumcision/genital mutilation that Africans do. You're trying to say that they are similar/equal by using the same term to describe both. Your view isn't about the best term to describe things, but a debate about religion and politics. From the perspective of atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, South Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc., it's all genital mutilation. Also, the next layer to this global culture war is trans surgery, which is often described as genital mutilation by conservative Americans, Jews, and Muslims who practice male circumcision/mutilation.  The interesting thing to the debate is that genital circumcision/mutilation is largely an African concept. The countries in the northern parts practice male genital mutilation (which are often described as Muslim and Jewish countries in the US). And countries in southern parts practice female genital mutilation (and they are often Christian/Muslim countries). The US is the exception. Because of the masturbation beliefs of the founder of Kellogg's, circumcision spread around the US.	<p>If there were a significant group of Somalians that identified with racial attacks against them as anti-semitic and wanted to distinguish this from attacks against Jews as anti-judaisim, I&#39;m fine with that. Or if they wanted to be included in the group of &quot;anti-semitism&quot;, that&#39;s fine too. Change isn&#39;t scary. </p>	0.832

Where did I say that veganism wasn't a choice? The point is that omnivorism is also a choice. And why would I care what specific meal you had? I don't understand why people say these things as if they think it's some sort of personal contest. I genuinely don't understand the thought process, as if you are looking to trigger a reaction instead of arguing in good faith.  >By your logic, suicide, murder, rape, is all a choice whereas in reality    not killing yourself, others, and not raping other people and animals    is the default selection.  Uh, what...? How is that "my logic"  >I hope you enjoy the active choice you are making not to eat the    delicious and nutritious animals we have evolved to eat and enjoy for    their superior nutritional value  Given that the majority of people are now overweight and obese in developed countries nutritional value is not the reasoning behind our food choices most of the time lol	There are so many reasons people may avoid meat. They're not necessarily all logical or good reasons, but so long as meat-eating isn't compulsory, it doesn't really matter. Lab grown meat may help some of those people, but I don't really understand your point. What kind of argument are you looking for? Nobody is going to claim that no vegan on earth will eat lab-grown meat, as it's impossible to prove (and possibly even wrong, as some vegans may eat it)."	0.904

If op wants to send his kids to fight other countries poor for the sake of the rich let him, his kids will probably be retarded too thin the heard of retards	The other huge issue is that you’re exacerbating class stratification by drawing different sets of options for poor and rich students. If you tell rich students “you can choose X or Y” but tell poor students “you should only choose Y if you’re smart”, a problem that’s already bad gets worse. The rich kids get to be *all* the lawyers, doctors, writers, journalists, artists, etc. and they can also choose vocational training if they want it. While the poor kids only get vocational training. The fields I mentioned for the rich are already disproportionately dominated by the rich. We don’t want that problem to get worse.	0.864
Do you follow the Kardashians on social media? You might think celebrity gossip is reductive and garbage and the people that are interested in it are basically stupid and wasting their lives... and you'd be right... but it has a strong relationship with religion and perhaps your opinion.  Whether the Torah was dictated to Moses by God in the wilderness or not, it's laws are a set of social guidelines that helped form a distinct community. It helped bring reform, order and bring social cohesion to people. People need social guidelines to conform to for a sense of equality in their tribes.  Over the decades there are many ways for those social guidelines to manifest.  * The Church until the last century * Actual Laws * Gossip, and people who Gossip. "Oh look Maggy at 42 is pregnant again. At her age.... " * Newspapers, Soaps during the 80s - 2000 * Facebook Memes, Twitter accounts, Trashy celebs are how morals are propogated and pushed on to each other these days.  Facebooks Memes aren't always supposed to be funny, they are sometimes supposed to push a political view on you. You Uncle with the weird posts is essentially just from a different social tribe as you - even though you are related! These social expectations and rules, this public lambasting of certain people are a replacement for the bible. That we all understand and conform to certain social rules.  With Politcs in America becoming ever more divisive (since and thanks to Trump) and escalating into hard left and right stances it's easy to identify how this is causing people to choose one of two tribes in the US. How it matters more than Facebook Memes, TV dramas and actual laws. So yeah politics is replacing religion in America somewhat but it's a meandering journey about social identity and more than that - trying to force people to live according to your core beliefs.	<p>But, I think one of the reasons why people have started shying away from organized religion is because it&#39;s difficult to reconcile your identity as a good and kind person with organized religion&#39;s legacy of violence and oppression. The religions that have the largest number of adherents today didn&#39;t become popular because their ideas were &quot;better&quot;, they became popular because of genocide and forced conversion. Religion has often been used as a tool for social control of women and minorities (look up the slave bible), and it&#39;s understandable that people nowadays don&#39;t want to be a part of that. </p>	0.845
