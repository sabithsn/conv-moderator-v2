I do.  I mean it's fair.  Then if it gets busy I call them back in to their fkin JOB to do their job. And if they don't want to, I write em of the schedule for their next 2 shifts. Give the shifts to people that want the money and don't give a shit about doing busy work.  Hey...what can I say? I'm a fkin fair guy.    And hey kid....IT'S CALLED WORK!  Welcome to life outta high-school!   Enjoy!  Cheers!	<p>It&#39;s the business job to ensure the customers have a good experience so they&#39;ll wanna come again or maybe suggest to their friends, charging them more bc they dunno bout where to sit won&#39;t help.</p>	0.818
I agree, real life Larping (except for a true reenactment of something) is cringe. This is reddit though, so I am sure this directly applies to half the people on here and there are are a lot of people who will be butthurt about your unpopular opinion.	Meta posts refer to posts that discuss the subreddit itself. The subreddit isn't perfect, far from it, and you may have a very valid opinion about moderator actions, rules, management, the users, and how they post and vote on various topics. And you are more than welcome to those views. Unfortunately, virtually everything you might say about the subreddit has been said a thousand times before, and regular users are sick to death of hearing ""the only opinions here are popular"".	0.854

Thank you for the advice üôè, heading to the office on Monday.	<p>In a professional setting (like an actual career, not a crappy retail or fast food job) where you have been treated well, it&#39;s a courtesy to the company that allows them a couple of weeks to find a replacement with less stress and should give you a couple of weeks to tie off any remaining tasks and get ready to pass things over to your replacement. I work for a small vet clinic and our HR/OM is in the middle of this process. She&#39;s cleaning out her office, organizing things for the next person to come in, just trying to get things together in general, so that when the transition happens it&#39;s much easier on all the staff and her replacement.</p>	0.707

Ok is a sentence you absolute numb nut. Did you never get taught to end sentences with periods in preschool? Kitty, you‚Äôre literally trying to correct a professional on the field they‚Äôre a professional at. How big is the stick up your arse to the point you feel you are righteous enough to correct everyone with a diploma. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you other than just because you have kitty in your name doesn‚Äôt make you a cat expert you know.	It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve lost a pet to the same kind of irresponsible behavior you‚Äôre condoning and learned my lesson after doing research for my next pet, so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to go through that again. It‚Äôs almost as if I have an indoor-only cat now who, through enrichment and engagement, has absolutely no interest in going outside. It‚Äôs almost as if the suggested method of care by countless actual animal professionals supports **my** assertion, not some self-righteous idiot who thinks they know more about cats than veterinarians.	0.855

Its perfectly fair. And makes an impression.  2 things happen. Either they get there shit together and do as instructed at their job. Or someone else that really wants the work and doesn't want to leave early gets the shifts.  It's a job, not a day camp.  Grow up.	Construction is behind in applying tech and it's not hard to exceed the tech savviness of the older generation. The new people getting started are more savvy but it's a growth part of it.

Yeah see that's not so much an opinion as it is a personal preference. An opinion would be that lockdown is better for everyone than normal life. When you make it about you specifically it's just a preference.	Nothing. All value is subjective.

I‚Äôm more so talking about the cases where it‚Äôs been proven that they committed the crime (on video, tons of biological evidence, etc) or where the person flat out admits it themselves.

Yes and a majority of people once thought that Galileo was wrong. Majority of Germany once thought it was right to kill a bunch of Jews and gays and other people they considered degenerates. Mob Rule doesn‚Äôt make things right for obvious reasons and my excuse isn‚Äôt hate trans people need actual help not people feeding into their delusions. You wouldn‚Äôt push a schizophrenic person deeper into believing what was going on in their head was right why the hell would you do it for people with Gender dysphoria.	<p>The problem is that people may start to feel like these tragedies could only be committed by someone who is inherently evil. It could be dangerous if people don&#39;t understand that average, ordinary people can be brainwashed and intimidated into supporting such hatred. The only reason we don&#39;t believe in hate is because we were lucky enough to be brought up in a way that taught us hate is wrong. Most citizens of Nazi Germany were not so lucky. That doesn&#39;t soften their crimes. It just shows how ridiculous it is for someone to think that they would be any better if they had gone through the same experiences. I wish I could explain better, but I just can&#39;t think of the correct words in English.</p>	0.904

I like to relax to ASMR - but it's been very sexualized  in the last year or two.  I don't watch on twitch, but youtube and it went from taping and scratching to these cam girls "trying on" fashion or licking/kicking or stroking their body parts.  It's just blatant soft core porn at this point under the ASMR "label"	<p>I was at both of her porn shoots for safety. I gotta say the two guys that fucked her I was a bit intimidated but she was with me another 2 years after that so it ain&#39;t all about the size. Additionally like others have said the porn industry is incredibly exploiting and if I wasn&#39;t there she wouldn&#39;t have been paid what they agreed and she they would&#39;ve forced her to do stuff she didn&#39;t agree to.</p>	0.823

None of those are facts, but different definitions being asserted by different groups. I can also link you to a page that defines racism to mean that POC cant be racist because the definition of racism is prejudice + power.   Here's one from an actual dictionary: Gender: "either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones."  Much easier to see that its linked to sex here.	People just changed the meaning of gender and argue over it. It‚Äôs semantics. If gender means what sex chromosomes you have they‚Äôre are 2 (XX, XY) and if it‚Äôs and identity thing then it can be infinite or a spectrum, but the argument is just what the word gender means. People need to stop arguing over words it‚Äôs dumb as shit. Just get down to what the argument is‚Äî1 side says that all there is is XX (woman) people and XY (men) people. The other side says they‚Äôre are more genders then that but I don‚Äôt see why that side can‚Äôt admit that 99% or whatever gender you identify with or are even, still fall into either the XX or XY category.  So it doesn‚Äôt even matter, because someone calling you a girl (if you have XX sex chromosomes) is completely logical even if you identify as something else. Words have meanings and boy and girl just mean XY and XX.	0.854
Refusing to yield to faster traffic is more dangerous than speeding.  There is nothing more infuriating than being in the middle of a multi-hour road trip and having someone in the left lane who will not move over to let you by, despite going under the speed limit.  What makes the most sense is that you must yield to overtaking traffic if you are in any lane except the right lane (i.e. passing lanes).  For some reason, some people are either unaware that there are other cars on the road or they feel entitled to dictate the flow of traffic. Slow traffic not moving out of the passing lanes is what causes traffic jams and accidents due to many people passing on the right.  Slow driving in passing lanes is oblivious at best, usually inconsiderate, and dangerous at worst. Let the speeders do their thing in passing lanes, and let highway patrol do their jobs.	<p>In general (not so much to OP) if you have the attitude that speeding is dangerous bcuz it breaks the law... I don&#39;t want to see you going 68 in a 65. Because then what you&#39;re saying is, &quot;I can choose what the limit is. no one should drive faster than what I decide is OK.&quot; BS. Now you&#39;re the law? Either obey the law (a sound principle) or GTFO for other drivers deciding LIKE YOU that they can determine reasonable speeds. </p>	0.89

I literally never said that trans people transitioning hurts me or that it require more than minimal effort to respect their pronouns. You keep saying that in every comment as if I somehow denied that. So for the millionth time, I choose not to use pronouns that trans people claim to be theirs because I do not believe those are the correct pronouns for reasons previously mentioned. By decision to not use the pronouns is not based on fear or laziness, but on respect for the truth of which the identity that trans people claim is not.	Where did I say that? I said that the concept of being non-binary is largely meaningless because the concept is stretchered to the point of becoming meaningless. I never said that there was a ""wrong"" or ""right"" way, but that for example what my friend would consider offensive. I however have maintained that the all encompassing nature of the non-binary identity is the very reason why it is largely meaningless anymore. Nothing more or less then that."	0.875

Common enough to the point where people celebrate doxxing and getting places shut down that were doing good for people as a victory. My I‚Äôve heard that one before it‚Äôs the same argument the trumptards use how ironic. Hell even white supermacy use that shit it‚Äôs funny seeing it coming from you even more the person that claims to be on the side of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù	<p>I know the consertive pundits like to portray progressives as hopeless idealists who are endlessly gullible to blatant pandering becuase I nearly went down that rabbit hole my self. But SJW/Progressives are just as cynical about blatant pandering as everyone else is. Rowling was seen as the same as the tons of companies that put a pride icon on their twitter account when pride rolls around, just doing it to try and score some brownie points without doing any of the actual work.

There‚Äôs a huge different between used and new cars, I was a finance manager at Mercedes for a few years, and left because of dickheads like u/sibre2001 who is the exact type of customer I‚Äôm talking about. 20 something year old who things he‚Äôs something in life.

It's not necessarily that I (or anyone else cares about them) it is more so that (if nothing else) a law to dictate helmets/ seatbelts in order to reduce the chances of a kid getting traumatized from seeing someone splattered on the asphalt.	If you want to wear a helmet so bad, just do it. I don't intend to argue why you shouldn't wear protective gear, as long as it doesn't make things worse you can if you want to. I wouldn't tell a pedestrian to not wear helmet if they want to, if they fall it could help. Same goes for most things you can do. But we don't wear helmets while we walk or while we drive cars, because the risk isn't big enough to justify the inconveniences that come with wearing a helmet. If you're fine with living your life with a helmet on at all times, that's your decision and I'm fine with you doing that.	0.849

I‚Äôd rather not lump the entire community in one pot as that is just brain dead. I am very passionate when it comes to the homosexuals and bisexuals (seeing as I am bi)just not when people start feeding the delusions of people who think their something they are not. I‚Äôd say the more modern trans community shares more with nazis considering that they seem to scream how much rape should be done on someone if they don‚Äôt agree with their views or vandalize rape shelters for not letting in men.	I‚Äôm not trying to partake in another round of the Gender Oppression Olympics. We can acknowledge that women face the brunt of gendered violence globally while giving the space for guys to talk their shit out too. When people started bringing up #UsToo during the Alexander Wang scandal, it felt like an afterthought (oh lol, men and trans men also get abused too, here‚Äôs your cute little hashtag, don‚Äôt take up more space than you should though!) and it‚Äôs a disservice to the whole point of the MeToo movement which is giving victims the space to share their stories. So why are we splitting survivors up by gender? I thought a movement was supposed to unite people, not divide us.	0.87
