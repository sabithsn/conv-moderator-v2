It does work. I don’t follow or care about Trump either, and didn’t like him being banned either  Free speech is paramount for democracy. Twitter ≠ government, so this isn’t a “first amendment violation” by any stretch, but it is a violation of the principle.   The response to that should be social, not legal IMO  (Per my tag, this issue matters more to me than *nearly* any other)	<p>By the way, Twitter did nothing illegal. And if they did I strongly encourage Trump to file suit for damages. Otherwise, this conversation should be about changes to legislature you want so Twitter can’t ban.</p>	0.741

These people made a mistake, although was it really a mistake? Many of these people were young & stupid (weren't we all at one point?) and were promised great paying jobs with their history degrees from snake oil salesmen advocating for non-bankruptable loans.  Also, this isn't our responsibility, the government can easily pay for this by implementing a wealth tax (on top .1%), banning stock buybacks, etc...  And you should care about these people. It's a national security risk to shovel loans to our younger generations without any benefit. It only increases the wealth gap, which is not a good thing.  Please keep an open mind for those that made these mistakes. They're not lost, they just need help.	<p>Yep. Millions went for art and garbage that isn&#39;t beneficiary to the majority of society. That&#39;s why most tradesmen are conservative dudes that didn&#39;t go to college and are able to pay their debts easily. People who graduate with degrees for anything medical related make good money, so do other trades like welders, machinists. It&#39;s the kids that went for political science and other relatively useless forms of education that think it is predatory. When you take out thousands and drop out or go for useless majors and can&#39;t get a job, who&#39;s fault is that? Definitely not private lenders. You came asking for the money, they didn&#39;t force you to take it. I didn&#39;t graduate, got a trade cert and have a great credit score, a nice, cheap house and am on my way to retirement now all before 30. I dropped out of college (network administration/Cisco CCNA) and paid my loans off, worked in entry-level IT and made it work. I took the cash out, it was my responsibility and obligation to pay it, plus interest because that&#39;s what I agreed to.  </p>	0.573

100%.  Yes, they're "private" companies but the influence they have is very public and continually used for "private" agendas.

I have yet to see verifiable evidence of any Uyghurs being abused.  Much like previous hoaxes created by the US government, such as the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and chemical attacks in Syria, the Uyghur allegations look like misinformation designed to demonize China.	Now we look at China, and see that in recent years before 2017 there were around 200+ reported domestic terror attacks on innocent Chinese racing from mass stabbings to car bombings. All of which carried out by the East Turkic Islamic movement, a recognized terror group operating out of Xinjiang consisting mostly of Uighers. So the Chinese government instituted what it thought was necessary to protect the people, and it worked. Since 2017 there is no reported mass terror attacks on Chinese soil.	0.555
I mean... they support people being forced to take medicine they don't need. They loudly cheer when the unvaccinated die from Covid.

It's really not that much of a stretch, tbh.	<p>Do I think they will try and exclude people who do not take the vaccine from normal life? Yes.

You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	<p>I remember Biden saying this after encouraging it weeks before.

Yeah this isn’t even going to go anywhere. You can’t even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don’t agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that’s all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says “go home”, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don’t stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to. And I’m not saying with guns, but with common sense before all this shit happens.	>I think the truth is that most people just don't care that much about the petty Twitter world and so most of the coverage of this sort of thing comes from the side who can claim victim points and get their readers/viewers the most worked up.

I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines. All of the doctors I saw on major media outlets when asked responded with either "we don't know" or "the data doesn't suggest that". Thats how scientist approach any subject. In fact, stating any of these points, or even their counter point as 100% certainty is irresponsible and without nuance. It is rare that anything is ever 100%	We *know* the pandemic is real.

Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	<p>Why does anyone care what anyone does so long as they are not hurting anyone else? Which is why I am not in favor of someone who changes their gender and competes in the opposite sport. They are hurting others with their unfair advantage.</p>	0.631

Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you’ll get less sick, and you’re less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	You say that, but is it really the case? Of the data that I have seen presented to me over the past months since the ""vaccine was released, I have been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that the ""vaccine"" does *anything* to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus.	0.788

Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	<p>I wrote a scholarly inquiry paper regarding mask use in healthcare settings. Definitely found that medical grade surgical masks and N95s were somewhat effective at preventing staff and patients from becoming sick. There was some overlap in my research with cloth face coverings, and those pretty much showed massive in efficiency at stopping particle penetration, though there was a decent amount of discrepancy between studies.</p>	0.761

Wait. He has a job. Just because it’s not 40 hrs a week why is he a lazy socialist? If he can support himself, which I wish Jesse would have asked, what is wrong with that? Yeah there are people on there who don’t want to work and be supported but the idea is to. work at a job that is not soul crushing and that you can support yourself on. The name “anti work” is misleading. They are more anti traditional work roles and don’t want to feel like they are being taken advantage of. I don’t think anything is wrong with that logic if they can support themselves.	<p>Once they get out and have to support themselves and finally see that while you work 40+ hours a week someone else is allowed to just sit at home and basically collect twice as much money as you do for no real reason except they were born into the system, will probably change at least some people’s minds when it comes to socialism.</p>	0.554

Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	<p>That&#39;s the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That&#39;s not a protest. That&#39;s not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That&#39;s similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn&#39;t almost decapitate the US government. Plus there was only a couple dozen of them vs tens of thousands of Trump rioters at the Capitol.</p>	0.6

It's full capitalistic, yet it can offer broad and strong social net, free college and cheap healthcare. The word ""socialist"" is thrown out so much is has lost all meaning. And by that mean, simply offering tax covered shcools, firefighters and i.e lawyers during procecution, is enough to stample the USA as a socialist country.	0.63
If she is spreading that detail as a means to convince others NOT to vaccinate? Then fuck her she deserves removed. The fact that people can spread it while vaccinated is why EVERYONE SHOULD BE VACCINATED. With a booster your odds of catching covid and having a bad time are incredibly low.    &nbsp;  The vaccine is our safest way to combat this issue, and the non compliance of people like you and those here, are why we are so fucked. You will literally create the scenario where COVID spreads the most and gets to mutate the most. As having unvaxxed and vaxxed people in the same population, actually helps create new mutations.	<p>There are enough anti-vaxx people out there pushing the narrative that she’s being cancelled due to the vaccine being dangerous that a lot of people are being alienated from the discussion about cancel culture even though they support freedom of speech.</p>	0.672

Please damn how many small pox breakthrough cases we have per day?   Please let me know how many breakthrough cases per day do we have for hepatitis A? For hepatitis B? For the polio vaccine?  Absolutely none of these vaccines stop you from getting infected! If you get infected whether you’re vaccinated or not you can infect other people! And I’m so tired of the outright bullshit no vaccine is 100% effective. But what do you expect for vaccines that were rushed to the market with the absolute minimum of castings were one of the major manufacturers is actually trying to hide their trial data! We’re Project Veritas is uncovered Pfizer employees admitting that they did not use proper technique for the chess. What do you expect? When is such a garbage show we are only getting one side of the information and you have people like you gullible believing what the media sharing. I can’t help it.	Regardless, I will not put my faith in a brand new vaccine, without research even available to determine short- or long-term affects, that the makers do not stand behind, and that the very creator of this class of vaccines is so adamantly warning against.  The science does not match up with the mainstream media or Google's recommendations and the more one researches it the more one realizes just that.	0.642

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   “You only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.” Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let’s be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao’s China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	<p>Communism is out there.

Medical ethics:    1) Informed consent -- the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    3) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    4) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #4 on the list (and there are more than 4 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!    C) Read https://i.redd.it/89ds3c6156c81.jpg	<p>If you aren&#39;t infected or if you have natural immunity, you are in the right, morally if not legally. You are no harm to any one.

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>By what measure? Death rate? Well in that regard your statement is obviously not true because it&#39;s been proven that people are much less likely to be significantly harmed or killed by Covid-19 with the vaccine. Chances of catching it? In that regard the vaccine isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s still helpful.

The issue that I have is that your choice does effect others.  For each surge that we had, our hospitals were clogged full of unvaccinated people.  We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.     As a physician I know that the current vaccine is still highly effective in keeping people from hospitalization and death.  Hopefully this will give us time for the production of the more effective medication.	<p>COVID numbers are definitely effecting treatment outcomes of even non COVID conditions at the moment. I would definitely suggest to anyone to look at the vaccine which reduces mortality significantly and can help unclog the system. Everyone thinks they will be fine without it until they are not, and it is almost entirely the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised who end up taking up beds in critical care. Ask a physician to address any concerns if you have them.</p>	0.748
So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	<p>I agree with you on Trump&#39;s spending, however I don&#39;t think Biden will be better. So on that front I just don&#39;t see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump doesn&#39;t have the personality I want.

 The study contained multiple methodological flaws that call the reliability of its conclusions into question. For example, there are indications that many people assigned to the ivermectin treatment group didn’t take the drug consistently, or stopped taking it after a while. It is therefore unclear whether any observed effect in this group can be reliably attributed to ivermectin treatment.	<p>I&#39;m not familiar with the study you&#39;re referring to but I&#39;ll look at it if/when you get a chance to link it. My anecdotal experience:  early in the pandemic HCQ, zinc, azithromycin were used concurrently in India, that was not supported by science.

[The actual number of deaths from COVID for age < 18 is 841.](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3)  This, of course, does not include the long-term effects that can come from catching the virus, which can include everything from nerve and/or lung damage to ED :/  >A vaccine that causes more harm than good, and evidently lowers your immune system by sharing a very similar genetic makeup to the AIDS virus (please do your own homework),  I am familiar enough with the science already to say that that is completely, laughably false.  >But again, its all just a conspiracy somehow.  Yes, you are literally theorizing a conspiracy.  I mean, I'm no fan of Pfizer, Moderna, etc, either.

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright?

My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers.

Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers. Being against tax payer dollars for potential mother's is why the left bashes the right over not caring about the baby after it's born. If you ban abortion there definitely should be outreach for mothers. Especially young ones.	0.587

Its nothing to do with the army at all. The story is about feeding anti mandate sentiment. No one seriously believes this will impact army in any way.

Sure you can, you just have to be willing to pay the price when some lib puke DA calls it an accusation instead of a rape and charges you for defending the girl from an ongoing criminal sexual assault.     "At the time of his death, Quintanilla had an arrest warrant out for continuous sexual abuse of a different child and assault family violence, police said."	It’s interesting that TX SB8 171.208(j) provides that charges cannot be brought BY a rapist, but there isn’t anything in there specifically spelling out that a pregnancy due to rape/incest/assault is specifically excluded from charges. At least, I couldn’t find it. There are specific exclusions for medical emergencies.	0.511

The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It’s not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it’s not a political problem. Get over yourself.

What about Japan only having 18k deaths compared to the US which is rapidly approaching over the million mark?

The WWII generation fought against them and for American exceptionalism, and now we can’t even agree on how to combat a virus. Sad.	<p>This is just not true. I&#39;m sure you live in Japan, but everyone I know who is Japanese knows of most of the big atrocities that Japan committed during WWII. Further, the government has apologized many times, with both South Korea and China basically telling them to fuck off because their apology wasn&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot; and then Japan rescinding the apology in response. All three countries have seemingly zero desire to heal these open wounds, but Japan has at the very least been very open about it.</p>	0.565

Yup and the right wanted to be able to hit protestors with their cars if they block the road back during the oil pipeline and BLM protests.

Reminds me of when the Ukrainian government banned helmets in early 2014, just before the revolution. Within days, tens of thousands of people joined the protests with construction helmets, bike helmets, pots on their heads, etc. To make a mockery of the government. We saw how that turned out. Freedom wins every time.  Tyrannical governments making arbitrary laws like this wake up the masses. And soon everyone will be out there with gas cans. Freedom prevails!	<p>I completely agree that it was pathetic how politicians endorsed and excused the rioters last year who didn’t give two shits avoid protesting but just wanted free shit and to destroy stuff.

There's no use comparing the current situation in Germany to current time USA, they'll keep holding onto their notion that owning guns will prevent anyone with a political or military background from seizing power like with Hitler.   I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past. We should be happy that we can actually step out of our home and not worry about some lunatic with a gun whenever we enter a store, bring our kids to school or being stopped on the road by a police officer.  I don't care whatever kind of response I get by an American by typing this, not if you're fine with the current situation in the USA and not passing gun laws. First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	I'm pretty sure America doesn't have much of a future. I'm starting to look for options. Hungary and Czech Republic have similar gun laws to the US.

The ultra wealthy have almost always been liberal. They aren’t a victim of “wokeism”, it’s just that when you have *that* much money, where losing 10s of millions hardly makes a dent, you turn to philanthropy, expansion, and doing your best to right the societal wrongs. There’s also a difference between “spouting left bullshit” and general decency, responsibility, and respect.

Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with an adult male having sex with a 13 year old female. *If the female is of reproductive age, and is willing, its just nature.*   Chimps, our closest relative, often give birth to their first baby at the age of 13-14, orangutans are generally 13-15. They have a similar life expectancy to us, if we ignore modern medicine. We have decided as a culture that this is not allowed, and there are good reasons for it, and I am in no way advocating for sex with minors. To say however that it is fundamentally wrong is just incorrect.	<p>That makes it sound less bad than it is.  &quot;Sex crimes with minor&quot; can mean that a 17 year old prostitute lied to you about their age; what this dude is accused of is having &quot;joint training sessions&quot; with a 9 yo, a 14 yo, and their mother at the same time, while also trying to bring other children into it.</p>	0.532

Fox News is really obsessed about joe biden, huh? The article should really be about how Delaware needs this state of emergency so they can employ their national guard as nurses and so they can keep providing free testing. Instead, it’s obsessed over the president because it thinks it’s readers are dumb enough to eat that up. Don’t be sheep, don’t just take this at face value.

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	Just remember. You’re the extremist, and when history is written, you will have been on the side of the fascist regime we narrowly avoided.	0.583

Defend her rights, sure. She a Marxist,  and by definition marxists are domestic enemies.  She should be on trial,  not in any position of power.

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	Zero evidence? Testimony of shady events and statistical evidence all point to some form of fraud. And there is no way to produce evidence of said fraud without having access to the ballots, envelopes, counting machines, and the voter registration to compare addresses and signatures. That hasn't been granted to anyone trying to audit an election in *any* state yet. Even in Arizona, the election board and Dominion defied subpoenas to produce those materials.	0.673

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	MLK was not talking to your sense of white victimhood when he said this. He was saying this in a time when it was impossible to send your black children to school with white children, or drink from the same fountains, or sit anywhere on a bus. He was talking about treating black people fairly.	0.652
PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead.   :heart:️Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate :heart:️.

I know we’ve been requiring vaccines for children going into schools for ages now, and these vaccines are widely proven safe and effective so I simply think you’d be stupid not go get them and it shouldn’t even be a law to do so, let the stupid die off on their own accord.</p>	0.726
“Wonder how y’all look like.”   Jesus Christ, did you sleep through English class? Fucking living up to the stereotype every day huh?	Your whole argument is based on the idea that if people look or act differently than what you consider “American”, they must be here illegally. Perhaps you’ve never left your tiny backwoods town, and never made it past high school, but here’s a free tip for you: this is a very diverse country. Americans “normal” actions and looks come within a very wide range. It just takes a little more culture and a little less bigotry to see it.	0.434

Answer:👇  Sadly, it’s the West that’s been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia’s doorstep.  Putin hasn’t been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It’s been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What’s happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‘RESPONDED’ by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets’ military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America’s nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn’t having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn’t fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we’re a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.👇  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	Also, Putin is only relevant to Europe. They’re a paper tiger the left likes to pretend is still a superpower beyond nukes. They aren’t. I’d have done more than send Ukraine Javelin missiles when Putin shot down an airliner and invaded Ukraine. I’d have sent them a squadron of F-22’s and an AWACS to control them till Putin went back to his hunting cabin.	0.676

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	What happens next? Colleges have an endless supply of students with endless amounts of federally guaranteed loan money. Banks take on no risk, so they lend to anyone willing to apply for them. Colleges create more and more coursework and degrees that don’t lead to jobs, and worse yet, they indoctrinate entire generations to believe they need a degree to get ahead in life. Tuition skyrockets, student loan debt soars, all because we decided to take away the free market forces that kept college affordable (pre-1965) in the first place.	0.77

> expert  *J. Alex Halderman professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where he is also director of the Center for Computer Security & Society.*  *After the 2016 United States presidential election, computer scientists, including Halderman, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly, while Clinton won New Hampshire and Maine narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome.*  *On 21 June 2017, Halderman testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.The hearing, titled "Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election" focused on the federal government's role in safeguarding U.S. elections from outside interference.*  *Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Halderman stated that a software glitch during the unofficial vote tally was not caused by fraud, but rather by human error...*  ...*and said the conspiracy theory that a supercomputer was used to switch votes from Trump to Biden was "nonsense".*	<p>Third, the issue with Trump&#39;s claims that votes randomly appeared was explained by the machines having issues which were corrected. Votes were updated in clusters. Trump had bumps of votes, too. It wasn&#39;t just Biden that had 90,000 random votes found for him. More people just happened to vote for Biden in a democratic county.

First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights’ worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?”	&quot;The entire issue they have with voter id is that red states will make them hard to get for poor people and minorities.&quot;	0.701

All things that Black Americans would draw crucial advantages from, even more so than other Americans.  > even voted against MLK, Jr. Day being recognized  So you base your voting decisions on the distant past. Okay. Where exactly do you draw the line? 2010? 1980? Surely somewhere after 1965, right? After all, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party, **and** the pro-Jim Crow party? So how come you don't eschew them for past misdeeds?  I'd argue that the Republican Party has an imperfect, yet infinitely better track record at how the treat Black Americans than the Democrats. Slavery and Jim Crow are kind of hard to top, no?  > If I'm wrong prove it ... if you have the mental ability to do so  Pff hahaha, you know what, I had another paragraph typed out, but I won't bother. Have fun voting straight blue and repaing all the rewards it's yielded you for the last 50 years. 😂 In the meantime, I'll take my chances with my oh-so-evil far-right nuclear family and sound economic policies.	<p>Look, you vote and support the democrats as you please. The values and policies they promote are clearly what you support but don&#39;t be a fool and assume all black people think along your lines. I have seen democrat policies in states like New York, California, Michigan, Illinois and cities like Portland, Chicago, Baltimore etc. I have seen how it leads to poverty, gang violence, gun deaths, high abortions, high unemployment, high illiteracy, single parenthood, welfare dependency, and so many more problems that have destroyed the black community. If you think that is good for black people, no worries. It&#39;s your view. if I think that is terrible for black people, then that&#39;s my view as a black person.</p>	0.616

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	During a pandemic you need multiple mitigation strategies. CDC screwed up big time when they prematurely announced vaccinated people could stop masking. We needed more time and more data before making that call. Too much pressure is being put on vaccines to be bulletproof, and they’re not, even though they work really well.	0.749

You wanna hear some real stupidity? People commenting things like “stupidity knows no bounds” in a conservative sub when you’ll go to a dem sub and see the exact same comments there. If you picked 10 random comments in both subs and got rid of the obvious words that’d give it away, no one would be able to accurately say which sub the comments came from because they’re all the same comments.   C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb” C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb”  Back and forth forever and ever.   Politics are fucking stupid.   Another thing that drives me nuts is when I see “they’re hypocrites!” I see the same comment in both subs. And the funny thing is THEY’RE BOTH RIGHT AT ALL TIMES BUT NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHEN THEY DO IT! “Well, we’re being hypocrites right now because they’re hypocrites” but they were hypocrites because the other side was hypocritical and so on forever and ever and ever.   It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don’t actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	<p>I mean, honest question, not trying to be a dick, how is it possible that this hypocrisy is not apparent to you or literally every other conservative who is commenting here? </p>	0.565

The wikipedia for trans athletes lists a number of ftm athletes. But only three have competed against men. A college swimmer, a boxer who has had one professional fight as a man, and an olympic duathalon.  Realistically even giving a buttload of testosterone is not going to bridge the gap of a female body vs a male body.   But we also see more men who think they are women, it's a very recent change for so many teen girls to think they are boys, and I believe they also make up the biggest percentage of people who detransition.	The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition.

Right, so by you’re logic you’re quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can’t support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it’s acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It’s the ‘parents responsibility’ to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they’ll suddenly ‘get it’ and do a good job… but they’re not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	And on the ""something wrong with the baby"" argument, I think that's even worse.

Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	<p>Get the fuck out of here with that revisionist bullshit. Go watch the video of his whole speech on Jan 6, go look at an archive of Trumps tweets after the election. He didn’t say he barely won, he talked about hundreds of thousands (!!!!) of fake/fraudulent/whatever votes and there is still no evidence of even 10! Then he told people to come to DC for a protest and that “it will be wild”. He lied out his ass, whipped a mob into a frenzy, then told them to walk down the street to “stop the steal”. One of the single worst acts by any president in the history of the country - actively attempting to thwart the results of an election using lies and a mob. Un-fucking-forgiveable.</p>	0.574

Yes, a Fox News video. We should definitely base our opinions and world view off of anecdata. Again, try reading actual articles rather than the propagandized versions of peoples’ arguments trickled down to you through Fox News.   In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	I believe that voting is a right but with rights go responsibility. I don’t think any law should be passed to prevent or make it more difficult for legal voters to vote just to target certain groups of voters. I also think that is important to have laws that check the validity of voters. Especially, as divided as our country now is, it is important that people be able to trust the vote.	0.535

First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	<p>E. <strong>Not let hundreds of thousands of people across the border who have no vaccine whatsoever</strong>.

Just give me some actual hard evidence. All I am seeing is people who were told the election was rigged, so they believed the election was rigged, and they will listen to anyone who says anything in defense of that, but they won’t listen to anyone who has anything to say against that. People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn’t change the outcome. For there to be some large scale conspiracy, they would have to get past the same people who have been volunteering their precious time for years just because they believe in the power of democracy.	Second, possibly tens of millions of voters believe that this election was rigged and stolen. I am not one of them.

Yes folks, Its a race to the bottom. Both parties suck now.  According to the Gallup Poll in 2018  "President Donald Trump's job approval rating averaged 38.4% during his    first year in office -- slightly more than 10 percentage points lower    than any other elected president's first-year average. Bill Clinton is    the only other president who was below 50% in his first year. All others    were 57% or higher, with six of the 10 presidents elected since World    War II averaging 60% or better in their first year."  &#x200B;  Sad isn't it. Lets get some real LEADERS in office, not these clowns.	<p>Trump left office with a 90% approval rating among republicans and that number hardly waivered his entire presidency.

This seems like an overwhelmingly positive change. Why wouldn’t we want insurance companies to better be able to assess situations? This will allow police to more concretely arrest the right people.

What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water. The healthier they, the more they can work. And citizens who know their government has their backs are more likely to be happy, and provide more output.   That said, I'd probably just model it after Canada's or Germany's system. They have proven to be robust, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.	<li><p>Health insurance tied to employmen....Now this one is a real mixed bag for me. On the plus side for universal Healthcare I think it would be hugely helpful so that people could make career changes or take risks with opportunities. I have one in particular that could potentially make me a millionaire if it worked out but in doing so my wife and child would be without health insurance. That&#39;s not a risk I&#39;m willing to take. On the same token, I like the idea of those who are working and contributing to society being the ones to stay healthy so they can continue to do so while those who are a drain on society don&#39;t get to be a drain on Healthcare as well </p>	0.669

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead. Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate.

A real quick Google search will do you good. Trump visited The Hermitage on March 15, 2017. Gave a speech and laid flowers on Jackson's grave.

Meanwhile if you were to add up the total amount of deaths through religion, whether it's being a martyr to being persecuted for your religion, it adds up to ~200 million. So by your logic all religion- whether it be Christianity, Catholicism, Islamic, and all other religions are terrible to the point that if you mention God or have a cross on your wall it's akin to heiling Hitler and hanging a swastika on your wall.   We can add up how many people have died for or been killed by America over the course of two world wars in the name of preserving our American capitalistic values and freedoms and guess what that number would be? 100 million. So now again, with your logic, American Capitalistism also falls under the category of being classified as a bad word.   Left or right, y'all are actual troglodytes who care only about the tribal "us vs them" mentality and will twist your reality, stats, and logic to appease your sensibilities.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...    Those irrational wokes are at it again!	Do you think Rapists give a shit about this new law?	0.559

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots. If you couldn't or can't see and acknowledge that fact that was noted even before the election occurred, then your reaction to this issue is obviously based purely on the election results and your feelings about them.	0.715

The responses to your question fog up what he ACTUALLY said.  He talked about the badness of whiteness for the vast majority of the podcast.   That whites are genetically incapable of sympathy and such.  That is NOT why he was fired from his job.  He was talking to an ex-member of Public Enemy ("Professor Griff")...who was in full agreement.  Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).

It used to be extremely anti job, then people started posting about how they actually wanted fair compensation for working, like actually getting a livable wage among many other things like having a safe work environment, which would increase staff happiness and productivity. So the sub transformed into that.

Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	<p>Moreover abortions are always fatal, wheras being contagious and spreading a virus (with respect to covid 19) is almost always not fatal.

Last Thursday I went to the funeral for my best friends father. He died from Covid because he was unvaccinated. He was unvaccinated becuase he listened to people like you.  Many people like myself have suffered greatly and lost loved ones at the hands of Covid. I can tell by your gross comments that you are lucky enough to not have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to Covid. Be better.	I know the mantra is that almost everyone dying of covid today is unvaccinated, but I'm incredibly skeptical of those stats. I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even *had* covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don't know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don't know, but I'd assume she was unvaccinated. So that's 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50.	0.668

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	Because COVID is an order of magnitude more contagious than the flu. The reason you get a flu shot every year is because there's multiple strains of the virus. There's currently only a handful of strains of COVID.	0.738

I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court." Biden especially at his age probably has his cabinet taking the reigns moreso than others.  Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.  Unless of course you are saying that simply because he's a democrat, in which case I would ask that you try to be a little more open minded, as the dismissal of others simply due to political affiliation isn't really helping anyone.	Biden might not be Trump in his mannerisms, but he also gets a lot of help from the media to ignore the fact that he's really NOT a nice person. I mean for goodness sake there are plenty of times where he blew up on reporters and voters for asking questions he didn't like, where he said he wished he could punch Trump in the face, ""race shamed"" black people for even thinking about not voting for him, etc... the guy is no peach either.	0.564

You do know that your body doesn't know why it's producing the injected spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine, right? This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	<p>A vaccine is often just stimulating your immune system to kick in and start working, building the memory cells to detect future infection early, though it is often not quite as good as your natural system depending on the strategy (hence why live virus vaccines tend to do better than dead virus vaccines). You cannot make this kind of decision to do vaccine boosters yearly without knowing if it is even necessary. For many people, we may find solid antibody levels good enough for at least decades. Maybe they should get a booster once per 10 years? Maybe not at all. We don&#39;t know yet. </p>	0.761
Is it extremely small compared to the one life?  My math is back of napkin, but there's \~300 million people in the US, so to "balance" the 100% of 1 you only need \~0.0000000003%(1/300,000,000). And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	<p>Just because you don&#39;t die doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re home free. Not only could there be effects we don&#39;t know yet, but you&#39;re also giving the virus an opportunity to mutate into another variant. Multiple that by millions and you get the delta variant.

Big Pharma lobbying against weed is based on 100% bullshit.    They don't care about recreational marijuana use.  Their issue is with people who sell medical marijuana using unscientific claims.

They have companies like Amway.  Medical marijuana industry wants more lax FDA regulation than Big Pharma gets.  Their issue is not with weed but with the herbal supplement and vitamin market, giving weed products FDA medical labels without the years of research to back them.   They don't care about recreational marijuana use, they welcome it.  It will creates more customers for them in the long run.

I’d like to agree with you, but earlier this year there were hundreds of articles touting this information. The narrative changes everyday sadly.	You say that, but is it really the case? Of the data that I have seen presented to me over the past months since the ""vaccine was released, I have been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that the ""vaccine"" does *anything* to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus.	0.691

Why did you do the interview we voted on not to do any interviews and you sent the worst person to represent us the way they spoke dressed and gave anti work a bad name  The mods in the subreddit decided to ban everyone who spoke about it with the reason being trolls, right wingers, left wingers, brigadiers, and transphobes ....

The person claiming to be naturally vaccinated is the one who is anti science. We have literal science that shows COVID can fuck your world up and even kill you, after you have had it already.

Certainly won’t trust you on this.  You do realize that monoclonal antibodies is more experimental than the vaccine right?

Is it a fair critique to argue they’re being overly cautious and that their approach has downsides? Absolutely.

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	<p>We&#39;re in a pandemic and you&#39;re not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It&#39;s not ideal when anyone—much less a child—has to spend time in the ICU, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.</p>	0.748

Maybe I should rephrase this: the government sponsored a program that loaners promised would guarantee success to a lot of vulnerable people, and is causing a significant portion of younger generations to have a much lower percentage of wealth. This is a national security risk, and was a mistake of the government to allow this many people to fall this far. We are paying the consequences of poor policymaking of our elders, not because of some uneducated kids.	<p>The young got a raw deal because older generations voted to strip funding from schools after they got all their free tuition money. And now they look forward to social security and medicare paid for by my tax dollars. It&#39;s time for some reparations.

I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.    All of my colleagues have been vaccinated, as well as a significant amount of the other hospital workers.  The only people we see getting sick are generally the ones who are unvaccinated.  Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.  Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	Vaccines are developed through research and science.  And if these people are rejecting science, I don't think they should waste further public resources by getting treated at hospital, because medical advancement is science and they rejected them.	0.747

“Obvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities”  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.  Conservatives want a strong leader who will do what’s right for the country without engaging in inflammatory, childish attacks and furthering the divide in this country. We need a presidential candidate who can have honor, dignity, and class. Trump unfortunately does not possess those qualities and never will.   Yes I voted for him in 2020. No I will not vote for him again.	<p>Show me proof of widespread voter fraud. You know how I know? In order for it to matter you would need thousands of votes. Let&#39;s say you buy 1000 votes. People go in, sign as someone else, and vote. If only 20% of the actual people go in to vote and see someone already signed their name that&#39;s 200 people complaining and then there&#39;s an investigation and the perpetrators are caught. But that&#39;s not happening. If there were fraud we would have 100% uncovered it in this last election. But we didn&#39;t.

I might care about this if the vaccine worked. All it does now is basically help you get less sick, like a complicated form of Tylenol. Doesn't stop the spread, doesn't stop you getting sick.

Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane.

If they test positive then they have to quarantine for up to <del>90 days</del> 5 weeks (unless they can test negative twice, but sometimes tests keep coming back positive after prior infections). For players whose teams don’t really have a chance at a medal (USA, Canada, Russia, and maybe Finland and Sweden), that’s a huge risk (plus the risk of injury) for very little gain. The NHL is trying to further dissuade participation by not paying players quarantined in China. It would be spectacular if a US/Canada-based group organized a competing hockey tournament here to avoid those restrictions and got the monopoly on NHL talent, which would drive people towards that and legitimize it while giving China and the IOC the farce of an Olympics they deserve.</p>	0.67

>red many options like city, state, municipal employment which offers good pay benefits and a pension     The problem is you need to make 20-30$+/hour, those pensions, and benefits to have anything close to a decent livelihood. Even then you have to work 40 hours/week for the next 40-60 years of your life, and end up making so much less in retirement.  ***Most of the people in anti-work seems to come from those city, state, and other federal work. A lot of the people in anti-work did do trade school.***     Most jobs nowadays requires bachelors, or 5-10 years of experience in a trade to even make some semblance of a living.     \---     I've calculated different jobs for myself, and all of them end up work 40 hours/week 5-6 days a week for the next 40-50 year, then retire on <3,000/month. **If I get a bachelors, or go back to trade school for a better trade, I can do it slightly faster & maybe go on vacation once a year.**     That's not living, that's slavery.

I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don’t know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn’t tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don’t think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that’s not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don’t know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It’s also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we’ve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn’t be. This is concerning. Perhaps something similar is happening with the heart too, but so far I haven’t seen it.	Vaccine = reliant on just the spike protein.	0.65

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>Except... Now we&#39;ve waited so long to actually get the vaccines in people that it&#39;s mutated (Delta variant). And they provide protection, but definitely not as much? So we start this whole cycle over. Once you get to a critical mass of virus out there, it keeps mutating and you&#39;re left with a nightmare of randomized versions. This is basically why the flu (influenza, a long distant child of the Spanish / Kansas influenza) exists and the <strong>quadrivalent</strong> vaccine that gets administered has a 20% protectiveness in younger populations. Even though you get 4 strains that they are estimating to be popular that year, there&#39;s plenty of others. </p>	0.74

They don’t. The omicron infects at a high rate and mostly mild symptoms, ( not to be confused with mostly peaceful protests) and has less than a handful of deaths.

There has never been a sterilizing vaccine. Not even smallpox was sterilizing for all ppl, and certainly didn't last for a lifetime.

Wait, I think I get it now. I'm sorry it took me awhile but I definitely thought about your comment so much more than you did.

The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable. Yet...I'm still nervous about November.	<p>That division has been stoked by the left and the media (but I repeat myself) for literally decades—Time and again democrats have been held up as paragons of virtue even as many of them have been convicted of criminal abuses of their authority.

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	I get that generational poverty is a thing. I get that black people are more likely to be impacted by that because of the past. What I don’t get is why I, someone who had absolutely nothing to do with it, should be on the hook for it. Equity policies that address that issue seek to do nothing but punish me for things I didn’t do, with the goal of making life better for people that didn’t experience those things.	0.653
Yep, she could beat any GOP candidate, right up until that point in the campaign where she has to start stating her views on any topic other than pop culture, being a mom and redecorating the White House.

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	The problem, as I see it, is if we discriminate to be &quot;fair,&quot; what is the point at we have &quot;achieved true fairness?&quot; How is that measured, and by whom? Are diversity offices going to just give up their jobs, and agree that they have counter-discriminated to the correct point that their jobs and salaries and political influence are no longer needed?  That&#39;s when we tend to see people &quot;find&quot; new problems.	0.567

Sweetheart, don't hurt yourself too much tripping over your propaganda. Democrats would love nothing more than print at home ballots and drop boxes. Voting rights for illegals and maybe let's just throw online voting. You're pathetic because you've been so brainwashed to think that you're so virtuous that you think we are the ones outside the circle. Save me the propaganda, I wasn't born in the us. Your scumbag gov tried the same color revolution on my country twice. I know exactly what's happening, perhaps YOU'RE the snowflake here with your hurt feelings and constantly having to worry about what next big corrupt thing your party will be guilty of next. Just because the corporate media isn't broadcasting the truth, doesn't give you the excuse to be stupid.	Kinda sounds like you're a Biden Boy, worshipping the Socialist Democrats and their Dictatorial Establishment as the Saviors of this country while they legalize pedophilia, implement heinous material about sex and gender and race into school curriculum for little kids, teaching the kids that ""being white"" isn't okay and that they should be shamed for their skin color, allow abortion and gender changes WITHOUT parental consent for SMALL MINORS, and infringe our Constitutional rights while also repeatedly stomping their Oath of Office into the ground on the American Flag.

The vaccine doesn't work. If you believe that it does and you're vaccinated, why do you care if other people are unvaccinated? I hate wearing masks. I was vaccinated with the initial 2 doses, got Covid (which was a mild cold), and have no intention of getting the booster. Why are we still reporting daily cases, why are events being cancelled, and why are people frantically searching for Covid tests? If you feel sick, stay home for a few days and you'll get better. Why is this still being handled like the plague?	You dont seem to understand that most people don't worry about this for their own personal safety. Some do, sure, but most vaccinated people are no longer worried about their own wellbeing in terms of getting covid. It's the fact that hospitals are overwhelmed. I'm not worried about an unvaccinated person getting me sick, I'm worried about enough unvaccinated people getting sick and clogging up the hospital. There's already stories about how individuals are being turned away for non-covid related issues simply because there's no room.	0.749

The problem with conspiracies is counting on everyone to keep their mouths shut.  The effort required to commit fraud on a large enough scale to turn an election can’t be kept secret.  Too many people willing to profit from their secret.  Yet 60+ lawsuits thrown out from lack of evidence.  It appears the only conspiracy to commit election fraud that could have flipped the election was discovered on Jan 6 and committed by the folks that were complaining the most.  Go figure.	It is not a wild conspiracy theory that people will attempt to cheat in the most consequential election on the planet.

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.

Your first four paragraphs apply equally to folk on the right.   Politics is largely a construct of the leadership class designed to keep everyone else entrapped in an “us vs them” war while the leaders control things.

People at the top don’t care about left vs right, they just want the people below them to care.	<p>That&#39;s the difference between left and right.

An example of riling someone up:  "You're a man and always will be a man." It's only said to make someone angry.  "They're all just delusional" - obvious even if it is asked.  An example of opinion:  "What is your opinion on trans people?"  "I personally believe they will always be their birth sex." Followed up with something along the lines of:   "I will not call them by the gender they say they are, but I will respect them as a person and only attack their opinions." - unless there's a genuine reason to attack them as a person (Ex: Demi and Alok)   "I will call them by gender they say they are out of respect, but that doesn't mean I have to believe it."	<p>Once someone launches a personal attack against you...racist...trans-phobe, etc. you can stop talking because there is no more debate. Personal attacks indicate they cannot explain the merits of their beliefs let alone debate them.  Most likely because their belief is based on feelings and not facts.</p>	0.577

Listen, I honestly couldn't be less impressed by the voter fraud.  After near 50 lawsuits, the Trump show couldn't get one case thru a prima facie case.  That doesn't happen because of a conspiracy.

Funny thing is they voted in that community not to do any interviews...

Permanently banning them for several reasons like trolls, right wingers,left wingers, brigadiers, and transphobes... And when the mods found out they started leaving and making their own subreddits because they don't care what the community thinks they decided to private the subreddit to protect themselves...  In fact one of them spoke to the one who did the interview directly and she basically said she doesn't care what the community thinks... Because she is doing politics... At least that what i understood she meant https://redd.it/sdbaff	<p>The mods never do it to limit speech, they do it because there are like 3 active mods at one singular time while <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> with 10000+ raid this place with low hanging bait while using terminology that could get this sub banned.

Australia with vax and strict control:  \~21 million pop, 2,600 dead   Florida with Deathsantis: 26 million pop, 63,000 dead  They ain't gonna die, but a \*lot\* more of them will.  The hospitals in Michigan are a disaster zone, overflowing with the un-vaxed.  Friday we drive to an AirBnB in Vermont for the next month because my wife has medical issues and we need to be near functioning health care services.  Vermont?  The hospitals are fine there, where the vax rate is 24% higher than Michigan.	<p>If you&#39;re in Michigan, then you&#39;re aware we got our asses kicked for a minute. Crazy infection spikes. Beaumont hospital system, the largest in the state, was FULL. Many others were on diversion, meaning ambulances were being turned away and patients getting moved to other hospitals. We had some of the highest death rates, too. We were close to some serious peril. And that was WITH shutdowns.</p>	0.592

We just don’t see it, or hear it, because we don’t talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say “the leftists” or “the democrats”, not the looters.   Just like democrats say “the republicans that stormed the capitol”. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say “hey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b”. It’s disgusting that we as a people have so little say, or are ignored in what our views our. Currently, we HAVE to match what our leaders say.	<p>Even policies you&#39;d think should be bipartisan aren&#39;t. Democrats don&#39;t seem too fond of school choice. They regularly simp for Big Tech and massively powerful corporations. If you support freedom of speech and the 2A, and oppose illegal immigration,  you won&#39;t have a home in the Democrat party. It&#39;s crazy how much has changed in so little time. In 2008, the elected president and VP were openly opposed to gay marriage. Before they even left office, holding that position made you a far right extremist. Democrats have dragged the Overton window so far to the left that overlap has become incredibly scarce. Would you really want the most conservative Democrat over the most liberal Republican, knowing that you&#39;ll still get at worst 50% of what you want from the Republican and at best about 10% of what you want from the Democrat? Even the RINOS are still holding the line on a lot, bad as they may be in too many situations. If they were replaced by Democrats, then the fake &quot;voting rights&quot; nonsense would have been rammed through the Senate months ago. I&#39;m not saying you should blindly vote for one party, but as it stands right now, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a truly electable Democrat and not just someone you would prefer because the Republican happens to be a piece of shit.</p>	0.553

The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	Vaccine = reliant on just the spike protein.	0.739

I'm confused, is it a good thing then that without gun control the USA has the highest rate of gun related homicide per capita of all developed countries and the second highest total of gun deaths overall?  Is this what the second amendment was all about? Or is this a side effect of not having a so called 'police state' because I would argue less gun related deaths is a good thing right?	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok. Oddly 2020 had relatively few mass shootings, so gun control was mostly ignored in the news and debates.</p>	0.691
YouTube has a right to take down any content.  If a law was passed saying they had to keep content up that would actually violate the first amendment.

They aren&#39;t a free service to everyone that uses them and removing content from a paid subscriber is something we can keep letting slide.</p>	0.697
Off topic of that sub, but most subs on reddit are run by morons. I've been banned from like 4 or 5 for the most trivial reasons.  buildapcsales because morons misunderstood my title and said I was trolling by telling them how to get a gpu from b&h.  fantasybaseball because I dared say ozuna was innocent until proven guilty.  sportsbook because people didn't like my questions, which were totally on topic of the sub.  news because I said the pfizer ceo said the original vaccine was only beneficial in a limtied way and that twitter removed the vid when someone tweeted it.  I think 1 or 2 others also. And usually they don't even bother telling me how I broke any rule.	<p>Were you that outraged when Reddit shut down conservative leaning subs? What about the fact they&#39;ve banned any gay and lesbian sub that believes sexual orientation and gender identity are different?

So are you so am I right in that the message is  "if you want free healthcare, you'll get communism instead and you won't get what you want" or something similar?

Unless the intent is to day "you'll turn on it too," but the asking of the question it makes them sound like they're still hoping for it.   The face, doesn't match the stereotype and the comment, which makes me feel like this is poorly executed, unless I'm completely missing something here.	<p>Seems like it works though for both sides to scream their one word to instill fear, “communism” or “racism.” I guess then I don’t find much fault in saying it’s all communism, even if it isn’t.</p>	0.489

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately.

We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>I imagine what you’re referring to about Republicans being proud of the confederacy has to be about statues that dems are trying to remove.  No, thats part of our history as a nation.  Either we learn from our past or we’re doomed to repeat it.  Removing statues does nothing other than bury Dems awful past. </p>	0.717

That’s pretty tame for US voting districts. Sure, 10 and 11 are a bit strange, but that can be explained away as a population density thing combined with an already difficult border with Jersey. The rest of this map actually looks really sensible to me, much better than a lot of Republican-proposed maps in Texas and Louisiana over the years.   Calling this gerrymandering is like calling a small jog sprinting. I don’t care what your political beliefs are, calling this gerrymandering whilst ignoring the absolutely abysmal state of the Texan voting district maps over the past few decades is just plain wilful ignorance.	<p>As for gerrymandering, that&#39;s been going on since state legislatures have been drawing district lines.

That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	>providing birth control to women at no cost substantially reduces unplanned pregnancies and cuts abortion rates by a range of 62 to 78 percent compared to the national rate.	0.729

Much better than forcing them to work by tying healthcare to work, right? Generally speaking, government policies are made with citizen efficiency in mind, and that's very true for our current situation. Except it's worse than my suggestion. Forcing productivity out of citizens using fear is no way to govern. Currently a person's savings can completely deplete due to a freak health accident. That's inhumane, not right, and needs to be protected against.	<li><p>Health insurance tied to employmen....Now this one is a real mixed bag for me. On the plus side for universal Healthcare I think it would be hugely helpful so that people could make career changes or take risks with opportunities. I have one in particular that could potentially make me a millionaire if it worked out but in doing so my wife and child would be without health insurance. That&#39;s not a risk I&#39;m willing to take.

This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.   And idk what you mean by massively devaluing college degrees... Just by forgiving loans doesn't mean the education is worth any less.	What happens next? Colleges have an endless supply of students with endless amounts of federally guaranteed loan money. Banks take on no risk, so they lend to anyone willing to apply for them. Colleges create more and more coursework and degrees that don’t lead to jobs, and worse yet, they indoctrinate entire generations to believe they need a degree to get ahead in life. Tuition skyrockets, student loan debt soars, all because we decided to take away the free market forces that kept college affordable (pre-1965) in the first place.	0.749

Uh no — liberal peruser here and me and all of my liberal friendie friends want shit to be back to normal. I am annoyed as f*ck that I am still dealing with this BS after almost 2 years.   And it’s not the government faking shit. People are still being hospitalized and dying — but, strangely, it’s the weirdos who refuse vaccines! They’re the ones dying!   If you guys were actually conservative... drawing on the root meaning of the word... you would be risk averse and recognize that your chance of vaccine issues is minuscule in comparison to the aggregate affect of non-vaccinated people filling the hospitals, necessitating further mandate, etc.     [If I’m removed from this sub, it’s clear evidence that conservatives actually love censorship, when it’s convenient. Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don’t want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it’s effectiveness, but that’s a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.709

You are mixing two different stories.

Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.  Zero impact on races. Look at the fraudulent elector scam with forged documents, getting zero news coverage by right-leaning news sources.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots.

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since.

B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	<p>If you aren&#39;t infected or if you have natural immunity, you are in the right, morally if not legally. You are no harm to any one. At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated. This law will not be able to stand on such grounds.</p>	0.768

Voting definitely sucks in some states.  Waiting in line for hours does suppress votes.  But that’s up to the states to fix it, not the federal government.  It’s simply not in their enumerated powers to regulate voting.  And since the 2020 election was the most fair election ever, what’s the issue?	However it raises the question: Why are are some voters waiting hours in line to vote when others are able to cast their vote within minutes of arriving?	0.637
the Democratic Party of the 1850s and 1860s was on the wrong side of the slavery issue, and in 1860s, it wrenched the party apart — into northern Democrats and southern “Dixiecrats”.

Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare. Life expectancy in Denmark is 80.8 years and achieves an infant mortality rate of 3.2 per 1k births. Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.

There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why? Because at that point, there might only be a few white supremacists, but 1 is too many.  If you see a group of 10 people, and 1 of them is dressed like a nazi and no one is kicking that person out, or telling them to at the very least fuck off, there is a group of 10 nazis.   This last paragraph gives a glimpse into how the rest of the world sees canada right now. A convoy of misled truckers and racists standing outside our capitol demanding federal government change provincial restrictions.   Oh wait, their second group of hooligans are at the Couts, AB border crossing essentially demanding all the MPs to leave the cabinet or else they'll continue to disrupt 44 million in trade per day. Sounds a little bit like domestic terrorism, but I'd have to read up on some Canadian domestic terrorism laws to be safe.   And FYI the city police have estimated the rally to be between 7,000 and 15,000 protesters at its peak. While that is the first ten of thousands, it is not tens of thousands.   Reddit will rake you hard over the coals if you come to a debate without clear data and posting conjecture (black supremacists) and opinion (fox News, extremely right wing, they wouldn't give 2 positive minutes to BLM)  If I were you, I'd stop. You look foolish.	But after seeing what&#39;s happening in Canada here, cops bullying small businesses, attacking protestors, and  arresting people for the most idiotic reasons. it&#39;s disgusting.

No dictatorship seen here.	<p>Where I live, it is forced,or you can’t live in society.  That is not ok in my opinion to take away choice.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielcassady/2020/09/05/election-2020-battleground-states-heres-how-theyll-count-mail-in-ballots/  Read this. I'm telling the truth. States that couldn't count their mail in until late: Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, United Nevada, Ohio, Wisconsin.	<p>Mail ballots should be counted *immediately* on election day, not counted after the other ballots. This prevents the manufacturing of a known number of ballots to just tip the scales. The total count of mail ballots received should be known, too. The total number of mail-in ballots handled by USPS must be declared daily and this would set the limit of votes that can be counted. Any discrepancy should trigger a statutory review process. USPS must have a franking machine that cannot be reconfigured, which stamps the date on mail ballot envelopes. This prevents backdating.</p>	0.587

Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.	<p>While 5 million or 50 million dying to COVID in the US is an obscene exaggeration on your part, those are reasonable numbers if you&#39;re talking about lives ruined by the irrational lockdowns.</p>	0.682

I would like nothing more than to see an open debate between all the healthcare professionals (including) those that had their social media accounts shut down due to "misinformation".  I propose a national debate covered by every major TV network, including Tony Fuaci, Sanjay Gupta, Bill Gates, CDC director Rochelle wolinsky, Robert Malone, Richard Fleming, Peter McCullough, Simone gold, Michael Yeadon etc etc...   Pit every medical professional against one another in an open debate about Covid-19 and Vaccines, let the American people decide who to believe. I want to hear everyone's ideas about the pandemic, I don't want to be forcefed one single narrative over and over and over every day of the week, I want everyone to have a say in the matter. That's how we solve this problem!	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don’t want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it’s effectiveness, but that’s a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.634
Pro life or forced birth? Do you care about the children after birth? No. You don't care that they are unwanted or live in poverty. You just care that a collection of cells is carried to term and develops into an infant despite there being no biblical basis behind it. Social issues are meant to divide the lower classes and it has worked perfectly.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.  To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.  Now maybe a society comes about that there&#39;s no point in maintaining an &quot;unwanted life&quot; but that gets really screwy and it goes against human nature in that in nature you needed more people generally due to strong death rates in the natural world.</p>	0.578

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?  Since 2018 there has been 92 school shootings in the USA, that number would likely be higher too if a lot of learning wasn’t done remote due to covid.  We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok.

Holy crap boys. I get it if you don’t want to get vaccinated I support your freedom to choose, but picking and choosing the data like the author did in this article is junk science.

Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000. That’s somewhere between 3 times and 15 times the risk of death to be unvaccinated.   This data doesn’t show what the author is trying to distort it to show.

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.  It will act the way it does, and the results will follow.	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane.

Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few. He also expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. These are all things that all Republicans and even many Democrats vehemently attack.      Eisenhower was not an outlier among Republicans. Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards. These are all things we now deem "liberal," or "socialist," but they were widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike only a couple of decades ago.	Republicans act like they're the party of law and order and the for the people yet give the people nothing basically in their deals for stimulus checks or extra unemployment benefits. They do nothing in terms of fixing the low income problems of America and prefer if everything would just stay in the 1980s when they first started there terms.	0.574

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	A vaccine is often just stimulating your immune system to kick in and start working, building the memory cells to detect future infection early, though it is often not quite as good as your natural system depending on the strategy (hence why live virus vaccines tend to do better than dead virus vaccines). You cannot make this kind of decision to do vaccine boosters yearly without knowing if it is even necessary. For many people, we may find solid antibody levels good enough for at least decades. Maybe they should get a booster once per 10 years? Maybe not at all. We don't know yet.	0.748

Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated.

Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth.

The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.

I was just pointing out that Democrats were once the more Conservative party, while at their inception Republicans were the more progressive party. I don’t think 100 years ago the south was a bastion of progressive thinking. Democrats just matched up better with a more conservative way of thinking at the time. I think politicians on both sides are mostly self serving garbage today, but this post doesn’t paint the full picture of the political landscape during those times.	But the say that the parties swapped because of racism is ridiculous. They swapped because of a handful of issues such as small government and pro-life, but racism is not one of them. The South turned from Democrat to Republican in the 90s as the older racist Democrat politicians that fought against civil rights finally died out and were replaced.	0.613

Feel free to ask me for sources on any of this (since you purport to be following science), but what I want to know is what's the logic behind this.

 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	<p>I’m curious where abortions reduce crime rates as you state. Would love to see that research or article.</p>	0.597

I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	<p>“The explanation is new, too: instead of the traditional link between poverty and crime, this crime wave has more to do with policy. Virtually all the cities with the most notable crime outbreaks — San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles — are places with progressive prosecutors working to limit punishments for looters, organised thieves and the unruly, occasionally violent, homeless. The cities, with the exception of Los Angeles, are also among the whitest in the U.S., with a large population of educated people.”</p>	0.597

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.  Nuance breaks this sloppy meme into the shit that it is	<p>All I&#39;m saying is that it makes sense on paper. As far as being told the vaccine would work forever I never really trusted that too much anyway. I was really happy when I saw America produce one of the first ones because for a long time we were saying they were working on supporting their production and we&#39;d be proud of what we&#39;d done. But it was a new disease, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get it perfect the first time around. That just seemed impossible. I&#39;m cautious but at the same time I feel like I understand. To me it seems less like a conspiracy and more of the typical over promise and under deliver. Is that just me?</p>	0.693
The problem is, the high skill & high wage jobs are like this.     ***"Specialization in a trade that is in high demand will yield superior wages."***     ***That's the biggest lie you probably tell yourself.*** A masters plumber should make 25-35$+/hour, but they can barely make more than an apprentice at ***<20$. Maybe above 12$/hour if they are lucky.***     A mechanic won't make more than a beginner mechanic unless they can snipe the good paying job from the couple lead mechanic positions in an autobody shop.      Even college kids, and trade skillers who spent 5-10 years training, and learning aren't guaranteed a decent paying job with a decent workplace.     A computer technician, programmer, etc needs a bachelors, and 2-5 years of experience just to get started in the field. **OR** they could go the apprenticeship route, and make less than minimum wage for 2-5 years just to get the experience needed, and even then they aren't guaranteed the job they need to put food on the table for one.     With Inflation, jobs paying <20 for unskilled labor even when said labor can lead to 5day 9hour work weeks where you break your back to just live.     You need a minimum of 20-25$/hour just to live beyond eating well everyday, and paying utilities.     \---     You can't make it well for yourself in todays economy. It's not an Obama, Trump, or Biden thing. It's a 60,70s, and 80s problem that caused this. It is not a republican, or democrat problem. It's an American problem.     ***Minimum Wage needs to be 25-30 dollars just to live, and anything less than 45$/hour you need to work 30-40 hours/week, 60+ years of your life, then you can retire.***     Yes, this is America & you could make something of it. Most of the time? You won't be able to cause you're making 20-25$/hour just to make ends meet by yourself.	<p>It’s not like those companies are taking middle-class people that would otherwise be living a comfortable life with a decent income and giving them shit pay in a sweatshop - these jobs attract people with little access to qualify education and would otherwise be forced to make even worse pay in a different sector. </p>	0.526

Funny that's what the dog walker Doreen said. And he works 25 hours a week and isn't sure that's not to much.   Your concerns are legitimate in a few scenarios, however they took those talkings points and used them as a spearhead to accomplish the goal of not working at all or barely at all while screaming for more free shit.

Sooooo you just want the same thing we have now. Which sucks. Healthcare costs are huge because administrative fat cats take a huge chunk of the change. And they do that while doing very little themselves. Literally welfare kings. And you're fighting for them, which makes me very sad. I know a few international doctors, and I ask them the reality of US healthcare, and they back up this claim - a lot of our healthcare costs go to millionaire administrative folks that would rather pull the plug on someone without insurance than help them out.	<p>To me when I think of wealthy in the healthcare industry, I think of private coverage being the golden ticket because I am hands on in the system and I know how the corruption truly works. This is where my argument comes from with people at the poor/poverty levels not having the same privilege to quality healthcare, which in turn could lead to a shorter life span as opposed to those who have access to better care from their private healthcare options. The US healthcare system thrives off of capital. There are pros and cons to it, but the way I see this is as a major downside. There has to be a better way to offer equality in healthcare to all, regardless of Medicare Medicaid or Private insurance status.  I am not necessarily in agreement with a single payer Medicare for All option in America. I think our system is too far established and reliant on capital to be fully funded by the federal government and tax payer money. The amount of money people would need to be taxed to cover the expenses of the multi-billion dollar healthcare industry that this country has built and established… would leave the middle class broke.</p>	0.655

>Now who doesn't know how they generate revenue?  You, dipshit. Because you've consistently missed EVERY single factor here while babbling about subscriptions; which would be one thing if you were correct, but you weren't even correct about THAT. He retains 11 million listeners per episode. Spotify now has a metric they can measure value to as opposed to just "People like music". ONE GUY keeps 11 million people paying 10 bucks a month. He paid for himself in under a month.  Then you have the free accounts, who have to listen to ads, but still listen to Rogan. Do I need to explain advertising dollars to you? Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game. Joe Rogan, from all conceivable angles, is literally spotifys most valuable asset.  Meanwhile, you're talking about fucking subscriptions amd doubling down on trying to say a **market share valuation doesnt mean anything** like you know a THING of what you're talking about.  Fucking goon.	Read again. I never stated this leap of judgement as you're suggesting it to be. Hell I'll paste that part again ""The bigger issue I see every lefty trying to criticize is muh mask, when in reality, people are happy for this (the abolition of all mandates) because it means they don't have to close down their business for over 3 months while letting ""ESSENTIAL"" podcasters keep their jobs at their studio while they starve.

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	<p>So all said, we&#39;re here with a vaccine that gets less effective the more we wait. We have tons of surplus (for the us. A virus that targets most of the population due to existing risk factors. And to really know if you had covid or not uses an immense amount of resources.

This actually makes sense because I have always thought that Jan 21st 2023 Biden is removed from office or steps down on his own.  That way whoever is VP would be able to run 2 more times for a total of 10 years, but then they picked Harris as the VP who is super unlikeable.  But if they put Harris in the Supreme Court then they can get anyone else as VP and then President in 2023.  It is all working out.	Still would not surprise me if Harris becomes President due to the cognitive inability of Joe Biden by mid terms so she can fulfill a full 10 years. The media is beginning their campaign now, after propping up Biden for all of 2020, to set out that agenda. Slander Biden's cognitive state, grounds to remove him from office for being unfit.

Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	I also think the time and money spent on stopping abortions could be used to help potential mothers. Being against tax payer dollars for potential mother's is why the left bashes the right over not caring about the baby after it's born. If you ban abortion there definitely should be outreach for mothers. Especially young ones.	0.662

If you’re of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you’re not pro life at all, you’re pro control and don’t care about welfare of the child at all.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.  To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.

If they truly cared about the will of the people, which is what they primarily argued, then they would have waited two months to see how the presidency turned out.

Sorry for being impolite to traitors. No evidence of fraud, but I’m supposed to just trust this fishy gut feeling that trump supporters are getting.

I have nothing against going to the courts. I do have a problem with Jan 6 and the fact that they’re still pushing this lie	Listen, I honestly couldn't be less impressed by the voter fraud.

The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.'

It does mean, though, that this was not a nefarious attempt to overthrow the election but rather a disgruntled band of hooligans disrespecting the capitol.

I can't do anything about an entire group of people who think I'm a bigot for thinking kids and teens shouldn't medically transition, kids should socially transition if gender dysphoria persists past 16 and it started at a young age, and that being LGBT is becoming a trend.

I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	<p>Which is why you should donate to or volunteer at your local food bank.

B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!

Hello, not a conservative but have a question?  Is the issue with this political in nature (you don’t think companies should be allowed to do this)? Or personal (you don’t like that this company is doing this)?  Because this seems to be how a private system is supposed to work. The government rules it can’t enforce a certain policy, and then the private sector chooses to implement the policy if they deem it to be the best thing for their business.	Businesses can and have enforced dress codes, no smoking policy, kicked people out for swearing, or smelling like shit, or being too drunk. The list goes on and on. If you don’t like their rules go somewhere else. You talk about the trend that allowing private businesses to operate freely, which is a CORE conservative belief, could be costly.

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.  Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.	<p>In regard to HIPPA, that&#39;s only regarding service medical service providers like insurance companies,  pharmacies, doctors offices, ect. Asking you to disclose your medical information isnt a violation of HIPPA.</p>	0.57

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	<p>If you aren&#39;t infected or if you have natural immunity, you are in the right, morally if not legally. You are no harm to any one. At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated.

Those other humans involved have the option to take the vaccine, which has been proven to reduce hospitalizations.

Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more.

Yes, why would somebody blame Trump for helping to try to overturn an election when he told people that the election was rigged and falsely claiming that Mike Pence could overturn the election on 1/6 if he just ignored the will of the voters. /s He was literally the one who brought them there by pedaling bullshit. According to testimony he actually intended to go to the capital and didn't because the Secret Service told him they wouldn't be able to protect him. He only managed his "we love you. stand down" bullshit after a great deal of pressuring by others including his daughter and he still wasn't the one to request reinforcements. Arrest the traitor and move on. He is an entitled piece of shit with zero emotional intelligence.	<p>So, in essence, Trump sat on his hands while Mike Pence had to assume responsibility and ensure that timely aid was provided to the Capitol - <em>while being endangered himself</em> (a commendable performance, but should absolutely not be necessary). Again, I believe this to be grossly negligent of the duty of office of the presidency and, if true, worthy of impeachment. The second a single pane of glass broke Trump should have been on the phone with every support mechanism possible to as quickly as efficiently remove or eliminate every threat to the Capitol. This is the People&#39;s House we&#39;re talking about, and duly elected representatives of the American people.</p>	0.61

Dunno, I was in Minneapolis last week and the city's infrastructure seemed pretty intact. None of the buildings on Nicolette were demolished, smoking ruins.

I live in Portland, Maine and there's no damage to the city here. No burnt out buildings, etc.  If you mean Portland, Oregon. My MIL lives there and I just talked to her last night.

This is a bad bill and sad to see such support in the comments.  Paternity can't be proven at conception. So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.  This is going to be abused to hell and back, with seemingly no course for action for when the wrong man is held accountable.   A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.

Lol, don’t worry, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden he just got 81 million “votes” from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you’ll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they’ll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don’t see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the “worst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics” even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you’re a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you’re constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	<p>McCain was a disgrace, Romney was a Rino, W.

If I were you I’d go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	<p>Also of course there are 1000 articles about how voter ID is racist, one party and ideology depends on voter fraud and must produce that propaganda to survive. The fact is we are the only country that votes that doesnt have voter ID. Literally the only country in the world without voter ID. Seems the rest of the world can do it, why is it racist here and not anywhere else?

A small percentage with no power can still be a threat.  Big picture, they don't have the power to make a real difference.

Personally, I wouldn't care if they weren't blocking a border or terrorizing people who didn't make the decision.	<p>Beyond the facts though, the fact that conservatives are trying so hard to undermine the fears felt by politicians in the area that day is very concerning. We had an armed insurrection take place in our Capitol, in which multiple people died and there is evidence that more were in imminent danger. Our politicians, especially vocal ones on the left, have a very good reason to be afraid of the far right, which has moved from vocal opposition to violent opposition.

I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	Just like salem.	0.514

There are a lot of Rinos like you. On Jan 6, my very Republican uncle was watching the news, turned to me and said “there goes trumps chances of ever winning again”. The funny thing is , if the RNC just pivots slightly to the center, and has more sane, responsible moderate-conservative candidate , I believe they will wipe the floor with Biden. But if it’s trump , trump jr or anyone who appears extreme, people are going to play it safe and stick with Biden	Rallying the republicans is not going to win the Presidential race.

While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	If it wasn't for those things, I'd be actually torn between which US party aligns the best with my European views. But the fact that these things are political, and that the Republicans are the ones who have issues with everything I just mentioned, makes me a communist I guess.	0.638

Let’s not forget many poor single mothers that seek abortions can’t see a way to afford the pregnancy itself. Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	>providing birth control to women at no cost substantially reduces unplanned pregnancies and cuts abortion rates by a range of 62 to 78 percent compared to the national rate.	0.669

> Four people were burned to death.  irrelevant unless this man intended that they should die by burning to death. such detail is intended to excite a thrust for retaliatory blood and anyone that acts on that information in that way would be more guilty of violence than the man in the truck.   in the heat of the moment, many people would try to run from the scene without even being aware of their actions including people you love and respect. if you don't understand that, i suggest you study psychology research circa urgent autonomic responses (fight, flight, or freeze). i would be more concerned if he showed no emotion, that would be a kind of indicator that he meant to do what he did and is likely to do so again. running is a sign that he knew he made a grave mistake and he feared the consequences. he's no saint but it doesn't seem to me that anyone is better off if he spends the rest of his life in prison.

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	She views Ted Cruz as a ringleader of a movement that actively wants to kill her.

You're right in pointing this out. It is, however, the least bad choice in a situation of many bad choices. We accept that their ballots will be inherently less secure because we think the people who have volunteered to fight in our military should not be disenfranchised. It is a tolerable compromise to ensure that Americans who are often quite literally on the other side of the planet have a say in their government. However, if you're an able bodied person in Altoona, Pennsylvania, you can go to a fucking polling place.	<p>I can buy that train of thought, it&#39;s fairly logical. I don&#39;t want to get too deep into how secure current elections are as I don&#39;t want to de-rail the conversation but could you also see that while the two are tightly related that one shouldn&#39;t necessarily negate the other? I would argue that if a jurisdiction believes legal non citizens should have a vote in local matters that making those votes secure is a separate (no less important) matter. If security is the issue, and the current voter base isn&#39;t secure, these votes would be no different to votes from current citizens after all.</p>	0.551

The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.   Screw that.  So yes, the masks are harmful.	Masks now are sort of like the controlled burns to help bring wildfires under control. It’s not fun, but it’s a near term inconvenience to avoid long term foreseeable consequences.	0.761
If you'd actually read any of the studies or releases about the side effects, you'd know that the incidence was not statistically significantly higher than an unvaccinated population.  It's ok though. You've already made your ideological bias abundantly clear, so no amount of actual data can change your mind.  And before you pitifully invoke Fauci, I say he should step down. Tbh his communication needed some polish but, more importantly,  conservative media clockwork oranged people like you and now  his visage is carved into your reptile brain as THREAT forever. Thus a new face is requisite to placate all of you.  One can only hope to pull the conservative collective consciousness's ass out of the sand and, subsequently, its head out if its ass.

In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption. This is the result of the confluence of these two facts.  There is no lack of a free market here, and there is no lack of private ownership. This corporation is working *within* the system here. This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	Lots of your counter examples to my points say that what I attribute to the free market is actually the government screwing it up. And I agree that is part of the problem.  But the government is also an artifact of the free market. Can I claim that the powerful companies use their market positions to get government to change the rules in there favor? Isn't that just an expression of market power?	0.619

Wait, are you joking? So the last year+ of “Stop the Steal” and a literal violent attack on the capital because the election was stolen is who…democrats?!   And Bush and Trump both lost the popular votes but ultimately won the election due to the flawed electoral college system. So that’s a valid reason to “complain” that maybe something needs to change in a 250 year old system that’s clearly not working anymore.	On the right an example is the January 6th storming of the Capitol incident. Leaders shouldn’t ‘fan the flames’ that there was a steal of the vote.

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.

I don't like the law. Absolutely should not have passed in the "bipartisan infrastructure bill." I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all. The technology has to be developed and deemed viable before it takes effect anyway, and if not by a certain date, an explanation as to why it's unfeasible has to be given.     Louis Rossmann did a good job explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg)     Just because we understand the lunacy of the left doesn't mean we should be careless in our criticism of them.

Alright buddy.	<p>But if you even suggest they stop using abortion as birth control, and maybe practice safe sex, that’s a gigantic issue and infringes on their rights as a woman.

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years. It's a shame, because I don't see it turning around this time.	<p>The most frustrating part of BLM and &#39;defund the police&#39; is it has put departments on the defensive, causing them to close ranks and often pull back from the most agitated communities. This is a big part of why violent crime is exploding. No officer wants to be the next guy that politicians and the MSM are calling to be charged with murder cause they see someone acting suspiciously, the suspect pulls a knife, and the cop shot them. Additionally, it has completely drowned out any conversation about reform efforts that are actually needed, such as increased training/education, or meaningfully eliminating behavior like cops looking the other way for cops+friends of cops who are caught in low level offenses.</p>	0.716

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn’t between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups. Republicans on the establishment side hated Trump and the populist movement he represented just as much as any establishment liberal.   Because of that, the party affiliation of any judges who looked at cases (when they didn’t dismiss them on standing, as happened in the vast majority of cases) didn’t matter.	<p>Most of the candidates running against him in the primaries and the democrat that ran against him were all of the same faith so that’s not a huge deciding factor</p>	0.529

none of that is true, its always been about republicans introducing bills that make it harder for minorities to vote. They for some reason always choose ids that less minorities have.

1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	<p>Yes, I do believe that life begins at conception and therefore abortion is murder, but forcing a woman to carry a baby to term against her will seems to be at least as reprehensible as rape, possibly more so because it goes on for nine whole months. </p>	0.712
Exactly my point. Going to the courts is the proper avenue to challenge the election results. Which they did. And the courts sent them home because there was no evidence	When a case goes to court, the court has to allow investigators to go into locations to search for evidence. That's why there are warrants issued in cases. You can't present evidence if you don't have access to the scene of the crime. So while you may be right that there is no evidence presented, there wasn't a chance for someone to actually find said evidence. All data as well as testimony however *does* point to there being evidence available to find and that either or both voter and/or election fraud (which are two different things) occurred. And with the Secretaries of State and local election boards not being open and forthcoming with their policies as well, it looks like they have plenty to hide.	0.659

Ron DeSantis is pushing laws that don&#39;t allow private companies to require vaccines while getting widespread conservative support. It&#39;s simply not up for debate that conservatives today care more about being outraged at the liberals than actually having principles. This isn&#39;t the same movement my parents were a part of.

Let’s be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what “side” they’re on. So don’t try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I’m not.   But you’re trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn’t be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn’t clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to “protest” a “stolen” election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	<p>Natural immunity is extremely variable. People get challenged with different amounts of virus, different strains and got sick to different levels.

He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	<p>Even policies you&#39;d think should be bipartisan aren&#39;t. Democrats don&#39;t seem too fond of school choice. They regularly simp for Big Tech and massively powerful corporations. If you support freedom of speech and the 2A, and oppose illegal immigration,  you won&#39;t have a home in the Democrat party. It&#39;s crazy how much has changed in so little time. In 2008, the elected president and VP were openly opposed to gay marriage. Before they even left office, holding that position made you a far right extremist. Democrats have dragged the Overton window so far to the left that overlap has become incredibly scarce. Would you really want the most conservative Democrat over the most liberal Republican, knowing that you&#39;ll still get at worst 50% of what you want from the Republican and at best about 10% of what you want from the Democrat? Even the RINOS are still holding the line on a lot, bad as they may be in too many situations. If they were replaced by Democrats, then the fake &quot;voting rights&quot; nonsense would have been rammed through the Senate months ago. I&#39;m not saying you should blindly vote for one party, but as it stands right now, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a truly electable Democrat and not just someone you would prefer because the Republican happens to be a piece of shit.</p>	0.525

According to [this website](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/) only 64% of the population has received both vaccines.  And even if it were 75%, 5% of the us is like 16Million people. That’s over twice as much as the entire population of Denmark.   So with all that being said, I do think that the 5% would make a difference, even if everyone in the US was making a wholehearted attempt to follow guidelines, which we know isn’t true even with the fully vaccinated and boosted people.	<p>At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days (Fig. 1). In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people. Notably, Israel with over 60% of their population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID-19 cases per 1 million people in the last 7 days. The lack of a meaningful association between percentage population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases is further exemplified, for instance, by comparison of Iceland and Portugal. Both countries have over 75% of their population fully vaccinated and have more COVID-19 cases per 1 million people than countries such as Vietnam and South Africa that have around 10% of their population fully vaccinated.</p>	0.709

Say some one breaks into my home with the intent to harm my family , if i manage to not miss my first few shots due to adrenaline dump and i hit my target, unless its a headshot then one or two hits wont always stop a person… this is why you hear from the left that “so and so cop shot a guy 7 to 8 times” well thats because they keep shooting till the threat is neutralized.  People who don’t own guns i think do not understand that one bullet is not enough to stop a threat. And im willing to bet part of that is thanks to movies.	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok.

It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.

Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	<p>The real sad thing is what&#39;s going to happen to poor DeSantis.   He&#39;s going to keep rising in the polls.  Once the primaries start one of two things will happen.

If you ask trans activists what a woman is and take whatever they say at face value you’ll walk away thinking women don’t even exist.   They’ll say shit like “trans women are real women” but can’t even tell you what a real woman is, because the answer to that question fucks their entire worldview up.	Transgenderism is that anybody who identifies as such, can be counted as a woman.	0.585

The right has always claimed those labels, which I think are absolutely meaningless. I don’t think unwavering patriotism is a virtue, it’s just jingoism. The left seeing legitimate faults with the country and wanting to fix them is considered unpatriotic by the right.  What’s patriotic to me is helping the vulnerable. America first? Okay, let’s get everyone healthcare. Let’s get everyone fed and housed. Let’s get everyone educated.  “We just haven't become radicalized.”  Extremely debatable based on a lot of polling recently. What percentage of the right believes in Q or some conspiracy about pedophilic baby-eating dems? What percent believe the election was stolen?	<p>We&#39;re all Americans, and dehumanizing half of the people who live here is an anti-American stance.

So what, is it a slippery slope sort of thing? Or is it that communists in particular are stupid for thinking their ideology would help them and it will inevitably end in fascism?  Or is it suggesting the modern transgender liberal with their crazy hair is a stupid communist?  It kind of just seems like it's a little all over the place. Which is funny, because usually political comics are so bash you over the head simplistic that they aren't thought provoking or interesting. Basically boomer humor.	<p>Does the term “slippery slope” still mean what it used to, or does your lot only use that term for non-mask wearers?

Interesting article, thank you for sharing.

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  “Among 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.”  So, there’s at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it’s symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	There are not 500M deaths *FROM* COVID. That's yet another misrepresentation. Rather there are 500M who have (supposedly) die *WITH* COVID. That's a big difference. We have victims of motor vehicle crashes, gunshots, poisoning, etc. all being listed as COVID deaths. They clear are not. The CDC admits that something like 6% of the deaths are actually *FROM* COVID, while the remainder had an AVERAGE of 2.6 other comorbidities.	0.767

It's not full communist, the citizens pay into these systems usually at a graduated rate depending on age.

Government should be there to push citizens in the right direction to get the most efficiency out of them, which involves responsibility over health, because individuals are pretty terrible at maintaining their own health.

Communist whores are a dime a dozen	By communism they don't mean communism, because they don't know what it is. What they actually mean historically is bolshevism, the right-wing precursor to totalitarianism that developed in the Soviet Union.

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket. If Boebert and MTG are the future of the party, then Alex Jones deserves to be the chairman.	> Yet, the Second Circuit’s conclusion that Mr. Trump’s Twitter account was a public forum is in tension with, among other things, our frequent description of public fo- rums as “government-controlled spaces.” Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 7); accord, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469 (2009) (“government property and . . . government pro- grams”); Arkansas Ed. Television Comm’n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666, 677 (1998) (“government properties”). Any con- trol Mr. Trump exercised over the account greatly paled in comparison to Twitter’s authority, dictated in its terms of service, to remove the account “at any time for any or no reason.” Twitter exercised its authority to do exactly that.	0.601

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.  I honestly do advocate for state's rights, but some things NEED to be looked at from a top-down view (from fed government) to determine the minimal amount of work needed for the success of the country as a whole.	I support government aid for Kentucky. Disaster relief should be a part of the government's job, in my opinion, as events like this can be better handled by larger logistical operations who can pull from multiple states, as opposed to a single state's responsibility.	0.553

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They’ll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape.

I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.

"concerns about election security"  We can all go back and listen to the claims made by Trump and his legal team. These weren't just concerns.

BLM/antifa were either paid tools or just there to burn and loot.	<p>Brian Sicknick had a stroke the following day which investigators and medical examiners deemed unrelated to the riot. Ashli Babbitt was shot by capitol police, Kevin Greyson had a heart attack, Rosanne Boyland died of a drug overdose, and I see you left out the two that died of heat stroke as well— which is odd since you are blaming the rest of these deaths on the rioters anyways. </p>	0.584
Your free-dumb doesn’t include disobeying the law.  It’s fine. These asshats can go to jail too.	<p>Being dumb is perfectly legal here in the US but that doesn’t mean your job has to keep you on. They are not the government they can do as they see fit with your public social media profile. Hell this is a foundational principle of conservatism. I love how it’s always “butt out of my life” when you do something but then get right up in my business whenever you feel like it.</p>	0.612

>Depends on what other kinds of private groups the city usually allows to utilize the third flagpole imo.  Nope.  That's the whole point.  If they every allowed any private group, but are dnying a religious group, they're engaging in viewpoint discrimination (see: Gorsuch's argument.)	<p>Likewise the public is free to scorn them and while threats should not be made and those threats should be denounced by the mayor; it exacerbates the situation of removing the pledge to the point that it shows up in national news.</p>	0.467

If you’re just going to out of hand dismiss the cdc because you think the government is a big conspiracy, then you’re delusional and no one should ever seriously engage with you in a conversation.	<p>You’re trusting/ quoting the CDC as a reliable source...THE CDC....who has flip flopped and contradicted themselves countless times throughout the “pandemic”.

Finally  !!! Someone who understands!!!! Masks DONT work !!!!!!!!!!!! They actually increase your odds of catching if you don't have it. Now if you do have it then it may help  you from passing it but ONLY if you are smart enough  to understand how cross contamination works !!! If you don't have it.... DONT WEAR A MASK ! They don't work...	<p>However, there is a lot of evidence that all types of masks help, at least to some degree. It’s all about keeping your breath from extending out of your mouth/nose as much as possible. Hell, you could tape a Taco Bell napkin to your face and it would help!</p>	0.684

Go ahead, downvote this, but I'm a  member of this sub and Anti Work. If people want to go on strike or complain about their shitty work conditions they should be free to do so (America is a free country isn't that the point of America?). The real problem in the country is corporate communism, paying Elon 7k a car, billions to shitty corrupt banks, endless wars, etc etc etc.   &#x200B;  If you think that a bunch of inraged taco bell employees are the problem you are either the owner of that franchise or delusional.	<p>Just one anecdote: there used to be a chrysler factory  outside of St. Louis when I moved to the area 15-ish years ago.  One day the UAW went on strike and shuttered the factory.  The local radio station interviewed one of the picketers who, I kid you not, stated they were on strike for &quot;job security.&quot;  Imagine... walking off the job for job security.  Assinine.  Anyhow, a few months later, the factory closed for good, and all of those jobs the factory supported, both indirectly and directly, were wiped out.  I&#39;m told the factory was relocated to Mexico, but who knows.  These days, I often think about Mr. Striking For Job Security and if he realizes the irony of it all.  I also wonder about all the other people whose livlihoods were lost because of him and those who thought like him.  Such is the price of union avarice.</p>	0.521
Yeah, facebook needs to ban all the bullshit about last year's election and all of the lies about Covid-19.	<p>Once we dismantle Facebook (a disgusting, censoring propaganda machine) I&#39;ll join others attacking China on democracy. Until then, I won&#39;t because it&#39;s just hypocrisy...we have State sponsored censorship (facebook obeys democrats) inside our own country.</p>	0.614

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	<p>If you aren&#39;t infected or if you have natural immunity, you are in the right, morally if not legally. You are no harm to any one. At this point we now know even the vaccinated can become infected and can transmit, but somehow are not subject to the same restrictions as the unvaccinated. This law will not be able to stand on such grounds.</p>	0.799
I thought it was pretty obvious that the South lost the war, and that made them traitors to the USA. Is this not basic knowledge in America? It continues with those who think the South will rise again. Just a bunch of traitors.	I used to think the civil war was about states rights. Then I read the constitutions or several southern states that voted for session. You will see how important slavery was for the south.	0.543
Yeah, at the absolute bare minimum Trump knew.  But we all know it’s more likely they were both involved.  If Clinton was involved he should go to jail….upvotes, if Trump was involved he should go to jail….downvotes. I’m wonder why that’s the case?	We just don't know the level of collusion or not because by all accounts Trump and his administration egregiously obstructed justice, refused to do interviews or cooperate and eventually pardoned convicted criminals.	0.526

I wanted to say that it may be too late, but you may be on the right track. They will do something, maybe even pull another 9/11 and this time succeed at things that failed the first time.	But they won’t. They are too busy spying on Americans. Focused on that five hour riot at the capitol. Figuring out how to make sure the election ""turns out right""...

So like, one building constitutes a whole city?  I just don’t see the apocalyptic hellscape.   At some point, the narrative has to come back to reality.   Trump lost. Pence was right. 1/6 was domestic terrorism.	<p>Domestic Terrorism - &quot;all&quot;? 99.9% I&#39;d say.  Look no further than most any Democrat run city over the last year, including since the installation of China Joe and Heels Up.  CJ and HU STILL haven&#39;t mentioned their constituent rioting.  I remember HU actually suupporting and encouraging the rioting on the Cobert Show.  If you have Internet access, you can watch the video.</p>	0.471
