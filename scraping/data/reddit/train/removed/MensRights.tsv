>These male activists have targeted anything that smacks of feminism, forcing a university to cancel a lecture by a woman they accused of spreading misandry.   And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	<p>Last guy I talked to dismissed my concerns regarding Michael Kimmel and his &quot;activist scholarship&quot; as non-indicative of broader problems with quasi-religious, agenda-driven perversions of academic integrity in the movement, because... <strong>drum roll</strong>... he was accused of sexually harassing a woman, and it obvious to him that  no true feminist would do that.</p>	0.878
I'm just talking in general terms , women are tricky , good liars and actresses , so you never know who's a problem and who's not.	<p>That&#39;s what you might as well say when you spout such nonsense.  Amazing how women are so incapable of things (i.e. stupid as all hell) when it fits the narrative men bad, women good.  Otherwise women are smart, strong, powerful, independent and all that.  But oh man, a woman fucks up, she was the victim, coerced, she was depressed and the litany of other flimsy excuses that don&#39;t even fly for a freaking child.</p>	0.876
This is why, if a woman ever falsely accuses me of rape, I'll just kill her right then and there.  If your life is ruined either way, better to be in jail for a crime you *did* commit (murder) than a crime you *didn't* commit (rape).	I think women that lie and say a guy raped them should suffer the same jail sentence for lying about it.  I think they should be prosecuted for lying and it pisses me off that they aren't.	0.898
"1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."	or let's put it this way, 40,000 women a year are assaulted. 7-800,000 men are assaulted, murdered, robbed every year.	0.898
Or we could just kill all proven rapists, and maybe set a curfew for men at night. An enforced one.	<p>Or we could just kill all proven rapists</p>	0.81

I made them mad and I didn't say what they wanted to hear, so they reported my post to the mods so they would delete it. Simple as that.	<p>Banned. I challenged the ban, and got fed up dealing with whatever pissy twat was on a power trip. So then I reported the mod to Reddit. Pretty sure nothing was done as you know --- it&#39;s them.</p>	0.874
Well, it's stats about nonreciprocally violent relationships, not of all violent relationships. You cherry picked a stat.  I just read that in your article :  "1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."	<p>The CDC NISVS studies showed that in the previous year 1.6% of women were raped, and 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator. It also found that a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%), and so on.</p>	0.865

I told your Mother the Same thing Last Night...When she was smokin my Circumsized 8" ---- suck it Bitch~!	<p>My mother&#39;s immediate response when I first told her about being molested by an aunt was &quot;you must have wanted it&quot;. I had to explain to her that when I was seven I didn&#39;t even know what &quot;it&quot; was.</p>	0.815

Seriously? Do the moderators even look at the subs when they mindlessly ban people from other subs just for existing on them? It’s so easy to tell that none of the popular posts (or ones that stay up for longer than a few seconds) aren’t incel beliefs. It’s literally just acknowledging that men have problems. What a fucking joke.	<p>For anyone wondering this guy is full of sht,he even supports the whole men cant call a kid cute since the op does it once and he immediately jumps to a bias(i don&#39;t think i need to spell this out for anyone).</p>	0.877
I am sorry that is literal the dumbest thing I have ever heard, but that’s your perspective.  Here is my perspective.  My dad, me, my eldest son and my grandson.  All cut. All no issue.  My second son. Uncut until he needed emergency surgery to free up everything down there.  It’s a tiny issue.  Ill continue recommending it to any new father, just because of the risk that it poses and the issues i know it has caused.  I am sorry your penis broke or is shorter.  Sue the doctor.  My dick is fine.  And I see no harm or foul in performing hygienic surgery.	I get that your penis still works, but it is a matter of fact that it doesn&#39;t work as well. Do you need lotion to jerk off like many cut men? That&#39;s a very clear example of how the function of your penis was damaged. It&#39;s like if you were born colorblind so you want to surgically make your son the same way because of tradition, it makes no logical or moral sense.</p>	0.867
