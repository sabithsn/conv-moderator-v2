Left leaning: There are only two sexes. GTFO with the gender issues. You can't feel your gender. If you're a man who likes woman clothes, you're still a man, but with a different taste of clothes.	It's just natural for the most part that men do that; I don't see much evidence society is the *main* cause of it... and even then, **on the off chance men do have something to express and they do share it with a woman they're with (usually straight women, so maybe you may not resonate with this), that woman more-often-than not subconsciously loses attraction to a man who truly opens up and becomes less of a rock,** especially because if there is something to share it will be ugly. I've heard stories of friends who've had it blown up in their face when they had an argument with their girlfriend/wife later...	0.8
I think therapy is a valid choice for children questioning their gender identity. I‚Äôm not sure if that would be considered conversion therapy.

I don‚Äôt know the process so that‚Äôs probably a drastic oversimplification.	<p>are you arguing that this shouldnt be how it is?

I'm white.

She was really nice about it, too, which made it even worse.	If you‚Äôre wondering why the first was worse, it‚Äôs because I had been off *everything* (no drugs, vape, caffeine, even Tylenol) for 2 years before having my daughter, and yet they still felt like regardless of what a better place I was in, I still apparently looked so frumpy that all I needed was makeup.

Well, I would certainly agree with you that the real problem is ***NOT*** trans women (or trans *people* for that matter). Side note: that's a great point for me to emphasize in future discussions, so thank you for that!   But rather, I think the root problem‚Äîin this discussion anyways‚Äîis, "laws that erode the category of 'female'". In my view that's the problem that needs to be solved.  And I think it will never get solved if liberal / progressive-minded groups continue their approach of censoring, bullying, and / or threatening anyone who disagrees with them. We as a society need to be able to communicate openly with one another and try to resolve our differences. There is no "us" or "them", except in our minds. We're all human, and we're all in this together. Every single person is right about some things, and wrong about other things. And we can help each other, to fill in the gaps where we fall short, and to help everyone be a better version of themselves!   /soapbox üòÖ	<p>Your examples with names are very clear, I get the issue. There are biases. But I don&#39;t think that forcing people to act in the opposite direction is going to solve the issue. You&#39;ll just foster an environment where Mohammads and Maggies will be the &quot;privileged class&quot;, and Johns and Harolds will be oppressed for no reason.

This is true, but many trans women are shorter than many cis women. If height is the real issue, then why are we talking about gender at all? Not to mention that hormone levels in trans women are tightly controlled, which is not the case for cis women. This means that many cis athletes actually have *higher* testosterone levels than their trans counterparts. As it stands, the current regulations are working, and rather than seeing trans women dominate (as some would have you believe), we actually see trans women winning less often than their cis counterparts, even when adjusted for population size.  In the end, this is an issue that has been basically solved already, and is mostly just being used as a culture war issue to win seats for politicians.  One more side note: "a transgender" is not really the preferred wording. It comes across a little dehumanizing, like saying "a black" to refer to a black person. Transgender is an adjective, so it doesn't really work as a noun like that. I am not "a transgender", I am a transgender woman (or a trans woman, or even just a woman).	<p>But if you allow trans women to set records for cis women, you‚Äôre disadvantaging a much larger portion of the population. Yes, I know it sucks for trans women, but the solution can‚Äôt be to make it suck for cis women instead.</p>	0.829

In this specific case no one is calling you a slur except your own race. If you are singing along to a song with said slur in it you are not using it as a slur you are using it as a form music.

The point is that gender and sex meaning different things is not an objective fact. It is a definition created by a small group of sexologists that has gained *some* support and common use, but I would be willing to bet that the majority of English speakers (going beyond the Reddit/Twitter bubble) think of gender and sex as being the same thing. So linguistically, your definition certainly can count as an alternative definition, but the word has certainly not undergone a full shift in definition.  And there was no "discovery" that gender and sex are different things. A few sexologists just up and decided that from now on gender meant gender identity, and sex meant biological sex. And that's the thing, we already had a perfectly good term: gender identity. Why do we need to change the meaning of the word gender?	<p>Like, no, hearing these slogans doesn&#39;t make me personally more conservative, but it&#39;s naive to think it doesn&#39;t push people away who could be persuaded.

What I've been reading/hearing about recently is that the whole "conversation therapy" name is really abused here. Of course it sounds horrible because we associate it with therapy that tried to force gay people into not being gay etc. But apparently the issue here is that this ban extends to the idea that a therapist would question or simply not automatically accept or agree with a kid who claims they're trans. So for example if a little girl comes out as trans after 4 other girlfriends in school did the same (apparently this is a thing) and her reasoning is that she has "masculine" interests or some nonsense, a therapist can't talk to her through that and about that, ask questions, etc before assigning her to hormone blockers or treatments, let alone reach the conclusion that the issue is something else and work with her on it. Therapists are apparently supposed to non questioningly validate the opinion of their patient	<p>Again, especially after becoming more aware of what women often have to put up with from men, she would have been very well within politeness to tell me to stop because my behavior <em>wasn&#39;t</em> okay.

I'm fine, thanks for the concern. If you don't care about my opinion, why go to the trouble of responding at all?  People who don't give a fuck don't make the effort you just did.

Your slur has less value than the Turkish lira at this point. I got pussy too you know, I'm worthy if that's your way of evaluating people, my sweet androgynous Casanova soyboy.

Baking soda is a miracle worker that cleans everything from ovens to dishwashers. It can also clean your iron  Dampen a paper towel or rag with water or distilled white vinegar and dip a corner in baking soda or coarse salt. Baking soda is less likely to scratch your iron than coarse salt. Buff the soleplate clean. Wipe clean with a damp rag or paper towel.	<p>After brushing, I would use water to rinse the toothpaste from my mouth. Apparently what you should do is just spit out the toothpaste/foam, and that‚Äôs it. At first it felt strange, but now it feels completely normal and feels much cleaner. It doesn‚Äôt leave a weird taste in your mouth either, no different than after you‚Äôd rinse.</p>	0.804

Then even after she apologizes she was like, I was so afraid of losing you and the family. Like what? What does even make sense. You were afraid of losing your family‚Ä¶ presumably through death or estrangement as that‚Äôs how you loose your family‚Ä¶ that you held them to an impossible standard and told the second to youngest she was hurting the family??? What? That makes no sense.	You'll be confused about why she does these things. You'll be upset. You'll want to lash out yourself because you don't understand how your own mother could treat you so poorly. You'll start doing things to avoid bringing her wrath on you. You'll lie, and you'll get really good at it. You'll be a perfectionist at the things you think you can perfect, and you'll avoid everything you think you can't. You'll be afraid of coming home from school every day because you don't know what you're going to walk into. You won't feel safe or stable. There will be times when you are certain she doesn't really love you, and you're probably right; She's unable to love herself, you couldn't possibly hope to compete in her eyes.	0.888

Gaylord Focker is probably the worst I know of. I heard he got married and had a couple kids.	<p>At one point my moms friends generosity ran out and she had her boyfriend throw us out. Afterward the whole situation kind of screwed me up. I thought it was my fault we got kicked out. I had some warped notion of this must be what a relationship was like. I heard from her son (we were in the same school) that she was pregnant and had a baby girl. We never used a condom and the timing lined up so still to this day I think maybe I got her pregnant.</p>	0.766
