Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare. Life expectancy in Denmark is 80.8 years and achieves an infant mortality rate of 3.2 per 1k births. Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.  So yes. Let's be more like Denmark.	<p>2-3% need hospital beds. That’s 8 million people at least. The US has 80,000 ICU beds, so even if only 10% of them need ICU, we are lacking by a factor of 100 patients to one bed. </p>	0.83
Aight I’m convinced you’re a troll because after looking at even a bit of your profile you’re not Christian at all, but I’ll humor you. All of the members of Sabbath grew up and remain religious, mostly part of the Anglican Church, but their lead lyricist, Geezer Butler, is catholic. Any religious person who listens to them can see that in their lyrics and know that their “dark” persona, is just a persona, not sac religious or anti-god. Educate yourself	<p>Like I don&#39;t condemn people for being religious, and there&#39;s 0 evidence for theology and its validity compared to the numerous papers and decades of research on transgender individuals.  I am to respect their views despite them being based in no actual evidence and often not even based on the Bible they claim to source their views from. Instead they impose their views upon me instead of acknowledging the reality for how it is, and call me a sinner and attempt to legislate my rights away for the sole reason of me being different. That&#39;s legislating against liberty and individuality of Americans and we can&#39;t let government do such things and harm vulnerable individuals in a free and just society.</p>	0.841

unfortunately Regan didn’t have a good solution to the problem of increasing national debt, due to social security and other government handouts and benefits. and he had to even rack up the debt more because of star wars program. The problem with the nation is far more than just joe biden and the recent 30 years of government. think about it. why did we get into this much debt to begin with?	<p>Your right the government has money, we also have trillions of debt, with an administration that added over 6 trillion well within 100 days, and wants to add another war, which would push this country even further into debt. Pretty sure the government is living outside its means. Which means we should probably pay off some of that debt before allowing at least 18,000+ foreign country kids in our system.

Jesus Christ. I love how this dude 1) takes NO responsibility for his actions. Repeatedly saying he couldn't control his urges and it isn't it fault.

I don't believe this trash response necessarily exposes BLM to be communist/sympathizers, I believe it just further highlights how single-minded they are. Their only reaction to every situation is black = helpless victim and nonblack = racist. They don't look at the specifics, they don't think, they don't care. They are not about justice just blind, rabid dogma that anyone who doesn't look AND agree with them is a degenerate racist.	0.869
Says the guy with a biological upper-hand since he doesn’t produce lactic acid (makes you sore) like the rest of his competitors.	But since the vaccines don't prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there's likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren't being noticed because they don't have a reason to get tested. They don't have symptoms to test for. So even if they're positive and contribute to spreading covid as much as an unvaccinated person, they haven't had any reason to believe they were sick.	0.788

Funny that's what the dog walker Doreen said. And he works 25 hours a week and isn't sure that's not to much.   Your concerns are legitimate in a few scenarios, however they took those talkings points and used them as a spearhead to accomplish the goal of not working at all or barely at all while screaming for more free shit. So in a way, the people shouting for more worker protections, have damaged the image of that argument more than any other group.	<p>For the “making more while unemployed..” I do understand the frustration. Even agree, however I think that’s more on Target/minimum wage(s) being shit or stagnant in most places for a decade or more.

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you’ll get less sick, and you’re less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	>Evidence suggests the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission. **Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential to spread the virus to others, although at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.**	0.902

I don’t take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being “retarded” ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I’m proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity.

Last year I’d go into a store without a mask and some people would bat an eye, but not anymore. After I got the vaccine I’ve basically lived my life as if this never happened, and quite frankly before getting the vaccine I wasn’t worried about this for more than a few weeks.

Big Pharma lobbying against weed is based on 100% bullshit.    They don't care about recreational marijuana use.  Their issue is with people who sell medical marijuana using unscientific claims.  Big Pharma complains about herbal supplements, snake oil, holistic medicine.  They have to spend money and pay the US government to make their medicine prescribable by doctors. They have companies like Amway.  Medical marijuana industry wants more lax FDA regulation than Big Pharma gets.  Their issue is not with weed but with the herbal supplement and vitamin market, giving weed products FDA medical labels without the years of research to back them.   They don't care about recreational marijuana use, they welcome it.  It will creates more customers for them in the long run.

The wikipedia for trans athletes lists a number of ftm athletes. But only three have competed against men. A college swimmer, a boxer who has had one professional fight as a man, and an olympic duathalon.  Realistically even giving a buttload of testosterone is not going to bridge the gap of a female body vs a male body.   But we also see more men who think they are women, it's a very recent change for so many teen girls to think they are boys, and I believe they also make up the biggest percentage of people who detransition.	<p>Case in point. You argue that men have always competed against men. If you switch from sport to acting you see a completely different dichotomy. In ancient Greece women were forbidden from acting and only males could play the role of women?  This continued throughout Europe during Elizabethan times. There was no competition. You can argue that a man can act as a female better than a female acting as a female.

Forcing someone to take shots is unethical, but I guess you’re ignoring the medical ethics courses they taught.

Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	<p>Your argument that there shouldn’t be an investigation into the Capitol because there wasn’t one for the riots is simply illogical . Republicans in Congress have literally said that both of these situations are the results of Antifa and BLM , therefor there is no legitimate reason to not investigate and prove that.</p>	0.901
If they declare the emergency over then the vaccines go away l, they are emergency use only. Then they have ti explain to everyone that the fda approved vaccine isn't what they took. They were intentionally blurry on the details on that one.	<p>It’s also important to interpret it literally given the context of what is going on.  Many people literally think the vaccines are the only option for protecting yourself, which absolutely isn’t true.  When someone who is vaccinated gets the disease, therefore, they think there is nothing they can do except wait and pray.  There are steps that people can take early to drastically improve their chances once/if they get the disease.  There is no legitimate reason for our health system and doctors to be keeping that information from people.</p>	0.873
This, trans raping girls in bathrooms, and trans taking over women’s sports were predictable consequences of the breakdown in definitions of traditional marriage and sexuality but it was dismissed by those who thought love is always the answer.	<p>Yes there are a myriad of types of contraception. But even that isn&#39;t cut and dry. Doctors continuously deny woman the ability to chose to have their tubes tied. So even if a woman knows she doesn&#39;t want kids she still has to meet some fairly arbitrary prerequisites. Usually a certain age, plus a certain number of kids. We often don&#39;t allow women this choice. She can just abstain from sex for how ever long a doctor requires, but sex is one of the better parts of life, seems cruel to require absentia from it.</p>	0.822

Your first four paragraphs apply equally to folk on the right.   Politics is largely a construct of the leadership class designed to keep everyone else entrapped in an “us vs them” war while the leaders control things.

People at the top don’t care about left vs right, they just want the people below them to care.	<p>I get your point and I don&#39;t have too much of an issue with the tax cuts, republicans had control of senate and white house and they will always lobby for corporations.

Some of the most left leaning people I know will listen to it and actively defend it, portraying it as some kind of sexual liberation (specifically, with the dance associated with the genre, which is basically just grinding). I suppose that makes sense within the context, but how do you justify the lyrics? Some of the most widely revered tracks are <em>insanely dirty</em> and hell, one of the dirtiest duos here just sold out their concert in PR’s largest venue. It’s crazy.</p>	0.711

> not moot at all just another example of republicans trying to suppress the vote as with the NC example.  Again.  To get a student ID, the student needs a state-issued ID.  So how is that vote being suppressed, by requiring something they already have?	<p>If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They&#39;ve somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn&#39;t make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it&#39;s just mildly offensive that you won&#39;t acknowledge that <em>you&#39;re in the minority.</em> The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche. </p>	0.858

Because if there is a safe and effective treatment, like monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy is no longer an “emergency use”.

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband’s current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn’t still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband’s tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.	I agree with you on Trump's spending, however I don't think Biden will be better. So on that front I just don't see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump doesn't have the personality I want.

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?

Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us. I’m also wondering if they’ll turn it into a yearly thing.	0.878

That didn’t happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies. Just face that your guy lost and he lost without honor because he’s a conman. Grow up and face reality	<p>Corporations only care about money, and Trump&#39;s realignment of the GOP voter base means the Democrats have significantly more of it.

You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before. But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself. Or even better find a way that nobody has to wait that long that these things are necessary.	Even better, realize that abortion already isn’t a federal issue of any significance and will not be for at least a decade. No one in the federal government wants to change a damn thing about the status quo here - they profit too much from it. Blue team gets much of its vote from single-issue pro choice folks; red team gets much of its vote from single-issue anti-abortion folks. They win or lose largely on that issue, and getting rid of it would mean voters might actually pay attention to other things. And SCOTUS probably prays every night to keep abortion shit off their docket.	0.856
 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	<p>Wait, he didn&#39;t that that, did he? He supported laws, didn&#39;t he?

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.

This actually makes sense because I have always thought that Jan 21st 2023 Biden is removed from office or steps down on his own.  That way whoever is VP would be able to run 2 more times for a total of 10 years, but then they picked Harris as the VP who is super unlikeable.  But if they put Harris in the Supreme Court then they can get anyone else as VP and then President in 2023.  It is all working out.	<p>Still would not surprise me if Harris becomes President due to the cognitive inability of Joe Biden by mid terms so she can fulfill a full 10 years. The media is beginning their campaign now, after propping up Biden for all of 2020, to set out that agenda. Slander Biden&#39;s cognitive state, grounds to remove him from office for being unfit.

Convoy supporters can keep burying your heads in the sand, but that doesn't change the fact that you're being played.	As far as Covid-19, you are absolutely free to believe as you wish; just don't push those beliefs off on me, because while I'll agree that social distancing may help, hand washing may help, but masks do nothing but collect bacteria (go to cdc.gov and run a chart on the most heavily masked states and those that don't mask at all and you will see through Covid Hospitalizations and Deaths why I say that.  Or don't. Up to you.  My experience is that people, once their mind is made up, won't look at charts and graphs and statistics.  They ""KNOW"" already.	0.812

Why why your involving yourself in someone’s private medical decisions you hypocrite . Don’t come up with bullshit. Getting a vaccine is ummm….literally stopping people from killing other people. If he’ll exists it’s full of conserv	Either way we are discussing MANDATING a COVID vaccine for a virus, which has no cure. Forcing someone to take shots is unethical, but I guess you’re ignoring the medical ethics courses they taught. The alternative is to let people go to the doctor for consensual treatment when they’re sick, let people who wish to get vaxxed get it, don’t bash people for getting vaxxed or not getting vaxxed, and respecting other individuals freewill for medical treatment.	0.87
One of the reasons I'm so exciting for the potential of genetic engineering is to find out what makes paedos paedos and fix it, in the womb. Ditto psychopathy/sociopathy, so much human suffering would be solved.  Until then paedos get two choices of method and location. Knife/chemicals, balls/throat.	<p>The vaccine isn&#39;t a fool-proof cure. As I understand it, the vaccine works by training your immune system to react to the protein patterns that match the virus&#39;s profile. If your immune system is too far gone, then vaccine or not you will die from infection. And if you die while infected with Covid, I&#39;d imagine your death would still be counted even if you had a pre-existing condition like an auto-immune disease. </p>	0.804
But you are skewing the data. The efficacy of the vaccine, as acknowledged in the report you shared, has demonstrably kept the death rate lower by reducing the severity of symptoms.

Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few.

Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards.

Voting definitely sucks in some states.  Waiting in line for hours does suppress votes.  But that’s up to the states to fix it, not the federal government.  It’s simply not in their enumerated powers to regulate voting.  And since the 2020 election was the most fair election ever, what’s the issue?	<p>But all of this is moot if one side cheats and then frustrates a review, because the period from election day to confirmation is far too short. The most important thing is very serious jail sentences for anyone fucking with the election. If the election was really spiked, then right now justice cannot be served because nothing allows Trump and Pence to take office.

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	<p>Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us.

If they truly cared about the will of the people, which is what they primarily argued, then they would have waited two months to see how the presidency turned out. But they didn't and appointed someone who was unqualified because she was younger and very conservative in her views, and they knew Trump was rather unfavorable as the election drew closer.	<p>But the political climate has shifted alot since then. I would bet in the past 2 years, approval from the CDC has gone up on the left and down on the right.

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn’t between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups. Republicans on the establishment side hated Trump and the populist movement he represented just as much as any establishment liberal.   Because of that, the party affiliation of any judges who looked at cases (when they didn’t dismiss them on standing, as happened in the vast majority of cases) didn’t matter.	I'm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. Bumpstocks are honestly pretty pointless, but they're also not machine guns, Trump should have left them alone, it's not his place to write laws, it's congress's job.	0.884

Wait, I think I get it now. I'm sorry it took me awhile but I definitely thought about your comment so much more than you did.  The most logical reading of it is that you're tacitly admitting that you agree with me, that Biden isn't to blame for an increase in police deaths, but you're going to just say he is anyway because you're salty over some 24 hour news channel wagging a finger at your daddy tromp for being a stupid toe about COVID.  You have some seriously crossed wires, my guy. You just saw some words (covid, Biden, deaths) and blurted out some reactionary nonsense that was a total self dunk.	I love pretty much everything Trump did policy wise but he was a dumpster fire outside of that. He couldn’t help but put his foot in his mouth anytime any kind of good news came out, giving his detractors an easy way to change the narrative. While he’s good at it implementing conservative policies, he’s awful at explaining the conservative position. He doesn’t know many of the figures and facts so he misstates them, giving the media something to focus on besides the undeniable results. He acts like a child in debates and comes off exactly as democrats want him to.	0.848

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead. Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate.

From what I've read is that this all happened because of an interview .... They asked the whole community if they should do an interview and most of their users said no... We shouldn't do any interviews.... And that mod in the video basically said well I'm still going to do the interview with fox...hence the video... And when the community said... Why did you do the interview we voted on not to do any interviews and you sent the worst person to represent us the way they spoke dressed and gave anti work a bad name  The mods in the subreddit decided to ban everyone who spoke about it with the reason being trolls, right wingers, left wingers, brigadiers, and transphobes ....

The us army probably killed a similar number. And guns killed a lot more.As much as i hate to say it but these are numbers that just need to happen. We need to defend our country and woman need to defend themselves. Whether its with a gun or abortion this is just the way it is nowadays.  A lot more millions of people have died from war and gun violence. If abortion is a cause of death  then so is war because its preventable and a choice. You cant allow one and prevent the other and call them different.	<p>Here&#39;s a news flash: the people who want stricter gun control don&#39;t want it to oppress you, or enslave you, or anything like that. They&#39;ve already got you by the balls in every conceivable way. You think that because you have a gun they are afraid of you? The reason people push for gun control is to over time reduce the availability of guns (yes, even illegaly obtained ones) because America has a shitload of shooting deaths! </p>	0.869

I might care about this if the vaccine worked. All it does now is basically help you get less sick, like a complicated form of Tylenol. Doesn't stop the spread, doesn't stop you getting sick. The sheer uselessness of the vaccine in the face of omicron really sort of ended the whole mandate globally imo. Only the most fanatical leftists still cling to it. Previously vaccine-authoritative governments like UK and Israel have all but abandoned it.	<p>There is a CHANCE that the vaccine may help.  But in cases like with my uncle, being fully vaccinated did nothing. He still died from it. So if you feel you need the help then that&#39;s good but we need to stop acting like this vaccine is this amazing thing. It works okay against the original strain and does very little against the other strains.</p>	0.912

Yeah this isn’t even going to go anywhere. You can’t even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don’t agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that’s all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says “go home”, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don’t stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to. And I’m not saying with guns, but with common sense before all this shit happens.	<p>Ironic you moan about people &quot;not reading past the headline&quot; when you clearly didn&#39;t read any bit of the article yourself.

Is it extremely small compared to the one life?  My math is back of napkin, but there's \~300 million people in the US, so to "balance" the 100% of 1 you only need \~0.0000000003%(1/300,000,000). And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	A few things about that. The mortality in those over 80 is close to 90% (although probably old numbers). So ignore those people. The rest of the us populace is fine right? Well 70+ % are overweight or obese, which is an extremely compounding risk factor for a number of reasons. So ignore those people right? Add all of the other chronic conditions that exist in the us and you're left with a small percent of the population that actually doesn't have risk factors for covid. And guess what? **it's a virus that we have (had) a vaccine for. ** It's miraculous that we could have developed it so quickly, but that's what happens when there's money to be made (capitalism) and the whole human populace is facing the same challenge.	0.847

TBH my 2nd thought (1st was ""wow, what a moron, that's blatant overreach, and are you trying to start a civil war you'll lose?"") was that man, this could be a boost to small employers. Everyone's already feeling the pinch trying to find employees, but large businesses often are having a tougher time probably due to HR/C-suite thinking they can get away with not raising wages to match competition.

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.  Nuance breaks this sloppy meme into the shit that it is	In light of current narrative that the jab has basically no side effects (at least that are allowed to be talked about lest it lead to ""vaccine hesitancy""), It's hilarious to watch drug commercials and their inevitable list of horrific side effects that often include death and several other things much worse then the thing they purport to help symptoms of.	0.907

The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off.

You wanna hear some real stupidity? People commenting things like “stupidity knows no bounds” in a conservative sub when you’ll go to a dem sub and see the exact same comments there. If you picked 10 random comments in both subs and got rid of the obvious words that’d give it away, no one would be able to accurately say which sub the comments came from because they’re all the same comments.   C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb” C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb”  Back and forth forever and ever.   Politics are fucking stupid.   Another thing that drives me nuts is when I see “they’re hypocrites!” I see the same comment in both subs. And the funny thing is THEY’RE BOTH RIGHT AT ALL TIMES BUT NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHEN THEY DO IT! “Well, we’re being hypocrites right now because they’re hypocrites” but they were hypocrites because the other side was hypocritical and so on forever and ever and ever.   It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don’t actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	<p>I have conservative beliefs, but that’s about as far as it goes.

Sure you can, you just have to be willing to pay the price when some lib puke DA calls it an accusation instead of a rape and charges you for defending the girl from an ongoing criminal sexual assault.     "At the time of his death, Quintanilla had an arrest warrant out for continuous sexual abuse of a different child and assault family violence, police said."	<p>Here is the deal, you know this, but the vast majority of the people being held without bail and those that have been indicted or charged did break windows, assault police or smear shit on walls. ALL of these offenses constitute crimes and the offenders should be punished. But cut the crap with your deep concern about these crimes. I actually had to add assaulting police because you didn&#39;t mention it. Probably because you support police being assaulted. You also laughably support police shooting protesters, but only if they are Trump supporters. Prove me wrong.</p>	0.862
While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	<p>Hmm that’s weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes. Their successors as well, are Democrats.</p>	0.847

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since. I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren't wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.	0.884

Yes, you keep telling yourself that. Last I checked, it wasn't Republicans who were stepping down, signaling they weren't selling rejection. Now if things were going SO WELL why would so many Democrats suddenly choose not to run again? It's not the Republicans in panic, no sweetheart. It's the Democrats in a panic because they know what's coming. I hope your feelings are tougher than you put on, I sense a lot of disappointment in your future. Remember, elections have consequences. 😂😂😂	<p>Then again, maybe in a roundabout way this is good for the democrats. Because the other side of the coin is that trump being a considerable influence on the right isn’t really good for the right as a whole. Without him as a common enemy, I think the left will start infighting and crumbling. So it’s in the democrats’ interest for trump to hang on as long as possible, even if he can’t actually run again.</p>	0.883

I've no reason to think this woman lied in this sworn affidavit that has so far been ignored by these corrupt fucking judges.  She has been doing this for many years.  It's her career.  Why would she risk her job over this situation, just to make up some really odd claim about the ballots being ""unlike any she had ever seen before (in this long career), and exactly the same in every way?""	0.853

It prioritizes acceptance, normalization, and glorification of this alternative lifestyle. No they are not trying to be allowed to merely_exist().

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat. But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	<p>But I want you to understand that the culture that has risen in minority neighborhoods is destructive, and has been for decades. For the first time in a long time we&#39;re seeing fathers return to black neighborhoods and with them comes a small opportunity for prosperity in these neighborhoods, with that gang violence and drug use will go down.

Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	<p>HIPAA protects you from that business then sharing your vaccination status with others. It protects you from your doctors office from sharing your vaccination status. But it in no way protects you from being asked about it, and businesses can absolutely refuse you entry if you can&#39;t or won&#39;t produce evidence of vaccination. </p>	0.882

Page 23 paraphrased to:  &#x200B;  In particular, vaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, the envelope of the virus, which is a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people. In the long term, the vaccinated are far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein, even if they have already been infected and cured once or more.    The unvaccinated, on the other hand, will gain lasting (if not permanent) immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being naturally infected with it even once.	<p>That&#39;s actually untrue. The vaccines have demonstrated significant decrease in symptomatic cases and hospitalisations from covid. No vaccine prevents anyone from catching a virus. They train your body to develop antibodies. Vaccinated populations produce more antibodies than &quot;natural infections.&quot;</p>	0.892

I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.	<p>Worst case scenarios aren’t happening because we are doing a good job in mitigating spread, and a great job in vaccine development and roll out.</p>	0.848

Let adult folks have these surgeries if they want to and doctors are willing; don’t ever pay for them with tax dollars, etc, but more obviously don’t do something really, profoundly dumb like put someone who, whatever “gender” they may claim is a fertile biological male human with a female bunkmate.

These judges and law makers don't tend to reside in places where they have to deal with the first hand repercussions of decisions like these.

If less ppl die when they’re vaccinated as opposed to those that aren’t. Even trump said “ the vaccine works, those that are dying are mostly unvaccinated” like I just don’t get it lol u think because covid hasn’t magically disappeared then the vaccine doesn’t work? It was never a cure it’s just armor to white off being killed or hospitalized and it doesn’t stop spread which we always knew. Who told y’all this vaccine should magically stop all covid and spread of it or it doesn’t work	<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it. If you have it, you’re protected. It’s not 100% but you’re probably more likely to die of a lightning strike than die of a breakthrough case. So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way. If they get sick and die, that’s their problem, not yours. </p>	0.903

Again, what lack of confidence? What you see is backed up by research and it's the reason why you haven't listed a single example of a major shift in recommendations yet.   The only thing you can talk is about is masks, which at first weren't recommended due to fear of shortages for medical personnel. Guidelines change, get used to it.	Scientific research is really hard to value because ideally, you avoid ever having to know how much you lost. So for example with the invention of antibiotics we can’t know how many lives were saved so we can’t begin to assign a value to it. So really, science should be one of those areas where we don’t expect to turn a profit and monetary “losses” should be weighed in different terms than, say, a manufacturing business.</p>	0.866

And citizens should get teeth cleanings and doctor's checkups, because it costs less overall when preemptive maintenance is done. And if offered free, it is even more convincing to do it. Government should be there to push citizens in the right direction to get the most efficiency out of them, which involves responsibility over health, because individuals are pretty terrible at maintaining their own health. The US is filled with fat fucks that don't realize they're usually the ones that put the most strain and expenses on our healthcare. This would help with that.	<p>When in reality, we don&#39;t want to be governed. The less control the government has on my life, the happier and healthier I am. Simple as that. What we really need to do, is put it to a vote. Statewide or national vote. But bring up a package that simply redefines medical costs. Puts a reasonable cap on medical equipment, tests, medicines, and insurance. Don&#39;t base it on your level of income, but base it on a national average of income. Then average the cost of insurance to that. Medium household income is $65k a year, insurance should be 2-3 hundred a month based on that. Cap it at 250.</p>	0.862

I had it back in March and was sick for two days, and then fine. Back to shoveling snow and light workouts…though carrying my kids upstairs left me winded. I’m in great shape so the additional symptoms lasted about a week. I’m vaccinated now but hesitant to get booster after booster. Some of these people are gonna take so many their skin color is gonna start resembling a Mountain Dew color.	<p>I wouldn&#39;t really say it&#39;s mild for everyone though.

I don't understand the title of this post. How is it that pro choice is equivalent to pro-life about one person.

I knew a woman whose son&#39;s wife was pregnant. The doctor found that both of them had some disorder in their family history, tested them and found that they both had the gene. So suggested that they test the baby&#39;s DNA in utero. That baby died <em>because of the test</em>. Let me be clear, the test was not positive, and they chose to terminate, the test killed the baby. Some years later they were pregnant again and did not do the test and the baby did not have the disorder, but they would have loved the baby all the same if it had.</p>	0.864

That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	<p>Abortion is not a religious issue any more than any other crime is. I&#39;m not religious and I am extremely anti abortion. We have no scientific evidence of when human life begins. Until we are 100% certain that the thing consuming nutrients and reproducing cells is not a living creature, <em>we shouldn&#39;t be killing them by the millions.</em></p>	0.915

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible.

You're right and that's what makes her one of the *smartest* contemporary socialists. Someone out there is dumb enough to vote for her, more are dumb enough to think she's something great and that this ridiculous response is amazing. Can we just have global nuclear war already?	This is 100% a descent towards communism. Communism is such an evil and destructive ideology while America is the greatest, most prosperous nation in the history of the world, so we like to think that something so wretched could never happen to America.

The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb 😁😁😁  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am 😈 Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.	<p>Exodus 21:22-25, here we have a disagreement about translation. The old translation which was taught for well over a thousand years was &quot;miscarriage&quot; not &quot;premature birth&quot;. That translation came about in the mid 1800s as best I&#39;ve been able find. Which would indicate that if a miscarriage is caused, but no further harm comes to the mother, then a fine, according to the husband, shall be imposed by a judge. If, however, the woman dies as a result of the miscarriage, then the man shall be put to death. This is interesting because the Syrian, Hittite, and Babylonian code in the area all had nearly the exact same passage, but required a fetus for a fetus. Those codes existed before the Mosaic Code was written, so a lack of that clarification seems fairly important. </p>	0.781
Bruh, even the CDC says masks and SD dont work, so thats at a MINIMUM 2/3. The CDC ALSO says that natural immunity is more effective than just triple jabs.

Except the real conspiracy theory was the fact that Joe Biden, who sat in his basement, somehow got the most votes in US election history without having to campaign in any serious way.

Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done.

Making baseless claims of voter fraud, filing law suits with no evidence, asking the Georgia Secretary of State to find a certain number of votes, encouraging your base to “fight” on jan 6, this is what attempting to steal an election looks like. Other republicans are now refusing to concede even when they loose by large margins. Yup definitely the Democrats trying to rig and steal elections. Bunch of stupid sons of bitches you are.	If democrats refuse to let you call ANYONE, every republican needs to shout from the rafters that they’re denying the president the right to call witnesses in his own defense. Nows the time to drag this out as long as possible, thereby pushing Biden’s adgenda into summer/fall and maybe even 2022 before negotiations are done.

But the property has been a family home since Trump bought it in the mid 1990s. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have talked about spending their summers there, doing whatever Trump kids do. Even the Trump organization’s website lists Seven Springs as “a retreat for the Trump family.” Calling a home a “business” solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people “working from home” during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.</p>	0.799

This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don&#39;t know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we&#39;re too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.</p>	0.836

I personally think that likely you are seeing the worst of the worst in terms of Covid, and that skews your outlook, even understandably, but when you take the whole of the population, it appears to me that the ""abuse of the healthcare system"" occurred when they started the panic, and added to it by doing all the ""great"" things we've heard of including running PCR tests at CT higher than 35 (and that's already high- and why I never take ""cases,"" into consideration) calling everyone who has died ""with"" covid as being killed ""BY"" covid, and thirdly (keeping the list short, but incomplete) failing utterly to divide the hospitalization and death statistics up by age range in news available to the general public, and subjecting young people to the preventative measures suffered by the old, completely unnecessarily.	0.876

That&#39;s why you see so much outrage1!! about things like the Olympics, or about Cuba, or how their political strategy is LITERALLY just copying what the Democrats do to further their evil narrative and then doing this &quot;They&#39;re the <em>real</em> racists for putting white people in concentration camps, could you imagine if <em>we</em> did that? Just kidding we would never actually do anything to legitimize ourselves as a political threat to them, gib donations and socialism bad pls.</p></li>	0.814

What? Truckers running on gasoline, and not diesel? I thought you should use Green Diesel cans for diesel fuel?	<p>For me, it just isn&#39;t worth the hassle to ever own a battery-powered electric car.  I might be interested in a hydrogen fuel cell car, which retains the refueling convenience and storage stability of gasoline-powered cars.  In fact, hydrogen would be an improvement for storage stability.  But with a battery-powered electric, I&#39;d still feel the need to own a gasoline powered car as a backup for winter and/or emergencies.  And at that point, why not just forego the electric and drive the gasoline car?</p>	0.737

I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines. All of the doctors I saw on major media outlets when asked responded with either "we don't know" or "the data doesn't suggest that". Thats how scientist approach any subject. In fact, stating any of these points, or even their counter point as 100% certainty is irresponsible and without nuance. It is rare that anything is ever 100%	<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates. Logical contradictions are all over the place and most people don&#39;t notice or care, I find it really hard to describe the average person in that case as &quot;reasonable&quot;.

Sorry, but this hardly qualifies as a definitive study. If it’s not a randomized double blind placebo controlled study it really doesn’t mean Shit.  What you have here is a Dr, (who after just a quick search is clearly seeking attention after being blown off by a majority of the medical community after claiming he invented mRNA tech) cherry picking data from 2nd and 3rd world countries where he wasn’t even directly involved in the experiments.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

Never mind that 95% of current cases are Delta though, and Delta didn’t enter this country until March—two months AFTER Biden was inaugurated.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857
First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights’ worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?”	<p>I was really hoping to have a valid debate with someone that might have some useful insight, but all you have done is insult, bring zero valid points to the debate, and be a hypocrite. I hope in the future you actually think more before you post. If you really want people to &quot;turn from their evil Republican ways,&quot; maybe you should consider giving them a legitimate reason to do so.

Well sure, it wasn't a universal security measure , it was a deterrent against assassination plots.  The idea was that Obama could be managed, but Biden would be so bad that anyone considering a move against Obama would think twice.  Lone wolf crackpots are obviously different.  Picking the worst candidate from the field as your running mate is a pretty effective way of discouraging people from moving against you, either politically or lethally.  Very few people talk about this sort of think in 100% absolutes.  You should probably keep that in mind when reading posts.	People love to pick one of the two extremes; either it's super dangerous and we should all be scared of it or you're going to die! or, it's nothing special and we should just ignore it--it'll go away.

It's not a deadly virus (expected 0.038-0.009% mortality rate, but it can and does kill those who are immunocompromised (the old and immune system weak). Halting the economy is a stupid reaction, but so is not taking basic safety measures.	0.873

You’ve got to be kidding right? Ever heard of the NSA? Campus « police » being given MRAPs? Extrajudicial killings of your citizens? None of this is European.	Remind me which is supposed to be worse:   No cop let anyone in;  They were all let in by cops; or ""Some were let in by cops""?  The folks who went in with weapons intent on finding our elected officials are just as guilty.  There is no scenario where they are ok entering the capitol.

No one cares? A mob of people broke into the capitol building, vandalized it, and harassed and assaulted the police defending it. That’s a big deal regardless of what political party you align with.	Also a few people breaking things doesn&#39;t make all of them rioters, that&#39;s crazy; it would be like saying everyone who showed up on Jan 6th was an insurrectionist, even those that didn&#39;t illegally and violently storm the capitol.</p>	0.857
No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	One, the virus mutates because there is what's known as ""Leak By"". This is why there is a new Flu vaccine developed every year. The Flu vaccine does not ""kill"" the Flu virus, so it mutates. This is the same for the COVID  virus. If there was no Leak By, then the vaccine would kill the virus in a couple ""jabs"", and that would be it.	0.871
Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

So, I see the comedy, but this is an instance where I think pointing out this woman as trans is mean.   She isn't fucking up women's sports. She is just smart and won on Jeopardy playing by the same rules as every other male, female, trans, etc.   It is one thing when a trans person uses their biological advantage to gain an "achievement" they otherwise don't deserve due to biology. I don't think this is one of them.	<p>It doesn&#39;t make them good or pleasant people,  but it has to be noted that military measures that stay within modern SOP simply can&#39;t eradicate them.

I'm confused, is it a good thing then that without gun control the USA has the highest rate of gun related homicide per capita of all developed countries and the second highest total of gun deaths overall?  Is this what the second amendment was all about? Or is this a side effect of not having a so called 'police state' because I would argue less gun related deaths is a good thing right?	<p>Definitely didn&#39;t expect a European to say that, but yeah when you look at case fatality rate and deaths per 100k population the US is definitely doing better than plenty of other countries across the pond like the UK and Belgium. US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported. I think the Netherlands numbers are currently better than the US, but that few ICU beds is just asking to be Italy. With how much EU citizens are taxed for healthcare I would hope the government increases ICU beds soon 🙁</p>	0.845

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	<p>Anyway, this is another example how the name of an organization is not what is its mission (like &quot;freedom fighter&quot; means the opposite). The NAACP has an agenda and it is not the advancement of Colored People. It is the advancement of socialism and the end of the nuclear family.  That is why they won&#39;t touch Hunter, it does not advance that agenda.  As for colored people, they have not been advanced in 50 years (this is according to the NAACP).</p>	0.855

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.

They are.. i own a glock 17 gen 5 moa and it came with 3 magazines that hold up to 16 rounds each . Which is kinda to low in my opinion.  I looked it up and you can get 50 round drum mags for glocks…  Thing is not that democrats care about our safety, it takes more than one shot to put down a potential threat.  Say some one breaks into my home with the intent to harm my family , if i manage to not miss my first few shots due to adrenaline dump and i hit my target, unless its a headshot then one or two hits wont always stop a person… this is why you hear from the left that “so and so cop shot a guy 7 to 8 times” well thats because they keep shooting till the threat is neutralized.  People who don’t own guns i think do not understand that one bullet is not enough to stop a threat. And im willing to bet part of that is thanks to movies.	<p>Now I&#39;ve watched about 500 videos of police shootings over the past few months (not an exaggeration).  The conclusion I think is extremely obvious is this:  Police shootings are almost always technically justified.  But in most cases they are also avoidable.  Oftentimes the police put themselves in a position where they are foced to use their guns becayse they&#39;ve ran out of other options.  Most people shot by police are armed with sharp edged weapons or some kind of club.  And most shootings happen in a location where the suspect does not present an immediate threat to anybody (other than the police).  My advice, if they were to ask it, would be that the police keep their distance as much as possible, until better less-lethal measures can be employed, or until mental health pros can arrive on scene.  Another thing they could do is to stay in their cars, where a suspect armed with the weaopns I mentioned cannot pose a serious threat to them.  They could even try using their cars to knock the suspect over, the goal being to disarm in the process.</p>	0.818

 I worked full-time 12.00$ hour 40 hours a week and was homeless.   Was I on drugs ?  No I wasn't.   I was not even drinking .    I did not make enough money cover the basics. So I chose to live in my truck save as much money as I could and be able to eat what I needed to stay healthy.  I totally understand why someone could get discouraged in this type of system .    Actually this system helped create BLM and ANTIFA.	I grew up dirt poor and on the verge of homelessness.  I've had the experience of not knowing if you were going to eat on any given day.  Have you?

Just from the information I've seknife scene the boasters seem to be much more dangerous than the actual vaccine was originally, And that could be just potentially because it's now your 3rd shot of a MRNA.  And I understand not everyone can just quit their job, But you need to quit your job. You bought yourself sometime with your booster shot fine find another fucking job.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.851

The ultra wealthy have almost always been liberal. They aren’t a victim of “wokeism”, it’s just that when you have *that* much money, where losing 10s of millions hardly makes a dent, you turn to philanthropy, expansion, and doing your best to right the societal wrongs. There’s also a difference between “spouting left bullshit” and general decency, responsibility, and respect. Advocating for diversity, advocating for environmental friendliness, advocating for equal rights is not a sided issue, it’s general human decency.	<p>And participants in capitalism do have the option for their effort to be rewarded predictably. Most jobs have predictable pay. Entrepreneurship is obviously more of an all-or-nothing, but that&#39;s an entirely optional venture. I&#39;m perfectly happy with my stable salary and stock grants, so I&#39;m not one of those people claiming that everyone should strive to be their own boss.</p>	0.838
I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.

Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.

Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated. The government should be responsible for allowing a cost-free path to the middle class, because:  1. That increases the country's worker output 2. Increases tax revenue 3. Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth. If we keep going this route, people will need to be housed by their jobs, and that's just the start of it. We're quickly approaching the endgame here.	<p>Secondly taxes reduce inflationary pressures by removing currency from circulation. Let&#39;s say the government wanted to hire some workers to increase the size of the military, but there were no unemployed workers left to do so. If the government wanted to hire some workers from the private sector, it would have to outbid the private sector wages. That could drive inflation. Instead, the government could levy taxes on the private sector, to cause unemployment, or reduce wages, thereby freeing workers to hire for the military at a non-inflationary price.</p>	0.909

Much better than forcing them to work by tying healthcare to work, right? Generally speaking, government policies are made with citizen efficiency in mind, and that's very true for our current situation. Except it's worse than my suggestion. Forcing productivity out of citizens using fear is no way to govern. Currently a person's savings can completely deplete due to a freak health accident. That's inhumane, not right, and needs to be protected against.	<p>When you lose the truth what&#39;s left? I&#39;m very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask.

Both are bad, but one is much worse, but "party of personal responsibility" is just a slogan, and doesn't actually mean anything, because if you do try to call out an issue you are branded a RINO.

I understand the rate of death is higher adjusted for population 14% black v 64% white. Yet black people still commit 52% of all crimes.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

You will literally create the scenario where COVID spreads the most and gets to mutate the most. As having unvaxxed and vaxxed people in the same population, actually helps create new mutations.	<p>This whole notion that we need to protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated is a complete farce and just a tool to create division and hostility among the population.

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.  Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.	<p>If you’d like me to take anything you say seriously, provide some sources to back up your claims. Otherwise crawl back to the hole from which you came.

I’m starting to think you’re a bot.	<p>By you&#39;re own logic, nobody should listen to you anyways, you&#39;re not a doctor. My own doctor told me not to get the vaccine, because I have natural immunity. It&#39;s fairly common for other doctors to give the same advice. But they all must be &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; huh? You know better than them.</p>	0.882

You are not naturally vaccinated you goober. Having COVID and then catching it again is actually a marker for a bad reaction, not a lesser one.      &nbsp;   >But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.  Your mind has been poisoned with lies. You don't have natural immunity and tons of people on HermanCainAwards were previously infected with COVID at the start of this nonsense, and then die when they catch it again. Your a fool.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.909

What they actually mean historically is bolshevism, the right-wing precursor to totalitarianism that developed in the Soviet Union. The US had a major attack on labor earlier in the last century and anti-labor oriented US business and political interests attacked supporters of labor/workers as being communists by associating people advocating for more democracy, better labor standards, equality, unions as advocates for the brutality of the Russian state, and wanting to bring that to America. </p>	0.817

Funny thing is they voted in that community not to do any interviews...

And when the mods found out they started leaving and making their own subreddits because they don't care what the community thinks they decided to private the subreddit to protect themselves...  In fact one of them spoke to the one who did the interview directly and she basically said she doesn't care what the community thinks... Because she is doing politics...

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.893

1. It's not your responsibility 2. It's the government's responsibility because the government stupidly allowed these people to get worthless degrees that can't be bankrupted 3. The government pays for all of this by incorporating a wealth tax (top .1%), ban stock buybacks, etc 4. It's not your responsibility, stop saying it is, and go about this in a much more positive way. There's plently of wealth to bring back our middle class from the top .1%.	I really think that inflation isn't just a negative side effect of left-wing politics, it's a feature. They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don't know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we're too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.	0.874

Hello, not a conservative but have a question?  Is the issue with this political in nature (you don’t think companies should be allowed to do this)? Or personal (you don’t like that this company is doing this)?  Because this seems to be how a private system is supposed to work. The government rules it can’t enforce a certain policy, and then the private sector chooses to implement the policy if they deem it to be the best thing for their business.	<p>The government shouldn&#39;t force business&#39;s to provide services to people however I&#39;m not sure that conservatism explicitly prohibits governments from preventing business from doing something. </p>	0.848

I mean, Trump and company are welcome to bring any and all allegations  to the courts, which they did. And they had no evidence , so the courts sent them home. These were conservative , trump appointed judges mind you. Just because enough people repeat a lie, doesn’t make it true. Cultists believe what they’re leaders tell them to believe	<p>Couldn’t agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn’t matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns.

I don't make money from the vaccine in any capacity. My concern about this is a pharmacist for my patients and my pay doesn't go up or down a single cent with sales from medication.  It's honestly insulting that you think my concern for people suffering from the vaccine is from monetary gain and not from genuine concern.	But since the vaccines don't prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there's likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren't being noticed because they don't have a reason to get tested.

i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence.

Oh I don’t think that most of todays democrats are actually concerned with racial equality but yea we should teach how originally democrats were the conservative party but how all this changes between 1860 and 1936 when FDR was elected and the New Deal cemented the party swapping ideologies. Considering David Duke has endorsed Trump in the past two election cycles I’d say it’s clear who todays segregationists, who openly state black people are inferior, actually support.	<p>I&#39;d also like to point out that the democrats only started to support gay rights when they realized it was politically advantageous to do so. In the 90s and early 00s, they didn&#39;t like homosexuals either. And now they want to act like they&#39;ve always been champions for their rights. Like how they chanted BLM, then voted in the guy who signed the 1993 crime bill who&#39;s VP was a DA. LMAO Also all these companies want to pretend they support gays when not a single one supported them before gay marriage went through and it was popular to do so.

The responses to your question fog up what he ACTUALLY said.  He talked about the badness of whiteness for the vast majority of the podcast.   That whites are genetically incapable of sympathy and such.  That is NOT why he was fired from his job.  He was talking to an ex-member of Public Enemy ("Professor Griff")...who was in full agreement.  Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).   One bonus of free speech is that it allows us to identify these fools, too.... otherwise, they hide their true feelings.	<p>Set your straw man down please sir.

I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even *had* covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don't know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don't know, but I'd assume she was unvaccinated. So that's 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50.	0.818

Ooooohhhh paintballs how terrible lmao.  I also don't remember the government suspending civil liberties and freezing their bank accounts like they're doing to the truckers.  And what were the rioters doing to the cop car before he got scared and hit the gas?  To be clear I don't give a shit about cops, they are just enforcers for capital.  But now that I mentioned capital, let's recall every big corporation jumping on the BLM bandwagon.  Suddenly every corp had BLM messaging on their website.  Kamala Harris started a bail fund for BLM rioters, OK.  Look man, if the federal government, local mayors, and every big corporation supports your "protest," then it's a fake astroturfed protest in service of capital.	<p>The storming of the Capitol and murder of two police officers to overturn our election was also bad, and was directly called for by our sitting president and his allies at his own rally. It also was over no actual evidence. That&#39;s really bad.  Those people belong in jail.</p>	0.877

The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.   Screw that.  So yes, the masks are harmful.	<p>Businesses can and have enforced dress codes, no smoking policy, kicked people out for swearing, or smelling like shit, or being too drunk. The list goes on and on. If you don’t like their rules go somewhere else. You talk about the trend that allowing private businesses to operate freely, which is a CORE conservative belief, could be costly.

Holy crap boys. I get it if you don’t want to get vaccinated I support your freedom to choose, but picking and choosing the data like the author did in this article is junk science.  From the article the author pasted in this article: Boosted vs unvaccinated isn’t even close. Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000. That’s somewhere between 3 times and 15 times the risk of death to be unvaccinated.   This data doesn’t show what the author is trying to distort it to show.	<p>That being said the Covid vaccine isn&#39;t without small chances of side affects they even make you wait 15 mins because of some of the reactions you could have. The point is that the vaccine is less dangerous then the virus. That being said I don&#39;t support any type of forced vaccine legislation even having got it myself.</p>	0.872

I prefer to be healthy in my "great free state". Getting into a car accident that isn't your fault and results in hundreds of thousands of medical bills doesn't scream "FREE" to me.

Only time I have had a power outage in the last 20 years it didn't last for longer then 4 hours.  I could go on and on but I'm going to go ahead and guess that you're looking through rose colored glasses at your state when you should be comparing it objectively with not only other states, but the rest of the world.	<p>Statically speaking, I won’t. This shit isn’t the Black Plague, for anyone between 20 and 50 it has a 99.9% survival rate, and most people end up having a fairly mild case of it where you feel like shit but you’re not in the hospital.  Not to mention that only like 10% of the US population even got infected in the first place. </p>	0.851
First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	<p>Why would I, me not you dumbass, get this vaccine when I have more of a chance for adverse side effects than I do from getting sick from COVID?</p>	0.84

When every narrative from multiple sources starts to look like propaganda or conspiracy, it might not be a bad idea to also check your own biases as you check your sources. When the whole world looks like it's against you, it probably isn't.	And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  What Weissmann says is technically correct, but he leaves out context that radically changes how one might view the Tucker situation.  Yes, of course anyone reaching out to a Putin surrogate should expect the NSA/CIA to be listening.  No one is surprised by that.  What makes this so frightening is that this information was leaked to journalists.  This could potentially be used (and Tucker alleges this to be the case) for blackmail and to otherwise influence American journalists and influential figures.  That right there should be enough to enrage you.	0.837

There are two Sergeant at Arms. The House one reported to Pelosi and the Senate one reported to McConnell.

This is what capitalism is about...    I as a business want to have the most profits, how do I do that?    I pay as little as possible to get the most return on my money.      This is as basic as it gets, not very hard to understand honestly.	<p>And participants in capitalism do have the option for their effort to be rewarded predictably. Most jobs have predictable pay.

A lot of people had to eat local wildlife to survive the famines caused by Mao's Great Leap Forward, the modernisation of predominantly rural China. Millions starved and cannibalism was rife, so bats, rats etc became staple food items for people. Habits die hard I guess. The problem isn't that we're eating bats, it's that we're eating animals full stop.	<p>Picture this scenario. An alien overlord looks down on Earth and finds that he really likes pennies, but hates humans. He will kill 2,000 people per day, but for every 2% of the human population who carries a penny in their pocket at all times in public, he will reduce the number of people he kills by 1%. So if everyone keeps a penny on them in public, 1,000 people per day will still die, but 1,000 people per day will be spared. </p>	0.806

Uh no — liberal peruser here and me and all of my liberal friendie friends want shit to be back to normal. I am annoyed as f*ck that I am still dealing with this BS after almost 2 years.

If you guys were actually conservative... drawing on the root meaning of the word... you would be risk averse and recognize that your chance of vaccine issues is minuscule in comparison to the aggregate affect of non-vaccinated people filling the hospitals, necessitating further mandate, etc.     [If I’m removed from this sub, it’s clear evidence that conservatives actually love censorship, when it’s convenient. Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]	Deaths have been on a decline for a long time now, and whether that's from the vaccines or from less virulent strains of the virus, facts are facts and this pandemic has been winding down for quite a while.

If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws.

People don’t even know what critical race theory is.  It’s an application of critical theory used to explore racism in legal settings.  It’s taught in law schools, not elementary or high schools.

CRT is not at all what you are portraying it is, you are lying.

You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	The following nights their response to the protests felt like overcompensating for the night of the riot. Peaceful marches would get boxed in and tear gassed, etc. These tactics would have been nice to deal with the looters but were unnecessary for the marches. They realized that they were basically fanning the flames at this point and backed off, rightfully in my opinion. Whether you agree with that move or not, they did not need federal assistance either way, and the offer just felt like political showmanship by Trump saying he could swoop into this Democrat city and save the day.	0.864

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	<p>Most of these neo-Marxist morons are just made that universities and community colleges aren&#39;t free.

You are mixing two different stories.     There was a pipe burst @ 6am in the morning, it was taken care of in a couple of hours.     @ 11pm opening the envelopes stopped, which observers are supposed to be there for.  Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.  Zero impact on races. Look at the fraudulent elector scam with forged documents, getting zero news coverage by right-leaning news sources.

> At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.  None of this was behind closed doors. Most of it was index fund ETFs which I was told was supposed to be the only allowable investment by this sub, and the rest of it was after the completely public bill text was unsurprisingly passed.  What a bullshit hit piece. It's talking about the ROI on 6 individual trades not his actual portfolio.  > But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%.  The S&P ETFs he bought way out performed this purchase by nearly double. After BA opted for private funding rather than the offered public funding.  What exactly did he do wrong and should be outlawed? Not including that he filed the disclosure extremely late, obviously. But you're acting like this is the poster child of why congress shouldn't be allowed to hold  stock when it's pretty blatantly not.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-rep-dan-crenshaw-decided-the-covid-19-pandemic-was-the-perfect-time-to-buy-and-not-disclose-stocks	<p>Trump is absolutely <strong>not</strong> an exception. He had a lot of talk about bringing back manufacturing, and even had moderate success, but passing the tax bill, the only real major act of his presidency, was an absolute, undeniable betrayal of the working class and the greatest gift to the mega-wealthy they could have possibly hoped for. That tax bill contributed massively to the greatest transfer of wealth from the poor 99% to the top 1% in history that&#39;s been happening over the last few decades.</p>	0.846

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	<p>I get that generational poverty is a thing. I get that black people are more likely to be impacted by that because of the past. What I don’t get is why I, someone who had absolutely nothing to do with it, should be on the hook for it.

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	<p>We should raise awarness to get that changed though. idk how, but i guess an okay way to start is just to keep bringing it up every time someoje brings up the 2nd amendment. Both should be amended, no amendments are untouchable, Thomas Jefferson was right (except for all his racism lol, mainly on that the constitution should be looked at for revision every 20 years or so).</p>	0.784

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They’ll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape. Not to mention,   > Domestic violence is more common than any other health problem among women during pregnancy.   https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy  I sincerely hope I don’t get banned for posting this link. I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.	<p>But if you even suggest they stop using abortion as birth control, and maybe practice safe sex, that’s a gigantic issue and infringes on their rights as a woman. I mean there were at least a dozen girls at my high school that had <em>multiple</em> abortions.

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately.

There's only 1 norwegian country and it's Norway, dumbass, the word you were looking for is scandinavian.

You are just claiming the US healthcare is terrible with no evidence whatsoever. The US absolutely isn't LAST lmfao. If they're last in maybe some specific thing I can believe that, but at least have an idea of what you're even claiming. Are you talking about OECD countries? Then in some areas we are last yes. But we are also the lowest cancer mortality rate in that list, and one of the best at preventative procedures, visits, and vaccination. We have a big obesity problem in this country which causes us to be lower on many things such as life expectancy too. So our healthcare is not terrible by any stretch, although it's not as efficient and isn't as easily accessible. Ignoring all that though, our healthcare system still has undeniably created most of the medical advancements in the past many decades which even allow countries to improve their healthcare to this point. That's just a fact. Where do you think all the new medicines and treatments come from? The US pulls more than its weight in drug/treatment research costs, and if other countries would share that burden then we'd all be better off in the long term	0.764

Yes, but what if the father does want the child but the mother does? The father shouldn’t be force to provide for a child he had no way of denying. (After conception, I know you could use contraceptives. What I mean is if the mother doesn’t want the child she has/had abortion, but if the father doesn’t want the child he can’t abort the baby unless the mother also wants an abortion.)	Now, unless you’re in a position to get an abortion, which I’m not, why would you wish to impose your will on another human being? Why not just NOT get an abortion? It’s not up to you what I or my family do with our bodies, Nor is it up to me what you do with yours.

His old personal lawyer is convicted of a crime, his new personal lawyer was just suspended from practicing law, and the political future of his old Vice President—who has solid conservative credentials—has effectively been pushed out of the Republican Party because he opted to not unilaterally void the electoral college results and instead followed the process that’s been in place and codified in law in this country for well over 100 years.	0.843

A real quick Google search will do you good. Trump visited The Hermitage on March 15, 2017. Gave a speech and laid flowers on Jackson's grave.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

I'm naturally vaccinated, had it last year.  But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.861

They are still operating on thinking that ‘Oh, everything is normal. You know, we’ve got to play politics, as usual.’ It’s not politics as usual. What is happening of the right is not politics as usual. What is happening on the right is not right.

Ok, just pointing this out... this law was pass in 2019 by a Republican legislature, and signed by a Democratic governor... and a good number of the conservative state legislators who voted in favor of the bill ~2 1/2 years ago have turned on it... so this is not the clap that you think it is...	<p>The problem is that election laws <em>were not</em> legally modified in 2020.  In 2020, many state and local officials <em>ignored</em> election laws to accommodate covid.  This is the key point where the Republican argument wins.

Haha yup after that dingleberry screwed up horribly on Foxnews theres been tons of infighting.   Lets be honest not every person in that group was a left wing antifa nazi who lives with mommy.

A new home cost 300K, yet an office job with a degree will net 45k a year something is wrong	But I agree with some of it. Retail is a brutal job sometimes and is very frustrating. Target has provided 30 days of leave for those with comorbidities and extended leaves for those with Covid. One person was even told to stay out of state with pay and a small per diem when she caught it while at her parents. They have been very generous with the covid part.

Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.  If they're dead then we're super-mega-dead.	<li>While I&#39;m employed my health insurance is incredible for myself and my family. Easily affordable and manageable. My whole family is only $1200 a year with 2000 out of pocket max. Estimates for Universal Healthcare is WAY more PER PERSON.

Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I’m general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it’s a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it’s a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it’s a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics? Politicians vote with their wallet.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren't wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.	0.89

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	So as conservatives, we absolutely hate it when anybody wants to tell us what to think, or what to say, or what to believe, but at the same time, we want to use the state to make such prescriptions for others when it comes to exercising certain functions of their body.	0.904
The person claiming to be naturally vaccinated is the one who is anti science. We have literal science that shows COVID can fuck your world up and even kill you, after you have had it already.

They don’t. The omicron infects at a high rate and mostly mild symptoms, ( not to be confused with mostly peaceful protests) and has less than a handful of deaths.

A ton of registered democrat voters were registered to addresses that can't possibly exist, proven on video on the LwC show.

You do know that your body doesn't know why it's producing the injected spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine, right? This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	<p>That&#39;s actually untrue. The vaccines have demonstrated significant decrease in symptomatic cases and hospitalisations from covid. No vaccine prevents anyone from catching a virus. They train your body to develop antibodies. Vaccinated populations produce more antibodies than &quot;natural infections.&quot;</p>	0.897

This country will never get out of debt. So many presidents rack it up in their tenure, and voters hate being taxed.  I live in Minnesota and I can't tell you how many people lose their minds over the fact that there's a surplus here. We generally have pretty good infrastructure, pretty good schools, and our local government takes issues seriously. Yet people lose their minds over the fact that things aren't at an exact zero sum on the budget.	Now Norway is far from a perfect utopia like a lot of redditors try to make it look, but it baffles me that USA and Norway can have such similar social and government structures, yet so many people in the states are scared by the slightest tax increase, even when the small increase causes large personal savings in the long run. Why so many go against their own interest? (Less student loan, no health insurance deductible, reducing economic desperation causing fewer crimes, etc).	0.858

These people made a mistake, although was it really a mistake? Many of these people were young & stupid (weren't we all at one point?) and were promised great paying jobs with their history degrees from snake oil salesmen advocating for non-bankruptable loans.  Also, this isn't our responsibility, the government can easily pay for this by implementing a wealth tax (on top .1%), banning stock buybacks, etc...  And you should care about these people. It's a national security risk to shovel loans to our younger generations without any benefit. It only increases the wealth gap, which is not a good thing.  Please keep an open mind for those that made these mistakes. They're not lost, they just need help.	I really think that inflation isn't just a negative side effect of left-wing politics, it's a feature. They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don't know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we're too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.	0.887

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>However, enforcement was a tricky subject. Any time a politician said we need to prosecute unregistered firearms hard and start throwing the book at them you would get pushback because that would disproportionately affect the black community. Historically, the government has found various ways to try to discourage minorities from legally owning guns in a way that rural whites never fully experienced, so there is some grounding there.</p>	0.847

Oh sure, I'm certain everyone of the long list of women who have accused him are lying, and that he is telling the truth.

Maybe there isn't a place for a serial sexual assaulter in the Conservative movement. Are we about personal integrity, or not? The aim should be to be better than that.	<p>About six months later she started feeling guilty and confessed they had consensual sex and she accused him of that in an attempt to save her marriage. As far as I know nothing happened to her (adultery is a crime under the UCMJ) and he got tossed out with a general discharge (not great, not terrible) as an E-1 private.

If you are afraid of the vaccine then you should be afraid of monoclonal antibodies for the same reason.  But of course you just parrot whatever the alt media tells you to say.	<p>When you lose the truth what&#39;s left? I&#39;m very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn&#39;t work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven&#39;t gotten vaccinated, but those who haven&#39;t still wear masks. They&#39;re irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.</p>	0.892

Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	<li><p>Amnesty would secure a permanent Democrat majority for the next generation. This would help RINO&#39;s because the last thing they want is to be in power (unless they&#39;re at the head of the table) you see what most of these congressional Republicans really want is to collect donations and bitch about things they cannot control or really do anything about.

100% - Yes - it is selfish to protest a mild inconvenience at the expense of the lives of other people during a health crisis.  And it will never be OK to put your neighbor at risk to further one’s own self interest, and especially so for self-imagined reason.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children.

The reason I say cult is because Trump supporters have proven time and time again that they are willing to believe anything trump tells them to believe. As far as changing voting laws, it’s kind of the legislators jobs to update and change laws. I don’t see anything wrong with voting through the mail , and yes Facebook is sketchy but I don’t remember that having anything to do with Democrats. Facebook sponsored the first Republican primary debate if I recall correctly.	<p>The context is obvious from the flow of the conversation. DoJ says they can&#39;t just overturn an election and Trump says he isn&#39;t asking for that.  He just wants a public statement to be made.  Right after discussing one of the voter fraud allegations that the DoJ said was possible.  The DoJ didn&#39;t just tell Trump that there was zero evidence of voter fraud.</p>	0.867

As a society have acknowledged the fact that males have high testosterone levels,  and women have low levels.  This leads to different mindsets around sex.

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	**Restaurant:** You live and die by reviews these days.

A caveman child would starve to death if it had to rely on small game and gathered food that their mothers could help provide.

I presume you’d fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves?

>Now who doesn't know how they generate revenue?  You, dipshit. Because you've consistently missed EVERY single factor here while babbling about subscriptions; which would be one thing if you were correct, but you weren't even correct about THAT. He retains 11 million listeners per episode. Spotify now has a metric they can measure value to as opposed to just "People like music". ONE GUY keeps 11 million people paying 10 bucks a month. He paid for himself in under a month.  Then you have the free accounts, who have to listen to ads, but still listen to Rogan. Do I need to explain advertising dollars to you? Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game. Joe Rogan, from all conceivable angles, is literally spotifys most valuable asset.

They negotiated themselves into lower pay.   Their initial contract offer was the same as the men's. They renegotiated it to have a lower bonus for winning but a higher guarantee. They also negotiated non-monetary benefits into the contract which was offset by a lower cash payout.   In contrast, the men key the pay only contract (no benefits) and the lower guarantee (but higher pay for performance).   https://youtu.be/LLeAWuRbObQ	<p>They should pay their fair share.

I mean, yeah, there's a pretty obvious difference, I dunno why you would compare a burning building to blocked highways, seems like unequal comparisons... let's try something with a little more equal-standing, shall we?   *Conservatives when liberals block highways as a form of protest*: "Fuck those people, run em over if you have to!"  *Conservatives when other conservatives block highways as a form of protest*: "So much heroism, keep fighting the good fight, fellow-Patriots!"

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	<p>And while Anarchists rioted on inaugeration day, as they had in many inaugerations before, you would be very hard pressed to find rhetoric that Russia stole the election, therefore we riot among those Anarchists. We can tie direct Trump tweets and theories to people in the Capitol building. Those Anarchists did not prevent any votes or procedures from happenning either.	0.874

Why do you assume that I’m for defunding, and also why do you think defunding means removal of officers? Why do you think that all democrats have the same view point? We don’t.

Defunding the police isn’t the right move, re-determining what the current funds go to, is the step we need to take. My opinion?

As conservatives love to say, follow the law and you won&#39;t be punished. If you do actions that might support or encourage a terrorist group, you will be punished regardless of your ethnicity as Han Chinese have been executed for similar crimes.  The alleged &quot;genocide&quot; I would clarify doesn&#39;t actually involve killing. Not even the far fetched sources report mass killings. On top of this the majority of law abiding Uighers are free and living normally in China among other Chinese, enjoying their benefits as they should.</p>	0.836

... I'm failing to see where I remotely suggest this. To make it clear, I want historical facts to be taught. Nothing more. As conservatives, we need to teach our history because it contains our past failings and successes. So in the future we pass policies that have historically worked, and don't pass policies that have historically failed.  I'm simply here to gain more information about this subject, I'm not suggesting some stupid anti-white sentiment.	Guess what? I might be fairly conservative, but I'm not going to straight up ignore an argument that is being presented to me. That's what indoctrinated people do.

It might have something to do with the fact that the person who started it has essentially been MIA for the last 48 hours and even the "Leadership" of the Convoy <if you can call them leaders> have basically disavowed any association with her.  She also started asking for etransfers right before she disappeared. I'm sure she just assumed that that was all the money she'd ever get out of this grift and just took off with the cash given by whoever was stupid enough to send her any directly.  Either way, absolutely hilarious turn of events and the constant infighting within this fringe movement is entertaining as hell.	Now note, there were 10 other Republicans, some fairly principled like Rep Kizinger, who voted against Trump. They all walked out when she started her bullshit speech (not bullshit in text but just bullshit in she didn't actually believe or care about any of what she said), because while the speech may have some shred of truth to it, the person speaking those words, as I just noted above, who supported Trump almost overwhemingly through all his other lies, is obviously full of shit and just trying to paint a pretty picture because she knows she was on the outs.	0.856

Couple of things here, the FBI can't do anything until someone breaks the law. You can look at the Orlando public shooting for evidence of that, the FBI investigates all threats of terrorism no matter how big or how small domestic or not. So they have to investigate these people to determine if they actually pose a threat. All I see in this article is pandering to the conservative audience.	<p>Current laws acknowledge that police need the benefit of the doubt legally in order to do their job. Progressives want to start jailing cops any time they make a mistake, and for some bewildering reason ppl in this thread are now anti-police and want these democrat DAs to go after cops and jail them for mistakes too. What&#39;s next, maybe we should just defund and disband all the police depts like progressives want after all? Who cares about surging crime! That&#39;s the logical next step because very few cops would perform the job anyways under the new liability that we are now suggesting they should burden. Already critical police shortage and surging crime rates, yet apparently even some conservatives now jumping on the anti-cop bandwagon trying to strip all of their legal protection and open them up to being jailed for honest mistakes.</p>	0.858

> While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband’s current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She could still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of stigmatizing preconceptions of her. >  >   This is a fair point, but I think the US is burned out on political dynasties generally. Also keep in mind, Trump won as a direct rebuke to Obama (plus Clinton was terrible, but still).   Outside of Manhattan wine bars, the Obamas do not have the appeal many think they do.	I agree with you on Trump's spending, however I don't think Biden will be better. So on that front I just don't see the point of shooting myself in the foot just because Trump doesn't have the personality I want.

Just got over being sick with covid despite being vaccinated. My unvaccinated wife was not significantly more sick.  Leftoids: stop fucking pushing this nonsense. This vaccine WILL NOT eradicate covid, nor will the next one, or the next after that. The only thing it will do is keep *some* people out of the hospital who might have a severe case. You can still get it, you can still spread it, you can still die from it. Stop buying this bullshit that unvaccinated people are a threat and are standing against this fantastical "end of covid" fantasy you have.	<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it. If you have it, you’re protected. It’s not 100% but you’re probably more likely to die of a lightning strike than die of a breakthrough case. So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way.

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	You don't send a mail in ballot to just any random address because the person could've easily moved. Now you got a ballot floating around out there that anyone can just fill out. Of all the baseless claims y'all makes this is the most bizarre to me. Databases containing addresses go off of what's on your ID. Do you know how often those are updated? Also, why is it a bad thing to suggest if someone wants to vote, they should simply request a ballot? Like is it that difficult?	0.874

Slavery isn't bad, the justice system punishing black people worse for the same crime is not bad, all white juries clearing people of lynching and so on are not bad? CRT is the discussion of anti black bias in the justice system and that happens to be the domain of us whiteys.  How is learning about our justice system and where it has failed the citizens a bad thing unless you think that black people deserve worse treatment?	<p>To talk how racist things are against black people turns them into victims, which is in of itself racist because black people should be treated the same as white people and not be labeled. Who wants to be a victim and for people to feel sorry for them? That&#39;s not a good thing and you could even look at that as a way to secretly keep black people down, since outright racism from before the civil rights era isn&#39;t possible anymore. These white, social justice warrior, liberals are the actual oppressors of black people by labeling them as victims.</p>	0.873

Yes folks, Its a race to the bottom. Both parties suck now.  According to the Gallup Poll in 2018  "President Donald Trump's job approval rating averaged 38.4% during his    first year in office -- slightly more than 10 percentage points lower    than any other elected president's first-year average. Bill Clinton is    the only other president who was below 50% in his first year. All others    were 57% or higher, with six of the 10 presidents elected since World    War II averaging 60% or better in their first year."  &#x200B;  Sad isn't it. Lets get some real LEADERS in office, not these clowns.	That is the OLD Trump which NOONE remembers. The new Trump has been president for 1 term, had mass civil disobedience called BLM which rekt cities while he was President, had covid himself which made him look like an irresponsible weak president. A 1% polling Kamala can call him out on this and without any real support, any real rallies, no media has now polled almost close to Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a 40% candidate who can never win an election - don't lie to yourself he was lucky enough to win in 2016 against a baggaged Hillary. Now Trump is Hillary of the right.	0.868

Because the majority of the modern world is now vaccinated and the majority of vaccines occured nearly a year ago now. How is this hard to understand?  So you have a child I assume now, or close to it. You're ok with a neighbor storing high explosives in their bedroom? No matter the quantity? You know enough to level your house with your wife and child in it? I assume you're not ok with enforcement of drinking and driving laws either.   Boy you must be fun.	<p>I struggle to understand the difference between a covid vaccine and the one you got for chickenpox/shingles, tetanus and whatever else needed to be in elementary school.  Before going to certain countries a shot is required, the military makes you get shots,etc.   Your dog/cat needs shots before interacting with others.

Medical ethics:    1) Informed consent -- the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    3) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    4) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #4 on the list (and there are more than 4 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!

Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it&#39;s a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don&#39;t want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.</p>	0.855
Do vaccines not cause autism? I have some friends whose kids were irreversibly changed mentally only after they took some “vaccines” early in their development.	There are questions and data now about how some vaccines for children can alter their mind and cause some developmental issues even though doctors for years have claimed that they are completely safe. They say that because in the short term there are no apparent issues with it. But do they really take the time to study the true impact of it over the course of a person's life? Absolutely not.

Biden had some foreign experience that Obama lacked, but he was also generally known for his gaffes.   Biden wasn't even on the short list to be Obama's VP.  That's tells you right there he wasn't chosen because he was the best or obvious pick.  And Biden didn't expect it either.     This was all rewritten in the media over the following years to try and recast the Biden pick as the obvious choice and shore up both Obama and Biden.   If you read stories from the last few years, they tell a different story from these written in 2008:  https://www.wkyufm.org/post/obamas-potential-vp-shortlist#stream/0  https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=5615823&page=1	Now let's look at the article. The article picks up this 54,259 number and reports it as ""shocking"" but generally acknowledges that this number is not meaningful. But oh the headline: ""Wisconsin 2020 Election Investigation Finds More Illegal Votes Were Cast Than Biden's Margin of Victory"".  The law firm absolutely did not find that there were this many ""illegal"" votes. They have a section that addresses illegal voting actually, titled ""We found limited instances in which ineligible persons voted or attempted tocast ballots"". Note that they say that people ""attempted"" to vote? They note that 300 people attempted to vote illegally. All but 132 of these were rejected by state officials. 130 of these votes were registered to people whose address were PO Boxes which I guess is illegal in Wisconsin and 2 were from people may be dead.	0.843

It is generally considered a perk of the job that you can park your car wherever and whenever you like in the city with no consequence, contributing massively to the cities congestion. With city employees its bad enough, but when cops do it in their cruisers it creates a sense among the public that cops think they are above the law. It&#39;s a terrible look.</p>	0.793

In the year 2022, yes there is. It's the Republican Party, more specifically the libertarian/constitutionalist faction. They are ones advocating for school choice, police & criminal justice reform, more economic liberty, and a cultural shift back towards intact nuclear families. All things that Black Americans would draw crucial advantages from, even more so than other Americans.  > even voted against MLK, Jr. Day being recognized  So you base your voting decisions on the distant past. Okay. Where exactly do you draw the line? 2010? 1980? Surely somewhere after 1965, right? After all, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party, **and** the pro-Jim Crow party? So how come you don't eschew them for past misdeeds?  I'd argue that the Republican Party has an imperfect, yet infinitely better track record at how the treat Black Americans than the Democrats.

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery but was not an abolitionist in the sense of the abolition movement that was growing in the north.</p>	0.842

The issue that I have is that your choice does effect others.  For each surge that we had, our hospitals were clogged full of unvaccinated people.  We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.     As a physician I know that the current vaccine is still highly effective in keeping people from hospitalization and death.  Hopefully this will give us time for the production of the more effective medication.	<p>COVID numbers are definitely effecting treatment outcomes of even non COVID conditions at the moment. I would definitely suggest to anyone to look at the vaccine which reduces mortality significantly and can help unclog the system. Everyone thinks they will be fine without it until they are not, and it is almost entirely the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised who end up taking up beds in critical care.

There's no use comparing the current situation in Germany to current time USA, they'll keep holding onto their notion that owning guns will prevent anyone with a political or military background from seizing power like with Hitler.   I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past. We should be happy that we can actually step out of our home and not worry about some lunatic with a gun whenever we enter a store, bring our kids to school or being stopped on the road by a police officer.  I don't care whatever kind of response I get by an American by typing this, not if you're fine with the current situation in the USA and not passing gun laws. First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	<p>So, theoretically, if there was a large amount of crimes being committed on public transit by one particular group of individuals, possibly immigrants from a certain region, we are not allowed to know.

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead.   :heart:️Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate :heart:️.

Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.

How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	For example, dems should be outraged at the bill stuffing that happened with the Covid bill. That is dirty politics. Republicans should be outraged at the trump administration dismantling previous administrations accomplishments, that sets us on a course to never progress.	0.917

I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	<p>I do want to make it clear that I have always supported 50 state audits after elections.

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.  I honestly do advocate for state's rights, but some things NEED to be looked at from a top-down view (from fed government) to determine the minimal amount of work needed for the success of the country as a whole.	<p>&quot;masks work but the government needs to ensure frontline workers have an adequate supply.

I don’t know how…but it’s time to fight against the fucked up censorship from places like Facebook and Twitter. Their accusations of misinformation and lies are fucking bullshit and they know it. These piece of shit platforms are one of the two propaganda arms of the DNC (the other being the liberal media) and I’m getting sick of their bullshit.	<p>The issue is sometimes those repercussions take the form of censorship, which is contrary to the open and free discussion required in a civil society. Even worse is the fact that the censorship is handed down by the wishy-washy people who will change their morals more often than they change their underpants. Add in the attention-seeking, destructive tendencies of the mainstream media/Hollywood and it’s a dangerous mix.</p>	0.873
I think the democrats and the CCP are in bed actually. The stuff they push at it’s core is neo-Marxist ideology that bases the oppressor oppressed dichotomy on race and identity instead of by wealth and power like soviets.  Lots of evidence points to China being involved in these politics. China influence TikTok, China owns a ton of our debt and it seems like we’re moving toward censorship and social credit. I’m not willing to take that chance.	<p>As for most dems wanting a blend - at least in the internet arguments I see and pushes from the media, I don’t see that being the case at all. I’m sure the common democrat is that way, but that’s not how the party is skewing. You can’t have the best aspects of capitalism when there’s a constant push for “equity” the way that it is defined today.

Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	<p>But we don&#39;t think that these laws are about security, because what they protect against just doesn&#39;t happen regularly and can be detected in other ways. This whole song and dance is bullshit to sneak in a poll tax. Republican governors will pass stuff like this and then close down all but one DMV location within bus range of a major city. Georgia just closed voting on weekends... when many Black people just so happen to vote. It&#39;s infuriating, and it says to me that you folks aren&#39;t arguing in good faith. You&#39;re passing laws to help you keep power despite the will of the majority of the people. You&#39;re breaking democracy. It&#39;s un-American.

I did read it.   The article was referring to a poll. Doesn't a poll assume that you need to vote on a predefined list of options?   The Guardian didn't refer to a poll. It was just a submission form asking their readers who their person of the year was.   The released a selection of it yesterday and JK Rowling is mentioned: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/guardian-readers-nominate-their-person-of-the-year  Unless there is some evidence that the Guardian actually had a poll and showing who was leading then we can't assume that they pulled because JK Rowling was in the lead.

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	<p>So has heart disease and cancer.  The primary age groups of war deaths is 18-30, with a total over 660,000 for all of our wars. Covid deaths for that same age group is 11,677.  660,000&gt;11,677.  I imagine if 60+ year olds fought all of our wars the death rate for those would be much higher as well.  And to preempt the inevetable &quot;YoU dOn&#39;T cArE aBoUt GrAnDmA&quot;, yes I do, I am just smart enough to know that there is not really a comparison between a healthy and fit 25 year old being killed in combat to an 80 year old grandma at the end of her life being pushed over the edge by covid.</p>	0.831

So ignore those people. The rest of the us populace is fine right? Well 70+ % are overweight or obese, which is an extremely compounding risk factor for a number of reasons. So ignore those people right? Add all of the other chronic conditions that exist in the us and you're left with a small percent of the population that actually doesn't have risk factors for covid.

Get rid of IDs  for voting because minorities are too stupid and poor to get an ID and etc. Democrat policies are always supported by &quot;minorities are stupid and poor.&quot; And somehow their the anti racists.</p>	0.88

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #3 on the list (and there are more than 3 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!        Stand for medical freedom!  Stand for medical ethics!  NO MANDATES!!!!        A) Unvaccinated does not equal infected.    B) Since NONE of the vaccines prevents infection or infecting others, being vaccinated does not equal being safe!	The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

You’re implying that being “fairly intelligent” and @pushing a leftist agend are at odds. I don’t see it that way at all.

You’ll just have to reconcile that one yourself :-)	<p>I also don&#39;t think you can call the Biden coalition a populist movement. The average is better educated and richer than the average Trump voter. Plus populist movements like the Trump movement, at least in their rhetoric, do not ally themselves with big businesses. I&#39;d categorize the current movement within the Democratic party as a reactionary anti-populist movement. While Trumpism is pretty clearly an anti-establishment populist movement.</p>	0.802

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	<p>Even so, im not certain how adding onto what so many people believe is a big problem helps.

I dont understand why people so concern with Ukraine all of a sudden. It's the poorest country in Europe by choice, corruption is the meaning of life over there.  In 1991 when Ukraine gained its independence it had second largest economy in Europe and got sold out and robbed by their own people blaming Russia.  Look at the gains of Poroshenko he multiplied his wealth 18 times during his 4 years presidency.  Let Putin take it back who cares	<p>I guess I’m just more fiscally conservative than most and look at Trump as a failure because he raised the national debt almost as much as Obama despite being in office for 4 less years.</p>	0.854
While these are well known facts, putting them on a picture of Trump just makes us all look like wingnuts. There's no reason for it. He didn't discover these truths, and they were recognized well before he ran for president. Trump is not the future of our party. He is simply too old and a poor communicator.	<p>And that is only one example of how Xiden isn’t the nice, jovial, dude and the polar opposite of Trump the Left packaged him as being during the campaign (and that the media rammed down the public’s throats).  I’m not saying Trump isn’t thin-skinned, egotistical, etc., but this belief that Joe the Puppet is a good guy that’s respectful to others, doesn’t act/react like an angry, arrogant jerkwad?

My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn’t fascistic.   There is a long history of countries - including the US - requiring foreigners who are entering a sovereign nation - to present medical records, including proof of vaccination.   It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you’re keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	<p>EDIT: Forgot to add this, but I understand the argument about already having gotten COVID, but the CDC and doctors and other medical experts have all said that getting vaccinated is still recommended for those who have had COVID. Do you trust your gut instinct that you don’t need the vaccine more than the medical experts?</p>	0.815

Not getting the vax makes me 100% safe from vaccine side effects and death and 99.8% safe from staying alive after Covid infection.	Not only is that vaccine the most cost effective choice, while also providing additional benefits even if you had *actually* been infected with covid. BILLIONS of people have received the vaccine without widespread complications. The materials used in the vaccine are incredibly pure 1) because it risks killing us if it isn't and 2) the process to develop it in a lab requires it to be. There's no mind control plot, there's no plot to give you cancer 50 years down the line, etc.	0.856
But … there was an actual attempted coup …  people brought nooses, weapons and had specific targets in mind. Bashing cops around with fire extinguishers.

If the rules violate the first amendment, than No. The Left started this fight, you seem supprised that there's bleed-over into the right leaning forums.	That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with.

I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court." Biden especially at his age probably has his cabinet taking the reigns moreso than others.  Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.  Unless of course you are saying that simply because he's a democrat, in which case I would ask that you try to be a little more open minded, as the dismissal of others simply due to political affiliation isn't really helping anyone.	Biden replied: ""No, well, I've gotta get the votes. I gotta get the votes. That's why — you know, the one thing that I — I have this strange notion. We are a democracy.

The vaccine has killed more people than the “current strain” don’t buy into the BS if you do their will always be a new strain	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so.

And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.864

If I were you I’d go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.893
Vaccine has nothing to do with whether or not you get covid. Vaccine greatly reduces the incidence of severe symptoms. Symptoms that will put someone out of work.

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn't be further from the truth. It's not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as ""left wing"" as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant.

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>I never get the flu shot. I haven&#39;t had the flu since I was in a kid. I&#39;m not getting the covid vaccine either, I&#39;ve a higher chance of dying from the flu. The long term effect of mrna vaccine are not known. Seems like an easy decision on my part to not get it. The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.894

Alright dick I will. Their executive leadership is incredibly different. Mary Barra has been incredible for them leading them to innovate further and they are at the front foot of the ev movement. They are finding new and creative ways to make money, for example developing their IT structure to innovate software within and sell that software as well. In 2008 and even until the early 2010s they were incredibly stagnant but now they are doing all the can to keep up and get ahead.	<p>I’d encourage you to apply for jobs you’d want to do even if you feel like you’re not qualified.

The right has always claimed those labels, which I think are absolutely meaningless. I don’t think unwavering patriotism is a virtue, it’s just jingoism. The left seeing legitimate faults with the country and wanting to fix them is considered unpatriotic by the right.  What’s patriotic to me is helping the vulnerable. America first? Okay, let’s get everyone healthcare. Let’s get everyone fed and housed. Let’s get everyone educated.  “We just haven't become radicalized.”  Extremely debatable based on a lot of polling recently. What percentage of the right believes in Q or some conspiracy about pedophilic baby-eating dems? What percent believe the election was stolen?	So, to the point of CURRENT systemic racism - my argument is that the current SYSTEM, in and of itself, is not racist and therefore not in need of major reform, as it was in the 50's and 60's, simply because historical injustices are still having effects on people, they are. This shit takes generations to fix, but we're a quick fix society, and if we're not doing ""something"" actively,  we feel bad, so some take that as self-evident truth that our system is still racist.	0.852

I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	It is something that shouldn’t be a problem. For those in public office, taking that risk is ( as I said ) a part of the job but, secret ballot keeps average people from being put under the pressure of that risk.

Im not here to change you mind about anything, buddy. It’s obviously quite set in stone. And that’s okay. You’re entitled to that.   I don’t support what happened in Portland, Kenosha, Charlotte, Atlanta, Ferguson and countless other cities either. All the way back to Watts after the King verdict. That was all bullshit too.   I don’t give a fuck what side you are on. You get to protest. You get your first amendment rights. What you don’t get is the right to destroy property and harm others based on your beliefs or perceived grievances.   That is animal-level behavior, and we should all be above that. Violent antifa mobs…Jan 6 rioters beating cops with flags. All pieces of shit in my book.   Happy new year, pal.

Just give me some actual hard evidence.

People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn’t change the outcome.

You seem like you would fit well in my new sub r/ComplexPeople. I hope plugging subreddits are allowed in this sub…   Anyway, I noticed that you may be conservative leaning since you lurk on this sub, yet aren’t afraid to question the legitimacy of particular things. Not everyone has to agree with everything a political affiliation just says, and it is very important for us to freely state opinions or ask questions regarding particular worldly topics.  r/ComplexPeople promotes the idea that people are complex and are able to share viewpoints from multiple political parties. It promotes free thought and respectful debate or discussion between those who may agree with you and those who do not. Being condescending is not allowed, and members must conduct themselves professionally. The sub is aimed to help rational minded people effectively learn of each others viewpoints and live harmoniously regardless if viewpoints are opposed. If you’re interested in these sentiments, I would love for you to join to help make Reddit and this world a better place!  PS: I apologize for the shameless copy and pasting. I just really do think this new sub can be beneficial for the reddit community.	<p>If your good enough you can pretend to be a conservative (if your normally liberal) and click the links designed to catch [conservatives] attention and once they think they know who you are watch the links they give you and the propaganda you see, its much easier to see the propaganda made for your opposition but once you see their propaganda then you go back to your own echo chambers and see the same exact tactics being used just with different details and reasons. </p>	0.879

See guys the set up..:::they know they’re going to get their ass kicked by the republicans, so if the democrats can’t get election “reform” passed to ensure they can ballot harvest and pull all their shenanigans to steal upcoming elections, they’re already are refusing to recognize the upcoming Republican victory as legitimate. Their media will report that racist voting laws are suppressing minority votes which is why republicans won, so it’s not a legitimate victory…as they sit there and tell us to accept results of 2020 elections and don’t you dare question that. That’s the narrative that play out in r/politics too as those cry babies will share endless propaganda bolstering what I just said.	<p>Also impeachment is going to lead to the exact opposite of the healing Biden called for. That&#39;s why he hasn&#39;t taken a decisive stance. Remember 80% of Republican voters thought the election was unfair. That&#39;s a huge problem for the Dems if they impeach Trump, because that group of the population will just see that as the next, last step in a fraudulent process.</p>	0.908

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years. It's a shame, because I don't see it turning around this time.	<p>Current laws acknowledge that police need the benefit of the doubt legally in order to do their job. Progressives want to start jailing cops any time they make a mistake, and for some bewildering reason ppl in this thread are now anti-police and want these democrat DAs to go after cops and jail them for mistakes too. What&#39;s next, maybe we should just defund and disband all the police depts like progressives want after all? Who cares about surging crime! That&#39;s the logical next step because very few cops would perform the job anyways under the new liability that we are now suggesting they should burden. Already critical police shortage and surging crime rates, yet apparently even some conservatives now jumping on the anti-cop bandwagon trying to strip all of their legal protection and open them up to being jailed for honest mistakes.</p>	0.889

I joined in the Coast Guard and had to be up to date with my vaccines. In fact it is required every year to be up to date. If they can't comply with a direct order for the safety of their unit, community, and themselves then why serve?  Why is the COVID vaccine the hill you die on as opposed to all the other vaccines?	<p>Now let me address you second argument. Yes, doctors and nurses have been tackling covid-19 for over a year now with a vaccine and have gotten by. They didn’t have a choice. Whether for better or worse, they were forced to treat patients  infected with a deadly virus, risking bringing it home with them or spreading it to others in public (becuase PPE’s are not 100% perfect). Now that they have the option to take the vaccine, they have the opportunity to continue delivering patient care in a manner that is SAFER for themselves, their family, other non-covid-19 patients they also see in the hospital. Not taking the vaccine presents an inherent risk to spreading the virus to other people that might not be able to get fully vaccinated or cannot reap the benefits of the vaccine (immunocompromised, cofactors with lung health, age). So with doctors and nurses who are refusing to get the vaccine, not only are they refuting the very science they spent years studying, but they are now also putting others at risk. That is a direct conflict with their responsibilities as health care providers. If you can avoid putting other people at risk but you choose not to for personal reasons, goodbye. Go find another hospital to work at.</p>	0.845

The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.'

Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	<p>Yes there are a myriad of types of contraception. But even that isn&#39;t cut and dry. Doctors continuously deny woman the ability to chose to have their tubes tied. So even if a woman knows she doesn&#39;t want kids she still has to meet some fairly arbitrary prerequisites. Usually a certain age, plus a certain number of kids. We often don&#39;t allow women this choice.

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls.

There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why?

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	<p>I didn’t say you can’t spread the virus asymptotically. But there’s a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place. If viral load drops off quicker and your body clears the virus bc the vaccine kicks in, you’re contagious for a shorter amount of time and you’re not as likely to infect other people. </p>	0.904

You're right in pointing this out. It is, however, the least bad choice in a situation of many bad choices. We accept that their ballots will be inherently less secure because we think the people who have volunteered to fight in our military should not be disenfranchised.

It's literally in the first sentence of the article:  > OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said bringing in the military to deal with protesters who have gridlocked downtown Ottawa is not on the table, and is not something his government would agree to quickly if a request is made.	I don’t condone what occurred, and those who entered the Capital should absolutely be charged with the appropriate charges, but it doesn’t seem like an attack. It seems like a protest that got out of hand combined with a lack of preparation (and likely dismissive projections) by the DC Metropolitan Police, Capital Police, and local authorities.

I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don’t know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn’t tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don’t think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that’s not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don’t know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It’s also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we’ve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn’t be. This is concerning. Perhaps something similar is happening with the heart too, but so far I haven’t seen it.	Alright, so now your company wants you to get a vaccine, the original problem here. Well, as I've shown, testing can't guarantee that you had covid, you don't know if you had covid, and there's a good chance you're part of the 70% that has risk factors for covid.	0.826

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take “global perspectives,” which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn’t have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who’s a minority or has a “unique world view” (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I’m mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn’t speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it’s a threat - including stuff like “global perspectives” classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn’t have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn’t need any video/audio evidence of it and I’m a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	She wasn’t asked whether she stands by her comments **because** they were “anti-communist”. To me (having only read the article and watched the 2 minute video), it seems like the question was brought up specifically in regards to how her comments would effect her relationship with her future opponent, who is from China.	0.798
Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p><em>The United States government shipped an average of approximately 100,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies per week across July and August. The Administration will increase the average weekly pace of shipments of free monoclonal antibody treatment to states by a further 50% in September, continuing to accelerate the federal government’s efforts to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 treatment. Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. As hospital systems experience increased COVID-19 cases, many have identified monoclonal antibody treatment as a key tool to improve health outcomes, prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on overburdened hospitals.</em></p>	0.876

>Trump is getting awfully close to joining Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams in the Sore Election Losers Club.  regardless of the issues with the election, trump whined constantly about it when he clearly lost  i hate biden as much as anybody, but if we want to win back power from the left we have to look at how trump's behavior and attitude put a ton of people off. and look at the left. they can't govern for shit. they have control of everything, are doing what they said they would do, and people absolutely hate their guts for it. all the next guy needs to do is say "we can't run your life better than you can" and stop forcing people to do things and taking their money. enough people in the middle will flock back over and they will lose power. how you end up with another idiot in office is by refusing to look at why trump lost, which is that his style is polarizing and extremely easy for the left to raise support against	<p>Trump was depicted very badly by the media which was partially why he lost. However, he did himself no favor tweeting garbage and saying nonsense. I still remember that first debate with Biden. That turned off a lot of independents voter right off the bat, and him being sick with Covid allowed Biden to opt out of one of the three debates. Biden literally sat in his basement and did not campaign. The Dems would absolutely LOVE to run against Trump. It would make the entire 2024 campaign about Trump (the man/figure) rather than on their far-left policies. </p>	0.912

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.	Liberals judge the book by it's cover. ""Undocumented immigrants that live in the city get to vote, too."" They don't open that book that shows all of the flaws of this logic. It's one of the main problems that liberals have to overcome to recognize that the Democratic party is full of two-faced pieces of shit. Don't get me wrong, politicians from all sides of the aisle are the same, but Democrats and other leftists generally do not think about the consequences of irresponsible fiscal, cultural and political choices. On the surface, all left-leaning policy is well-intentioned, but sadly most politicians use those ""feel good"" talking points to convince people to do things to achieve different goals, such as more control, ballot harvesting, more taxation (therefore more spending on contractors that give kickbacks to politicians).	0.826

Then you will start whining about why the other 20% didn’t get it even though in the real world it is impossible to ever vaccinate 100% of the population	Children that do not have cancer, or some other immuno-compromising condition have NO place getting this vaccine.  It will help in almost NO way to give it to young healthy kids.  99.999% of children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms, or extremely mild symptoms.

So what I don't understand is why is it always the males thinking they are women and compete against real women yet you don't (or rarely) see it the other way around?	<p>That&#39;s like saying men aren&#39;t supposed to have emotions when women clearly are more emotional and shouldn&#39;t try to suppress that tendency to be more like men.

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>When covid first entered the scene and many people said it didn&#39;t worry them because side-effects appeared mild, others chimed in to say that we have to be cautious because we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. Why doesn&#39;t this rationale also apply to the vaccines? You can&#39;t test for something that happens years down the road regardless of how quickly you give it emergency authorization.</p>	0.879

The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

The vaccine doesn't work. If you believe that it does and you're vaccinated, why do you care if other people are unvaccinated? I hate wearing masks.

Why are we still reporting daily cases, why are events being cancelled, and why are people frantically searching for Covid tests? If you feel sick, stay home for a few days and you'll get better.

I&#39;m not getting the covid vaccine either, I&#39;ve a higher chance of dying from the flu. The long term effect of mrna vaccine are not known. Seems like an easy decision on my part to not get it. The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.881

I would agree that some skepticism of the Covid vaccine is understandable given its novelty, but to make a blanket statement that support of vaccines is tantamount to support of tyranny is ludicrous. If there’s any hope to beating the left it’s to be the more rational side of the political spectrum, not to be equally ridiculous but in a different direction.</p>	0.858
When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.88

Every order should be challenged, hampered, and otherwise stalled through the courts.

yes I would, please tell me how voter fraud in this case would be pulled off. polling staff in some county dont notice that 3 times the student population of a university voted and dont carry out an audit? In Belgium there was a case of a cosmic ray giving someone 4096 more votes than she got, what can be called an act of god was discovered and amended no amount of bad guys with fake moustaches and ids can rig an election  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Belgium   first point in the reported problems part	<p>Listen, I honestly couldn&#39;t be less impressed by the voter fraud.  After near 50 lawsuits, the Trump show couldn&#39;t get one case thru a prima facie case.  That doesn&#39;t happen because of a conspiracy. It happens because they have so little evidence, not even a Trump appointed judge was willing to find anything of merit to argue.</p>	0.834

Meanwhile if you were to add up the total amount of deaths through religion, whether it's being a martyr to being persecuted for your religion, it adds up to ~200 million. So by your logic all religion- whether it be Christianity, Catholicism, Islamic, and all other religions are terrible to the point that if you mention God or have a cross on your wall it's akin to heiling Hitler and hanging a swastika on your wall.   We can add up how many people have died for or been killed by America over the course of two world wars in the name of preserving our American capitalistic values and freedoms and guess what that number would be? 100 million. So now again, with your logic, American Capitalistism also falls under the category of being classified as a bad word.   Left or right, y'all are actual troglodytes who care only about the tribal "us vs them" mentality and will twist your reality, stats, and logic to appease your sensibilities. Everyone wants to call each other a snowflake in the midst of a blizzard.	But the point is, the praise from the left and the utter hypocrisy. If you reverse the political parties, and he'll, even remove the damn gorilla mask they'd still call it a racist attack, there'd be 200 articles written about how Republicans and conservatives are the party of racism.	0.859
I don't like the law. Absolutely should not have passed in the "bipartisan infrastructure bill." I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all. The technology has to be developed and deemed viable before it takes effect anyway, and if not by a certain date, an explanation as to why it's unfeasible has to be given.     Louis Rossmann did a good job explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg)     Just because we understand the lunacy of the left doesn't mean we should be careless in our criticism of them. Pursue excellence.	<p>I&#39;m not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

Biden said if you take the vax you will not catch the chinaWuhan19 virus.  He Lied!	<p>But I really don’t think it’s related to the case we’re talking about.

Vaccine efficacy of less than 100% doesn't mean vaccines are failing.   The serious side effects and death linked directly to a vaccine are extremely rare and are being studied to future cases. They are nowhere near the frequency MTG claimed.   Roughly 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have died from covid.	We're in a pandemic and you're not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It's not ideal when anyone—much less a child—has to spend time in the ICU, but I don't think there's been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.	0.886
And it's paid for by the administration farts in all corporations that sit up there collection ridiculous amounts of wealth.

Use the “climate crisis” as a means to garner more control. They hate nuclear because it can actually solve fossil fuel dependency. So they get rid of it because they need to keep the crisis going. Climate change fear mongering is a means for authoritarianism.	This is exactly the point and takes the argument away from liberals that if you’re against the mandate you *must* be anti-vaxx and/or science denying. Mandates are implemented to force compliance and have repercussions. The mandate isn’t saving ppl, the vaccine is. Slapping a mandate on it only allows the government to punish non-compliance.	0.87

Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.	<p>Since you are concerned with 41,000 deaths a year from 2nd hand smoke then why wouldn’t you be for Covid? CDC records for the past two years show in excess of 200K deaths due to Covid or presumed Covid. If we assume a conservative number out of those are real and use, say, only 30% out of that then we still have a higher death rate than 2nd hand smoke. So again, if you are indeed concerned with 2nd hand smoke, then why wouldn’t you be concerned about Covid? </p>	0.868

As was Mitch McConnell technically, but being politicians they're not actually actively involved with the day to day operations of the capital police. It's just a formal position.

Pointing out your willful ignorance doesn't make them a troll.	It is something that shouldn’t be a problem.

No my friend. It's tough living in a bible thumping red state when you're surrounded by hypocrites constantly. I'm worn out from so many people around me living their life as "do as I say not as I do". So many conservative veterans are out voluntarily ruining their lives for a rich kid who dodged the military but feels like he's a leader. For goodness sake Fox News won a definition case simply by claiming Tucker Carlson never states actual facts and is instead engaging in ' exaggeration ' and non literal commentary. It's exhausting the amount of lies and misinformation that is killing friends around me.	It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.

This is a bad bill and sad to see such support in the comments.  Paternity can't be proven at conception. So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.  This is going to be abused to hell and back, with seemingly no course for action for when the wrong man is held accountable.   A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.   Smart policy needs to incentivize parents to stay together.	<p>Teachers unions are even worse yet, because the needs of the children are diametrically opposed to what the union wants.

And guess what? **it's a virus that we have (had) a vaccine for. ** It's miraculous that we could have developed it so quickly, but that's what happens when there's money to be made (capitalism) and the whole human populace is facing the same challenge.	0.835

Why would you have *fixations* on women? Is it because you're only used to dealing with people online, and actual human contact is difficult for you?	Smartphones, with social media or without, are addictive and when used constantly are not healthy for the human psyche. We need to be engaged in something productive or else we get pretty depressed, and allowing a piece of technology to consume so much of your time will ultimately make you only feel good when you're using it. Social media exacerbates this because it tends to make people believe it counts for social interaction AND it teaches people to base their entire self worth on what peoples crudest opinions are of them. People, and this does not only apply to children, will post the fakest version of themselves online in hopes that they are recognized for it and if it is received poorly they take it personally and if it gets a lot of likes they still know that it wasn't a truthful representation of themselves so they begin to hate their true self because they aren't this image that they created.

The truth that’s too difficult for you to swallow is that her voters are the reason the country is in decline along with Trump voters being the reason our country is in decline. We have horrible leaders because we have horrible systems. We have horrible systems because we’re too busy destroying ourselves than uniting ourselves to create a clear and concise consensus on reforming our painfully obviously broken systems.	The problem with shitty Democrat policies is if one state refuses them, that state will do very well and make the others look foolish. Desantis did this with lockdowns and school closures, which threw off their plans across the country as other states followed suit. The Democrats are still reeling from that, which is why their policy messages seem so confused right now.	0.901

And while I think his mind will be fine, I think the man should just rest and enjoy his retirement. The man spent decades working long hours. His cumulative time spent sleeping over the course of his life is probably lower than that of many people half his age. He&#39;s in his 70s. He was cheated out of a second term, even setting aside the questionable election results. (The Democrat weaponization of COVID was very much real (in terms of the fear, not a bioweapon, so shut up lefties) and that all gets used as fake talking points to pretend his policies led to many of the issues we saw, ignoring the glaringly obvious context of a pandemic.)

Silencing your freedom of speech does not equal communism. Authoritarianism is not communism.	By communism they don't mean communism, because they don't know what it is. What they actually mean historically is bolshevism, the right-wing precursor to totalitarianism that developed in the Soviet Union. The US had a major attack on labor earlier in the last century and anti-labor oriented US business and political interests attacked supporters of labor/workers as being communists by associating people advocating for more democracy, better labor standards, equality, unions as advocates for the brutality of the Russian state, and wanting to bring that to America.	0.887
Yeah I think I’d agree with you, but from the article the data is anonymous and is in a black box type of situation, so you still have control over it (just like you would any other piece of your property, until the police could take it in the course of an investigation, or you handed it over to aid them).

I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	<p>A position of reason and reasonable tolerance is the best counterargument against this sort of absurdity.  Let adult folks have these surgeries if they want to and doctors are willing; don’t ever pay for them with tax dollars, etc, but more obviously don’t do something really, profoundly dumb like put someone who, whatever “gender” they may claim is a fertile biological male human with a female bunkmate.

No the best plan is to retake the House and Senate and let sleepy Joe sleep the next 3 years.	<p>This is why she&#39;s freaking out:  she expected to be President after Jan 20, 2023 so she could be in office until Jan 20, 2033. But that&#39;s not going to happen with the decline he&#39;s showing.  There&#39;s no way he&#39;s going to last another four months let alone seventeen.

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election. They vastly expanded the number of mail in ballots while decreasing the ability to verify they were sent in legally. In states that are decided by only a few thousand votes, that level of uncertainty is very disturbing.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots. If you couldn't or can't see and acknowledge that fact that was noted even before the election occurred, then your reaction to this issue is obviously based purely on the election results and your feelings about them.	0.859

The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	<p>I wonder if this is because these vaccines give protection against specifically the Spike protein that does the binding to the ACE2 receptors -- it drives evolution in a direction for this virus to develop adaptations by mutations in regions of the genome that are not the Spike protein, leading to a high propensity for a mutation to develop that evades protection. If these vaccines are specifically designed to target that particular protein they can later down the line be non-effective. I am unsure if these effects for protection waning are because of the evolutionary issue I just posited above or because they really do wear off in the body. </p>	0.85

It is going into a few pockets mainly. This is the problem with how our system works. We permit companies to bid on projects and then the government selects a winner and pays them the agreed contract rate. We end up with companies charging millions of dollars to do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work, and then, we run out of money before we can possibly maintain everything properly.	The usd is worth what? 1% of what it was at its inception due to the governments response to every previous crisis, central bank policy attempting to kick the can down the road and make budget balancing the next administration (or the next generations) problem.

There has never been a sterilizing vaccine. Not even smallpox was sterilizing for all ppl, and certainly didn't last for a lifetime.   Instead it takes a good enough vaccine, taken by enough people, combined with other measures, to suppress the spread of a disease (what we did with snallpox). Until Omicron, the mRNA vaccines were good enough for that and they still provide protection against Omicron.	Children that do not have cancer, or some other immuno-compromising condition have NO place getting this vaccine.  It will help in almost NO way to give it to young healthy kids.  99.999% of children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms, or extremely mild symptoms.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.

Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it's a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don't want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.	0.857

Maybe I should rephrase this: the government sponsored a program that loaners promised would guarantee success to a lot of vulnerable people, and is causing a significant portion of younger generations to have a much lower percentage of wealth.

You were the one who mentioned that our government is in debt and said taxing the rich more would help the government, implying that it would help alleviate some of our debt.

It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane. Let me guess, you’d welcome treating the common flu like we currently treat COVID, right?</p>	0.902

Expect act 77 was passed by general assembly and signed into law and not by executive fiat as you say. And it expanded and protected voting rights, not narrowed them like a poll tax would. Doesn’t the ideal democratic republic have every single eligible cast a vote.

And all this is ignoring the fact that this ruling will likely be overturned in time and the law probably will stand.	<p>I’ve never met a republican who wants to get rid of that pesky black vote, and yet if you listen to democrats, you’d think every one of us is clamoring to disenfranchise anyone with dark skin.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.  Plain and simple.	<p>The question of morality and whether you are pro choice or pro life really just comes down to whether or not you believe that abortion is murder.  Everyone views murder as bad.  Pro choice people just don&#39;t see abortion as murder, at least not before the point of viability.

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  “Among 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.”  So, there’s at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it’s symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	<p>I do think the matter of comorbity is being glossed over by most organisations: of the family members of mine who were diagnosed with covid, a vast majority of them were fine and had mild flu-like symptoms, and two with obvious comorbidities (tuberculosis and some manner of cardiac disease)  died very quickly after contracting it. It seems to me that the virus fast-tracks existing conditions which would have a strong chance of killing the person within a matter of years anyway. Most healthy people would probably be completely fine.</p>	0.841

Trump lied about the severity of the virus and said it would magically go away, he peddled ineffective drugs and harmful home remedies, and blamed everyone else he could. He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines. Everyone here says that the reason the US had so much trouble containing the outbreak is because of our land borders, and this is 100x more of an issue with state borders, except those can’t be locked down</p>	0.855

It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you’d look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.	So while I’m morally opposed to late term abortion unless the health of the mother is at risk I’m pretty meh about it in the first trimester.  It definitely gets murkier in cases where you have a completely non viable fetus.	0.89
> Four people were burned to death.  irrelevant unless this man intended that they should die by burning to death. such detail is intended to excite a thrust for retaliatory blood and anyone that acts on that information in that way would be more guilty of violence than the man in the truck.   in the heat of the moment, many people would try to run from the scene without even being aware of their actions including people you love and respect. if you don't understand that, i suggest you study psychology research circa urgent autonomic responses (fight, flight, or freeze). i would be more concerned if he showed no emotion, that would be a kind of indicator that he meant to do what he did and is likely to do so again. running is a sign that he knew he made a grave mistake and he feared the consequences. he's no saint but it doesn't seem to me that anyone is better off if he spends the rest of his life in prison.	<p>We murder people all the time.

Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	<p>With abortions, people who should not be parents such as women who’s baby father walked out, are poor, or don’t have the proper support systems are advocating for abortions but the conservatives are blocking that. If people had access to abortions then maybe these kids won’t have to be born into societies where becoming a menace is their only option. </p>	0.869

This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.   And idk what you mean by massively devaluing college degrees... Just by forgiving loans doesn't mean the education is worth any less.	<p>Now they lie to the audience. Suppress information. They lied to and tricked the least knowledgeable voting group in the country with emotional warfare. They don&#39;t use facts. They can&#39;t even define the systematic racism they proclaim. They can&#39;t define &quot;white rage&quot; they just throw it out there like an emotional grenade and inexperienced people take it as the truth. The young people trust them. They told people they were going to pay off their student loans lol. They lied about that and it was an obvious lie but young people are too inexperienced to know that. Now there&#39;s no accountability for their obvious lie. I Just hope and pray the corrupt Democrat party have permanently lost their trust. </p>	0.907

The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable. Yet...I'm still nervous about November.	<p>We game him his chance and he blew it. I wanted for him to be successful and I even approved of several things he did. It was when times got tough where he cracked under pressure though. If he worked as hard at being president as he did at hating the left, then maybe he would have been re-elected. I&#39;ll have a hard time voting Republican ever again if they continue to try and push the Trump agenda or have anyone remotely like him running for President.</p>	0.867
Did you support the cancelation of the Dixie Chicks in the early 2000's by Republicans? Did you support the attempted cancelation of "inappropriate rap music" by the conservatives in the 80's and 90's, which went all the way to the Supreme Court? Did you support or oppose the cancel culture campaigns of the "Moral majority" under the Falwell's?	<p>Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional &quot;party switch,&quot; but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn&#39;t want to follow.

1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	<p>The left&#39;s position rationalizes outright infanticide and if you listen to abortion supporters some of them are straight out infanticidal.  To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.  Now maybe a society comes about that there&#39;s no point in maintaining an &quot;unwanted life&quot; but that gets really screwy and it goes against human nature in that in nature you needed more people generally due to strong death rates in the natural world.</p>	0.879

The problem is, the high skill & high wage jobs are like this.     ***"Specialization in a trade that is in high demand will yield superior wages."***     ***That's the biggest lie you probably tell yourself.*** A masters plumber should make 25-35$+/hour, but they can barely make more than an apprentice at ***<20$. Maybe above 12$/hour if they are lucky.***     A mechanic won't make more than a beginner mechanic unless they can snipe the good paying job from the couple lead mechanic positions in an autobody shop.      Even college kids, and trade skillers who spent 5-10 years training, and learning aren't guaranteed a decent paying job with a decent workplace.     A computer technician, programmer, etc needs a bachelors, and 2-5 years of experience just to get started in the field. **OR** they could go the apprenticeship route, and make less than minimum wage for 2-5 years just to get the experience needed, and even then they aren't guaranteed the job they need to put food on the table for one.     With Inflation, jobs paying <20 for unskilled labor even when said labor can lead to 5day 9hour work weeks where you break your back to just live.     You need a minimum of 20-25$/hour just to live beyond eating well everyday, and paying utilities.     \---     You can't make it well for yourself in todays economy. It's not an Obama, Trump, or Biden thing. It's a 60,70s, and 80s problem that caused this. It is not a republican, or democrat problem. It's an American problem.     ***Minimum Wage needs to be 25-30 dollars just to live, and anything less than 45$/hour you need to work 30-40 hours/week, 60+ years of your life, then you can retire.***     Yes, this is America & you could make something of it.

You won't be able to cause you're making 20-25$/hour just to make ends meet by yourself.	<p>just simply put the best people in a given job. it&#39;s not hard to imagine the top 20% of women outperforming some of the men, so give them those jobs instead of people that can&#39;t stand toe to toe with them. unfortunately, the administration isn&#39;t trying to get the best candidates into jobs, they&#39;re trying to say everyone is equal even when they&#39;re not.</p>	0.84

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.  It will act the way it does, and the results will follow.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.913

Please damn how many small pox breakthrough cases we have per day?   Please let me know how many breakthrough cases per day do we have for hepatitis A? For hepatitis B? For the polio vaccine?  Absolutely none of these vaccines stop you from getting infected! If you get infected whether you’re vaccinated or not you can infect other people! And I’m so tired of the outright bullshit no vaccine is 100% effective. But what do you expect for vaccines that were rushed to the market with the absolute minimum of castings were one of the major manufacturers is actually trying to hide their trial data! We’re Project Veritas is uncovered Pfizer employees admitting that they did not use proper technique for the chess. What do you expect? When is such a garbage show we are only getting one side of the information and you have people like you gullible believing what the media sharing. I can’t help it.	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.882

Sweetheart, don't hurt yourself too much tripping over your propaganda. Democrats would love nothing more than print at home ballots and drop boxes. Voting rights for illegals and maybe let's just throw online voting. You're pathetic because you've been so brainwashed to think that you're so virtuous that you think we are the ones outside the circle. Save me the propaganda, I wasn't born in the us. Your scumbag gov tried the same color revolution on my country twice. I know exactly what's happening, perhaps YOU'RE the snowflake here with your hurt feelings and constantly having to worry about what next big corrupt thing your party will be guilty of next. Just because the corporate media isn't broadcasting the truth, doesn't give you the excuse to be stupid.	<p>People will blame corporate Democrats for pretending to pass the “progressive” agenda but scuttling it at the last moment.  However, I blame White House incompetence.  Everything this particular administration attempts ends up like rotten meat that fell behind a freezer.  And they then blame Trump.  CNN and MSNBC try to help the administration out by calling everyone white supremacists even when race isn’t involved.

It strikes me as very overbearing and paternalistic to just come in and decree that this and that province should be independent, when a majority of people actually living there would probably gladly vote to remain in China, when push comes to shove.

I agree about the tried and true vaccines. I do not understand the anti-vax stand on this at all. But COVID is a different case altogether.

You would rather take a brand new unproven vaccine with unknown possible long-term side effects <em>and</em> still have a chance to get Covid and still suffer side effects from that, although (supposedly) less than what you would get if you weren&#39;t vaccinated than to take your chances of never getting Covid at all and never having to deal with any side effects from either?</p>	0.908

While I agree with you on some of that (the dems have lost their minds). Republicans have made plenty of errors as well. We allowed for a mass citizen surveillance program under Bush Jr's watch (thanks Dick Cheney). We allowed a good men (Edward Snowden and Julian Assange) to be banished for bringing the crimes to light (including Clinton's email server crimes). I don't see any republican's stepping up and welcoming this man and Assange back into the country. These men deserve a statue in DC.	<p>In this case, Arbery probably wasn’t an angel, but considering he was murdered by 3 people that the media are trying to paint as typical conservatives with the right’s full support, it’s a good thing to state support for Arbery. Hell there are plenty of republican politicians that have committed a crime in the past and then had conservative support when running against a democrat in an election (same goes for dems supporting criminals sometimes). I think it’s so dumb to apply purity tests to everyone - supporting George Washington doesn’t mean you agree with his record of slave holding.</p>	0.887

Doesn't matter because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the far left. Therefore, it espouses far left policies. That's why I expect a Republican landslide this November. I'm actually an Independent, but the Democrats have swung so far to the left that I can longer support any of them.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.
