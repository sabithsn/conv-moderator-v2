You're the one who took it to the extreme by saying things like " no one is below redemption " and " no one is truly bad"  and I doubt you could teach me anything considering you're sophomoric attempt at philosophy. Inability to use the correct spelling of words. And failure to distinguish between optimistic and pessemistic. Your argument and original post are based on absolutely nothing but semantics and your own arbitrary views and definitions  of morality and redemption.   I no longer wish to continue discussing anything with someone who would be blatantly intellectually dishonest and say such disgusting things may God have mercy on whatever remains of your soul.	There is no reply you can give to disprove it. You can ask ""Why is it immoral"" but nothing about morality requires legitimate reasoning. You can only ever argue the reasoning used to reach a moral conclusion is illogical, it's impossible to argue the conclusion itself is wrong. That's what makes it a subjective matter. Do you not see how these things are different?"	0.923

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying ‚ÄúI have short hair, I wear ‚Äúmasculine clothing‚Äù, I don‚Äôt like makeup etc, but I‚Äôm still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood‚Äù people are saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a woman because I don‚Äôt follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)‚Äù. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	The logical conclusion of your ""we need to be breaking down stereotypes"" logic is that ""the rules"" should be just as strictly enforced, except, opposite. Wearing women's clothes because you are a woman and want to dress like a woman is bad and reinforcing stereotypes. Presumably, just as much for cis- as well as trans women. So the only people who should dress like women are men, who ought to do it not to feel like women, but to feel no particular way at all, I guess. Therefore the only ""correct"" way to dress is as the opposite gender that you identify as, but not because you associate those items with the opposite gender, that would be bad."	0.92

But you are struggling with reading comprehension. Expecting someone to take off their pants so you can fuck them, is not as bad as asking them to pay. You are comparing apples to grenades.	You're still comparing apples to oranges. The people in the wiki like are victims of a cultural practice where the perpetrators are getting away with it, because it's not a ""crime"". Whereas you're likely not getting away with genital mutilation in the U.S. are you?

I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	<li><p>even if they did do it the way they did to help small states, there&#39;s a big difference between that, and saying this was a big part of the electoral college&#39;s design.  People talk about this like the whole point of the electoral college is to help the small states; but even if you think the founders thought about that, they clearly had bigger fish to fry in designing the system.</p></li>	0.81

I feel like a lot of people that don‚Äôt support legalization on here haven‚Äôt seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I‚Äôve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI‚Äôs increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I‚Äôm not denying there aren‚Äôt withdrawal symptoms of weed, I‚Äôve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I‚Äôm not saying people can‚Äôt get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôs even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI‚Äôs increasing, this also shouldn‚Äôt be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it‚Äôs still legalized and there are people that aren‚Äôt using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I‚Äôm reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It‚Äôs literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>I hate that &quot;recreational drug use&quot; exists. I&#39;ve literally only ever had caffeine and alcohol myself, and I genuinely worry what will happen if I ever end up in hospital and get over medicated. But without recreational use of drugs and people prepared to experiment through history, many of the medical use drugs we have now would never have been discovered. </p>	0.889

Failures in human memory are one thing, intentional malice is another. She lied about him being 100% the one responsible. She lied about him in her book. She lied about him having a record.

The phrase "gender identity" might be somewhat recent, but we have data about people identifying with various genders that dates well over a thousand years.

It is reasonable to continue the conversation without pretending as if the wrong transphobic bullshit you write was true.	<p>In another couple decades, most of these divides will appear just as antiquated and silly as that. This does not mean that half of the country opposing interracial marriage was no big deal. Obviously it was a symptom of centuries of horrific racism.

In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you‚Äôve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn‚Äôt deserve it, you shouldn‚Äôt have been subject to it, and it shouldn‚Äôt have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you‚Äôve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.

Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options. [Here's](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) a page (with a link to the original study) that shows 90% of women would reject a 5'4" guy for his height. [This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	<p>Indeed, <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-0939-z?wt_mc=Affiliate.CommissionJunction.3.EPR1089.DeepLink"">this study</a> finds that heterosexual women are much less likely to orgasm during sex with men (only 65% of the time) - whereas for straight men it&#39;s 95%, gay men (89%), bisexual men (88%), lesbian women (86%), bisexual women (66%).</p>	0.83

Elon Musk isn‚Äôt just a hero. Elon is a superhero with the power to [regrow hair](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81958dc03744abb8e999974a79d03845-lq) in mere hours.

The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.	<p>It doesn&#39;t.  Loads of straight men have sex with other men.  Loads of gay men only have sex with women.  Statistically, of course, gay men are more likely than straight men to have only sex with men and less likely than straight men to have only sex with women.  But having sex is a choice.  Sexual orientation isn&#39;t.</p>	0.901

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society). Sure, gender might be important to you, but what will that bring in the end. Ask yourself that.	<p>I feel like this is under-estimated when discussing attraction and intimacy between cis and trans people. It may not be true in all cases, but I&#39;d say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a <strong>subconscious</strong> role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don&#39;t think people are actively saying ‚ÄúI could never date someone who was infertile!‚Äù ‚Äî rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it&#39;s true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it&#39;s rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it&#39;s immediately a given for trans women.</p>	0.862

Don't have to, it is irrelevant. He is a troll who took another identity and posted under a fake name and then pretended he was a victim. By almost every policy and convention, trolling is forbidden.   Do not feed the trolls because they will just go into other forums and troll those forums as well.	Like, I'm sorry, but communities _are allowed to have rules_. I've been banned from lots of forums, largely for breaking their rules, and you know what? I may think that those rules are bullshit (if you're going to allow fascists to blatantly and repeatedly lie in bad faith but will punish anyone who points out this dynamic, _your rules are bullshit_), but it was not a violation of my free speech, any more than it would have been if I had been banned for posting gore and shock images in every thread.

Of course some people are going to feel left out if i say ‚Äúwe need to cure cancer‚Äù and respond with ‚Äúwell what about X disease??‚Äù, but that‚Äôs a risk you gotta take because otherwise you box yourself into a corner of just saying‚Ä¶nothing</p>	0.869

Of course the sloganeering would have you believe that all rape victims have the latter experience, which is silly, but it's equally silly to say that none of them do. Though slogans, by necessity of needing to be short, do tend to oversimplify situations. That doesn't make the slogans right, but it doesn't make them wrong, either. Usually people aren't out sloganeering if there isn't or hasn't been some sort of genuine problem to some degree. The polarization is where things get really problematic. Doubt one accuser or even just want to have her story double checked, and you get accused of claiming that no rapes are real."	0.873

And I don&#39;t blame it for upsetting you, you have a right to feel your anger over this situation.

Or is this on a different sort of principle? A principle of honor that your father might not even share with you. Regardless, you can&#39;t know for certain if this is something born of your own hate or if it is something born of your father&#39;s will. Either way, I can see how this is holding you down. The injustice here is how much its locked you up in your own feelings and I can empathize with that more than you might realize. </p>	0.871
No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can‚Äôt really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He‚Äôs not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn‚Äôt been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos‚Äôs BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don‚Äôt even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of ‚Äúif I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit‚Äù. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre old and should die‚Äù and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he‚Äôs going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of ‚Äúrichest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone‚Äù	So what you're doing is saying that the team below Musk did all the technical/manual work so Musk deserves none of the credit. This truly isn't fair to Musk or anyone who's started/managed the company. Supposedly he's been somewhat involved in the actual design of the rockets but for the sake of the argument, lets assume that he has 0 contribution. Musk's largest contributions aren't technical. That doesn't mean his contributions aren't significant or Meaningful.	0.887

CMV: Student debt shouldn't be cancelled. I was making 60k a year out of school with 50k of loan.

Elon Musk sold off a lot of Tesla stock in the days before Tesla recalled nearly a half million cars. If that‚Äôs not the hallmark of a hero, I don‚Äôt know what is.   Edit: *insider trading* autocorrected to *a hero*	<p>It seems to me you still don&#39;t understand how stocks work either. Admittedly, plenty of people <em>buying</em> stocks have the same misunderstanding which leads to many bad investments. Tesla <em>produces</em> things which have value. When you buy Tesla stock you own a portion of the capital and assets belonging to Tesla which are used to generate revenue. You are entitled to a portion of it&#39;s profits/retained earnings. If the price of a stock I bought drops I care only in so much as it represents a drop in the value of the company I own. If I own a company and the price drops because nobody else wants to buy it but it still produces goods and generates revenue and I feel it will continue to do so, I do not give a damn about the price. </p>	0.82
A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	In terms of the police, they are human. People make mistakes. Police are ridiculed, insulted and they are quitting in high numbers. Those three days of riots had every cop working almost 24/7. They had a precinct burned down by protestors and they had objects thrown at them such as bricks, pee and bottles. I do believe in reform, but abolishing is a dumb idea with no plan, which puts a bunch of elected politicians with no experience in charge.

All you had to do is not be racist against white people, but it was too much to ask.  Thanks for proving my point though.  How about we compromise again, "I will join the rest of my superior race in being the only ones held accountable for racism, taking solace that you're content with the perpetual low expectations of non-whites"?	Therefore I am also sympathetic to the view on the left that racism towards white people, and sexism towards men, just isn't the same because there is no element of oppression. And I am sympathetic to the argument that we should reserve the words ""racism"" and ""sexism"" to specifically talk about oppression.

The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	<p>Also, isn&#39;t it capitalism that supports slavery? I think we both agree that sweatshops are basic child slavery?

> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	Then write this to the OP of the CMV article? I don't think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn't be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can't even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc."	0.883

It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary.

Again, I've supported my arguments and made counters. If you want me to go into more detail. DM me in a respectful way or go to hell. But I'm not engaging with bad faith actors.	You mention politely convincing with the Socratic method. Logical extreme: I am polite I am respectfully asking questions , but I have no interest in changing my own opinion. My curiosity is not to find a deeper truth so I can see what you see (even if we choose to disagree) and you can see what I see, etc, I‚Äôm just continuing to search for what will make you agree with me. Now I feel I‚Äôm arguing in good faith, I‚Äôm polite. You accuse me of sealioning. You aren‚Äôt wrong, but I feel like you are just using the word to dismiss my quite frankly watertight case. Did you not realise how good I am at showing the flaws in your reasoning? Sure I‚Äôve been called out as ‚Äúsealioning‚Äù before, but that guy was definitely using the term in bad faith as I was merely inquiring as to some of the subtler details of his initial proposal when he tried to shutdown my line of questioning with an irrational accusation of ‚Äúsealioning‚Äù. And so it is that you accuse me of sealioning or rather you think about calling me out on it, but you don‚Äôt want to use the term, because you‚Äôve seen it used in bad faith and you have to admit I stayed calm and politely asked my questions, politely reframed your answers because you were so obviously wrong and I didn‚Äôt have to give any ground because you were so much less right than me and that is why you eventually let it drop because you realised I had bested you in the ancient art of debate and that is how you let me think I had changed your mind to my bigoted racist opinion... for shame... you disgust me."	0.872

I didn‚Äôt mean art per say, but arts degrees (could be bachelor of dance, or bachelor of music, or gender studies).

What a load of propaganda.   ‚ÄòIsrael is the only democracy‚Ä¶. Bla bla bla‚Ä¶.‚Äô  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.

The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‚ÄòJews escaping bla bla bla‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äô this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‚Äòjews as victims‚Äô justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‚Äòwhataboutism‚Äô for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago‚Ä¶.  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.

I realized I know almost no one who had stories of police making a situation better. It doesn‚Äôt take too many people getting killed by police before people think you‚Äôre a horrible person if you call the police. The War on Drugs was racist from the very start and everyone knew rich white people never got in trouble for drugs and cannabis was an excuse to harass and arrest Black people at will. </p>	0.898

It‚Äôs pretty easy to understand. Everyone has grasped it.  But you do you bro. You wanna get fucked? You go get fucked. Or whatever you want to call it.	It's easy to call people phobic this and phobic that if you simply decide you define them that way no matter what."	0.827

You can't go around and say frueds false theories are "beliefs" now you moron. Holy shit, I've never meet someone who fucking defends freud.  Go around to any women and ask them if they have penis eny you biggot.	<p>But people use the ‚Äúwell if we can‚Äôt prove with 100% irrefutable logic <em>exactly</em> where the line is, we can‚Äôt draw it at all‚Äù to keep us from talking about the fact that there‚Äôs an unbelievable number of assholes who do not give a shit whether the woman actually wants to engage in sexual activities, and i find it all infuriating</p>	0.849

>And now you're changing the subject to   >   >individuals   >   >finding it important.  You need better reading comprehension. I am simply pointing out that gender has always been separate from sex. The fact that gender stereotypes are about gender is simply a tautology.  >You haven't presented any argument for what I have written being "factually false bullshit",  I have, you are simply unable to parse them because of your transphobia. I do not believe in respectability politics where you see a bigot being a bigot (like you) but you cannot call them a bigot (which you are). We need to be able to use words appropriately to be able to communicate - for example, it is appropriate to say that you are a transphobic bigot. If you don't want to be called a transphobic bigot, you should stop being transphobic and bigoted.	I dont really believe in objective morality. It doesn't really exist, so I couldn't care less for what someone considers to be ""bad values"". I find it ironic that you strongly reconciling a discussion on  morality with evidence. There is no real evidence of objective or universal morality. How do I know someone doesn't just consider trans people to be exhibiting bad morality just because they are grossed out by trans people or insecure about their own gender/sexuality? I think for this discussion to be meaningful, morality needs to be largely removed from the conversation.	0.92

And as we later established the word ‚Äúbacked‚Äù in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren‚Äôt willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid. Not sure we have anything left to discuss here.	I am often told that I must change my ontology because it hurts some people's feelings.  But I am incapable of changing it for that reason.  I can only change it if I am persuaded by logical argument that my ontology is incorrect.	0.913

'Crackers' were Scottish people who settled down in the Southeast United States. They were seen as poor and low class, even as someone a black slave could look down on.  'Cracker' is a racist slur.	I don't think I agree with that at all.  My point was that systemic racism is a system of keeping poor people down and just blaming the poor for their own problems.  This falls disproportionately on black people because of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.  Was that not clear in my post?"	0.831
You know, multiple people have told me this and I still don't see why. Pitbulls have killed hundreds of people and injured many thousands, golden retrievers have not. Plain and simple, dumbass.	<p>And killing isn&#39;t always a morally bad thing. Most humans kill billions upon billions of living creatures every day, and most of us don&#39;t think of that as morally reprehensible.</p>	0.849

>the implication is black people can't look up to and admire white heroes or vice versa.  And it's not like there aren't already a ton of prominent black superheros or anything. The Green Lantern (John Stewart) is probably one of my favorite DC superheroes.	So yes, while I do think recasting Black Panther would be nice, I don't think it's necessary for either of your two main issues. Marvel Studios has a lot of creative independence from the source material, and they could easily work around the unfortunate death of Chadwick Boseman to create additional black male superheroes."	0.831
