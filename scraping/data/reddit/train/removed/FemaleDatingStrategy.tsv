I like how he confirms that men lack common sense and social skills by telling them how to do the absolute obvious when you are meeting someone via social media.  Male IQ is in hell LMAO.	Absolutely agree with your observations!  Everyone who encourages sex work likes to pretend the men are neutral consumers with no risk profile, but in fact, these men are bottom of the barrel, defective, abusive creeps.	0.815
A walk is not a date, I agree. But I'm not taking a girl on a date before I've seen her in real life. The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	Don't say walks aren't dates, they'll waste your time and start explaining why it's such a great idea. Just say, I don't do walk dates. If they start probing and asking why, just block. Any man who thinks a walk date is a good first date is not worth dating, you'll always have to nudge them in the right direction.	0.851

I've been reading it too and it's amazing! Especially that you can find out many celebrities and people in your life who use those laws.   One of my favourite laws is conceal your intentions and I think you can apply it to FDS. It's better to not be open and direct about your FDS ideology and feminist beliefs. Sharing them and showing off how you don't need any men can be dangerous. People don't like being called out on their misogyny and LVM and pickmes will try to show you "your place".	It sucks, but it happens. An alt really is the only solution. As the other ladies have said, a lot of subs **require** a very watered down version of feminism because they are ran by men who obviously do not like getting their feelings hurt at the truth üòî and with FDS in your history it's just an easy target to hopefully dismiss you before other women look too hard at it.   I've actually had success saying the exact same things I feel on my main, but ultimately I'm not sure it makes a difference. I think a lot of women are waking up to the collective gaslighting we get on here and are pushing back because I've seen it a lot more frequently, but with men in charge they just do their best to bury it.	0.871
This is literally everything we hate at FDS.  I just looooove the menz!  I‚Äôm not like those other girlzzzzz!  Tee hee!  Have you thought maybe those men are nice mainly because they want to fuck you?	Men are so gross! His hobby is... having sex? Why? I would throw up at his questions and just hate the way he uses IG. But I understand that women just think "man is giving me attention, must give attention back". It's just sad when you see the process behind it. He's completely vapid, completely devoid of substance. We want to assume the best in people and think there must be something inside their head, but there's just nothing.	0.914
You sweet summer child, didn‚Äôt your mom ever teach you that there is a special room in your home where you can MAKE YOUR OWN FOOD?‚Ä¶ The money that you pi$$ away eating out, I invest.	You forgot something important, though: She needs to add her chores - cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping and so on and so forth and give them a value, too. Then add that to the money he needs to pay. Well, maybe half of it since she's doing them for both of them, while his repairs are for her house. But you get the idea.	0.746
And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	Yeah, I think she has mislead intentions. All the tiktok girls make it seem like it‚Äôs so easy to find wealthy men who will give you money platonically, but they don‚Äôt mention that 100% of them want sex and are essentially pedos/abusers (whether sexually, physically, or through power). They‚Äôre not some type of feminist altruists who only want to help young women through the goodness of their hearts.   Her an her friend have definitely seen some shit, so they have to put up that dead eyed front to pretend everything is okay. But deep down I think they know it‚Äôs wrong.	0.822
Wow. She dodged a bullet üö©üö©üö©üö© This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into üò≠ I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	Gavin de Becker would be so proud of you sis!  JFC, that is so terrifying though!! Thank Gaia you got out safely!	0.787
Wow you definitely did the right thing. Any man who can't understand a lone woman locking their door in this situation isn't living fully in reality. His immediate aggression is an obvious sign he was up to no good. I've been the man in situations like that and my immediate response was to communicate the situation without aggression if it was important enough and to make sure i was being as nonthreatening as possible. Cuz I'm 200+ pounds and bearded i already look crazy üòÜ in any case just to add to the tip about the window. Don't roll it down even a crack. Once closed it creates a sort of seal that strengthens the integrity of the glass. Cracking the window weakens that some in case he tried to strike the window.            edit: That sounds like something I've read about as a tactic for human traffickers.	Unfortunately too another point I‚Äôd like to add (unless I missed it) but never stay in your car for extended periods especially to text or to finish up a song. Men prey on this and watch for this because you become more vulnerable as you‚Äôre distracted and sitting in one place. It‚Äôs best to be in and out as fast and alert as possible.   I would have been too scared to get the food but good instinct to not go and roll down your windows. I would have ran the man over tbh	0.826
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	Why should women have sex with men if said men don't know how to have sex is the basic question i keep asking	0.779
I reported you for blatantly ignoring the handbook.  Read the pickme garbage you just wrote.  And yes, those ‚Äúnice family men‚Äù just want to fuck you.  Are you really naive or like right out of high school or something?  Talking about how bad women are for being 50 and wanting to gossip? Please.	If you want to completely change your feelings on him again please watch his awful behavior toward Sofia Vergara in an old interview. He made tons of inappropriate sexual comments toward her, makes fun of her son's name for some reason, and touches her even after she said not to. He's gross and a definite LVM.	0.881
