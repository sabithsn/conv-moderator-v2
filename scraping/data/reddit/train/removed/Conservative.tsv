Of course not. There is a reason they all failed. There was no merit to the cases. If any of the cases actually had solid evidence then conservative news sources would be talking about it. Yet here we are more than a year later and we have no evidence.	<p>You still haven’t provided any critical analysis, you’ve just broadened your statement to “anyone who disagrees with me is a moron”.

It’s only science when they say it’s science silly! Just like Joe Rogan isn’t a medical professional, so has no authority to render an opinion on treatment options, yet Oprah Winfrey who is also not a medical professional can render opinion on treatment options. Also Twitter-tards are authorized to override opinions of medical professionals that have more credentials than lord Fauci.	<p>The thing is, from a scientific perspective we have only a primitive understanding of life, let alone consciousness.  This is part science, part religion or philosophy.  Science can eventually come to a definitive answer or at least a consensus on most things.  It will never do so in any useful way on this topic.  Super difficult topic.  I am in support of your arbitrary line policy, because I don&#39;t think abolishing it entirely is possible from a political perspective.  I know a lot of people would think that&#39;s giving up on a non-negotiable principle, but because the disagreement is as deep as described in this thread, I think reasonable compromise is the only  tenable solution.</p>	0.865

Can't stand being called out so you start slinging mud.  Grow up.  There's ***plenty*** of hypcorisy, corruption, dishonesty and bad faith on both sides. But in your isolated little world, only if you have a D next to your new does it matter.	<p>I believe the psychological damage of constant masking and hysteria over this virus is going to have a life lasting effect on children. We coddle children way too much these days and we forget that this is not in our humanity to be paranoid and afraid constantly looking for guidance from our authorities.

When did we decide that kinks are acceptable at all? Hurting other people physically and mentally? Degrading people? This shouldn't be acceptable even behind closed doors...  People can do it I guess, but it shouldn't be socially acceptable	<p>To answer your question though.... yes, the BLM “protests” were objectively worse. And achieved nothing.

Yeah I think I’d agree with you, but from the article the data is anonymous and is in a black box type of situation, so you still have control over it (just like you would any other piece of your property, until the police could take it in the course of an investigation, or you handed it over to aid them). So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it’s not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it’s built into the car.	<p>No really. In the darkest corner of your consciousness where no one can hear you scream, what did you think? Let me make it easier for you to admit that it was something along the lines of the second option. It may be rash, even irresponsible, to support impromptu vengeance, but it is not shameful to feel outrage on behalf of innocent people who are exercising their right to use the public highway to earn a living or travel for private purposes.</p>	0.83

Saying that I promote violence towards women is abhorrent and offensive, especially since you seem so confident that the claims you make aren’t rooted in evidence. 18 states have passed bathroom bill allowing trans people to access bathrooms and none of them have had increases in sexual assault related to bathrooms.   Here’s a study from the UCLA that proves this:   https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13178-018-0335-z	<p>It&#39;s just reality that gay people are born gay. What a gay person does in their bedroom is completely irrelevant and none of your concern. So you shouldn&#39;t have an opinion either way. Just treat people with human decency. Conservative values also don&#39;t dictate that we shit on and judge people for things they have no control over. Stop being ignorant.

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn’t tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous.

They did bring a case to the supreme court. Texas tried to argue that PA broke its own election rules so their delegates should be tossed.  Supreme Court brushed it aside despite having one of the strongest conservative leanings in its history.	He’s also known to bend the rules a bit to get the stuff he wants, and he’s perfectly willing to shove people into the mud in the process. His old personal lawyer is convicted of a crime, his new personal lawyer was just suspended from practicing law, and the political future of his old Vice President—who has solid conservative credentials—has effectively been pushed out of the Republican Party because he opted to not unilaterally void the electoral college results and instead followed the process that’s been in place and codified in law in this country for well over 100 years.	0.843

There is nothing wrong with what you said, it's not the right subreddit for it. Honestly a neutral subreddit is an oxymoron nowadays, you can still however find people on politics, news subreddits who can hold a discussion.	Also you linked a page without actually referencing it. Present your argument, and back it up with the source. I can interpret your source however I would like, and without framing the argument the source backs up, I no longer have to resist seeing it that way. Not super great debate tactics. Also the audience doesn’t care here. Not even the downvoters targeting those with flair exclusively will read your argument.	0.821
In the name of racial equity they're gonna discriminate against people who need the treatment until everyone lives in equality.  WTF?	<p>To talk how racist things are against black people turns them into victims, which is in of itself racist because black people should be treated the same as white people and not be labeled. Who wants to be a victim and for people to feel sorry for them? That&#39;s not a good thing and you could even look at that as a way to secretly keep black people down, since outright racism from before the civil rights era isn&#39;t possible anymore.

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	You don't send a mail in ballot to just any random address because the person could've easily moved. Now you got a ballot floating around out there that anyone can just fill out. Of all the baseless claims y'all makes this is the most bizarre to me. Databases containing addresses go off of what's on your ID. Do you know how often those are updated? Also, why is it a bad thing to suggest if someone wants to vote, they should simply request a ballot? Like is it that difficult?	0.874

The guy is studying to become a teacher - the school obviously has a vested interest in making sure they don’t give someone qualifications to be a teacher if he would also be discriminatory against some of his students, for something as simple and personal as their sexual orientation or gender expression.	Also, and I know I'm ranting at this point, I am tired of the argument that gen eds make you well rounded. They don't. You study for what you need to to get a decent grade and you move on and dump the info out.

I also don't need a professor to tell me how to read Meditations, or On Liberty, you can just do that yourself. The folks saying ""well you can talk to the teacher and the students about the subject and get new perspectives."" Yeah, I can also do that online for free on any forum that relates to that subject. Now if people wanna go STEM, I understand that.

The outrage throughout this entire thread is for her hypcorisy and in your case, the bad faith bullshit speeders hey these people.

A real quick Google search will do you good. Trump visited The Hermitage on March 15, 2017. Gave a speech and laid flowers on Jackson's grave.  Trump replaced the FDR portrait that Obama had up with one of Jackson and it remained there for all 4 years of the presidency. Its in the backdrop of a metric shit-ton of photos and there are plenty of articles talking about the decision.   Without knowing what you would consider accurate sourcing or Fake News, I'll let you connect the dots yourself.	<p>Rewind ten years or so and the Republican Governor and  state legislature passed a law limiting the powers of public employee unions.  Our capitol had a real armed resurrection that was cheered on by MSNBC&#39;s Ed Shultz (reporting daily on site), Rachael Maddow, her husband.  This went on for weeks, including the democratic members of the legislature fleeing to Illinois in the same manner as those doing it in Texas right now.

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	<p>I get that generational poverty is a thing. I get that black people are more likely to be impacted by that because of the past. What I don’t get is why I, someone who had absolutely nothing to do with it, should be on the hook for it. Equity policies that address that issue seek to do nothing but punish me for things I didn’t do, with the goal of making life better for people that didn’t experience those things. </p>	0.853

Smartphones, with social media or without, are addictive and when used constantly are not healthy for the human psyche. We need to be engaged in something productive or else we get pretty depressed, and allowing a piece of technology to consume so much of your time will ultimately make you only feel good when you're using it. Social media exacerbates this because it tends to make people believe it counts for social interaction AND it teaches people to base their entire self worth on what peoples crudest opinions are of them. People, and this does not only apply to children, will post the fakest version of themselves online in hopes that they are recognized for it and if it is received poorly they take it personally and if it gets a lot of likes they still know that it wasn't a truthful representation of themselves so they begin to hate their true self because they aren't this image that they created.

When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.88
Plus the lawyer just said he had performed community service. It sounds like he never offered proof, nor did the judge ask for it. I've seen the lawyers lie many times to get low bail. "Your honor, he is supporting his wife and 3 children. He has a fulltime job. He has lived in the same community since birth." The reality is something like this. He is single. He is a fulltime freelance drug dealer. He just arrived last month from south Chicago.	<p>I&#39;m saying that there is a double standard. The media and left bring up firearms at the rights peaceful protest, yet all summer there were hardly any mentions about the left&#39;s terrorism all summer including using class 3 destructive devices, which require a background check, submitted fingerprints, a federal form and a tax stamp to own.

>The fact that you can be suspended or banned for stating something that is true is alarming.  If you are spreading that detail as a means to coax people into NOT getting the vaccine?

It is a valid question that is ON topic so your inability to respond is rather telling. I wonder if you are vaxxed or unvaxxed.	<p>This is exactly the point and takes the argument away from liberals that if you’re against the mandate you <em>must</em> be anti-vaxx and/or science denying. Mandates are implemented to force compliance and have repercussions. The mandate isn’t saving ppl, the vaccine is.

The us army probably killed a similar number. And guns killed a lot more.As much as i hate to say it but these are numbers that just need to happen. We need to defend our country and woman need to defend themselves. Whether its with a gun or abortion this is just the way it is nowadays.  A lot more millions of people have died from war and gun violence. If abortion is a cause of death  then so is war because its preventable and a choice. You cant allow one and prevent the other and call them different.	<p>Here&#39;s a news flash: the people who want stricter gun control don&#39;t want it to oppress you, or enslave you, or anything like that. They&#39;ve already got you by the balls in every conceivable way. You think that because you have a gun they are afraid of you?

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election. They vastly expanded the number of mail in ballots while decreasing the ability to verify they were sent in legally. In states that are decided by only a few thousand votes, that level of uncertainty is very disturbing.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots. If you couldn't or can't see and acknowledge that fact that was noted even before the election occurred, then your reaction to this issue is obviously based purely on the election results and your feelings about them.	0.859

I’ve always said.  You don’t need to fly a plane into a building anymore.  If I was a terrorist and I stress this is hypothetical I’m not encouraging it, but I would start a couple wildfires.

You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before. But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself. Or even better find a way that nobody has to wait that long that these things are necessary.	Even better, realize that abortion already isn’t a federal issue of any significance and will not be for at least a decade. No one in the federal government wants to change a damn thing about the status quo here - they profit too much from it. Blue team gets much of its vote from single-issue pro choice folks; red team gets much of its vote from single-issue anti-abortion folks. They win or lose largely on that issue, and getting rid of it would mean voters might actually pay attention to other things. And SCOTUS probably prays every night to keep abortion shit off their docket.	0.856

Could Biden (not defending him, I think he’s a clown) have meant that the federal government lacks the police power to mandate masking/social distancing/vaccines at the state level?

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since. I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  “Among 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.”  So, there’s at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it’s symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	<p>I do think the matter of comorbity is being glossed over by most organisations: of the family members of mine who were diagnosed with covid, a vast majority of them were fine and had mild flu-like symptoms, and two with obvious comorbidities (tuberculosis and some manner of cardiac disease)  died very quickly after contracting it. It seems to me that the virus fast-tracks existing conditions which would have a strong chance of killing the person within a matter of years anyway.

What do you mean “affects?” Isn’t abortion a choice? And have you considered stratifying abortion rates by socioeconomic status and not race? Sounds like you are arbitrarily making this about race and not responsible family planning with realistic options for all people at safe, affordable health centers.	Now, unless you’re in a position to get an abortion, which I’m not, why would you wish to impose your will on another human being? Why not just NOT get an abortion? It’s not up to you what I or my family do with our bodies, Nor is it up to me what you do with yours. Why not simply educate and allow people to make their own, informed choice on the matter, which would presumably best suit them and their unique circumstances?

Uhh, they do have the ability to ask. I don’t know if it’s entirely appropriate for them to weigh in like this, but they absolutely can weigh in.  Also, executive branch? The President doesn’t have any more control over the Supreme Court than the legislative branch (actually, they have less power)	I don't understand why Americans have so little trust in their own goverment. Don't you choose the best and most capable people to be your senators and president and whatnot? Shouldn't they have the best interest of the entire population at heart? What's the point of even electing anyone if nobody trust or listens to them anyway?

Did you support the cancelation of the Dixie Chicks in the early 2000's by Republicans?

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn’t between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups. Republicans on the establishment side hated Trump and the populist movement he represented just as much as any establishment liberal.

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>I never get the flu shot. I haven&#39;t had the flu since I was in a kid. I&#39;m not getting the covid vaccine either, I&#39;ve a higher chance of dying from the flu. The long term effect of mrna vaccine are not known. Seems like an easy decision on my part to not get it. The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.894

First of all, were comparing the state senator to a congress woman lol.  Second of all, There is much that Ted Cruz couldve done, in fact he did after the fact. Help shelters, hand out supplies, give updates on the situation.  Another difference, covid doesn’t necessarily hit kids/young people hard.

There's no use comparing the current situation in Germany to current time USA, they'll keep holding onto their notion that owning guns will prevent anyone with a political or military background from seizing power like with Hitler.

The reason I say cult is because Trump supporters have proven time and time again that they are willing to believe anything trump tells them to believe.

Facebook sponsored the first Republican primary debate if I recall correctly.	<p>The context is obvious from the flow of the conversation. DoJ says they can&#39;t just overturn an election and Trump says he isn&#39;t asking for that.  He just wants a public statement to be made.  Right after discussing one of the voter fraud allegations that the DoJ said was possible.  The DoJ didn&#39;t just tell Trump that there was zero evidence of voter fraud.</p>	0.867
I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.    All of my colleagues have been vaccinated, as well as a significant amount of the other hospital workers.  The only people we see getting sick are generally the ones who are unvaccinated.  Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.  Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	<p>I volunteer at a clinic which treats a lot of undocumented people and this is one of the things they&#39;re worried about- but they do not need any form of ID to get the vaccine</p>	0.864
I got the first 2 vaxx and refuse any boosters until they are PROVEN to stop the spread. As of now there is 0 science that it stops or even slows the spread. I'll be fine with a 99.999% survival rate for people of my age with no dire health issues.  They can fire me at this point idgaf	Everyone will have an anecdotal story about someone they know being unvaccinated who never got a sniffle, and someone they know who got vaccinated that spontaneously combusted. On a macro scale though, with millions infected, even a 10% reduction in viral spread gives us all a better chance of being able to end the spread of covid and avoid deadlier strains.	0.81

*Donald J. Trump for President v. Boockvar,* *et al.* 4:20-CV-02078  "Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence... Therefore, I grant Defendants' motions and dismiss Plaintiffs' action with prejudice."	<p>&quot;The Court asserted that Trump’s challenge to indefinitely confined voter ballots was “meritless” in this particular case. It also ruled that the remainder of the president’s challenges “failed under laches.” This simply means that the Court said the Trump team was too late (a common theme throughout the swing states).</p>	0.853
It does work. I don’t follow or care about Trump either, and didn’t like him being banned either  Free speech is paramount for democracy. Twitter ≠ government, so this isn’t a “first amendment violation” by any stretch, but it is a violation of the principle.   The response to that should be social, not legal IMO  (Per my tag, this issue matters more to me than *nearly* any other)	I'm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law. Bumpstocks are honestly pretty pointless, but they're also not machine guns, Trump should have left them alone, it's not his place to write laws, it's congress's job.	0.899
I was speaking to someone else but thanks for telling me you took the "Trump vaccine" as if he was somehow the guy to develop it. Next you will be telling me how its the greatest vaccine ever made and how its the very best at what it does.	Trump imagined that by accelerating the vaccine process and helping combat Covid he would be heralded and adored by the media, the medical community, and his political opponents. He thought  he’d be the one to get the credit. He thought that because that’s just how big his ego is, it’s a real weakness for him.	0.836
Just like the right wing media calls any democrat a socialist…. Dude the answer is not to double down on extremism, it’s to meet in the middle.

But yes, if the Republican nominee continues to push the big lie that the election was stolen , the swing voters and those in the middle will be turned off by that shit	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons.

I'm confused, is it a good thing then that without gun control the USA has the highest rate of gun related homicide per capita of all developed countries and the second highest total of gun deaths overall?  Is this what the second amendment was all about? Or is this a side effect of not having a so called 'police state' because I would argue less gun related deaths is a good thing right?	<p>Definitely didn&#39;t expect a European to say that, but yeah when you look at case fatality rate and deaths per 100k population the US is definitely doing better than plenty of other countries across the pond like the UK and Belgium. US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported.

>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead. You endorse slavery with you purchases, tell me otherwise.	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise).

Vaccine efficacy of less than 100% doesn't mean vaccines are failing.   The serious side effects and death linked directly to a vaccine are extremely rare and are being studied to future cases. They are nowhere near the frequency MTG claimed.   Roughly 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have died from covid.	We're in a pandemic and you're not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It's not ideal when anyone—much less a child—has to spend time in the ICU, but I don't think there's been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.	0.886

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	<p>Anyway, this is another example how the name of an organization is not what is its mission (like &quot;freedom fighter&quot; means the opposite). The NAACP has an agenda and it is not the advancement of Colored People. It is the advancement of socialism and the end of the nuclear family.  That is why they won&#39;t touch Hunter, it does not advance that agenda.  As for colored people, they have not been advanced in 50 years (this is according to the NAACP).</p>	0.855

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	<p>I didn’t say you can’t spread the virus asymptotically. But there’s a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place. If viral load drops off quicker and your body clears the virus bc the vaccine kicks in, you’re contagious for a shorter amount of time and you’re not as likely to infect other people. </p>	0.904

I don’t think I’ve seen them take credit for it, but Republican presidents would do the same thing. We can be better than that, and not support either side for something they didn’t do.

Regardless, the double standard is ludicrous. The overcorrection of legitimate social issues has turned into a witch hunt against straight white men. It’s almost laughable tbh, it’s like yeah, there are social issues that stem from the system as a whole, but people fail to realize that it’s a rich vs poor issue, because of the emotional attachment that the media takes and spins, which captivates the infatuation of self pity by these types of people, and instead of bettering themselves, it’s easier to create a scapegoat and blame someone else for their short comings in life.	0.851

If she is spreading that detail as a means to convince others NOT to vaccinate? Then fuck her she deserves removed.

Vaccines are the best way to save lives and hasten the end of the pandemic so no it doesn't make sense to oppose vaccine mandates based on incorrect and misleading information.	6. There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (""they were pulled from the market!"") and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off. They have wide authority to continue them in a crisis, which this definitely is, and it's only a net benefit for everyone.	0.87

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls.

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat. But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	<p>But I want you to understand that the culture that has risen in minority neighborhoods is destructive, and has been for decades.

““It doesn’t matter who is in the Oval Office, whether it’s President Trump, President Biden or some other Republican or Democrat. Either one of them would have been greeted by the higher prices we saw this year," De Haan said, reiterating the current price surge is a direct result of the pandemic upending supply and demand.”  This has been annoying me for so long. I get high gas prices are annoying, but this simply isn’t the fault of any President. Not a good thing, but also something apolitical, and it’s a bad look on conservatives that we’re so up in arms about it.	It isn't as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told ""but he's rich"" or ""but the things he says are absurd!"" or ""no way he will build a wall! He's RACIST!!"".  Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.

No it wasn’t who ever said that? It’s supposed to stop deaths and hospitalizations and guess what it’s done? Covid isn’t going away because we didn’t stop it quick enough.

Hey there. Not sure why I wandered into this swamp of a sub to read these aggressively backwards comments, but I saw yours and it gave me just a little bit of hope.  There are Americans who don't believe every half-baked lie sold on Facebook.

You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you? Don't be niave, over the better part of the last century the left has been corrupting every level of our society,  and they're for damn sure not going to show their rules to be voted away.    And violence most definitely IS the answer sometimes. Our rights and freedoms are worth killing to defend, otherwise there never would have been an American revolution. I refuse to lose America as its meant to be because some people are too cowardly to fight for what's worth fighting for. I'll die for those ideals. I swore an oath to the constitution(not to the government) and I still take it seriously. Wise up, evil is real and our enemies are among us.	<p>That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with.

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p><em>The United States government shipped an average of approximately 100,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies per week across July and August. The Administration will increase the average weekly pace of shipments of free monoclonal antibody treatment to states by a further 50% in September, continuing to accelerate the federal government’s efforts to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 treatment. Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. As hospital systems experience increased COVID-19 cases, many have identified monoclonal antibody treatment as a key tool to improve health outcomes, prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on overburdened hospitals.</em></p>	0.876

Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms.

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you’ll get less sick, and you’re less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	>Evidence suggests the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission. **Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential to spread the virus to others, although at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.**	0.902

The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It’s not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it’s not a political problem. Get over yourself.	<p>Meanwhile California goes through rolling blackouts on a yearly basis which is somehow still republicans fault because &quot;climate change&quot; even though we have continued to reduce emissions both total and per capita as a country while watching world wide emissions rise from &quot;developing countries&quot; immune to all the of regulations we place on ourselves, essentially we NIMBY pollution to 3rd world countries and accomplish almost nothing for the environment other than making people feel good about &quot;doing something&quot;.</p>	0.844

So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	The more wiser portion of the base along with independents/dems do not buy this trumpian nonsense about the Kraken or whatever b/s being peddled by these grifters. There is no fucking ""ballot trafficking"" that is going to be exposed. There wasn't any to begin with (on a massive scale)! Focusing any calories on the past is not helpful. There's another election in a year that the GOP has a good chance of doing well in. It was trump's nonsensical drum beating about voter fraud in georgia that cause decreased turnout in the bumpkin portion of the state. Its an absolute travesty that the months following the November election were wasted on ""stopping the steal"" rather than winning those two seats. Millions of grassroot dollars were wasted to release the kraken that never amounted to jack shit.	0.911

As I understand it, the vaccine works by training your immune system to react to the protein patterns that match the virus&#39;s profile.

And if you die while infected with Covid, I&#39;d imagine your death would still be counted even if you had a pre-existing condition like an auto-immune disease. </p>	0.804

But the property has been a family home since Trump bought it in the mid 1990s. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have talked about spending their summers there, doing whatever Trump kids do. Even the Trump organization’s website lists Seven Springs as “a retreat for the Trump family.” Calling a home a “business” solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people “working from home” during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.</p>	0.799

i got my first two shots but have held off on the booster, most ppl who got the booster r still getting omricon so i really don’t see the point, plus omricon is said to just be a mild cold the my second shot caused me days of headaches, would much rather have a mild cold over that	I know the mantra is that almost everyone dying of covid today is unvaccinated, but I'm incredibly skeptical of those stats. I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even *had* covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don't know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don't know, but I'd assume she was unvaccinated. So that's 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50.	0.818

This is definitely getting more into the realm of opinion than classical definitions of corruption, but I think that it you're still in office you shouldn't operate under the impression that people care so much about your life, story, or ideas that they'd want to read them en masse.

he was improperly trained and tested. the business that gave him the c.d.l is a license mill to fill the demands of an insufficiently staffed transportation sector. no one wants to drive anymore because of the high demand, long hours, and danger. so the jobs are being given to anyone desperate enough, without proper training. if you want to hold someone responsible it should be the people who are knowingly weaponizing the ignorant with tons of rolling steel.	TBH my 2nd thought (1st was ""wow, what a moron, that's blatant overreach, and are you trying to start a civil war you'll lose?"") was that man, this could be a boost to small employers. Everyone's already feeling the pinch trying to find employees, but large businesses often are having a tougher time probably due to HR/C-suite thinking they can get away with not raising wages to match competition. And the service at a lot of larger businesses is pure shit already, because often *no one* there gives a shit... there's no owner there to bust his ass, and the manager's sick & tired of being used as duct tape & bubble gum to patch together their lack of staffing.	0.889

Sovereign nations have the right to determine who crosses boarders. Didn’t think I’d have to explain that on a conservative sub.

That doesn’t mean he gets to enter a sovereign country.   Choices have consequences - something conservatives understand.   Smdh.	An sitting U.S Senator who was the 1 to end Fauci insanity prt 1.

Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they’re good at what they do? That is literally socialism. If you don’t like social media, just don’t use it. The free market will correct itself as long as people stop enabling it. It’s your fault as a consumer, not the company’s fault.   If you got this far, I hope you can see how ridiculous some of the takes on this sub are. As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	<p>No. No, screw that. It is the responsibility of the private sector to attract customers by making a better product. The only intervention it makes sense for the government to make is to institute a universal charging standard since that would discourage monopolistic practices.

What Weissmann says is technically correct, but he leaves out context that radically changes how one might view the Tucker situation.  Yes, of course anyone reaching out to a Putin surrogate should expect the NSA/CIA to be listening.  No one is surprised by that.

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	So as conservatives, we absolutely hate it when anybody wants to tell us what to think, or what to say, or what to believe, but at the same time, we want to use the state to make such prescriptions for others when it comes to exercising certain functions of their body.	0.904

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	One, the virus mutates because there is what's known as ""Leak By"". This is why there is a new Flu vaccine developed every year. The Flu vaccine does not ""kill"" the Flu virus, so it mutates. This is the same for the COVID  virus. If there was no Leak By, then the vaccine would kill the virus in a couple ""jabs"", and that would be it.	0.871

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.

But also many democrats are making the change to saying it may be time to just get it over with, since Omicron doesn’t seem like the biggest problem once you have it.	<p>Honestly, a few things I see here.  I think there are some conservatives who are going to stand up and say, my individual rights override your unconstitutional mandate.  There&#39;s also a large chunk of African Americans who are not getting vax&#39;ed.  You never hear about the latter.  You hear Biden blaming Trump supporters for not getting vax&#39;ed.  I believe the vax is highly effective at reducing the symptoms and severity of infection and very so-so at best at controlling the spread.  I also think overall, we have like 70% or so vax&#39;ed.  The un-vax&#39;ed are mostly young children and those with naturally acquired immunity.  The percentage of the population with COVID antibodies is likely very high, approaching 90%.</p>	0.835

Biggity makes a valid point. A key word in your response is “mostly”.  Another is “suspicious”.

That’s not how it is supposed to work, no matter what your beliefs or values. Order and rule of law are the basis of our democracy and civil society, and without that, it all eventually falls apart.	<p>Couldn’t agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn’t matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns. If not, then we just become another failed authoritarian state with no freedom.

Doesn't matter because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the far left. Therefore, it espouses far left policies. That's why I expect a Republican landslide this November. I'm actually an Independent, but the Democrats have swung so far to the left that I can longer support any of them.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.  When we criticized them, we were told we weren't wanted and don't let the door hit us on the way out.	0.87

The well was poisoned before Nixon. LBJ's "great society" reforms were a cancer that could never be removed.  >So Democrats started appealing to city dwellers and did a good job of it.  Bribed. Replaced the father with government money, made large swathes of the population dependent on taxpayer dollars. Your dumbass daughter votes for Democrat because she wants handouts. You vote Democrat because you don't want to have to pay for your dumbass daughter, and so on.  It was a democrat strategy change that could be summed up with a LBJ quote:  **"I'll have those [removed] voting Democrat for 200 years."**	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise). Get rid of IDs  for voting because minorities are too stupid and poor to get an ID and etc. Democrat policies are always supported by &quot;minorities are stupid and poor.&quot; And somehow their the anti racists.</p>	0.88

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	<p>You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. It&#39;s not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as &quot;left wing&quot; as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant.

I was just pointing out that Democrats were once the more Conservative party, while at their inception Republicans were the more progressive party. I don’t think 100 years ago the south was a bastion of progressive thinking. Democrats just matched up better with a more conservative way of thinking at the time. I think politicians on both sides are mostly self serving garbage today, but this post doesn’t paint the full picture of the political landscape during those times.	<p>Hmm that’s weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes. Their successors as well, are Democrats.</p>	0.877
Matt Walsh actively doesn't know what he's talking about.   You may not agree with her, but she often engages in intellectual conversation.   However it's not a secret in Washington the insanely large amount of lewd comments made about her from Republicans who talk about wanting to fuck her.	<p>It isn&#39;t done often but it is becoming more common to object during closings.

Anyone else see the hypocrisy of implying Biden has mental issues by quoting a mumbling stooge who was so riddled with Alzheimers during his first term, info was actively kept from him by his closest advisors?  Also, given the state of modern America due to 40 years of 'Reaganism,' the idea of unchecked corporatism has been thoroughly debunked.  P.S. Glad to see so many ostensibly conservative members of this group know the truth about Reagan's 'complicated' (to be polite) history.	<p>This bill is essentially &quot;take most of the shit we got away with last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, everything that conservatives are pissed off over, and make it law.&quot; People wonder why the rift in this country is growing wider and wider?

Just give me some actual hard evidence. All I am seeing is people who were told the election was rigged, so they believed the election was rigged, and they will listen to anyone who says anything in defense of that, but they won’t listen to anyone who has anything to say against that. People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn’t change the outcome. For there to be some large scale conspiracy, they would have to get past the same people who have been volunteering their precious time for years just because they believe in the power of democracy.	<p>FACTS are most important right now, not bias.  This prosecution is drowning, they have nearly no facts that help prove their case.  The liberal media is intentionally trying to convince people that Kyle is losing, so when he gets not guilty they immediately claim RACISM and PATRIARCHY and FASCIST and all the other nonsense they like to say when they don&#39;t agree with something.

Hello, not a conservative but have a question?  Is the issue with this political in nature (you don’t think companies should be allowed to do this)? Or personal (you don’t like that this company is doing this)?  Because this seems to be how a private system is supposed to work. The government rules it can’t enforce a certain policy, and then the private sector chooses to implement the policy if they deem it to be the best thing for their business.	<p>The government shouldn&#39;t force business&#39;s to provide services to people however I&#39;m not sure that conservatism explicitly prohibits governments from preventing business from doing something. </p>	0.848
Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>When covid first entered the scene and many people said it didn&#39;t worry them because side-effects appeared mild, others chimed in to say that we have to be cautious because we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. Why doesn&#39;t this rationale also apply to the vaccines? You can&#39;t test for something that happens years down the road regardless of how quickly you give it emergency authorization.</p>	0.879

Anyone with half a brain knows what VAERS is and using it to claim the covid 19 vaccine causes death is dishonest.   It is a lie.    MTG isn’t a victim. She broke the rules.   Twitter is a private company and can do what they want.    Go cry about it.	<p>I’ll agree that the virus was lied about and politicized from the start. Trump lied about the severity of the virus and said it would magically go away, he peddled ineffective drugs and harmful home remedies, and blamed everyone else he could. He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines. Everyone here says that the reason the US had so much trouble containing the outbreak is because of our land borders, and this is 100x more of an issue with state borders, except those can’t be locked down</p>	0.855

It is generally considered a perk of the job that you can park your car wherever and whenever you like in the city with no consequence, contributing massively to the cities congestion. With city employees its bad enough, but when cops do it in their cruisers it creates a sense among the public that cops think they are above the law. It&#39;s a terrible look.</p>	0.793
My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn’t fascistic.   There is a long history of countries - including the US - requiring foreigners who are entering a sovereign nation - to present medical records, including proof of vaccination.   It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you’re keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	<p>EDIT: Forgot to add this, but I understand the argument about already having gotten COVID, but the CDC and doctors and other medical experts have all said that getting vaccinated is still recommended for those who have had COVID. Do you trust your gut instinct that you don’t need the vaccine more than the medical experts?</p>	0.815
The person claiming to be naturally vaccinated is the one who is anti science. We have literal science that shows COVID can fuck your world up and even kill you, after you have had it already. The virus keeps mutating, and you have ALREADY HAD IT. It is insane you won't vaccinate. Your poor family.	<p>He was also a straight up liar. I mean you can look up YouTube compilations of Trump 1.) Lying about the severity of the situation, 2.) Lying about possible treatments 3.) Lying about scientific data 4.) Literally causing superspreader events, and this isn&#39;t even counting the &quot;it&#39;s under control, it&#39;ll be gone by April&quot; lie.

That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights.

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	If the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized because it lessens symptoms, but affords minor protection against infection... what is the point? The entire argument for universal masking for the past year has been to prevent asymptomatic spread. If you still have a high likelihood of catching covid, but a lower propensity to have severe symptoms, the vaccine *encourages* asymptomatic spread.	0.906

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery but was not an abolitionist in the sense of the abolition movement that was growing in the north.</p>	0.842
That is very possible. I try to judge folks on their actions, not what party marker is beside their name. Those in the South were traitors to the nation, I think we can all agree. Any who look to duplicate this in the future would also be labeled traitors.	<p>But when you put it that way. I certainly agree. The punishment someone gets for any given crime should also serve to deter others from doing the same. And there is no place for targeted attacks based on race in this country.

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	cancel culture is forced on us, by using measures to manipulate emotion regardless of ideology. considering personalized advertisements and posts in general on online posts, at best i would have seen maybe two articles from smaller news sources, within a span of a day for most topics of such nature that lean towards my political views. i couldn’t give a damn less about cancel culture yet for whatever reason, they find any which way to push their narrative whether it be a movie scene/ad or a video game collab. the difference is that this isn’t forced into your normal day to day life, meaning you’d never see politics in a child’s video game, and yes that has happened.	0.846
Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

It’s easier to be outside and socially distanced in Florida right now, right?	<p>More freedom and less debt with the left.</p>	0.734
"A good hate fucking" ya yall wanna just fuck AOC and lack her feet. Fucking weirdos dude	<p>We&#39;re in a world of complete bullshit speak, where the words don&#39;t matter, and the objective is to hate as much as you possibly can.</p>	0.894
That's that r/conservative does as well though.	I mean from a conservative viewpoint, sure I guess that makes sense.	0.87
You’re here, aren’t you?	Yes, you were.	0.888
I posted this in r/politics and it’s not going over well with them	<p>And that’s the problem with politics today.</p>	0.819

You guys act like you leaning twitter will somehow make it so politicians can leave it. Simply put Twitter is the best way for them to get statements out to their followers and the public at large. You are never going to replace it with some conservative friendly alternative.	<p>If anything DeSantis should push to make a  nationalized social media sphere so that politician can post whatever inane shit they want without having to deal with the constituents since that is all he wants.</p>	0.848
Someone post this in r/ murderedbyAOC lmao	Name the people in that list that threatened to kill Senstors.	0.773
Gotta disagree.  Pro-vaccine, anti-mandate, anti-fauci, anti-school shutdown is the winner.  He’s basically there is you heard his last speech with o’Reilly.  If he tones the craziness down 10% he’ll win in an Reaganesque landslide.	<p>The politics in SF is so unbelieveably corrupt. I just heard in the 2018 election people voted for some initiative to give each homeless resident 10,000 dollars. I&#39;m not against helping the homeless, but I&#39;m against virtue signalling and looking good rather than looking for *real* solutions.</p>	0.815
Why would you want family and non-essential personnel in an embassy in an invaded country?	>Why cant they seek asylum in one of the countries they pass to get here?>	0.766
You fucks cry for a self admitted rapist who lost to some senile dem dipshit in the last elections. Hypocrisy much?	I’m sorry, which one of blindly follows the word of an egotistical orangutan? Which one of us supported the storming of the United States Capitol and the death of the Sitting Vice President? Whose the sore loser who thinks that the election is rigged because their guy lost? Sounds like the piece of shit is projecting.	0.87
Hey don't say that now, wouldn't wanna anger the trump never-wrong 'ers	Isn't about to take responsibility for his own actions. Wouldn't admit he made a mistake, let alone take responsibility for one.	0.86
You have to be dumb as fuck or just malicious to believe that	Sorry homie, but you have to be a fucking moron to not know this is exactly the plan.	0.863
Not sure why she'd deserve a title like this. Just because she made some transphobic tweets? The bar is so low...	<p>I don&#39;t always start arguments over the crappy leftist propaganda that &quot;feels good&quot;. But I got real pissed when she retweeted a post saying cancel culture didn&#39;t exist because they deserve it.... which is both logically self contradictory and absolutely stupid.</p>	0.772
I know what dictatorship is. In that context is utterly misused in my opinion. As I said many times before being conservative doesnt mean you are against these mandates...If a person doesnt want to get a vaccine I understand and rescpect but I also understand you will be blocked to meet your colleagues at work...its your decision. No dictatorship seen here.	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don’t want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it’s effectiveness, but that’s a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.884
