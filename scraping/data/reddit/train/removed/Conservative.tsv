Wow. The southern strategy wasn‚Äôt about appealing to racists. It was about appealing to the religious right. It just so happens a lot of them are ALSO racists.	<p>A certain religion has always been exempt from being criticized for their profiting off the use of black face</p>	0.798

Of course not. There is a reason they all failed. There was no merit to the cases. If any of the cases actually had solid evidence then conservative news sources would be talking about it. Yet here we are more than a year later and we have no evidence.	<p>You still haven‚Äôt provided any critical analysis, you‚Äôve just broadened your statement to ‚Äúanyone who disagrees with me is a moron‚Äù.  That‚Äôs not how you convince anyone of anything, and that attitude is absolutely responsible for republican‚Äôs recent election losses.</p>	0.855

I'll be happy to push my knee on the nape of your kneck and have you say "I can't breathe". If you manage, I won't stop, I promise.	So, just to be clear. You are totally OK with Joe Biden playing with the nipple of a little girl on C-SPAN video.  Right?  If not, tell us how it's bad.  Give us something critical, besides the *yeah?!

It‚Äôs only science when they say it‚Äôs science silly! Just like Joe Rogan isn‚Äôt a medical professional, so has no authority to render an opinion on treatment options, yet Oprah Winfrey who is also not a medical professional can render opinion on treatment options. Also Twitter-tards are authorized to override opinions of medical professionals that have more credentials than lord Fauci.	<p>The thing is, from a scientific perspective we have only a primitive understanding of life, let alone consciousness.  This is part science, part religion or philosophy.  Science can eventually come to a definitive answer or at least a consensus on most things.  It will never do so in any useful way on this topic.  Super difficult topic.  I am in support of your arbitrary line policy, because I don&#39;t think abolishing it entirely is possible from a political perspective.  I know a lot of people would think that&#39;s giving up on a non-negotiable principle, but because the disagreement is as deep as described in this thread, I think reasonable compromise is the only  tenable solution.</p>	0.865

Can't stand being called out so you start slinging mud.  Grow up.  There's ***plenty*** of hypcorisy, corruption, dishonesty and bad faith on both sides. But in your isolated little world, only if you have a D next to your new does it matter.	<p>I believe the psychological damage of constant masking and hysteria over this virus is going to have a life lasting effect on children. We coddle children way too much these days and we forget that this is not in our humanity to be paranoid and afraid constantly looking for guidance from our authorities. Fear creates a weak society that always leads to tyranny and we are prepping our children to not think critically and individually, fear the world and always seek the answers from authority and not themselves.</p>	0.808
Facts are unappreciated in leftie domain  Your post on r/politics is scrubbed ...I was hoping to gather some woke tears	<p>Let us hope this utter failure of the Biden presidency will serve as a wakeup call to many on the left to challenge the narrative, and insist on better quality and behavior on their own side.</p>	0.781

When did we decide that kinks are acceptable at all? Hurting other people physically and mentally? Degrading people? This shouldn't be acceptable even behind closed doors...  People can do it I guess, but it shouldn't be socially acceptable	<p>To answer your question though.... yes, the BLM ‚Äúprotests‚Äù were objectively worse. And achieved nothing. Besides hurting a bunch of innocent Americans. And you would need to be seriously brainwashed to think otherwise.</p>	0.854
Yeah I think I‚Äôd agree with you, but from the article the data is anonymous and is in a black box type of situation, so you still have control over it (just like you would any other piece of your property, until the police could take it in the course of an investigation, or you handed it over to aid them). So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it‚Äôs not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it‚Äôs built into the car.	<p>No really. In the darkest corner of your consciousness where no one can hear you scream, what did you think? Let me make it easier for you to admit that it was something along the lines of the second option. It may be rash, even irresponsible, to support impromptu vengeance, but it is not shameful to feel outrage on behalf of innocent people who are exercising their right to use the public highway to earn a living or travel for private purposes.</p>	0.83

Saying that I promote violence towards women is abhorrent and offensive, especially since you seem so confident that the claims you make aren‚Äôt rooted in evidence. 18 states have passed bathroom bill allowing trans people to access bathrooms and none of them have had increases in sexual assault related to bathrooms.   Here‚Äôs a study from the UCLA that proves this:   https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13178-018-0335-z	<p>It&#39;s just reality that gay people are born gay. What a gay person does in their bedroom is completely irrelevant and none of your concern. So you shouldn&#39;t have an opinion either way. Just treat people with human decency. Conservative values also don&#39;t dictate that we shit on and judge people for things they have no control over. Stop being ignorant. There&#39;s a difference between the lgbt &quot;community&quot; which is political and being an lgbt person, which is just something you&#39;re born as.</p>	0.808
I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn‚Äôt tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn‚Äôt you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous.

They did bring a case to the supreme court. Texas tried to argue that PA broke its own election rules so their delegates should be tossed.  Supreme Court brushed it aside despite having one of the strongest conservative leanings in its history.	He‚Äôs also known to bend the rules a bit to get the stuff he wants, and he‚Äôs perfectly willing to shove people into the mud in the process. His old personal lawyer is convicted of a crime, his new personal lawyer was just suspended from practicing law, and the political future of his old Vice President‚Äîwho has solid conservative credentials‚Äîhas effectively been pushed out of the Republican Party because he opted to not unilaterally void the electoral college results and instead followed the process that‚Äôs been in place and codified in law in this country for well over 100 years.	0.843

Every domain that has potential to educate is taken over by lefties of the world, this has been a phenomenon since past 2 decades or more  Its all about identity monetization Victimhood celebration and Outrage monetization  The lefties are both arsonists & firefighters (at least pretend to be )  everywhere in the world	<p>Everyone in the manufacturing world is interconnected and uses each other&#39;s products, so the unprecedented scale with which this shutdown hit everyone simultaneously just compounded that effect so many times over.

Exactly. It was a movie. Nobody and I mean nobody, up until 5 years ago, ever went on and on and on about this kind of thing in movies.

There is nothing wrong with what you said, it's not the right subreddit for it. Honestly a neutral subreddit is an oxymoron nowadays, you can still however find people on politics, news subreddits who can hold a discussion.	Also you linked a page without actually referencing it. Present your argument, and back it up with the source. I can interpret your source however I would like, and without framing the argument the source backs up, I no longer have to resist seeing it that way. Not super great debate tactics. Also the audience doesn‚Äôt care here. Not even the downvoters targeting those with flair exclusively will read your argument.	0.821
In the name of racial equity they're gonna discriminate against people who need the treatment until everyone lives in equality.  WTF?	<p>To talk how racist things are against black people turns them into victims, which is in of itself racist because black people should be treated the same as white people and not be labeled. Who wants to be a victim and for people to feel sorry for them? That&#39;s not a good thing and you could even look at that as a way to secretly keep black people down, since outright racism from before the civil rights era isn&#39;t possible anymore. These white, social justice warrior, liberals are the actual oppressors of black people by labeling them as victims.</p>	0.839

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn‚Äôt have voted in person if mail in ballots weren‚Äôt an option  It excludes the fact that it isn‚Äôt just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn‚Äôt be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	You don't send a mail in ballot to just any random address because the person could've easily moved. Now you got a ballot floating around out there that anyone can just fill out. Of all the baseless claims y'all makes this is the most bizarre to me. Databases containing addresses go off of what's on your ID. Do you know how often those are updated? Also, why is it a bad thing to suggest if someone wants to vote, they should simply request a ballot? Like is it that difficult?	0.874

BILLIONS of people have received the vaccine without widespread complications.

The guy is studying to become a teacher - the school obviously has a vested interest in making sure they don‚Äôt give someone qualifications to be a teacher if he would also be discriminatory against some of his students, for something as simple and personal as their sexual orientation or gender expression.	Also, and I know I'm ranting at this point, I am tired of the argument that gen eds make you well rounded. They don't. You study for what you need to to get a decent grade and you move on and dump the info out. Unless you cared about literature, philosophy, creative writing, whatever, you weren't going to truly steep yourself in that path. I also don't need a professor to tell me how to read Meditations, or On Liberty, you can just do that yourself. The folks saying ""well you can talk to the teacher and the students about the subject and get new perspectives."" Yeah, I can also do that online for free on any forum that relates to that subject. Now if people wanna go STEM, I understand that. Access to labs and equipment is nice and having instructors who really understand how to use them/can instruct you on how to is nice, but even then there are plenty of YouTube videos out there.

A real quick Google search will do you good. Trump visited The Hermitage on March 15, 2017. Gave a speech and laid flowers on Jackson's grave.  Trump replaced the FDR portrait that Obama had up with one of Jackson and it remained there for all 4 years of the presidency. Its in the backdrop of a metric shit-ton of photos and there are plenty of articles talking about the decision.   Without knowing what you would consider accurate sourcing or Fake News, I'll let you connect the dots yourself.	<p>Rewind ten years or so and the Republican Governor and  state legislature passed a law limiting the powers of public employee unions.  Our capitol had a real armed resurrection that was cheered on by MSNBC&#39;s Ed Shultz (reporting daily on site), Rachael Maddow, her husband.  This went on for weeks, including the democratic members of the legislature fleeing to Illinois in the same manner as those doing it in Texas right now.

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	<p>I get that generational poverty is a thing. I get that black people are more likely to be impacted by that because of the past. What I don‚Äôt get is why I, someone who had absolutely nothing to do with it, should be on the hook for it. Equity policies that address that issue seek to do nothing but punish me for things I didn‚Äôt do, with the goal of making life better for people that didn‚Äôt experience those things. </p>	0.853

Why would you have *fixations* on women? Is it because you're only used to dealing with people online, and actual human contact is difficult for you?	Smartphones, with social media or without, are addictive and when used constantly are not healthy for the human psyche. We need to be engaged in something productive or else we get pretty depressed, and allowing a piece of technology to consume so much of your time will ultimately make you only feel good when you're using it. Social media exacerbates this because it tends to make people believe it counts for social interaction AND it teaches people to base their entire self worth on what peoples crudest opinions are of them. People, and this does not only apply to children, will post the fakest version of themselves online in hopes that they are recognized for it and if it is received poorly they take it personally and if it gets a lot of likes they still know that it wasn't a truthful representation of themselves so they begin to hate their true self because they aren't this image that they created.

When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety.

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election. They vastly expanded the number of mail in ballots while decreasing the ability to verify they were sent in legally. In states that are decided by only a few thousand votes, that level of uncertainty is very disturbing.	There were massively more ways that fraudulent ballots could enter our election this past cycle when compared to previous elections specifically due to mail-in ballots.

You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before. But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself. Or even better find a way that nobody has to wait that long that these things are necessary.	Even better, realize that abortion already isn‚Äôt a federal issue of any significance and will not be for at least a decade. No one in the federal government wants to change a damn thing about the status quo here - they profit too much from it. Blue team gets much of its vote from single-issue pro choice folks; red team gets much of its vote from single-issue anti-abortion folks. They win or lose largely on that issue, and getting rid of it would mean voters might actually pay attention to other things. And SCOTUS probably prays every night to keep abortion shit off their docket.	0.856

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since.

You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.

You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  ‚ÄúAmong 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.‚Äù  So, there‚Äôs at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it‚Äôs symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	<p>I do think the matter of comorbity is being glossed over by most organisations: of the family members of mine who were diagnosed with covid, a vast majority of them were fine and had mild flu-like symptoms, and two with obvious comorbidities (tuberculosis and some manner of cardiac disease)  died very quickly after contracting it.

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn‚Äôt between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups. Republicans on the establishment side hated Trump and the populist movement he represented just as much as any establishment liberal.

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>I never get the flu shot. I haven&#39;t had the flu since I was in a kid. I&#39;m not getting the covid vaccine either, I&#39;ve a higher chance of dying from the flu. The long term effect of mrna vaccine are not known. Seems like an easy decision on my part to not get it. The people who covid is a threat to can get the vaccine themselves. It&#39;s pretty simple. Even my GP said I shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, which surprised me. It&#39;s not worth feeling like I was hit by a truck for 24 to 48 hours after the shot, which is pretty common. I know many people who went through that after the vaccine.</p>	0.894

First of all, were comparing the state senator to a congress woman lol.  Second of all, There is much that Ted Cruz couldve done, in fact he did after the fact. Help shelters, hand out supplies, give updates on the situation.  Another difference, covid doesn‚Äôt necessarily hit kids/young people hard. Unlike freezing/no food/no gas/no water/no electricity that put people into and kids at risk. Some even dying.  I get where the argument is coming from, but yes. Two very different situations that this sub will pass as similar.	<p>While I&#39;m not a huge gun person, I did grow up in an area with people who were, and they all seem to agree with the current rules.

There's no use comparing the current situation in Germany to current time USA, they'll keep holding onto their notion that owning guns will prevent anyone with a political or military background from seizing power like with Hitler.

Conservative "blue dog" Democrats (which I was back in the 90s/early 00s) basically are incompatible with the modern Democratic party because we can't support their current brand of blatant anti-Liberalism.

I did read it.   The article was referring to a poll. Doesn't a poll assume that you need to vote on a predefined list of options?   The Guardian didn't refer to a poll. It was just a submission form asking their readers who their person of the year was.   The released a selection of it yesterday and JK Rowling is mentioned: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/guardian-readers-nominate-their-person-of-the-year  Unless there is some evidence that the Guardian actually had a poll and showing who was leading then we can't assume that they pulled because JK Rowling was in the lead.

I'm confused, is it a good thing then that without gun control the USA has the highest rate of gun related homicide per capita of all developed countries and the second highest total of gun deaths overall?  Is this what the second amendment was all about? Or is this a side effect of not having a so called 'police state' because I would argue less gun related deaths is a good thing right?	<p>Definitely didn&#39;t expect a European to say that, but yeah when you look at case fatality rate and deaths per 100k population the US is definitely doing better than plenty of other countries across the pond like the UK and Belgium. US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported. I think the Netherlands numbers are currently better than the US, but that few ICU beds is just asking to be Italy.

>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead. You endorse slavery with you purchases, tell me otherwise.	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise).

I don‚Äôt listen to Biden he‚Äôs not a scientist he misspoke like a dumb old guy he is.

Vaccine efficacy of less than 100% doesn't mean vaccines are failing.   The serious side effects and death linked directly to a vaccine are extremely rare and are being studied to future cases. They are nowhere near the frequency MTG claimed.   Roughly 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have died from covid.	We're in a pandemic and you're not going to escape 100% of bad outcomes.  But the number of healthy kids who will have vaccine-related complications is far lower than the number of healthy kids who would likely have medical complications from COVID if they remained unvaccinated.  It's not ideal when anyone‚Äîmuch less a child‚Äîhas to spend time in the ICU, but I don't think there's been a single death related to the vaccine, while even people with no risk factor whatsoever have died of COVID in rare cases.	0.886

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have ‚Äúhis due.‚Äù There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	<p>Anyway, this is another example how the name of an organization is not what is its mission (like &quot;freedom fighter&quot; means the opposite). The NAACP has an agenda and it is not the advancement of Colored People. It is the advancement of socialism and the end of the nuclear family.  That is why they won&#39;t touch Hunter, it does not advance that agenda.  As for colored people, they have not been advanced in 50 years (this is according to the NAACP).</p>	0.855

Hey, if you‚Äôre on board to have the government ban smoking, then I‚Äôm with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let‚Äôs go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn‚Äôt know much about Covid, and when we weren‚Äôt prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they‚Äôre helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don‚Äôt get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	<p>I didn‚Äôt say you can‚Äôt spread the virus asymptotically. But there‚Äôs a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place. If viral load drops off quicker and your body clears the virus bc the vaccine kicks in, you‚Äôre contagious for a shorter amount of time and you‚Äôre not as likely to infect other people. </p>	0.904

The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off.

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat. But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	<p>But I want you to understand that the culture that has risen in minority neighborhoods is destructive, and has been for decades.

There are Americans who know the actual meaning of the word Communist, instead of tossing it around as a one-size-fits-all insult for anyone we disagree with politically. Some people just never recovered from the paranoia of the cold war, and missed the memo that nationalism is a bad thing in any flavor, not just German. We're here struggling to be heard over screaming idiots, and we appreciate your efforts from the other side.	I don't always start arguments over the crappy leftist propaganda that ""feels good"". But I got real pissed when she retweeted a post saying cancel culture didn't exist because they deserve it.... which is both logically self contradictory and absolutely stupid.	0.875

You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you? Don't be niave, over the better part of the last century the left has been corrupting every level of our society,  and they're for damn sure not going to show their rules to be voted away.    And violence most definitely IS the answer sometimes. Our rights and freedoms are worth killing to defend, otherwise there never would have been an American revolution. I refuse to lose America as its meant to be because some people are too cowardly to fight for what's worth fighting for. I'll die for those ideals. I swore an oath to the constitution(not to the government) and I still take it seriously. Wise up, evil is real and our enemies are among us.	<p>That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with. Now, they want full control over your lives and there is not compromise.</p>	0.886

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th¬†week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p><em>The United States government shipped an average of approximately 100,000 doses of monoclonal antibodies per week across July and August. The Administration will increase the average weekly pace of shipments of free monoclonal antibody treatment to states by a further 50% in September, continuing to accelerate the federal government‚Äôs efforts to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 treatment. Monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. As hospital systems experience increased COVID-19 cases, many have identified monoclonal antibody treatment as a key tool to improve health outcomes, prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on overburdened hospitals.</em></p>	0.876

Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms. Turns out if you run a coordinated 4 year propaganda campaign to make someone into Hitler 2.0 and have all intelligence agencies feeding disinfo to fuel the flames the enthusiasm can be outsourced. Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes. Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government.

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you‚Äôre less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It‚Äôs been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it‚Äôs a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you‚Äôll get less sick, and you‚Äôre less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	>Evidence suggests the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission. **Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential to spread the virus to others, although at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.**	0.902

So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	The more wiser portion of the base along with independents/dems do not buy this trumpian nonsense about the Kraken or whatever b/s being peddled by these grifters. There is no fucking ""ballot trafficking"" that is going to be exposed. There wasn't any to begin with (on a massive scale)! Focusing any calories on the past is not helpful. There's another election in a year that the GOP has a good chance of doing well in. It was trump's nonsensical drum beating about voter fraud in georgia that cause decreased turnout in the bumpkin portion of the state. Its an absolute travesty that the months following the November election were wasted on ""stopping the steal"" rather than winning those two seats. Millions of grassroot dollars were wasted to release the kraken that never amounted to jack shit.	0.911

i got my first two shots but have held off on the booster, most ppl who got the booster r still getting omricon so i really don‚Äôt see the point, plus omricon is said to just be a mild cold the my second shot caused me days of headaches, would much rather have a mild cold over that	I know the mantra is that almost everyone dying of covid today is unvaccinated, but I'm incredibly skeptical of those stats. I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even *had* covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don't know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don't know, but I'd assume she was unvaccinated. So that's 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50.	0.818

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.

Socialism :  a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.  Community as a whole, not a singular party or group of maniacs.	<p>&quot;Social democracy is a political, social and economic philosophy within socialism. As a policy regime, it is described by academics as advocating economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal-democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented mixed economy.&quot;</p>	0.799

I'm socially far right but economically left on things. So I guess I'm not a lolbert by any means but it's hard to respect anyone who stifled American industries and sold us to foreign swine like China and India and mexico. Like all we are is a massive bloated date center everyone works in a service job.	DC's imperial actions post-USSR have no clear, material goal & offer no benefit to the American people. Their directed by foreign (e.g. Israeli/AIPAC or Saudi) money & merely profit construction firms (e.g. Haliburton). You cannot impose liberal democracy on a people who have no history (nor desire) for it at the point of a gun - and even if you could, American democracy is crumbling away alongside our infrastructure, healthcare, & education every year.	0.851
Lincoln did not oppose slavery. He said if he could win the war without freeing any slaves he would do so. He said if he could win the war freeing only half the slaves he would do so.

Last Thursday I went to the funeral for my best friends father. He died from Covid because he was unvaccinated. He was unvaccinated becuase he listened to people like you.  Many people like myself have suffered greatly and lost loved ones at the hands of Covid. I can tell by your gross comments that you are lucky enough to not have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to Covid. Be better.	<p>Also, it&#39;s a scam? Tell that to the almost 3 million who have died globally and the almost 600k who have died in the US including my grandmother. I also contracted it from my Trump supporting, anti mask MIL who showed up unannounced on Xmas and gave my entire family covid. It was horrible. I&#39;m in good health and felt like I was dying. Almost went to the ER. I feel so bad for anyone who died from this disease. These people basically drowned and you&#39;re telling them it was a scam and you not wearing a mask is worth more than their lives. You are truly a horrible person.

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus. It's what everyone was told a year ago.  Booster would be required as the original vaccination would be effective for 6 months or so.	One, the virus mutates because there is what's known as ""Leak By"". This is why there is a new Flu vaccine developed every year. The Flu vaccine does not ""kill"" the Flu virus, so it mutates. This is the same for the COVID  virus. If there was no Leak By, then the vaccine would kill the virus in a couple ""jabs"", and that would be it.	0.871

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.

Idk, 800,000 dead from Covid seems like a pretty good thing to be fearful about. But also many democrats are making the change to saying it may be time to just get it over with, since Omicron doesn‚Äôt seem like the biggest problem once you have it.	<p>Honestly, a few things I see here.  I think there are some conservatives who are going to stand up and say, my individual rights override your unconstitutional mandate.  There&#39;s also a large chunk of African Americans who are not getting vax&#39;ed.  You never hear about the latter.  You hear Biden blaming Trump supporters for not getting vax&#39;ed.  I believe the vax is highly effective at reducing the symptoms and severity of infection and very so-so at best at controlling the spread.  I also think overall, we have like 70% or so vax&#39;ed.  The un-vax&#39;ed are mostly young children and those with naturally acquired immunity.  The percentage of the population with COVID antibodies is likely very high, approaching 90%.</p>	0.835

Biggity makes a valid point. A key word in your response is ‚Äúmostly‚Äù.  Another is ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.

That‚Äôs not how it is supposed to work, no matter what your beliefs or values. Order and rule of law are the basis of our democracy and civil society, and without that, it all eventually falls apart.	<p>Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn‚Äôt matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns. If not, then we just become another failed authoritarian state with no freedom.

Doesn't matter because the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the far left. Therefore, it espouses far left policies. That's why I expect a Republican landslide this November. I'm actually an Independent, but the Democrats have swung so far to the left that I can longer support any of them.	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.  Despite voting for Clinton by a comfortable margin, voters started supporting Republicans on the state level.  The Democratic party blamed (and still does) the whole thing on southern racism or the fictional ""party switch,"" but the plain fact is, the party went in a direction most people didn't want to follow.

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	<p>You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. It&#39;s not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as &quot;left wing&quot; as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant. It stinks of YouTube political commentary, which is oftentimes just laymen ranting.</p>	0.85

I was just pointing out that Democrats were once the more Conservative party, while at their inception Republicans were the more progressive party. I don‚Äôt think 100 years ago the south was a bastion of progressive thinking. Democrats just matched up better with a more conservative way of thinking at the time. I think politicians on both sides are mostly self serving garbage today, but this post doesn‚Äôt paint the full picture of the political landscape during those times.	<p>Hmm that‚Äôs weird considering the last two presidents to rank the economy (Bush and Trump) were REPUBLICAN, while their successors had to clean up their messes.

Matt Walsh actively doesn't know what he's talking about.   You may not agree with her, but she often engages in intellectual conversation.

Anyone else see the hypocrisy of implying Biden has mental issues by quoting a mumbling stooge who was so riddled with Alzheimers during his first term, info was actively kept from him by his closest advisors?  Also, given the state of modern America due to 40 years of 'Reaganism,' the idea of unchecked corporatism has been thoroughly debunked.  P.S. Glad to see so many ostensibly conservative members of this group know the truth about Reagan's 'complicated' (to be polite) history.	<p>This bill is essentially &quot;take most of the shit we got away with last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, everything that conservatives are pissed off over, and make it law.&quot; People wonder why the rift in this country is growing wider and wider?

Just give me some actual hard evidence. All I am seeing is people who were told the election was rigged, so they believed the election was rigged, and they will listen to anyone who says anything in defense of that, but they won‚Äôt listen to anyone who has anything to say against that. People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn‚Äôt change the outcome.

Hello, not a conservative but have a question?  Is the issue with this political in nature (you don‚Äôt think companies should be allowed to do this)? Or personal (you don‚Äôt like that this company is doing this)?  Because this seems to be how a private system is supposed to work. The government rules it can‚Äôt enforce a certain policy, and then the private sector chooses to implement the policy if they deem it to be the best thing for their business.	<p>The government shouldn&#39;t force business&#39;s to provide services to people however I&#39;m not sure that conservatism explicitly prohibits governments from preventing business from doing something. </p>	0.848
Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>When covid first entered the scene and many people said it didn&#39;t worry them because side-effects appeared mild, others chimed in to say that we have to be cautious because we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. Why doesn&#39;t this rationale also apply to the vaccines? You can&#39;t test for something that happens years down the road regardless of how quickly you give it emergency authorization.</p>	0.879

Twitter is a private company and can do what they want.    Go cry about it.	<p>I‚Äôll agree that the virus was lied about and politicized from the start. Trump lied about the severity of the virus and said it would magically go away, he peddled ineffective drugs and harmful home remedies, and blamed everyone else he could. He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines. Everyone here says that the reason the US had so much trouble containing the outbreak is because of our land borders, and this is 100x more of an issue with state borders, except those can‚Äôt be locked down</p>	0.855

It is generally considered a perk of the job that you can park your car wherever and whenever you like in the city with no consequence, contributing massively to the cities congestion. With city employees its bad enough, but when cops do it in their cruisers it creates a sense among the public that cops think they are above the law. It&#39;s a terrible look.</p>	0.793
My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn‚Äôt fascistic.   There is a long history of countries - including the US - requiring foreigners who are entering a sovereign nation - to present medical records, including proof of vaccination.   It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you‚Äôre keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	<p>EDIT: Forgot to add this, but I understand the argument about already having gotten COVID, but the CDC and doctors and other medical experts have all said that getting vaccinated is still recommended for those who have had COVID. Do you trust your gut instinct that you don‚Äôt need the vaccine more than the medical experts?</p>	0.815
The person claiming to be naturally vaccinated is the one who is anti science. We have literal science that shows COVID can fuck your world up and even kill you, after you have had it already.

Lying about the severity of the situation, 2.) Lying about possible treatments 3.) Lying about scientific data 4.) Literally causing superspreader events, and this isn&#39;t even counting the &quot;it&#39;s under control, it&#39;ll be gone by April&quot; lie.

If the rules violate the first amendment, than No. The Left started this fight, you seem supprised that there's bleed-over into the right leaning forums.	That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights.

And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left.

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you‚Äôve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	If the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized because it lessens symptoms, but affords minor protection against infection... what is the point? The entire argument for universal masking for the past year has been to prevent asymptomatic spread. If you still have a high likelihood of catching covid, but a lower propensity to have severe symptoms, the vaccine *encourages* asymptomatic spread.	0.906

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery but was not an abolitionist in the sense of the abolition movement that was growing in the north.</p>	0.842
That is very possible. I try to judge folks on their actions, not what party marker is beside their name. Those in the South were traitors to the nation, I think we can all agree. Any who look to duplicate this in the future would also be labeled traitors.	<p>But when you put it that way. I certainly agree. The punishment someone gets for any given crime should also serve to deter others from doing the same. And there is no place for targeted attacks based on race in this country.

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	cancel culture is forced on us, by using measures to manipulate emotion regardless of ideology. considering personalized advertisements and posts in general on online posts, at best i would have seen maybe two articles from smaller news sources, within a span of a day for most topics of such nature that lean towards my political views. i couldn‚Äôt give a damn less about cancel culture yet for whatever reason, they find any which way to push their narrative whether it be a movie scene/ad or a video game collab. the difference is that this isn‚Äôt forced into your normal day to day life, meaning you‚Äôd never see politics in a child‚Äôs video game, and yes that has happened.	0.846
Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here‚Äôs my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women‚Äôs bathroom.‚Äù It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women‚Äôs bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...    Those irrational wokes are at it again!	<li>Move Overton window as far as possible to prime the argument and limit any foothold your opponent may have (shout your abortion, all guns should be banned, trans women are the same as XX women) </li>	0.805
