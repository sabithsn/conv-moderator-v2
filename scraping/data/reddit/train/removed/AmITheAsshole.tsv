So it's bad that me and my husband want some time with our literally girl alone? I'm not risking my child getting sick. Covid cases are high in Maryland and my kids still actually go into school/ uni. 16 kids in my 17-year-olds school had covid .	<p>Okay, so a bit of background is needed. I (M, 25) had a beautiful baby girl, Emma, when I was a teenager. I was a foster kid and have no family. Emma’s mother passed away after giving birth. When I had her, I knew I wanted to give her the world. So fast forward to 7 years later, I own my own company, work a second job as a bookkeeper, and own multiple houses I rent out for passive income. We do very well for ourselves, Emma goes to a private academy that does half days so she’s in school 8-12:15 and the rest of day she’s with me. Emma is the light of my life and has inspired everything I do. So, the dilemma is that i recently started dating (ever since starting a business I’ve had many prospects but refused to be serious) and I am seeing a wonderful woman, Annie, but we recently got in a disagreement that seems to be brought up again and again. She thinks that Emma and I are too close and Emma needs a mother, siblings, and I need time away. (Emma does have many friends, she’s social, has a play group, goes to sleepovers, and is in therapy and her therapist assured me that Emma is thriving) I kind of yelled at Annie and my friends have said I’m an asshole for not taking her advice and giving Emma distance and letting Annie and I have more private time. We do things together, the three of us have been on a few trips and small weekend getaways. I was planning another small vacation for the three of us as a surprise for Annie’s birthday and when I surprised her she was upset that I included child friendly activities for Emma and that Emma was going at all. She told me she won’t go if Emma is going. We both yelled and now I’m worried I’m an asshole but I’m also concerned that Annie isn’t wanting Emma in our picture. (We do have dates without Emma and day activities, but no getaways as I don’t feel good about leaving my Emma alone) Am I the asshole for this?</p>	0.843
NTA- What an ignorant prick. What happened to you is quite common and it’s not only something you shouldn’t be embarrassed about it’s also something he shouldn’t be making jokes about. Seriously, is he 12?	<p>They were inconsiderate, careless, and selfish. He had a <em>great</em> setup with you, but couldn&#39;t be bothered to do the <strong>only</strong> thing asked of him that was required to make it work. He has nobody to blame for what happened except himself. They were banking on your generosity and on you not holding them accountable for their laziness.</p>	0.822
His son is a moron. Why would you marry someone that cheated on you multiple times and at 21 years old now less. And how is he wrong to make sure that his son is being manipulated into raising someone else bio kid when his girlfriend has once again cheated on him multiple times?	<p>I would personally be grossed out beyond words if any of my kids slept with someone I did. Doesn&#39;t make sense that she&#39;s angry with you.  Also, if he is an affair from 18ish years ago, why does your mom still have his contact info to have you guys meet? Seems suspicious unless she is still seeing him on the side. Also 100% makes no sense to tell you he is your bio dad when you have her husband who treated you as his own. What was the point in that other than to explain why you look different? This just sounds like a Jerry Springer episode.</p>	0.877

This sounds like bs to me. So the aunt is nice enough to leave such an amount of money to each kid but doesn't think about making sure kid number three gets it if something happened? Not buying it. And what were you going to do if the aunt died before your kid's graduation? You are seriously saying no one ever considered thst? 'Sorry love, I know everyone else got money, but lucks is a capricious mistress! You get the shitty basement and loans that will fuck you up for life!'. I don't buy it, this is a shitpost with the ragebait of bullying. You need to think your stories better, people.	<p>Why reconcile with a person like this when she has shown you she doesn&#39;t care about your feelings or your wife&#39;s and twist things around to make herself the victim and berates you about the gift you buy for your own child? Life is too short and you don&#39;t have to put up with it. Leave your mother and your siblings to it. They can deal with her, you don&#39;t have to.</p>	0.905
Good, you are starting off the New Year well then!! What kind of idiot calls someone a gold digger over a $14 meal they didn’t even eat? SMH  The fact he put you down like that and treated you that way is such a major red flag - he was testing your boundaries to see what he could get away with, probably because if you had stayed, he would’ve escalated and become abusive. Good on you for being smart and getting out before any more damage is done. Abusers like to break people down over time, and it looks like that was what he was trying to do.	And then what really did it was earlier today while this roommate was complaining that nobody was interested in that road trip I mentioned that would cost each person a few hundred. I just snapped and said something along the lines of ""Well most of our credit card bills aren't sent to our parents so it's not that easy"" and he just stormed off all mad that I said that. So he's a spoiled man-child, right? I'm holding hope that his parents will get fed up and cut off the credit card one day and the real world will hit him like a bus.	0.867
YTA. It would be different if your two daughters were younger but they’re more than capable of acting independently. They should be allowed to meet your new baby before 2 weeks & also see you before then. I feel you’re treating them like they’re extended family. At the end of the day, it is your choice who sees your new child but I think as your child’s siblings they should be one of the first people to meet them.	<p>Your mother can look after them since she feels it’s so important. She should have planned better. At least some of the relatives of the fathers (or the fathers themselves) should be able to babysit.  She could have borrowed money or taken you up on the babysitting money help. She could take all six kids with her, hire a sitter for a few hours while she’s at the wedding and then come back early. Many options that don’t involve sticking her sister with parenting duties.</p>	0.848

> tell me how that isn’t cheating again?  Are you dense?  There is emotional cheating and physical cheating.  When using the term "Cheating" it is typically addressing physical cheating.  OP state that he "kept things professional" which can be reasonably interpreted as not having any sort of physical contact inappropriate for colleagues.      >you seem to be projecting your insecurities onto me.       You mean my supposed insecurities where I've been in various committed relationships for 2+ decades and only been cheated on a couple of times (both of which I acknowledged that my partner might cheat early on and accepted it as a risk)?  Yeah, there are none of those.       You are the one getting all bent out of shape because you have purposefully mischaracterized what OP said.  The only reason I could see someone so blatantly mischaracterizing a statement is due to their own insecurities. Unless you just didn't read the post....	<p>I understand where your friends are coming from but someone&#39;s past can affect your future together (for example, had she confessed to previously cheating in every relationship but swears she won&#39;t cheat this time, you&#39;d always be on edge. Or if the person has a large and varied sexual history, it&#39;s ok to not feel comfortable about it.) You were both upfront and honest and you know where you both stand.</p>	0.826
NTA at all. Does he realize how common it is to do that? The feeling of having to push is literally the same exact feeling of having a bowel movement, it’s literally nothing at all for any woman to be embarrassed about and I promise you the hospital staff doesn’t give a flying fuck about it. They care about healthy mom and healthy baby, end of story.   Sorry you had to find out after having a baby with this jerk, but your husband is a grade A asshole. My husband never once made me feel embarrassed about anything after birthing our two children and he’s a jokester too…just not a hurtful asshole who likes to humiliate people.	<p>Look, I get it. She&#39;s my mom and she loves me. I love her too, but I can&#39;t handle someone who acts like a clingy girlfriend who I have nothing in common with. I don&#39;t have this problem with dad. He and I could be in utter silence for hours and none of us care about it because we&#39;re both inside our own heads, doing our own thing. Doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t love each other.</p>	0.869
He only forgives her because he doesn't have the self-esteem to seek anyone else.	Your friends are right they don't need your side of the story because it's all excuses and bullshit.  You don't care about your friends if you were waiting to throw that back at them.	0.855
I hate cheaters and everyone taking the side of a cheater is pissing me off.	<p>I hate toxic people in games and absolutely ruins it for the rest. Stupid even with warning people were still asshats towards you. I&#39;d rather lose and have a good time then win and be yelled at/mocked/etc.</p>	0.914
I will.	EXACTLY.	0.883
What a horrible c#*t. Some folk are happy to have a laugh over this kinda stuff, some folk are not. And as for him doing it in front of his family? That's really not on. I'm not happy when my husband talks about our son's birth, because it's a very personal thing, not something to be bandied about at family things. Alas, some people have no filter, and don't know/care when to stop. NTA, OP. Husband needs to be more supportive & less idiotic. I feel so bad for you.	<p>It would be different if OP were saying things like &quot;I know this is a big sacrifice but I talked to him about it and he said he wasn&#39;t willing to break up and thought he could be happy anyway&quot; and &quot;I understand partner says he cares about this kid and misses him, and he can&#39;t have any children in his own relationship. Despite that I&#39;m uncomfortable with it, so I talked to him about his feelings and needs (instead of going behind his back and trying to end it without telling him).</p>	0.909

You should pay for your own wedding and you should return your parents hard earned money, being spent on your education. Don't expect or take other people's money if you cannot respect them. If you don't even have the brains to make sane financial decisions.	<p>NTA for not immediately telling him the exact sum. I’d try this once, tell him that you spend the money you earn on household expenses and your child and that he needs to stop arguing over whether you call it ‘yours’ or ‘ours’. (He wants you to earn less. Why? Doesn’t that mean he needs to pay even more?)</p>	0.873
>Well, yeah. She can't control what other people say but she can for sure say something herself to stand up for her sister. She still had a voice. Instead she chose to stand by and laugh at her sisters misery.  exactly... how come they aren't standing up for the daughter? take the asshole kids to court for what was promised to your daughter?   they advocate for that but then they want to let their daughter get bullied by the aunt's kids.    >She deserved to be punished. No graduation party is a good punishment.   she did. and no it wasn't... it was vindictive and mean to take away a milestone that only happens once in her entire lifetime like that... a more appropriate one would be some community service and volunteering possibly with local anti bullying groups...   >Unfortunately, life isn't fair   so when the daughter loses 40k it's "sometimes life isn't fair" but when someone says a mean comment about the other daughter it isn't "life isn't fair" its "how dare you not stand up for protect and take full responibility for your step sister?"   why aren't they standing up for and protecting their daughter and taking full responsibility for them?   they have no texts at all where the aunt said they wanted to give the check?    >For my daughter, my aunt asked when we'd have the party so she can give the cheque. I told her we weren't planning a party as a consequence. She understood and said she'd bring the cheque when we met up in the future.  there is likely record of this interaction lmfao.   #how can you ask her to do for her stepsister what her parents won't do for her... protect her, fight for her interests....	<p>OP is willing to sue her own daughter for making a false claim to a small following of strangers. However, she doesn&#39;t listen to her daughter or care that her boyfriend has made her feel hurt multiple time in the past. She doesn&#39;t care that her daughter is estranged and has traumas from her own past. But she is willing to bring in the law and screw over her daughter for this unstable boy. </p>	0.915

I think this will be an unpopular opinion, but NAH. I completely see where you are coming from. It seems like you are concerned for your friend's safety. I know a pastor who is in the military and he said that he had a marine in his office who had just gotten back from beating a man to death with his gun. But he was in the fetal position crying because his wife was leaving him. It's serious. And when coupled with ptsd, he could be a danger to himself or others. Your daughter is too young to understand that though, so obviously she is upset. But you can't wait when it comes to mental health. One day your daughter will be old enough to understand that part of it. But I don't think you were wrong. This could have made him stop going to therapy, you kept him from doing that.	<p>Well my own father saw the post and “angry” reacted to it. My mom called me later and told me my dad was really hurt and stated that he really tried to be a good dad etc. and the post made him feel like I was saying he wasn’t a good father. I told my mom I didn’t want to change the post caption. My mother got really upset and told me I was going to give my dad a heart attack. I think I might be the asshole here because it is a little petty to refuse to change a caption for the sake of family harmony. So Reddit am I the asshole? </p>	0.908

NTA Start as you mean to go on. No matter how well-intentioned, if you give in now, and next year, and the next, with each passing year it will become more fixed and hard to change.

Send him a head of cauliflower instead.	<p>When I tried to tell them, &quot;hi I don&#39;t want to eat it&quot; they shut me up with &quot;you didn&#39;t even give the exam&quot; I told them I don&#39;t want to go than, and they are screaming at me calling me ungrateful, this made me wonder if the dinner was for me or they just wanted an excuse for a family dinner, if I went through so much for this marksheet I don&#39;t even get to pick what I want to eat in its celebration?.

Yes I agree, I think. I think I should have just not let the horniness take advantage of me and gain some of my own self control.	(I jest, more or less).  I’ve since learned that it is not a personal statement of disrespect for me, but pretty typical here.  Now, I still think it’s vaguely odd, but I’m not outraged.  I do tend to inherently assume they just don’t want to be bothered with me, so I adjust my expectations of the relationship accordingly.  If I were her, I would be fairly certain you weren’t that interested.</p>	0.855
NTA. Jenna clearly hasn’t changed since high school, despite what she’d like to pretend. And I think it’s pretty rich of her to be offended, seeing as she killed someone.	<p>My friend was cheated on 3 weeks ago. She was and still is really dramatic about it but I honestly don’t think she cared that much. I personally suck at helping others with emotional issues so I was useless while my other friends gave her a lot of. attention. I was happy when I heard we were going to be in the same class this year along with her best friend (another one of my friends) but anytime I said something she was so rude. Im currently in high school btw. She and her best friend apparently have depression, anxiety, go to therapy and cut. </p>	0.847

yes... taking away a once in a lifetime event is never an appropriate punishment unless something egregious happened. not sticking up to bullies isn't what I consider egregious. it's not great and obviously behavior that needs correcting but it's also really common in teens in groups... they just need some course correcting... not taking away a once in a lifetime event from them that celebrates everything they have accomplished.   those mistakes don't negate the achievements...	I honestly don't have a huge issue with him seeing his kids, despite the restrictions, (please don't judge,) because it is his kids afterall. However, they will not come here to see him, because they claim to be worried about getting fined, but I think it's just a conviennent excuse to see dad on their turf, and not have to come here and see me and my kids. They don't seem to be all that worried about dad getting fined.	0.881

I always eat while I cook, both to taste my food in order to make adjustments (when it&#39;s safe) but also just the (safe) raw ingredients because I think look good, but I have the sense to not eat it all before it reaches my families plate, and I wouldn&#39;t lie about it either.

It seems more than just “time off”.  *Time off* is something she plans with her husband. *time off* very Monday morning that she hides from the husband is ridiculous.  The Monday appointment takes priority over the health and safety of a 5 year old - so it’s not “time off”. It’s something fixed and important enough for her to continue regardless of childcare. It’s important enough that her parents are helping her to do whatever activity it is and hide it from the husband. It’s important enough that OPs dad thinks it warrants OP skipping school to mind the kid.  Is she getting therapy? Medical treatment? Taking a class? Working part-time? Organizing her life to get away from an abusive situation? What could it be?  I’m wondering what would warrant that kind of consideration from the parents and behavior from the sister.	<p>From my personal background, I always tried to make sure that my grief never affected my son. And if this were an advice sub, I’d tell OP to do everything she can to support her brother while emotionally protecting her own child. It’s why I draw the distinction between this birthday and the “phase”.  The exclusion of that baby has the impact of preventing her from making bonds with her family. So that’s a big no-go for me. A big family party for one year on a different day? That child isn’t going to care. She’s not going to look at photos one day and say, “You celebrated my first birthday on Saturday and not Friday? How dare you!”  So in that instance, I don’t think it is a huge ask to move the party to a different day as it impacts the child not at all. However, future birthdays can’t be treated that way as she begins to understand birthdays.</p>	0.881

Cause if he decides she's being too big of an asshole, she can enjoy a nice little 1 bedroom apartment after her ass hits grass divorced.	My fiancee and I are in a very similar situation. She makes almost $10/hr less than I do, and we had to finally have a conversation about it recently because she wanted to ""balance"" the percentages of our paychecks going into our shared household account--I'd put in $950 a month and she'd put in $750. What helped was talking bluntly about how she was valuing other input we were both making to the household--we were splitting the bills and such halfway, but I was spending much more on things like groceries or ""fun stuff"" (dining out, pizza night, etc.). I definitely think that if you're serious about each other, socking away the kind of money you are is respectable and shows a real commitment to a more peaceful golden years for you both. If she can't see that, then having a conversation about where she feels she's overpaying her share is going to be important going forward.	0.845

> Most people don’t get the easy option.  they don't... and if their parents gave it to their siblings and withheld it from them that would breed resentment...   op has a choice to die on this hill or have a relationship with his daughter.   and let's not act like she deserved this for laughing at things other people said. nobody knows why she laughed. she wasn't bullying someone. and might have been nervous or scared herself about standing up to the bullies. she is also only a 17 year old girl and shouldn't be expected to be the schools white knight. it sucks people said mean things about the step sister but let's not villify another teenager for not knowing how to handle it properly like it makes them literally hitler.	<p>I am not a psychologist but you don&#39;t have to be to connect the dots and realize your 14 YO sister believes her thoughts and feelings are not being paid attention to and that is why the end of this song bothers her so much. Part of that is probably normal because of her age but how is her relationship with your parents and do you ever have real heart to heart talks with her? Based on how you reacted to her over this song she probably feels even more validated  about being ignored.</p>	0.911

I've co-signed these loans for her because I feel terrible about it. I've tried talking to her about it and how I wish it hadn't gone this way but she's completely iced all of us out.  no that's not what I said... they put her in debt and said "oopsie poopsie" lol.   my plan was to make an actual commitment to showing with my actions that I'm sorry...   that's the difference buddy.	It’s funny reading this story because I had a similar experience with my husband’s mom because she kept trying to push us to buy an extremely overpriced house that would have stretched us out financially and made us house poor. I had enough and told her to stay out of our business. Well, my husband got angry at me and told me I had to apologize to her. I never did and thankfully I no longer have to deal with her.

cosigning the loans is not committing to help clear the debt unless she defaults and trashes her credit first...   that's gross.	<p>Based on what you are saying, she would not qualify for a loan, so taking you off the mortgage is a moot point.</p>	0.853
ok. you've made enough points to me. I have nothing to say to you and would appreciate if you'd stop harassing me across this thread because I have a different opinion.	I don't even care about the clarification here, like I already said you didn't do what I was trying to describe.

OP I believe if you also talked about sex alongside periods, a mild YTA.  Yes 11 is late. Yes your aunt should have taken care of it by that age. Yes kids ask a lot of questions. But I think you overstepped and violated your aunt and her family's choices. Even if they're wrong, your cousin still isn't your child. You should have passed the questions about what is sex and left it to your aunt and told your cousin to ask her mother about x and y. Knowing that it's natural would have been adequate to calm her down enough to wait for her mom.	<p>At this meeting you can ask about allergies and other medical conditions, house rules, and go over your rates. Any good parent should insist on meeting you first anyway...who just leaves a teenager they&#39;ve never met before alone with their kids? Think about that. I bet this lady would have also stayed out later than agreed and/or tried to stiff you in the end with a guilt trip about how you&#39;re charging too much. She&#39;s not worth your time.</p>	0.901

Thanks you for your comment. Im already living my life, i just don’t want the money but I’m feeling really guilty depraving my family from it	<p>I think I’m the asshole because I was inflexible. People are always saying life is more than work and now that my wife left, I feel it weighting in me. I think I would be unhappy leaving everything I worked for but maybe I could have done it again and maybe I should have been a better husband after all family is important but in my country sons and daughters are expected to look after their parents so I could have just been selfish.</p>	0.884
That is certainly a more complicated question isn't it?    >It’s really unfortunate that her behavior indirectly led to this because her party was canceled.  and she said it was out of her control what other people do... just like it was out of the parent's control that she doesn't get her check.   the difference is she gets punished... hard. meanwhile the parents get to hand wave it away with a cool "it wasn't my fault"   .... you have to see the hypocrisy here right?   beyond that.... regardless of what you think... it's about being the bigger person than your 17 year old kid.   there are ways to fix it. they may not be able to hand over 40k now... but they probably could before she has to start paying those student loans... better start saving.	<p>Then to compound the situation, rather than apologize to you and to the family of the child whose appointment you missed, asshole mom filed a negative review of you BECAUSE YOU WOULDN&quot;T DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU DON&quot;T DO.   She has the audacity to blame you for her situation, caused only by her actions and intentional failure to comply with the agreement, and then wants to harm your reputation and ability to earn a living.   It wasn&#39;t like she ran out for an emergency or was on her way back and got into an accident that delayed her.  She just didn&#39;t plan or manage her time well and expects you to suffer the consequences.  Be sure to respond to her negative comments or feedback if you can that what transpired is solely due to her irresponsible noncompliant conduct.

Their punishment was no graduation party. The lack of a check is due to the person planning on gifting it fucking dying. The daughter is still going to college which is more than a lot of people get and stepdaughter is going to end up in the exact situation because the parents are doing what they can and the lack of that previous money is not due to the parents lack of care its due to the person who actually gave it again, dying. I guess the parents lack of being able to read the future ala thats so raven and still making it work for her is such a fucking betrayal.	<p>Throughout college my mom would threaten me financially that she would stop supporting me if I didn’t wish Will a happy Father’s Day and get him a card each year. Once I finally graduated and became financially independent from her, I decided that I do not care about Father’s Day. I don’t have someone in my life who was ever a father figure in my opinion. He helped me move states but that’s only because my mom forced him to because she couldn’t, and when I asked him to help me put furniture together, he lost his shit.

Yes.  And every piece of evidence regarding omicron has shown that it is milder.  Less able to survive in the lungs, and that previous infection or vaccination increases the likelihood that it will be very mild.    Also, this is what viruses do.  They mutate.  They usually also mutate to be more contagious, and less severe.  As it is in the best interests of a virus to have a walking talking host, spreading a mild version, than an incapacitated host, spreading it to no one.    Despite what media scaremongering will have us believe, this mutation is a good thing.  Naturally acquired antibodies are as good (sometimes better) than vaccination acquired immunity (though vaccination is of course essential for those immunocompromised or those who feel it would benefit them).  But demonising people who are choosing to wait for other options (such as novavax for one example)  or claiming that this mutation is the worst thing ever, is just not accurate.	Abuse generally doesn’t start outright awful - it’s calculated and starts small, so you get used to it incrementally. It seems like he’s planting those seeds now. You’re pushing back and he’s punishing you - that’s not a good sign. I could be wrong - this could be a one off, and I know the pandemic is making people wonky, but there are signs that it could be more than that.	0.806

He obviously did it to get a rise out of you which not only proves that is an immature idiot but a petulant child as well.   That being said, the way you explain his little outburst seems so natural and instinctual of him that I totally believe you that he'd eat the same way at home.  Honestly why are you even with him? With how petty you make him seem I can't imagine he'd be any different or any sort of good guy material.  I'd imagine you'd be cleaning up after him a lot as well considering the slop he might leave behind after he eats. Not assuming anything but just making an educated guess.   I thought it was bad enough that my Dad could go to an Olive's Garden Italian Restaurant and ask the waiter for Mexican Horchata when prompted for a drink but your guy takes it to a whole new level. If I were you it'd take a serious look at my relationship and wonder if you're this guy's gf or his mother.	Your father's reaction when you didn't make scrambled eggs exactly the way he wants them was breathtakingly cruel, especially his aside to your brother. I can see why you snapped at them.

A dinner she didn't order because he ATE HERS !!!!!!!!, then asks her for the $10 for the dish he left her with, that she could not eat (she hated Cauliflower Rice).	But yesterday my mom told me I'm not allowed to bake desserts because my sister will see the rest of us eating and feel angry and resentful and she'd want to eat too. She's 5 years old and therefore loves junk food but it's obviously easier for her to abstain from eating it when it's not in front of her in the first place. My mom usually just buys her those organic sugar-free granola bars and cookies, and she told me that the only thing I'm allowed to bake is a plain cake recipe (tastes like cardboard) that she usually makes every weekend or so. We don't have the ingredients for artificial sweeteners or those complicated dairy-free recipes.

I get that Luisa was an ungrateful 20 year-old and got mad that the car that her brother was given was nicer than hers.  I get that OP said that the price of the wedding he paid for her + her car was more expensive.  I get that the whole breaking point of this was Luisa saying ""Treat us equally or we're no longer family"" an then Luisa just broke contact with OP and is now only coming back because she's about to lose her home.	0.883

NTA, your bf is TA for not training his dog properly, and bringing his dog unannounced and having the audacity to tell you to put your pets away in your own home? That's a huge red flag.

In his eyes, I was being very selfish and was only worried about myself. He said that when he gets his results back and he turns out negative he will break up with me and personally come here to get his dog (who my family and I have been taking care of as he&#39;s been too busy with work to take care of the dog and the dog has always been left alone at home in a very polluted area).

personally, my kids would always have a safe home with me no matter where they go. And i would never make my child pay rent in the one place that they are most comfortable. This world is already harsh and expensive to live in so why make it harder for your child over 350$? She didnt ask to be in this world. You should be teaching her the value of money and what it could do for her herself, not taking it from her for your own needs. Your responsibility is that home and them kids no matter what.	<p>Offer her your love and support but be firm that you will not let her live rent free and raise a baby in your home. She and the baby&#39;s father can figure out what to do. If neither are capable of raising a child then the child will be removed from her home. Be honest with her.

It was tactical and he was setting the precedent for the rest of your time living together. He wanted to break you down but he didn’t count on you having the backbone to leave.

nah but you both sound kinda stupid (and i mean that in the best way) but its so easy to learn how to jump start a car. ask a mechanic to show you/ explain once and you're done. youtube is another great source.	<p>It is ok for her to make it a business - but she is likely ruining his hobby for him.

well if he was 40k in the whole the kid would have the money and probably wouldn't hate op.   op could fix this by having an honest talk with the daughter and committing to helping pay off the debt... not just cosigning so he's forced to if she blows her credit...	He&#39;s asking to live for less than half the rent when he makes less than half the income as her. This will help him better pay bills, reduce any debt he has, and meet savings goals. (At least, that&#39;s how I would hope he approaches it). All of which will only help both of them in the future.</p>	0.829

I feel that I am taking crazy pills, he is 21 years old and is marrying someone that cheated on him multiple times but I am the only godamn person seeing that is a massive red flag? How in the hell is the grandpa wrong for DNA testing his grandchild when his son is blind as a bat to a manipulator? And all these reddit weirdos are saying YTA? OP's son is going to be divorced in 5 years or less calling it now.	Hi, I'm an 18 year old male, when I was about 4 years old my dad started shooting heroin and decided to abandon our family (my mum, me and my 3 sibling). 99% of the time he doesn't even cross my mind but sometimes when I'm showering it will hit be like a tonne of bricks and I'll just breakdown crying, while contemplating how my life could've been different if he were in it, he tried to make contact when I was 16 but I refused and told my mum if I were to see him I would kill him, and I'm not sure if I'm the asshole as yes it was 12 years to late he still tried to be apart of my life. Because of the fact he left us and my mum's relationship after (which lasted from me been 11 until 15 years old) that ended with her bf leaving (1 really looked up to him and basically modelled my personality from his as he was the closest thing to a dad I had ever known) I now have trust issues and trouble connecting with people because I don't want to get hurt (It's so bad I stopped telling my mum I love her because she said it back and I just started crying one time so I guess I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not reaching out even if it was just for some closure for myself or if what I've done is right. I don't want to be mentally hurt by him again as I feel my connection and trust issues would fuck me up. Thanks	0.889
then it does not matter why the party was canceled. losing out on the money to start her life is not appropriate.	<p>Whatever you call it, you have no obligation to give her anything since you are not getting what you were trading for. Since you aren’t getting free rent you need to sell the stuff to make up for the loss.</p>	0.862
The dad is the asshole for marrying her. Some people are too damaged to be parents. People who mate with such damaged people are enablers who are creating a new generation of damaged folks	<p>Pretty sure you were forced into something because you love someone and wanted to make them happy. And it seems like now that they got what they wanted, they realized it really wasn&#39;t what they wanted. Your husband is to blame here. I&#39;m sorry this is happening. Because in the end, that child is going to suffer most. He just walked out on his pregnant, emotionally charged wife. That he forced into this very situation. He sounds like a child himself.</p>	0.871

OP you weren't wrong but I don't think that you should have got involved. I fully understand you supporting your gf.  However, I do think that it's time for gf sister to pay her share of household expenses now	<p>I don’t blame you for separating the money. One time is enough. Next time it will be more. Sister doesn’t care that she’s driving a wedge between you and your wife. I hope your wife wakes up</p>	0.883
Yea totally OP's fault. They should have predict the aunt passing. /s   Life ain't fair. OP has no fault in this AT ALL. The punishment of canceling the graduation party is totally acceptable when it comes to bullying. How could OP have known the aunt would pass? He was just supposed to have 40k stashed away "In case the aunt passed"? Yea right. Your responses reek of privilege and someone who's disconnected from reality. He literally cosigned loans, mentioned he will helpw this expenses and is allowed her to love into the basement for a better living situation. The other daughter won't be getting a check from the aunt in her future either, so neither one of them will have that advantage.	<p>Thank you for standing up to a bigot!  Tell your mom that if she can&#39;t stand up for what&#39;s right then she can take herself out with the trash and go NC.  Your father doesn&#39;t deserve anything other than exactly what you called him because that&#39;s exactly what his pathetic ass is.</p>	0.87
DO NOT VEMO HIM BACK ever!   He deserves it for being a jerk and eating YOUR food in front of people.   Girl, congratulations… it’s the new year and you’re already shedding extra unnecessary weight/load off!!! 😉.   Keep it up.	<p>I was a picky eater once, when I caused a fuss I was told to either eat what is given to me or not expect to eat anything until the next meal. The lengths that people will go to justify spoiling their children never ceases to amaze me.</p>	0.835
I am because I am looking at the full picture and realizing he is a 21 year old KID that is marrying someone who has cheated on him multiple times. How do you think it is going to work out? Grandpa is not the asshole.	<p>Also, OP, I was my husband’s first serious girlfriend. We met not long before his 26th birthday. Not having a partner right now doesn’t mean you won’t ever have one. It sucks to be alone and lonely - I’ve been there. But it doesn’t have to be permanent. </p>	0.803
my favorite part is all of them calling me a kid for reasonably noting that op's relationship with their daughter hangs in the balance over this.	<p>You and your partner need therapy and basic parenting classes. Love isn&#39;t about paying for her to do stuff, it&#39;s about showing her how appreciated and cared for she is and that she is an amazing special girl no matter what. My daughter could turn out to be thick as two short planks and I won&#39;t care because I love her. As long as she is happy and tries, I am happy. </p>	0.86
So, basically, you’re proving OP’s assertion that eurotrash are a bunch of smug twats? Let me guess— you’re a Parisian.	So dear redditors AITA for spamming this morally questionable company at their whatsapp lines?	0.719
ESH. Jenna sucks for being a bully, but do you just love drama? Why even entertain a conversation with someone you clearly don't like and think was a bully? Why not walk away, end the conversation, say you're busy, etc? I get it, but adding in the jab where you included her daughter seemed like you were just looking for drama with an old high school bully.	<p>Also, I don&#39;t wanna say your friend is an A H because I <em>know</em> what being in a toxic/abusive relationship is, and honestly, we sometimes do not realize until its either too late or someone takes us out by force, so maybe try talking to her and explain her why you dont want him there, not only the red flags but explaining how this also affects you. (although if you already explained and she still got angry at you, then she totally is a ahole)</p>	0.896
NTA. Sorry you’re married to a child.   PS - Pooping is 109% normal, lots of women do it. It’s actually a sign you’re pushing, or “bearing down” the correct way.	<p>It&#39;s great that your sister had an easy baby. Some babies are content most all the time, some scream nonstop. Every baby is different. Stop assuming the parent is just not trying. You have no idea how hard it is to be a parent, especially to a high needs baby.</p>	0.813
yeah it's really unfortunate. I just OP reads all the comments and not just the ones at the top that say they've done nothing wrong and are a golden boy who the daughter should beg for forgiveness.   it's just insane.	<p>I know he didn&#39;t mean it maliciously but it was so abrupt from a sweet kid that I absolutely adored who adored me that it hurt more than I could even process. My husband had him apologise to me right away and he looked so confused. </p>	0.849
First of all I am glad that in all this mess the dads are competent at least. That is awsome and well done to both your dad and Bob for doing exactly what needs to bee done.  OP you are a child, a grown child, but you mom's kid, not your mom's servant or live in nanny. Your younger siblings should have never been your responsibility and it was extremely kind if you to devote so much time in raising them. But no OP, your mom should either have a nanny or at least pay you to professionally watch them. That's time taken out of your day, studies and productive time you could spend creatively and with friends as teens should do.  Not to mention how your mom puts her boyfriend over her own child, takes away her personal space and allows said boyfriend to massively overstep here. You've been civil and way more mature than your grown ass adult mother! You did the right thing and removed yourself from an unpleasant situation.   She decided to procreate about 10+ years since she had you and she should have been mothering her own kids instead of passing that role to her teenage daughter who should be out having fun with her friends being a "stupid" teenager with nit a care in the world. You should be allowed to do mistakes at this age, explore the world, sneak a ship of beer and find that to be the coolest thing you can do, being "sooo baaaaad". But actually just being young, and allowed to be a child and live without major responsibilities for as long as you can. I'm 27, turning 28 and I can't believe how fast 10 years past me by. Feels like yesterday I was being so baaaaad telling my mom I'll just go downtown and actually going to hang out with boys in the next town over, feeling that's so cool and edgy or whatever teens call it in 2021.  Your and incredible daughter and sister! NTA, your mom 5/5 assholes! she should grow up and take care of her own responsibilities!	<p>NTA obviously. You have been VERY generous with your siblings and their kids, and VERY sensitive to the situation--hence waiting to give the Switches until after the others had left. Your brother had no right to complain about ANYthing, no business commenting on YOUR gifts to YOUR kids you paid for YOURSELF and gave to them not even in his presence, and CERTAINLY no right to bring up the fact that the kids aren&#39;t biologically yours. He needs to take several seats and be grateful he has a generous brother like you.</p>	0.903
