Why would you have *fixations* on women? Is it because you're only used to dealing with people online, and actual human contact is difficult for you?	Is that likely? It doesn‚Äôt matter.	0.82
No it wasn‚Äôt who ever said that? It‚Äôs supposed to stop deaths and hospitalizations and guess what it‚Äôs done? Covid isn‚Äôt going away because we didn‚Äôt stop it quick enough. Y‚Äôall are so uninformed yet so confident it‚Äôs scary	<p>Personally, my biggest gripe about all of this is the lack of in-person learning at college campuses - and if we expand this to ALL people, my biggest gripe was the ineffective and detrimental shutdowns.

‚Äú‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who is in the Oval Office, whether it‚Äôs President Trump, President Biden or some other Republican or Democrat. Either one of them would have been greeted by the higher prices we saw this year," De Haan said, reiterating the current price surge is a direct result of the pandemic upending supply and demand.‚Äù  This has been annoying me for so long. I get high gas prices are annoying, but this simply isn‚Äôt the fault of any President. Not a good thing, but also something apolitical, and it‚Äôs a bad look on conservatives that we‚Äôre so up in arms about it.	<p>Having sex to evaluate partners?

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you‚Äôre less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It‚Äôs been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it‚Äôs a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you‚Äôll get less sick, and you‚Äôre less likely to get sick. Same thing applies here.	<p>I fucking hate tankies.</p>	0.864
Ewwww. . .I mean, I'd take a second glance at her leaked nudes, but date her? She got me fucked up. It's not socially acceptable to date someone with a significantly lower IQ than me.

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn‚Äôt have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn‚Äôt ‚Äúleaving behind‚Äù her constituents, because she‚Äôs still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she‚Äôs traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don‚Äôt even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn‚Äôt a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù and it‚Äôs straight up awful.	<p>I wonder if they&#39;re running for office with the expectation of that job paying off their loans.

Listen she‚Äôs a gigantic piece of shit, but she was never charged with assaulting a police officer.	‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through December 20, 2021.

No worries, Happy New Year.	<p>But they fail to address the <em>reasons</em> for these phenomena. Or reason. One. It&#39;s <em>hard</em> to make a profit in certain places. There are a few businesses that can do it...discount stores work in poor areas because people can actually afford their wares. Smaller packaging works because people don&#39;t tend to have large homes or own vehicles in some of these neighborhoods, so even without the question of affording large quantities (with lower per-unit-volume prices), there&#39;s a practicality aspect. </p>	0.803

Guns are everything to them.

Bad shit happened that day. People broke the law. People died. And it was a tremendous failure of government and law enforcement.

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that ‚ÄúHonor the Confederacy‚Äù. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can‚Äôt find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don‚Äôt want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don‚Äôt represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it‚Äôs hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>LoL....

Use the ‚Äúclimate crisis‚Äù as a means to garner more control. They hate nuclear because it can actually solve fossil fuel dependency.

The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.

Hey, if you‚Äôre on board to have the government ban smoking, then I‚Äôm with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let‚Äôs go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn‚Äôt know much about Covid, and when we weren‚Äôt prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they‚Äôre helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don‚Äôt get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	> She's 15. 15 year olds do dangerous stupid and malicious shit all the time, sometimes with disastrous consequences.	0.707

I prefer to be healthy in my "great free state". Getting into a car accident that isn't your fault and results in hundreds of thousands of medical bills doesn't scream "FREE" to me.

Only time I have had a power outage in the last 20 years it didn't last for longer then 4 hours.

So going to Florida is synonymous with agreeing with desantis?

The Daily Caller article doesn't clarify, but looking at other media reports about this, it seems this is in reference to Nahui Ollin. Now, unlike the In Lak Ech thing, Nahui Ollin DOES draw from Aztec (though ""Aztec"" is sort of an imprecise term, on that note: It can mean the broader Nahua civilization; the specific subgroup of Nahuas, the Mexica, who founded the city of Tenochtitlan; or the alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan and their collective subject/vassal states, which is the ""Aztec Empire"": The different Nahuas had roughly similar beliefs, but still had some differences, while the differences between a Nahua vs a Maya vs a Zapotec vs a Totonac city's beliefs/culture would be even greater. Also, the ""Aztec Empire"" didn't directly manage or rule it's subjects, so each city inside it kept it's own beliefs, customs, and laws) rather then Maya religion... though again, with dubious connections, and it's not a prayer.	0.787
Is anyone else getting banned in other subreddits for posting here?	<p>When you lose the truth what&#39;s left? I&#39;m very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn&#39;t work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren‚Äôt for masks. I know very few who haven&#39;t gotten vaccinated, but those who haven&#39;t still wear masks. They&#39;re irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.</p>	0.894

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>Increasing taxes on people is just a stupid idea in general.

In addition, Florida had a high portion of cases due to travel and NYC cases were centralized around residency meany that Floridas death didnt stay inside their state but their cases were reported there. NYC covid victims got sick and died in their state. Florida also benefited from having a younger demographic be a large portion of their exposure.

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.

(Un/)forunately, the freedoms granted to us by this country allow the individual to decide. Now are there restrictions, well yes, but ultimately if you don&#39;t want the vaccine, no one is putting a gun to your head like <em>other</em> countries. However, the free market also dictates that companies are allowed to require you to have the vaccine as a term of employment (for the reasons above, but mostly due to cost and liability). As a result, the market <em>has</em> dictated that requiring the vaccine is the best financial move. If you don&#39;t agree with that, you&#39;re more than welcome to form a competitor.</p>	0.826

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There‚Äôs small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it‚Äôs just so important for us to remember that we‚Äôre protecting ourselves, but we‚Äôre also protecting those little ones who aren‚Äôt yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing:¬†US pediatric hospital admissions for¬†Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334¬†children¬†have been admitted to the hospital with¬†Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.¬†	<p>Like where does president even go from there?</p>	0.831

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they‚Äôve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don‚Äôt have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it‚Äôs effects, then make another choice and see it‚Äôs effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary?

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn‚Äôt between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups.

The Daily Caller article doesn't clarify, but looking at other media reports about this, it seems this is in reference to Nahui Ollin. Now, unlike the In Lak Ech thing, Nahui Ollin DOES draw from Aztec (though ""Aztec"" is sort of an imprecise term, on that note: It can mean the broader Nahua civilization; the specific subgroup of Nahuas, the Mexica, who founded the city of Tenochtitlan; or the alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan and their collective subject/vassal states, which is the ""Aztec Empire"": The different Nahuas had roughly similar beliefs, but still had some differences, while the differences between a Nahua vs a Maya vs a Zapotec vs a Totonac city's beliefs/culture would be even greater. Also, the ""Aztec Empire"" didn't directly manage or rule it's subjects, so each city inside it kept it's own beliefs, customs, and laws) rather then Maya religion... though again, with dubious connections, and it's not a prayer.	0.797

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%.

True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>Leftism is a disease that destroys everything it touches.</p>	0.718
That statement is at the very least ambiguous. It wont stop infection or transmission, wich was never stated as fact (at least over here in the Netherlands) but hospitalization and death can certainly be prevented.	<p>It‚Äôs like an almond grove out there‚Ä¶nuts are everywhere.</p>	0.67
Bro it's MY car not yours.  I own the car, I make the rules, no smoking in my car.  I do not have to let you smoke in my car just because you want to.  My right to not breath the poison gas supercedes your right to make the poison gas in this case because it's my personal space you're invading not the other way around.  Don't be selfish and think that the only rights and freedoms that matter are your own, especially because they are in direct conflict with mine and others.  Are you one of those conservative in name only people who does the "rules for thee but not for me!" bullcrap?  You just stated that loving thy neighbor isn't a conservative tenant?!?! Holy crap that's backwards, do you actively hate your neighbors then.  What happened to real conservatives???	<p>But in this case, the city was only too eager to throw everyone they could under the bus.</p>	0.744
Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.

I‚Äôd like the alderthemthey and all who voted for themthey to do exactly that.	<p>To me it looks like repealing it would mean you get banned by Joe Biden instead of Jack Dorsey, as it would give the government tons of power to control social media and right now honestly they are all on the same side</p>	0.853

Maybe if you lose weight, you wouldn‚Äôt have sleep apnea anymore. You‚Äôre probably morbidly obese that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt even breathe when you sleep. Is that why you‚Äôre so grouchy? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	<p>Under Biden: Russia shuts down major US pipeline. Postures to invade Ukraine again.</p>	0.811

negligent homicide gets jail time, whether they deserve jail time depends on whether they pose a significant ongoing threat to society. jails are built to protect the public not to get revenge on people who make mistakes.	<p>It&#39;s like so you want all the people who feel and probably are completely healthy and covid free to go a testing site.......the one place where COVID positive people have definitely been...to get tested by someone who&#39;s been in direct contact with multiple COVID positive patients all day......wonder how many people contracted covid at the testing sites</p>	0.834
If this fucking idiot runs again you might as well hand the white house over to the Democrats right now	The one and only claim I have made, is that: you are in err when you say ""The election was clearly not fraudulent"". Providing no proof thereafter, whilst criticizing someone for making a claim without proof. That's a hypocrisy that could be, and should be easily reconciled.	0.835

Lol. "No it isn't, but if it was it would be democrats." It is clearly political, it is the flag for a military unit. It is by definition politics.   The conservative movement didn't used to be identified with the Confederacy until it chose to continue to prop up hateful losers like Marjorie Taylor Greene.   There used to be real conservative policy makers and now instead of promoting real ideas conservatives are left with just trying to lie.	<p>What is your point?</p>	0.826
Idk, 800,000 dead from Covid seems like a pretty good thing to be fearful about. But also many democrats are making the change to saying it may be time to just get it over with, since Omicron doesn‚Äôt seem like the biggest problem once you have it.	<p>Easy, they have half-wit viewers.</p>	0.739
