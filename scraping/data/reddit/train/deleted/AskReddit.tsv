Rap is made by low iq people for low iq people	On a side note, when I was that little shit's age, I was being bullied by a kid at school and the teachers did nothing.

Bye snowflake.	<p>A good friend of mine was attacked by her machete-wielding husband.

He had been acting more and more unstable for months, so she bought a pistol and got her license to carry it. He attacked her because she served him divorce papers. He just reached into the corner, grabbed the machete and swung in about a second. He was going to kill her for trying to divorce him and get away from him.

Lol	<p>You see, when you are fat, you are usually stretching your stomach with every big meal. Over time, your stomach gets bigger than average. Then, when you diet, you have a large empty stomach and that can add to your feelings of hunger which are unpleasant. But if you fill up on water or fiber, you can offset this temporarily. Over time of eating smaller portions and working out, your body will naturally shrink your stomach down to match this new diet a bit better, so smaller portions will make you feel more full!</p>	0.806
[Maybe the answer can be found at postmandeliveries.]	<p>My theory is that most of the people will order at least one meal because people have developed irrational ideas about what it means to starve, and even though they know they&#39;ll be done in 5 days and that there is no way they&#39;ll die or really have anything happen to them except feeling shitty, their mind will convince them that their life is in danger. </p>	0.858

The point is that gender and sex meaning different things is not an objective fact. It is a definition created by a small group of sexologists that has gained *some* support and common use, but I would be willing to bet that the majority of English speakers (going beyond the Reddit/Twitter bubble) think of gender and sex as being the same thing. So linguistically, your definition certainly can count as an alternative definition, but the word has certainly not undergone a full shift in definition.  And there was no "discovery" that gender and sex are different things. A few sexologists just up and decided that from now on gender meant gender identity, and sex meant biological sex. And that's the thing, we already had a perfectly good term: gender identity. Why do we need to change the meaning of the word gender?	<li><p>Suetonius and Pliny the Younger (112 CE, governor of Bithynia) both call the idea that Jesus was raised from the dead a &quot;mischievious superstition&quot; and a &quot;disease.&quot; Suetonius records Hadrian blaming a person named &quot;Chrestus&quot; (commonly considered to be in reference to Christ) for &quot;disturbances,&quot; namely not worshipping idols and loving everyone, including their tormentors. In a work that was not his biography, Suetonius also talks about the fire in 64 CE which Nero blamed the Christians for, and then his new punishment for them became burning them alive in his garden. Pliny suggested methods for dealing with the Christians to Trajan.</p></li>	0.769
This is true, but many trans women are shorter than many cis women. If height is the real issue, then why are we talking about gender at all? Not to mention that hormone levels in trans women are tightly controlled, which is not the case for cis women. This means that many cis athletes actually have *higher* testosterone levels than their trans counterparts. As it stands, the current regulations are working, and rather than seeing trans women dominate (as some would have you believe), we actually see trans women winning less often than their cis counterparts, even when adjusted for population size.  In the end, this is an issue that has been basically solved already, and is mostly just being used as a culture war issue to win seats for politicians.  One more side note: "a transgender" is not really the preferred wording. It comes across a little dehumanizing, like saying "a black" to refer to a black person. Transgender is an adjective, so it doesn't really work as a noun like that. I am not "a transgender", I am a transgender woman (or a trans woman, or even just a woman).	Except Chili Mac.

You're not even man enough to walk away from a comment you dislike.	<p>Probably because the obvious follow up question to this (in my head at least) would be &quot;anything in particular you like?&quot; Because of the stigmatisation of being overweight, there&#39;s a bit of a worry that complimenting a woman for their curves might be interpreted as &quot;you&#39;re fat but still kinda hot&quot; or just as negging. I think a lot of guys latched on to &quot;thicc&quot; because it&#39;s explicitly intended as a compliment for that particular body type, even if it is a bit of a crude one</p>	0.714

Your mum	Jeff Bezos made jobs, yes. They are mostly bad job, those ""claims"" have been substantiated over and over. He could make things better for his employees, pay them more, better benefits, better conditions, more employees to share the load, but it would cost him more money, so he doesn't. It is more affordable for him to run anti-union campaigns and just churn through employees, use them until they break then hire new ones, than make things better for those he already has. They didn't ask for that job, they *needed* a job and he controlled the only one available to them. You can afford to make those other arrangements, someone making $10 at 38 hours so they don't get insurance can't. Their livelihoods are held hostage by the man who controls their jobs, because he pays them the bare minimum to keep them in their place: more than other place, less than they need to get out. That is exploitation.	0.85
Doing alright	Now the two biggest reasons probably are that I end up loving people who don’t give two shits about me. They like what I am able to do for them, but they never actually want to just be with me.

What is the difference? They're all connected! I'll call a plumber right now!	China invades Taiwan, America defends Taiwan. China is taking heavy losses, so they invade a nearby japanese island so they have a foward base closer to Taiwan. Which brings Japan into the war (which doesn&#39;t bother China that much since Japan was already sending data and supplies to US troops. Also Japan has a defense agreement with the US anyway).	0.743

Problem is trans individuals make up less than 0.5% of the population or as much as 3% of the population depending on age.  So how does one make it fair when the total number of athletes means there's only 3 or 4 trans people?  You can't even make a basketball team with those kinds of numbers.

Then even after she apologizes she was like, I was so afraid of losing you and the family. Like what? What does even make sense.
