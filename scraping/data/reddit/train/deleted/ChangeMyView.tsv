How about not having such a combattive tone?	As for the problem I have with that second article, I think that using non-standard chromosomal arrangements to argue that sex is anything but binary is a mistake. Evolution doesn't care about chromosomes, evolution only cares if your genitals work. So from an evolutionary perspective, your biological sex is about your genitals, not your chromosomes. And the fact remains that there are only two gamete types, sperm and egg. Every human that has ever existed produces one of these two, with the exception of some intersex people, who may produce both. But understand that producing both does not constitute evidence that sex is not binary. Even intersex people are limited to sperm and egg. There is no third gamete, there is no third sex."	0.853

Elon Musk sold off a lot of Tesla stock in the days before Tesla recalled nearly a half million cars. If that’s not the hallmark of a hero, I don’t know what is.   Edit: *insider trading* autocorrected to *a hero*	There isn't a single minority that hasn't felt the bigotry of low expectations and it generally isn't a concept associated with 'conservatives'.  It's generally a concept associated with those who believe they are being sympathetic,  but they aren't, they are just infantalizing groups of people because ""Oh they can't handle a team named ""Indians"" (especially considering the origins of most of these teams was not negative in context in the first place and never was).	0.829
It's such a small % that actually get offended, and in most of these cases, the one offended isn't even part of the "appropriated group"; but rather, acting on their behalf.   I think the entire outrage stems from sensationalism of media, and making clicks for $$$.   The people that "ban" the expression of cultures are likely afraid of media backlash.	<p>Infections are the most philosophical illness. Our bodies are host to billions of organisms. Some coexisting, living off our detritus and plucking back some of our entropy that way. Many, the ones we call pathogens, have the capacity to evade our front line of defense and make us sick. Mostly we fight these off, but sometimes we don&#39;t. There are chemicals which kill these, but not us. They might harm us, and they certainly harm the other organisms on our body, but on balance, if we kill them (by the immune system or antibiotics) we survive. </p>	0.866

https://youtu.be/J3ES2Fp_MsU	<p>To demonstrate my skill in IT, and get the job I have right now, I had to take a bottom of the barrel entry-level job, and be the reliable guy who could save a trip to the IT guy whenever there was a problem and he wasn&#39;t at the office for just short of 3 years. After 3 years, I finally was offered an internship-like week with the IT guy, where he basically had me do jobs he felt every IT should be able to do, while he was handling the bigger messes, and after double-checking each of my task before committing them for about a week, I was to return to my normal position, which the main IT guy saw as a shame, and thus within the month, I was officially promoted to IT, and he was promoted to IT Senior.</p>	0.812
The phrase "gender identity" might be somewhat recent, but we have data about people identifying with various genders that dates well over a thousand years.  By the way, the term "constructive conversation" doesn't mean just lying down and accepting whatever factually false bullshit some random bigot on the internet throws at you. It is reasonable to continue the conversation without pretending as if the wrong transphobic bullshit you write was true.	<p>For example trying teach a six month old to sleep in their own bed takes only a week and they will cry during this time.

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society).

You claim to have heard it all, but fail to address their arguments. Interesting	>Because violence also deligitimizes agreements and thus the real source of power.

Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options.

[This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	Likewise, as harmless as ""white people can't handle spice and only eat white bread"" may seem, if you where to flip it and say ""black people sure like their spicy chicken"", people may take offense to the latter statement and some may even call it racist.

If we say ""you can't be racist against white people"" because racism does not happen on an individual level, then you also can't label individual prejudice against black people racism.	0.841

Add to this that the hierarchy of advice that we dispense as individuals and societies is often shaped by culture, history, and social hierarchy. We condemn some things that people should not do with great energy and piety and completely ignore other things. Working too hard or being a source of stress for others at work, for example, are known to be major contributors to heart disease and to many other physical and mental ailments but this is rarely a subject of pious finger-wagging in popular culture or at the level of public-service announcements from public health experts. (Indeed, doctors suffer enormously from this problem in their working lives, which has been a significant contributor to rising suicide rates and professional burnout--and yet their workplaces and professional associations have been slow to respond).	0.9

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	<p>Also, their death is irreversible and  kills any chance they would have got to get better, I know this is not the case you are talking about, but we humans do a lot of mistakes and some day someone will commit suicide over the wrong diagnosis.</p>	0.896

The simple fact is that when kids go to school, they do so for many hours at a time and the job of the stay-at-home-mom is much simpler. Obviously that isn't true during a pandemic when distance learning challenges every parent. But I remember being in high school especially from 8 in the morning to 10 at night sometimes.

My mother fed me and made sure I had the money to be clothed and that there was always electricity and shelter. A typical suburban middle class upbringing.

Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>some palestinians became refugees after their attempt to genocide the jews by starting the 1948 war. the list of masscres as an example i sent you, and the opinions of their leaders such as amin al husseiny, were held far before any of them became refugees.</p>	0.831

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.

Would there be women (in a similar position to you) who identify as women, were born with the ""female"" sex (= a penis), but feel dysphoria to have the male sex (but still want to be a woman)? In order to answer that, let's reverse it to how things are today: Are there people who identify fully as male and want to express themselves in a fully masculine way, while experiencing physical dysphoria and want to have a vagina? I've never heard of such a person in my life. I'm sure they exist, but they are much, much, much rarer than trans people.

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.

I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	What is a fact is that there is a [state of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine) now and Israeli settlers are settling on its land illegally, supported by the israelian government. **That** is all I'm saying - Israel does not have any rights to the land their settlers are on."	0.821

Depends if you say it with a hard r	But just to take a step back, it's not really as simple as you're saying either.  Things like contracts of adhesion are often problematic and in English law, covenants are generally not allowed to ""run with the land"" the way they are in the US.  And in the US, most of the early impetus was racial.  So, yeah, they're a status quo in the US, but the sentiment that they ***ought to be*** is mostly an artifact of the US with a very problematic history."	0.829
🙌	The interest problem is not serious and again won't make the system work any worse than the current one. In the current system, in the US about 40% of people don't show even that much interest that they would vote in the national elections. So, their interests don't get any attention in the political system. It's the people who actually vote for either of the two parties that get their views represented (I mean in theory, in practice it's the donor class who gets their view represented). So, if you elected, say, 300 random members and 40% of them never show up on any vote as they are not interested, you'd still have 180 people who would represent the people who are interested in political decisions. The result would be the same as in the current system, but just without the corruption.	0.863

If you look at this and you think, ""more money would have helped"", then you're ignoring all variables that must be considered. Wealthy individuals don't just have wealth to make money with. They KNOW HOW TO USE THEIR WEALTH. Those who don't, lose it. And that's why handouts don't work, because it does not change spending habits. It can help some people, but the ratio of people who will actually use the money properly to those who don't would be too small.	0.895

Great answer	Sponsorship views have a level of trust implied within it. A youtuber is leveraging a viewer's personal investment in them and their content to encourage them to buy things.

And while white Americans do make up the majority of the US, I think it is safe to say that black culture (and maybe even Asian-American culture) is just as popular and synonymous with the US despite being a minimal part of the population. But  if your argument is that all those subcultures should fall under one name you would be off base. Those cultures are based on the homeland of peoples ancestors, music, clothing etc all has a place of origin. While things that people consider white culture are normally superficial things that are specific to the US and not specific ethnicity."	0.813

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.	I might have expanded but you can totally get there from moral relativism. As there's no meaning or truth one might as well go for allowing people to do what they want (seek pleasure and avoid pain) which leads to utilitarianism. It's a ""good"" by default, if nothing else is true then it's the position to adopt. That's what I mean by this.	0.837

Lighten up Francis.	""pointless"" is just speaking about the 'realness' of it.  There's really nothing that matters with the concepts outside of the person who wants to put value in these things, there's no intrinsic value, therefore it's generally pointless.  Being gay isn't a concept that means anything to anyone, it doesn't make you any different or better or worse or physically different or have any real effect on anything other than the concept itself.  Straight dudes can fuck other dudes, it doesn't mean they are gay, it happens quite often in porn.  The concept is pointless in that there is nothing there in the actual 'reality' of it all."	0.904
How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	<p>I&#39;ll put it this way. I&#39;m a lawyer, meaning that I&#39;m a participant in the justice system. And I have the lawful right to use violence in certain situations- everyone does, either in defense of oneself or someone else. Police are the same way, they just have expanded situations where they are allowed to use violence compared to others- but not unlimited. The rules around when they can use force are clear and public. They cannot use force against someone who is not being detained for a lawful purpose, for example. They cannot use force against a member of the general public without one of those prior justifications being present.</p>	0.843
Lol stay mad	<p>For decades now, the US (at least) has been massively tilted in the direction of too much investment capital and not enough consumer demand, to the extent that most companies have nothing useful to do with their excess capital and roll most of it into nonproductive financial schemes, trying to steal it from each other with various confidence games.</p>	0.865
It is a slur...but most white people don't get butthurt when people make slurs towards them. I hear black people say "cracker" all the time with what sounds like an intent to disparage. Let me say "nigger"  once even in a joking or lighthearted manner and people act as of I just sent a bunch of babies to the gas chamber. Y'all are silly.	It's largely the latter, since I don't believe in the abolition of the state. Well, I mean, that would be *the dream* but I do believe it to be necessity to have a state with taxes and the power to enforce laws. So I advocate that, not abolishing it.	0.835
You are a big problem in this stigma	<p>I&#39;m white. I understand that the C word (especially in the way the streamer was using it) was a slur. But I&#39;m not offended by it, therefore it has no legitimacy. I actually believe this is why the C word isn&#39;t considered as offense: White people just don&#39;t care enough to take offense at it; Where as the N word is &quot;forbidden&quot; therefore when it is said it has legitimacy and impact. Like, at the end of the day these are both racial slurs with a negative connotation. The C word is just been allowed to be said so it has less impact.</p>	0.886

https://youtu.be/Dkix4UzEbjU   🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️	And I’ve done a bit of reading on curse words and the benefits and it was quite fun to learn about. There’s a lot of information about how curse words actually help you with different situations- it’s worth a read if you’re ever bored, you should definitely look it up. I know if you hurt yourself and you use curse words in response it actually takes your kind away from the pain and helps. And also, the fact that it helps convey the emotions you’re feeling. It’s been awhile since I read up on it, but I know there was some really interesting stuff I never realized. Highly recommend learning more about cursing and the benefits etc"	0.836

Change my view? A hero? Just a greedy self-centered capitalist who loves to take credit for others creations	I feel like this is under-estimated when discussing attraction and intimacy between cis and trans people. It may not be true in all cases, but I'd say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a **subconscious** role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don't think people are actively saying “I could never date someone who was infertile!” — rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it's true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it's rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it's immediately a given for trans women.	0.869
Again, context....  You are clearly missing the context here.  Your point would be valid if this werent withing the larger context of the conversationsation being specifically about the jan 6th riot.   If were talking about tomatoes and i say how much i hate fruit, then youll know im also saying i hate tomatoes.  Not sure how you still dont understand how context works.  Literaply every respnse youve made has failed to take that into consideration.  Meanwhile you accuse me of putting words in someones mouth while you are at the same time taking words out.  Additionally, if you think my asking if you can follow a conversation is rude, the same can be said for asking if i am even making a point.  Hypocrite.  Im done with you, you clearly have the reading comprehension and debate skills of a grade schooler.	As for men legislating, legislators don't know much about most of what they legislate. This is no different. A good legislator will seek guidance from experts, but unfortunately they don't do that enough. Gender has nothing to do with it and I think that's a crappy attitude. Female legislators can be just as ignorant.	0.837

You're the one who took it to the extreme by saying things like " no one is below redemption " and " no one is truly bad"  and I doubt you could teach me anything considering you're sophomoric attempt at philosophy. Inability to use the correct spelling of words. And failure to distinguish between optimistic and pessemistic.

Now the remaining question is that why would you bring up an argument that is contradictory to your own beliefs.	0.891
Go ahead, be racist if that’s what you wanna do.  You’re a pretty typical smug redditor who clearly cares more about winning pointless internet arguments than being a decent human being, plus it’s pretty obvious you’re already racist.  No one has any expectations that you’d ever be a good person, so you’re “threat” doesn’t hold on any weight.  No one’s gonna bend over backwards to accommodate your precious feelings when you’re gonna be racist anyways no matter what.	I'd say that it is a personally held belief (because tons of people do think otherwise, deconstruct the stereotypes they have ingrained in their mind, or just don't buy into specific social constructions), but your personal responsibility clearly is diluted, because you've not ""created by yourself a racist belief"" but ""inherited a racist belief from society""	0.893

As someone else has pointed out, an African immigrant living in America isn't likely to even *want* to refer to themselves as African-American, because ""African"" is a broader category than the sort of cultural and ethnic identities people usually take on: they'd be Nigerian-Americans, or Ethiopian-Americans, or so on.

Stay ashamed	<p>You&#39;re underestimating how much simpler life was back then. Homes were much smaller. They had fewer bathrooms. They didn&#39;t have many nice amenities. There were no cable bills, no phone bills, no internet bills, way fewer luxuries, let alone luxuries that everyone had access to like many of the ones you and I enjoy. Kids literally wore bread bags on their feet when it rained. Eating out was much more rare. And just in terms of prices, the price per square foot of US homes has gone nearly unchanged for 50 years.

But (1) it&#39;s a very solvable challenge, and (2) the doom and gloom around this overstates the problem dramatically.</p>	0.838
