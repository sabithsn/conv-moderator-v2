üòî	I've seen this numerous times with a lot of families with disabled children, including my own, who don't have a great quality of life. And I know a few parents with these type of children who are severely depressed and claim if they'd known it was going to be like this, they wouldn't have had any children at all. People calling you an asshole clearly don't have any experience with this or are in denial about the real long term impact these children have on their parents and family. It's a sad situation definitely."	0.858
Homophobe? I think your confusing the terms there. Really your really ignoring all the shit posted about her but you‚Äôll go along with all that how very convenient of you.

Hooray for that, you must be so happy that I was hit considering that you in your response literally wished that upon me because I had the audacity to disagree with you and your child abusing mates. Is that what you‚Äôre going to do to your children? Beat them for disagreeing with you? You and my dad would get along. What a pathetic person you are. </p>	0.876

People will just say you are a Karen and don't know how to drive if you criticize them for speeding.	Black Lives Matter is a slogan created because they feel like a black person dies and it just doesn't matter.  They believe, with years of experience, that society feels that black people don't matter, and they're there to say they do.  When a BLM protester says Black Lives Matter, they're obviously not saying ""Only Black Lives Matter"" or ""Other Lives Don't"".  Those have been pretty obvious Conservative reframing because 'Black Lives Matter Too' is universally agreed upon by all but open White Supremacists."	0.817

Incapable of breathing, loving, or feeling any emotion, so to expect your partner to stay loyal to a rotting, unfeeling corpse just because at some point during your life you realized you‚Äôd be sad if they moved on is narcissistic at best, completely fucking psychotic at worst. It will benefit you in absolutely no way whatsoever and will only prevent your partner from finding closure with your death, moving on, and learning to love again.	0.853

It's not bullshit.  It's the scientific consensus, and for that reason is present in the WPATH Standards of Care (page 11) and the DSM-5 (page 455).  While multiple studies covering decades of research demonstrate the desistence phenomenon, there have been **no** published studies which demonstrate otherwise.  The most recent research only confirms it.  There are critiques of the research, but it has been defended [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2018.1468292) and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325443416_The_myth_of_persistence_Response_to_A_critical_commentary_on_follow-up_studies_and_'desistance'_theories_about_transgender_and_gender_non-conforming_children_by_Temple_Newhook_et_al_2018/link/5b0e88414585157f8722b622/download).

As for why it's handed to you at a scalding temperature, that's because it either came straight from the coffee machine, the process of which involves boiling water, or it came from the heated pot (more likely), which is kept heated because it's more energy efficient to maintain hot than it is to maintain tepid. Keeping it at lukewarm temperature would involve an on/off mechanism, and that's more energetically costly.

From my own experience, the beautiful ladies I've slept with (and the less beautiful ones too. Loving ain't all about high scores) slept with me because I'm, well, me.

Not liking cheese or not liking cheese in dishes is not an unpopular opinion, it's a very typical dietary preference. Thinking too much cheese is not good is not an unpopular opinion.

I‚Äôd rather not lump the entire community in one pot as that is just brain dead. I am very passionate when it comes to the homosexuals and bisexuals (seeing as I am bi)just not when people start feeding the delusions of people who think their something they are not. I‚Äôd say the more modern trans community shares more with nazis considering that they seem to scream how much rape should be done on someone if they don‚Äôt agree with their views or vandalize rape shelters for not letting in men.	<p>Honestly, the veneer of civilisation is thin.

weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don‚Äôt contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I‚Äôm sure that it‚Äôs just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups‚Äô beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I‚Äôve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there‚Äôs a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It‚Äôs also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say ‚Äúfine‚Äù when asked how he‚Äôs doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I‚Äôve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of ‚Äúgender‚Äù or why it‚Äôs a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you‚Äôve said about sex is true - that doesn‚Äôt mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"	We need two parties committed to governing, because we need the competition and good faith bargaining. Instead we have a party telling us it cares about freedom while it‚Äôs judges erode our constitutional legal protections, and grand stand about giving a shit about who fucks who, and if their clothes ‚Äúmatch‚Äù their birth genitals. I‚Äôm an American, I do not give a single, solitary fuck about what you do with your body. It‚Äôs your freedom.	0.844
What a mature response. Sounds like something a smartass 8 year old would say  "Yes, our asses do grow, don't they?"  I know people like you.

I like how you seen the think I was thinking of that and not other people.

Ok enough offtopic, you get my idea :D"	0.866
Because normalizing belief in something false is bad. The trans identity is not one that is valid.	Your morals don't align with other people's. This might be a shocker. Some people might care less about hiring a racist than they care about hiring a whore. You'd whine when your sister lost her job due to her part-timing on OnlyFans because it ""ISN'T ILLEGAL"" and applaud while someone loses their job over being a racist on the side despite it not being illegal.	0.901
