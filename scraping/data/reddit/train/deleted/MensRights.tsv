Would you mind perusing my conflict with the highly downvoted feminist who replied to me? You do not have to weigh in at all, I‚Äôm just hitting a rock wall, and would like to know if I‚Äôm crazy. Well, about this topic lol.  I totally understand it‚Äôs a lot of reading, so if you don‚Äôt want to it don‚Äôt have time, I completely understand. But if you wouldn‚Äôt mind, could you just tell me if I‚Äôm completely unreasonable?	Because it isn't just some random woman on the web.  We're talking about a close female friend of the latest high profile murder victim, whose now being martyred by ideological groups and toxic women, speaking out against said violation of the dead to score gender political points against a group.	0.861
Or we could just kill all proven rapists, and maybe set a curfew for men at night. An enforced one.	She told me she was on birth control. Well two weeks later she tells me that she ‚Äúthinks‚Äù that she‚Äôs pregnant. Then I ask her , did you take the birth control. She answers ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Never been so pissed it off in my life. Then I tell her, let‚Äôs just hope you‚Äôre not pregnant. You can‚Äôt believe what she says after that. She says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the answer I wanted‚Äù. Long story short, we broke up.</p>	0.856
Shut the fuck up.	<p>Biology:  Men tend to have a higher sex drive than women (but have a harder time getting sex) so spend more time and energy pursuing it. The other difference is that men tend to be physically stronger so are therefore more capable of overpowering a potential victim.</p>	0.877
This is why, if a woman ever falsely accuses me of rape, I'll just kill her right then and there.  If your life is ruined either way, better to be in jail for a crime you *did* commit (murder) than a crime you *didn't* commit (rape).	There is no reason for minutely examining and asking for permission on every single act. This kills all sexual attraction, and is specifically designed to do so, much like genital mutilation.	0.828
It's almost like they have zero ability to reason and have childlike mentalities......	No, I think the reason why a lot of women (but also plenty of men who are completely oblivious) can't even emphasize - not *support* but just *emphasize* - with men issues is because they're taught from such a young age that women are victims and individuals to be protected and men are perpetrators. As a society, we tell boys they should *never* hit girls, not even in retaliation, but we never tell girls not to hit boys, we talk about rape and DV in schools in a gendered way, we *teach* girls to fear for their lives when they're walking alone even though boys are much more likely to be agressed, etc.	0.906
I made them mad and I didn't say what they wanted to hear, so they reported my post to the mods so they would delete it. Simple as that.	üòê	1.0
I'm just talking in general terms , women are tricky , good liars and actresses , so you never know who's a problem and who's not.	<p>Honestly all this discussion is useless. Okay. Statement is clear. Water is wet. Wat else op wanted?</p>	0.791
Not sure what's funnier this or the original post	<p>A rigorous insolvency program would save more lives than any other suicide prevention program could ever hope to in Japan. But barring that, a suicide prevention program that recognizes the social stigma against debt and works to curtail it would likely be the most effective use of government energy.</p>	0.75
Kill yourself.	Second therapist I saw was at 18 in the military because the military rejected me having a Hernia surgery, that therapist was a dick who barely listened to what I said, I would tell him I feel shitty because I can't train, I can't work and it ruined my basic will to live, and he'll respond ""maybe you should work out sometimes, go on long runs""	0.92
OK, let's be frank: men - not women - are the "weaker sex". They have subjected women which has taken a toll on their psyche - and women are not to blame for it ....	You do realise that signing up for selective service is mandatory for men only, right? And that failure to do so impacts men's lives with fines, jail time, and removed access to services, scholarships, citizenship rights like the vote, and some areas of work?	0.837
>These male activists have targeted anything that smacks of feminism, forcing a university to cancel a lecture by a woman they accused of spreading misandry.   And what is the difference between American feminism and Korean MRAs?	<p>Almost, illegal *** so irrelevant.</p>	0.794
I am sorry that is literal the dumbest thing I have ever heard, but that‚Äôs your perspective.  Here is my perspective.  My dad, me, my eldest son and my grandson.  All cut. All no issue.  My second son. Uncut until he needed emergency surgery to free up everything down there.  It‚Äôs a tiny issue.  Ill continue recommending it to any new father, just because of the risk that it poses and the issues i know it has caused.  I am sorry your penis broke or is shorter.  Sue the doctor.  My dick is fine.  And I see no harm or foul in performing hygienic surgery.	In fact, I was called a danger to my child, because everyone who self harms is apparently capable of infanticide.... I endured 10 torturous weeks of separation from my daughter, fearing our bond would be lost and she wouldn't remember me, before I was able to reestablish contact through family court proceedings. I had to deny a plethora of outrageous accusations that painted me as a horrible, perverted, intimidating monster while poor mother sobbed in front of the Sheriff that she had to protect her child.	0.93
I told your Mother the Same thing Last Night...When she was smokin my Circumsized 8" ---- suck it Bitch~!	<p>If she doesn&#39;t he will then think she&#39;s showing interest. And tries to take the next step.</p>	0.755
"1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."	<p>What‚Äôs the motivation here?</p>	0.855
Well, it's stats about nonreciprocally violent relationships, not of all violent relationships. You cherry picked a stat.  I just read that in your article :  "1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."	<p>Edit #2: Many people who identify as incels also identify as MRAs. They don‚Äôt want anything to do with a woman in charge, talking to one, seeing one, and they want everything sexist to happen to them. Many people have put on the news that along with these incels who have killed women, they were also identified as an MRA, which already leaves a bad impression on the people who were thinking about advocating, unfortunately. Just how I hate feminists that say kill all men, I hate Incels. Some women feel more comfortable talking to feminists about women‚Äôs issues, even during the KAM thing ( not me, lmao ), because they still felt like the women was on their side. So, when they begin to see the unfairness for men‚Äôs rights and want to advocate for them as well and many men are shoving the woman away, it does make them feel unwanted in the movement.</p>	0.916
Hyper dramatic bulshit. Lots of men are circumcised and have no issues with sensation whatsoever. Get a motherfuking life.	<p>I get that /mensrights is a bit too anti-feminist and should focus more on men rights than bashing feminism, but <a href=""/r/menslib"">/r/menslib</a> is the opposite, it tries way too much to not slight feminists in any way possible, that it makes your opinions feel censored and ignored.</p>	0.915
