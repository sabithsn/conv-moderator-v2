And I've seen women only being supportive, appreciative and non judgemental towards guys who wear feminine clothing. These men are being shamed by other men for wearing makeup or feminine clothes.	>when you hate a parent, you hate part of yourself  That's so profound omg	0.815
Are you sure	Yessss…this is why men are scared. I have my own home and I’m growing my business, so there’s very little a man provide for me at this point. He’s going to have to be pretty special to disrupt the peace of my current life.	0.778
I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	A guy I had been dating for maybe 3 months said if we were still together after a year I could move in with him. He talked about how his rent was fixed at about half of what I was paying for my rent, and I’d save so much money splitting with him. He eventually planned to buy the house he was renting. I said nope, I’ll never move into a man’s house and pay into his mortgage. Why put equity into his house especially if we break up, he keeps all that and I get nothing? Plus his house was shittier than my nice apartment and it was in an area of the city I was not interested in moving to. It would’ve been a total downgrade. If I’m gonna move anywhere with a man, it’s gonna be a place we both decided on, after dating for multiple years (I don’t want marriage) and an upgrade from my current living space.	0.829
I like how he confirms that men lack common sense and social skills by telling them how to do the absolute obvious when you are meeting someone via social media.  Male IQ is in hell LMAO.	This is frightening but true.  I have an ex friend like this and every now and again I tip toe around the idea of us being friends again but your comment solidified the reason why that’ll never happen.  It’s sad because we’re supposed to be able to trust one another (re: sisterhood) but at the end of the day, we have to protect ourselves and keep an eye out for red flags within our inner circles too.	0.847
That takes the cake! NYE first time date?GTFOH that only happens in cheesy rom com movies lol. These new OLD dudes be getting lamer and lamer, trying to mack hard without running coins (because we all know there are hella "free" events to do on NYE).	Lol, ofc you were, it’s crawling with incels who believe that children are a punishment for women who sleep with other men, and pickemes who don’t understand why the sperm-donor who hates her continues to act like he hates her.	0.856
That's just rape and pedophilia depending on where your at	Thank you for this post! I will repeat myself- we should not look at each other as competition, that does not benefit us. Tearing a woman down does not add value to you. Have each other’s back. I had a friend who would tell my most personal problems to her boyfriend (whom I didn’t like at all). I cut her off and never looked back. What’s the circle of this? She tells him, he tells his bros, his bros spread it to their bros, and everyone ends up knowing. Suddenly, you’re vulnerable to strangers who can be real predators.	0.824
Even if it takes a lifetime.	Thank you for this break down! I’ve always hated Issa and Lawrence’s dynamic because it reminded me of toxic relationships I’ve been in or witnessed firsthand. I was proud of Issa initially for walking away from Lawrence and the baby situation but when they ended up getting back together? It just seemed childish and immature. After making so many strides with her professional life, Issa backpedaled on herself so hard. It was disappointing.  And even in regards to Nathan I cringed when she was trying to get him to say he loved her. Like girl! What are you doing?! Issa needed more quality time with herself being single.	0.864
As an Israeli-American woman, I'm torn tbh. If he owes the money, he should pay up. As would the woman were she the higher earner. But to bar him from ever leaving the country? Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	So she can’t point out the flaws in men raised by single mothers because many of us were raised by one or are one? It’s not a personal attack on single mothers as no matter how perfect a woman is, many men develop problems due to a lack of a father figure.	0.92
I reported you for blatantly ignoring the handbook.  Read the pickme garbage you just wrote.  And yes, those “nice family men” just want to fuck you.  Are you really naive or like right out of high school or something?  Talking about how bad women are for being 50 and wanting to gossip? Please.	I love this! There is another one called “10 traits of a high value man” whenever I get angry dms from men , they say things like “wow! Good luck dating a famous athlete/musician/ceo with that attitude” and I’m just sitting there like :🙄Thats.not.the.point. It is character that makes you hv. The scrotes think that we just want to date rich and famous men, as if that is what high value means.	0.822
A walk is not a date, I agree. But I'm not taking a girl on a date before I've seen her in real life. The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	My last ex clearly exhibited your #1 and #4 issues. Also some covert #3 whenever he was expected to do something, like \*gasp\* being a parent to our daughter. I'm not sure about #2, but he sure partook in their (shitty) investments - or at least followed their example.  However, he grew up as the (single) child of married parents. And, yes, the parents were married until death parted them.  I think these issues are much more prominent in families with a narc mother, where everything has to be just about herself. In other words: A LVW and (most likely) pickme (for all the attention and validation). It's also more common in only sons than in sons with brothers, albeit the latter is not unheard of. With the man being one of several brothers with a narc mom, it's most often the "golden child" that gets the special mommy treatment, as far as my anecdotal evidence shows.	0.887
Omg this is giving me flashbacks to age 22. Good for this girl! I wish I’d had the guts to stick up for myself at her age.   Back then I was with my ex that would rest his head on my stomach while fingering me, acting like he was bored so I’d say forget it. 4+ years together and he made me cum less than 10 times lol. The same guy also couldn’t understand how not all women cum from penetrative sex… he said to me “it worked for all my ex’s, so I’m not the problem” 😭😩😤	She's with a Scrote who doesn't like her and most likely gives her a low looks rating. This blob thinks he can do better.	0.783
This is literally everything we hate at FDS.  I just looooove the menz!  I’m not like those other girlzzzzz!  Tee hee!  Have you thought maybe those men are nice mainly because they want to fuck you?	I'm so so so proud of you, Queen! <3	0.86
He reached out on linkedin?! ... We need an acronym for these sorts. What about social climber scrote (SCS)?	Congratulations! This must feel incredible! I hope you savor every bit of your success! You’re an example for younger women of what hard work and perseverance can lead to, and I think that’s a really beautiful thing.	0.781
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	Apparently they think that if you post on FDS you agree with EVERY single post here, and that an HVM is a 6-6-6 guy who needs their rights infringed on by installing spy cams and apps that monitor them 24/7.     Get mad. Sometimes I want them to just strike me up for a conversation instead of banning me or judging me for FDS, but then I remember they're all brainwashed by the idea that we've 'achieved equality'.	0.821
Wow you definitely did the right thing. Any man who can't understand a lone woman locking their door in this situation isn't living fully in reality. His immediate aggression is an obvious sign he was up to no good. I've been the man in situations like that and my immediate response was to communicate the situation without aggression if it was important enough and to make sure i was being as nonthreatening as possible. Cuz I'm 200+ pounds and bearded i already look crazy 😆 in any case just to add to the tip about the window. Don't roll it down even a crack. Once closed it creates a sort of seal that strengthens the integrity of the glass. Cracking the window weakens that some in case he tried to strike the window.            edit: That sounds like something I've read about as a tactic for human traffickers.	And he basically cheated to achieve the so called accomplishment - manipulated, lied, deceived. Yet he's still proud?! I'd bet all my limbs he consistently refers to himself as a "gentleman" or a "good guy", too 🤢     Promiscuous men like this fuck around because they have emotional issues, and are scared of the vulnerability that comes with actually connecting with a woman. They lose themselves in short-term highs to mask the fact they are empty and miserable inside. Look at all the hot celebs who've had a lifestyle like this, then realised the highs are sad and meaningless, and gone on to have committed relationships.	0.874
Wow. She dodged a bullet 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into 😭 I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	>LVM would literally rather emotionally abuse you than make efforts to become better men.  Because they can't accept that they are the problem. You bringing up that they are indeed the problem, hurt their feelings/ego/whatever, and now they have to hurt you back because they don't know how to process their hurt feelings and turn into an infant who throws a spiteful tantrum to get even.  It doesn't even need to be outright criticism for you to see this in action. I told my ex (when we were still married at the time) that I didn't feel loved. That's it. I just made a factual statement of my own feelings. I didn't criticize him outright. I didn't even ask him for anything. I just stated my thoughts and feelings into one simple sentence: "I don't feel loved."  Well, that surely pissed him off internally. How could I, after 13 years together, not feel loved?! I must be crazy, right? Never for a moment did he sit and think about what I said and what it might mean to him as my husband. Nope. He just blamed outwardly and concluded that if I didn't feel loved after so many years together, that that was somehow my own fault. Ok. And then he did what all male logic would make him do. He did nothing. And made pretty damn sure he was going to continue to do nothing to change that unloved feeling I had. It's like when abusive parents say, "If you're going to cry, I'll give you something to cry about." It runs along that same mentality. *If you're going to feel nothing, I'll give you nothing to feel about.*	0.883
