Yeah it does.	He always pulls them apart and we seperate them but obviously I can’t do this in my current condition and we certainly are NOT prepared to bring a newborn into the home with this going on.	0.836
Yeah no	<p>I would also consider that as the sole breadwinner in the family, in a new town where likely neither of them have a social circle yet, and his lack of support or assistance, she is likely feeling stressed and frustrated as well, yet she approached him gently and without lashing out the way he did. Her response thereafter to how he treated her is maybe not the best but fair and understandable when someone is blowing up at you. It&#39;s just an instinctual reaction sometimes.</p>	0.885
Um 1. Unsolicited rude comments about your weight and diet 2. Grabbing your food like some middle school bully 3. Expecting you to pay for food that you ate but did not order 4. Calling you a gold digger and an asshole for standing up for yourself 5. Embarrassing you in front of your friends. Obviously you’re NTA and Alan rearranges to anal cuz he’s an asshole.	<p>But I think the piece you may be missing is that it also shows trust. <strong>You aren&#39;t trusting those closest to you not to use the favor to hurt you</strong>. So you are rejecting those closest to you just in case they take advantage of the favor to do you wrong. So of course it feels weird to them. They want to show they care, but you reject that and basically tell them that you don&#39;t trust them.</p>	0.861
It is not ok to allow someone you know and care about to be tricked into raising another man's bio child.NTA.	<p>These are just weasel words, and a means to get around acknowledging the consistently anti-male bias that this sub has gravitated toward. It&#39;s the same as saying, &#39;people are saying x&#39; or &#39;many people believe y&#39;; it doesn&#39;t actually mean anything and only serves to muddle the truth. I would never say &quot;some women are domestic abusers and so are some men&quot; because it completely disregards real-world trends in favor of muddying honest discourse. Maybe try to do better.</p>	0.789
NTA. Seems like everyone wants to jump on the "he is an abuser & dump him train" though, as is usually the case with stories like these in this sub, which I think is a bridge too far. Yeah he's a disgusting animal but he isn't finished as a human, neither of us are untill the day we die.	<p>Does that mean I should boss him around about the house because its mine?  No.  We are married.  I treat him with respect.  If we divorced, the house would be mine.  But as long as we are married, it&#39;s ours.</p>	0.799
then it does not matter why the party was canceled. losing out on the money to start her life is not appropriate.	My mom said that she would pay for my sisters alterations. However, the size of the dress would end up smaller in some areas. My mom said “You can just lose weight, you look like you need it anyways.” I ended up saying no and my parents bring it up occasionally making me feel awful.	0.836
Yeah, learnt that lesson now. The first scare should've been enough warning for me. I'm gonna give prep a try, and wait til after I get it.	Recently she had her fifth and final child and after four boys, she had another boy. And she was crushed not having a girl. She sunk deep into depression and had tremendous gender disappointment. She and my husbands parents want me to offer her support and be there for her and help her through this. I said no. That I could not be her help and support after the stuff she said to me. My husband backs me up 100000% but the family thinks I am heartless and cruel and being an AH out of spite. They say I owe her this.	0.89
NTA. She is insecure	I think right now is not the time to stress about what your mother or SIL have to say, considering they're not even as involved in your life. And instead of asking how you're doing, SIL jumped to why the mother is upset. And while under appreciating you (all your life, I'm guessing), the mother cannot expect you to go out of the way to appreciate her presence while you're in a lot of pain. I mean everyone gets cranky after a hospital visit let alone a surgery, and caretakers (especially family) understand.	0.823
Their punishment was no graduation party. The lack of a check is due to the person planning on gifting it fucking dying. The daughter is still going to college which is more than a lot of people get and stepdaughter is going to end up in the exact situation because the parents are doing what they can and the lack of that previous money is not due to the parents lack of care its due to the person who actually gave it again, dying. I guess the parents lack of being able to read the future ala thats so raven and still making it work for her is such a fucking betrayal.	<p>It sounds like you&#39;re a great stepdad and I can appreciate you stepping in and being there for the boys. I don&#39;t think situation seems like that big of a deal, I do think that it&#39;s odd the the ex is cool with you being around his children, but not his adult brother?</p>	0.817

FUCK U OP AND  FUCK U REDDITERS	Do you think your wife doesn't already feel like shit? I guarantee she does. She already KNOWS she's letting you down and that makes her feel worse. She probably regrets quitting her job because that's what led to this. She probably already beats herself up, questions her self-worth, and wonders why you're still with her. Bottom line is she KNOWS how you feel and your lack of support isn't helping. It's this downward spiral that can be really fucking hard to pull yourself out of (source: been there, done that. More times than I care to count).	0.911
I'm old enough.    >U r acting as if OP knew aunt was going to die and wanted this as punishment.   Nope and I do not appreciate that you're making up lies. it's not ok or acceptable and it's definitely respectful.   #"I never said it was their fault... "  how exactly do you get from "it's not op's fault" to "you are acting as if op knew aunt was going to die and wanted this as punishment"   can you even explain yourself or your irrational jumping to conclusions that don't make any logical sense?    >U keep saying OP needs to make this right-why???  ... Because that's their kid...    >This crap situation is nobody’s fault.  now you're just repeating me but think you're adding to the conversation.   >Sometimes nobody is to blame and I don’t understand why u r hell bent to make it OPs fault.  for the third fucking time  #I never said it was their fault...  if you can't learn how to read. I will not bother responding to you.	I said it's not okay to be proud of purely just being white, because here in the US whiteness is used as a way to try and put down black and brown people. The US has literally country that was built upon white supremacy since its beginning of being colonized. If you are proud of being just white, but not your specific ethnicity, then you're probably racist.	0.807
>the daughter should just get 40k because she should and you said so.  how bout because the person who the 40k belonged to said so?   everyone in this thread keeps conveniently forgetting it was already committed... and quite likely already promised to the daughter....	<p>Yes, maybe she was upset, but it was better to just be honest, and tell her how you feel, than pretending everything is fine and keeping her in the dark while you feel uncomfortable when you&#39;re together. And again: she does NOT have the right to dictate how you should feel, feelings are the most personal, uncontrollable thing, and you should respect yours, as she also should. Don&#39;t beat yourself up for being a reasonable, mature person!</p>	0.881
OP I believe if you also talked about sex alongside periods, a mild YTA.  Yes 11 is late. Yes your aunt should have taken care of it by that age. Yes kids ask a lot of questions. But I think you overstepped and violated your aunt and her family's choices. Even if they're wrong, your cousin still isn't your child. You should have passed the questions about what is sex and left it to your aunt and told your cousin to ask her mother about x and y. Knowing that it's natural would have been adequate to calm her down enough to wait for her mom.	<p>Meanwhile school in Canada tends not to teach much US history except as it immediately relates to Canadian history, so you need to learn on your own. We also massively whitewash our own history of racism, including slavery and discriminatory treatment. You can’t fix what you’re still denying.</p>	0.81
Ring in the new year properly by dumping the dolt. Believe me, he will only get worse.	Late last week my mom called me and asked me to go to Fred Meyer and pick up two camping chairs that were on sale.  My fiance went and looked and searched for twenty minutes and didn't find them. Due to the stress of getting ready for surgery (we weren't expecting it to be this quick), I forgot to call my mom and let her know we couldn't find them.  She called me tonight and, when I told her we couldn't find them, she hit me with “I do so much for you and (service dog), it's sad that you can't even do one thing for me.  I expect you to be able to do these things for me.”	0.868
I feel like your friend is correct morally, ethically and economically and they are not the asshole for pointing out the flaws of capitalism however they are the asshole for the way in which they went about it.	<p>I got that shit done with 2 emails as a disabled lady, and never even left my bed. Because that&#39;s my job. I&#39;m a mother. Im a parent. So why the fuck is your kid sister still being bullied? Why do students feel they can lay hands on her, her hair, her wig, her person? The big holy fuck moment in this post isn&#39;t that she shaved her head or that she got teased, or she has regrets, or pressure about hair donation, its the fact that the school and your folks know damn well what is happening, who is doing it, why and what to do, they just... fucking... aren&#39;t.</p>	0.849

YTA you're a monster.	I haven't operated on 4 hours sleep since I was in grad school, and I felt like shit every time I did it (and never for more than a day or 2 max). I occasionally have trouble falling asleep, which causes me to get 5 or 6 hours instead of 7 or 8, and yes, I feel like crap the next day and need more sleep the following night just to get back to normal. After 7 nights of getting HALF the sleep I need I would probably just be completely miserable, headaches and moodiness and zero energy to even function.	0.876
NTA, His girlfriend cheated on him multiple times and you were just making sure he didn't get roped into raising another mans child.	I lost my temper at her rudeness and screamed at her and told her that she was being rude, selfish and a very mean tempered person. I was angry prior to her screaming because one of the cupboard locks wasn't working and she had been the last one to use it. I told her that the cupboard lock hadn't been working and she told me that the cupboard lock hadn't been working since last to last week and it couldn't have been her because she doesn't even stay here. I screamed at her saying that she was lying and that couldn't have had happened since I'd had fixed it. She said that she didn't break it and she wasn't the only one living in the house and there must've been something wrong with the mechanism but I'm pretty sure that she was lying.	0.8
NAH. Can’t blame you for not wanting to give it up but you have to see his gf side of the story as it’s true that it does make it look like u don’t accept her in the family.	<p>Even if your GF was doing everything she can (which she is not, because after &#39;agreeing&#39; to a gluten-free kitchen, she is still cooking food with gluten in, and don&#39;t mention that this is by mistake), if you&#39;re not used to being around celiacs, and suddenly expected to have a gluten-free kitchen, it&#39;d be easy to forget occasionally. It would be very easy to buy gluten-containing food by accident if you&#39;re not used to looking for it, and don&#39;t realise just how many foods its present in. </p>	0.746

Everyone witnessed these interactions, including the head of our team. They've all agreed to write statements, but she is arguing that the whole point is that everyone is against her due to her gender, so the statements can't be trusted.	My mom recently bought my sister(17F) a new car with a $22k loan, my sister makes $600 a month and the loan and insurance is $500. I told her she screwed my sister over and she exploded on me. That argument ended and a week later she let her alcoholic boyfriend get drunk and chase my sisters around the house while screaming he was going to kill her. I live 5 hours away so there’s nothing I can do about it. I told my mom as of now I don’t want to talk to her because I’m extremely upset with her. Supposedly she just walks around crying now, AITA?	0.89
This is what you do go to your lawyer then ask for a divorce then take custody of the other 2 kids as it seems the mother is a bad role model and use this as reasons she shouldn’t have custody	<p>ght be an ESH, for not communicating well enough before the guests arrived. You don’t have to host houseguests if it’s not going to be a comfortable situation for everyone, but it’s rough on the guest when they’ve already arrived and you start piling on restrictions. On the other hand, Claire knows her dog best, so she — or the brother, on her behalf — might have been in the best position to start the conversation about its need for outdoor space, how much it sheds, etc., and to confirm that OP was prepared to accommodate their needs on terms they’d be comfortable with.EDIT: Just saw OP’s comment below that she DID specify these restrictions before the visit. So now I’m wondering whether this is really an issue between Claire and the brother — maybe Claire really doesn’t want to be there given the constraints, but didn’t feel like she could opt out of the trip or ask to stay elsewhere...152ResponderPremiarCompartirReportarGuardarSeguir  </p>	0.883

saying this is saying it's an appropriate punishment... if they believe that then why didn't they take away the 40k check to begin with and tell the aunt to keep it?	I think I’m the asshole because I wondered whether he was making up all the problems in his family to make me feel bad for him. I felt skeptical about whether he was being truthful and I feel like that’s a wrong thing. I also feel like it’s not right of me to abandon him for my sake when he’s going through so much alone and really requires the support of someone.	0.884
ESH. Jenna sucks for being a bully, but do you just love drama? Why even entertain a conversation with someone you clearly don't like and think was a bully? Why not walk away, end the conversation, say you're busy, etc?

And the softest TA judgement I have ever given because the others are clearly much worse. The babysitting thing.

If you’re buying the house for her but you’re also married with adult children then I can see why she doesn’t want you on the deed. If you and your wife divorce, it is an asset that she could lose out on through no fault of her own. Essentially you’re paying for this relationship but she also has the right to protect herself.

I am a teacher that is f2f right now and i have a lot of my own stress but i still come home and cook/clean/etc. While my fiancé has multiple times gotten home before me and not started dinner even when asked. Anyways, this week was rough and one morning he woke me up at 6am sobbing about how he was going to quit and that he’s miserable. I spent my whole day at work worrying and talking to his parents to make sure he’s okay. He comes home, boss gave him a pat on the back, talked to parents about keeping work at work and he feels better. He promises to stop taking time outside of work to work. Cut to a few days later, he wakes up at 6 am on a Saturday (his off day) to go bring some of his work people donuts when he absolutely doesn’t need to. While this is a kind gesture, he woke me up flashing his flashlight everywhere and slamming around this morning and I’m pissed. He has been causing me so much stress with all this and he decided to work on a Saturday and I told him how upset I was and now he’s playing the huffy “I can’t do anything right” card.

Thanks for your comment but which one for example ?	<p>That said, I’m more disturbed by how little you seemed to care about the dog, or care about the dumping of it, and that your biggest regret about the date aspect is that you didn’t just lie so that you could get laid. It’s great what you’re doing for your nephew but excuse me if I don’t give you an all around ‘stand up guy’ award.

She pays if she decides to be an adult.	I don't think I'm the asshole because I'm am constantly trying to make plans but he's already 'busy but if it is the same day and another friend asks he's never busy for them so I gave up asking and now I'm being called an asshole for not inviting him to something he said he was to busy to do so I invited one of my other friends who is his ex but she is way more of a excepting friend then him.	0.923
Non binary and trans? How does that make any sense?	1 you don’t talk sex to a minor	0.848
Yes I agree, I think. I think I should have just not let the horniness take advantage of me and gain some of my own self control.	Op, you didn’t fail as a parent. I genuinely believe you raised a great kid but her gf obviously has something that explains her behavior. Who acts like that especially when a family member has died? So OP, saying no was a great choice. She needs to suck it up that not everything revolves around her. Don’t even pay attention to her when she comes back crawling. She needs to learn that she can’t act that way. Especially to her grieving mother. Don’t feel bad OP, she just needs to learn</p>	0.907
She cheated on his son multiple times that makes her guaranteed untrustworthy.	Hello, I am 20 years old and I am currently in college. I'm quite happy because I'm meeting new people, I like my studies very much, and I'm getting back to a normal life rhythm. However, one thing is disturbing this good atmosphere, and that thing is the bad relationship I have with my mother.	0.78
How tf is that illegal? ATP I think you're just trying to troll so go suck it ✌	<p>Now she’s in rehab, and the moment she gets out, her parents (my aunt and uncle) are sending her to live here with us. They say they can’t deal with her anymore. I think it’s extremely unfair that they’re sending her here, where my grandma and a 14 year old girl live just because they don’t wanna deal with her anymore. They say she’ll be fine after getting out of rehab, yet refuse to let her stay with them. I am very worried about getting robbed again, about her bringing dealers and drugs to the house around my sister, stealing my grandma’s medication, etc. I think it’s a recipe for disaster having her here. Also, my mom is a recovering alcoholic who has been relapsing lately, and I think having a recovering addict live with another recovering addict is a horrible idea. Even if my cousin isn’t doing fentanyl anymore, I know she’s gonna be drinking and she’s gonna drag my mom down with her. After voicing my concerns to her mom (my aunt) I’ve been told I’m turning my back on our family, that I’m coldhearted, and that I “need to have faith in her.” AITA for not believing one month of rehab will magically fix her problems after years and years of this behaviour?</p>	0.904
> tell me how that isn’t cheating again?  Are you dense?  There is emotional cheating and physical cheating.  When using the term "Cheating" it is typically addressing physical cheating.  OP state that he "kept things professional" which can be reasonably interpreted as not having any sort of physical contact inappropriate for colleagues.      >you seem to be projecting your insecurities onto me.       You mean my supposed insecurities where I've been in various committed relationships for 2+ decades and only been cheated on a couple of times (both of which I acknowledged that my partner might cheat early on and accepted it as a risk)?  Yeah, there are none of those.       You are the one getting all bent out of shape because you have purposefully mischaracterized what OP said.  The only reason I could see someone so blatantly mischaracterizing a statement is due to their own insecurities. Unless you just didn't read the post....	Aunt is freeloading and has not attempted to get new job or help in the house. It’s her cats she should have been cleaning up or sorting the matter. It is ridiculous that she is blaming you for complaining. The fact she has never trained the cats or tried to stop it means she is responsible they may have to be re homed. She certainly will never pay to replace carpets.	0.884
I don’t expect you to understand why you’re wrong because saying that to begin with is evidence of your lack of intelligence. So: STFU.	<p>Some of my friends think I&#39;m TA for not inviting her and others think I am justified since I don&#39;t really have much of a connection to her besides her being my stepfather&#39;s girlfriend.

Well that was one of your shorter dances but a dancing troll is still a dancing troll! I give it a 4/10, as there is definitely room for improvement and you’re relying on repetitive moves when you could be doing new ones	<p>My high school graduation - when we did the rehearsal, the principal butchered my last name.

Yes.  And every piece of evidence regarding omicron has shown that it is milder.  Less able to survive in the lungs, and that previous infection or vaccination increases the likelihood that it will be very mild.    Also, this is what viruses do.  They mutate.  They usually also mutate to be more contagious, and less severe.  As it is in the best interests of a virus to have a walking talking host, spreading a mild version, than an incapacitated host, spreading it to no one.    Despite what media scaremongering will have us believe, this mutation is a good thing.  Naturally acquired antibodies are as good (sometimes better) than vaccination acquired immunity (though vaccination is of course essential for those immunocompromised or those who feel it would benefit them).  But demonising people who are choosing to wait for other options (such as novavax for one example)  or claiming that this mutation is the worst thing ever, is just not accurate.	<p>p.s.

Good, you are starting off the New Year well then!! What kind of idiot calls someone a gold digger over a $14 meal they didn’t even eat? SMH  The fact he put you down like that and treated you that way is such a major red flag - he was testing your boundaries to see what he could get away with, probably because if you had stayed, he would’ve escalated and become abusive. Good on you for being smart and getting out before any more damage is done. Abusers like to break people down over time, and it looks like that was what he was trying to do.	My fiancee and I are in a very similar situation. She makes almost $10/hr less than I do, and we had to finally have a conversation about it recently because she wanted to ""balance"" the percentages of our paychecks going into our shared household account--I'd put in $950 a month and she'd put in $750. What helped was talking bluntly about how she was valuing other input we were both making to the household--we were splitting the bills and such halfway, but I was spending much more on things like groceries or ""fun stuff"" (dining out, pizza night, etc.). I definitely think that if you're serious about each other, socking away the kind of money you are is respectable and shows a real commitment to a more peaceful golden years for you both. If she can't see that, then having a conversation about where she feels she's overpaying her share is going to be important going forward.	0.816
Holy fuck you’re dumb.	I'm a bit annoyed, but brush it off expecting it will be moved soon. It wasn't moved for 3 days. Apparently the new people have the garage packed so they park 2 cars in the driveway and 4 on the street. I keep my Corvette in the garage but I keep my old beat up 1985 F-150 in the driveway along with my wife's car. After the car moved, I parked my truck on the street in front of my house.	0.853
Same.  The nurse who taught my prenatal class said "you WILL poop" not "might'.	<p>Ultimately, you have a right to have your dad in your life in whatever form and to whatever extent works for both of you. That may be hurtful to your mom, and that&#39;s something to tread cautiously around, but she doesn&#39;t get to dictate your relationship. Keep her concerns in mind. While it shouldn&#39;t be a secret that you&#39;re in contact with your dad, you don&#39;t need to share things that will hurt her. She also should be able to trust you&#39;re not giving him information about her.</p>	0.884
It is safer. But that literally doesn’t matter. What matters is that this was avoidable and OP needlessly increased their risk of exposure during an extremely vulnerable time.	1. You didn't bother to list your partner's reasons or her side of the story. Which makes me think you don't care about them. Have you given any real consideration to them or are you just wallowing in your anger? Not a good sign.	0.891

>I don’t think u can call it a punishment-that indicates OP or someone is dishing it out.  but it very much is. we understand cause and effect...    >. Life isn’t fair, kid can blame OP all she wants for not getting what her siblings got but it’s not their fault at all.  I never said it was their fault... but you have to understand the situation...   This is exactly the argument the sister made about the bullies... it's not her fault, she can't control what they do.   Her parents said tough luck we're in control this is how we're punishing you.   then something happened because of that punishment that was out of the parents control and they want to go "it's not our fault! we can't control this!"   what message does that send exactly? they took control and cancelled the party without a care or a thought to any other potential ramifications when there could have been a different punishment and because of that they lost control of the situation and irreparably damaged their child's start in life.   they have to own up to losing control of everything because they were the ones who imposed the control in the first place.   it's not even necessarily about fault... it's about being the bigger person than your 17 year old kid...   >It was extra crappy of her to allow it to happen to anyone, let alone a family member.  that does not in any way justify the result...	Um... pretty much, yes! Grocery shopping is a fucking pain in the ass. If I run out of two or three things but have plenty of other food, I *eat the other food*.

Well that’s kinda rude we love each-other and outside of this small issue we are very happy	NTA but I say it with a little salt. You don't have to a relationship or  be in contact with her. Honestly sounds like you don't even love her in the tiniest amount.  Saying that I can see how she reminds of your father with the "" learn to love me"" comment.  Honestly I would keep it at seeing her at seeing family events but being civil. Your Dad and sister are wrong for trying to force a relationship.	0.926
You should probably explain it a bit…	Ah, I see.	0.963
OP you weren't wrong but I don't think that you should have got involved. I fully understand you supporting your gf.  However, I do think that it's time for gf sister to pay her share of household expenses now	<p>For more context, everything in the living room was purchased by my girlfriend and I. The TV, couch, kitchen appliances, etc. My girlfriend and I also pay an extra $400 (each) per month so my roommate can afford to live here. We pay fully for Internet and utilities. Only thing he’s responsible for is his room (which I never enter). During the weekdays or weekend he never comes out and hangs out with us in the living room, he plays Call of Duty in his room and eats in his room, or is just not here, so never utilizes the couch or anything in the living room unless we have people over which is like twice a month. I never complain when he wants to come out to the kitchen and grab food or do anything else for that matter, as it’s been a month since I’ve started sleeping there and have never complained or thought about complaining, because it is a common area and he is welcome to do as he pleases in this area. I fully recognize that. I also never watch TV past 10PM (he’s up until 12-1AM) and all the lights are off with me making no noise. </p>	0.889
NTA. Sorry you’re married to a child.   PS - Pooping is 109% normal, lots of women do it. It’s actually a sign you’re pushing, or “bearing down” the correct way.	<p>As someone else has pointed out below too, most of us - if we own an animal product from pre-vegan - will use it for the rest of its useful life (or rehome it, I gave my cheese to friends). So this one is just a mad one. My original point still stands that he probably isn’t doing it for environmental concerns, so your statement isn’t really relevant - although I do understand why it’s wasteful etc.</p>	0.841
woooooooooooosh, that isn't necesary. the money isn't needed today. there's a few years to get it together if OP actually gave shit...

That's some good advice!! Thanks truly for your insight!	<p>As for if you’re TA, no, you’re not. You were protecting yourself. Your mother may be disappointed, but she doesn’t get to decide what size family you should have. I also find it infuriating when a woman wants one or no children, and everyone tells her she has to have children, as if she doesn’t know what she wants. When that person is your mother, it’s more complicated, but she is making this about her when it’s not. Surgery is always risky. Instead of being angry, she should be glad you’re okay. Shame on her.</p>	0.935

Yea totally OP's fault. They should have predict the aunt passing. /s   Life ain't fair. OP has no fault in this AT ALL. The punishment of canceling the graduation party is totally acceptable when it comes to bullying. How could OP have known the aunt would pass? He was just supposed to have 40k stashed away "In case the aunt passed"? Yea right. Your responses reek of privilege and someone who's disconnected from reality. He literally cosigned loans, mentioned he will helpw this expenses and is allowed her to love into the basement for a better living situation. The other daughter won't be getting a check from the aunt in her future either, so neither one of them will have that advantage.	<p>Holy shit OP this doesn’t belong here.</p>	0.921

You should pay for your own wedding and you should return your parents hard earned money, being spent on your education. Don't expect or take other people's money if you cannot respect them.

ok. you've made enough points to me. I have nothing to say to you and would appreciate if you'd stop harassing me across this thread because I have a different opinion.	1. Applauding your son for not listening to his mother is crap. As a parent myself, it's low and undermines your wife's authority as a parent. You could have just as easily taken the big boy parent route and suggested he get the drink after. You instead took a route that belittled your wife in front of your child. Good luck with that. Just wait.	0.932
yeah you're right. the teenaged girl made a mistake... why are you making her out to be the fucking devil?   >She could have trauma till the day she dies because her stepsister didn't defend her and make her "friends" stop,  and what do you think being saddled with an extra 40k in debt all of a sudden will do to her? it's not an appropriate punishment and she's owed an apology for how things worked out.     > She's not entitled to Money she didn't "earn"  I would not let that be how my kid starts their journey in the world... It goes against everything I stand for personally. sorry you disagree. sorry you think it's worth sticking it to your own kid like that over a punishment you made that went sideways.   I can only hope they'd forgive you eventually but if it was me I don't think I ever would.	However, in this case, OP's Dad had expressly not desired another child and had even set up the system so OP's Mum wouldn't have access to the money (which strikes me that there could well be additional reasons going on there). OP's Mum adopted Trisha as a single parent and it sounds like they didn't have anything to do with the grandfather.	0.882
YTA. But more importantly what the actual f is wrong with you? You throw a sentient living being that you supposedly cared for in the trash? You’re a sad, sad person. Shame on you for not have the mental acumen to deal with a tough conversation with your kids that is going to happen no matter what, so you just throw your dog away with the rest of your trash. You’re pathetic.	<p>Let me say that I know what it is like to have an ex that is mean and manipulative. </p>	0.879

personally, my kids would always have a safe home with me no matter where they go. And i would never make my child pay rent in the one place that they are most comfortable. This world is already harsh and expensive to live in so why make it harder for your child over 350$? She didnt ask to be in this world. You should be teaching her the value of money and what it could do for her herself, not taking it from her for your own needs. Your responsibility is that home and them kids no matter what.	I guess I am coming at this from the perspective of a person who just sees too many children out here having sex like it’s no big deal. The normalization of abortion like it’s a trip to the dentist office. All these damaged kids looking for love and acceptance and having sex with anybody who pretends to love them. Like I could go on and on. But yeah I don’t have a problem at all with purity promises. I have a problem with double downing on ignorance. And that’s on both sides. Have your purity balls and galas for the kids and preteens and hope that it preserves their innocence for a couple of years. But TEACH them about their bodies and puberty and how it will effect them. Acknowledge that they will get horny and that there are going to be people who will willingly have sex with them with no thought of consequences. Teach them about safer sex and ADVISE abstinence. Teach them about STI’s and how rampant they are. Bust out the numbers if you have to. Google is your friend. And actually address abortions and what they actually are. Promote healthy respect and acceptance of their bodies and everything that comes with it.	0.833

You sound insufferable.	I mention this because my friend started having nightmares about her mother (no contact for 20 years when her Mum joined a cult) around the time of a family event. The stress of worrying about whether her Mum would turn up at this family event and what she might do, triggered the sleep disorder. Plus her ""nightmares"" (actually hypnagogic hallucinations) were of her Mum sitting on the end of her bed, ranting about God and Hell and how everyone but her cult was going there.	0.871
Sure. And let’s see how you would fair without the US as a military caretaker and trade partner.	<p>Because they live together though, it&#39;s best to let it go I think (but keep the shirts)... and be very, very careful in the future until you can move. Because clearly roomie will be sneaky, and you probably can&#39;t trust her in the future with packages <em>or</em> to respect your stuff in every way. It might be time for a lock for your bedroom. I&#39;d do it discreetly though- put it in when she&#39;s not home, and try to only lock it when she isn&#39;t looking for as long as possible. You don&#39;t want to find out if roomie has a petty vengeful streak or anything like that, which might come out if she sees a lock suddenly. I guess it depends on how well you know her- although living with someone always reveals new things about people- usually not good ones.</p>	0.784

Yeah, though it’s not evenly distributed. States like California with the most electric cars have the most renewable energy. The government just needs to go fully electric.	<p>Or ... you can bring the necklace to a jeweller and ask him to make two identical necklaces from your old one, in order to give one to each of your daughter. This is, in my opinion, the fairest option. Choosing one girl out of two to give something that valuable and meaningfull is cruel, and I would not consider this alteration to devalue your heritage. In fact, in my family/country, this is fairly common to change a little bit the jewels you get from your ancestors - because it doesn&#39;t fit right, or it is a little bit too old to be worn, or it is damaged by time ... consider this option, I think it would be a good idea.</p>	0.878

The fact that she's sneaking condoms makes me think that you never even bothered to talk to her about safe sex and went the abstinence only route. Especially since they can only be together with other adults around. Spoiler alert: THAT DOESN'T WORK. Teens will absolutely still find a way to have sex if they want to.	0.861
time to start saving...   they put their kid in debt over a petty punishment that no longer fits the crime.... they have a few years before that debt starts accruing interest to save to pay it off... I haven't seen anyone, op or otherwise even mention this that they can fully help their kid not be trapped under the mountain of debt they saddled on them. they don't seem to care though and if I was the daughter I would notice that.  either make amends. do your best to make your kid whole... or respect that they are going to want nothing to do with you in the future.	<p>So honestly, I can&#39;t give a judgement here based on the information alone. OP could be expected to drop her job, school and everything and be a caretaker, or she could pay rent...or other things that would make her Not TA. Her parents could also be supporting her fully and she has no immediate plans to move out or go to school or even get a job, and just expect to be taken care of while not having to help her sister...in which case the parents definitely aren&#39;t wrong for expecting her to pitch in. The way she complains about how weird and disgusting helping her sister is doesn&#39;t help her case at all, and points a bit towards the latter if I am honest.</p>	0.908
That is certainly a more complicated question isn't it?    >It’s really unfortunate that her behavior indirectly led to this because her party was canceled.  and she said it was out of her control what other people do... just like it was out of the parent's control that she doesn't get her check.   the difference is she gets punished... hard. meanwhile the parents get to hand wave it away with a cool "it wasn't my fault"   .... you have to see the hypocrisy here right?   beyond that.... regardless of what you think... it's about being the bigger person than your 17 year old kid.   there are ways to fix it. they may not be able to hand over 40k now... but they probably could before she has to start paying those student loans... better start saving.	<p>If you have dietary requirements, it’s on you to make that clear. This is not something MIL should have thought about off the top of her head for her wedding, especially since OP doesn’t sound intolerant to the point where she can’t eat any lactose whatsoever if she had salad as an option and still went for all the cheese on the planet, so even if guest dietary requirements did cross her mind as far as MIL is concerned she eats cheese etc anyway.</p>	0.889
Nta. What a douche	Huh what is happening here. Do you know how old your daughter is? Besides that yeah, your business was more important than your son or daughter, and perhaps even your unborn child, but now you can be a hands on parent.	0.78
He doesn't owe him shit. He is son is a moron marrying someone who cheated on him to bandaid the relationship.	Back when I was a kid and teenager she always portrayed it as way more dramatic. Like every month she would tell us we don't have a lot of money. We can barely make it. If she bought me something, like a videogame, she told me that we can't afford it, but she still bought it for me because she loved me so much.	0.898
Yes I'm glad I was very straight straight forward and honest with him about it.	<p>Two- For all we know he helped with the wedding. Or maybe he didnt because shes centering people who treated him so badly he was granted a restraining order. Again- huge red flag that shes siding with that side of the restraining order- i personally dont understand how op didnt just block the lot of them and move on right there tbh. </p>	0.894
NTA - Your mutual friends don't sound very friendly, I would have spoken up for my friend immediately if anyone treated him or her that way rather than suggest they should pay for the food they didn't order after having their dinner stolen. I'm happy you dumped the boyfriend but maybe don't stop there.	<p>No somehow it made it worse if anything</p>	0.915
that doesn't really change anything.	<p>For christs sakes you’re suppose to marry the love of your life...and you’re asking about escorts?? What if he brought home and STD and your girlfriend found out. That could wreck your relationship.</p>	0.826
You married a real jerk.	<p>Attempting to use as a babysitter without even discussing it was really rude on her part.  Your mom isn&#39;t any better and if she was so damn concerned she should have stepped up and volunteered, but she didn&#39;t.</p>	0.919
Hope she gets over you you selfish suck.	When my mother passed away, she said some very rude and cruel things to my father which were pretty unforgivable.  Then when my father passed away, she made the comment that she wished the rest of us had never been born because then she could have everything and we didn't deserve anything.  These things weren't said in the heat of the moment during an argument.  She just kind  of blurted them out.  I continued my mediator role with the mantra that I don't have to like her but I do need to be polite.	0.919
DO NOT VEMO HIM BACK ever!   He deserves it for being a jerk and eating YOUR food in front of people.   Girl, congratulations… it’s the new year and you’re already shedding extra unnecessary weight/load off!!! 😉.   Keep it up.	<p>now the fact that they found your posts on facebook doesn’t make you TA, but it does make you look a bit stupid. i know you said they’re all out of state, and shouldn’t have been in those groups, but there are always ways for people to see those posts!</p>	0.828

you should probably actually read the post...   >For my daughter, my aunt asked when we'd have the party so she can give the cheque. I told her we weren't planning a party as a consequence. She understood and said she'd bring the cheque when we met up in the future.  that is a commitment in my eyes.	<p>Tell your parents that you&#39;re not Steve&#39;s parents,  they are. I highly doubt this is the first time he has been a disrespectful and entitled houseguest. I also doubt that either your parents or Steve have been compensating you for the food and utilities Steve has been using. The absolute LEAST he could do is respect that you bought a special cake for your wife&#39;s birthday and keep his grubby paws off of it until the party. This was a gift for your wife and he helped himself to it without respecting basic courtesy. Next time you&#39;re at Steve&#39;s birthday, get your wife a big ass piece of his cake before the party starts. Hell, give your parents the same treatment, since it&#39;s not a big deal.</p>	0.88
Hmm, how dumb can I call you and not have my comment deleted....	<p>Like I said... I can accept the judgement of being an asshole for not just cutting ties with both of them for being racist. But if I am being racist in this situation I want to know about it, because I really don&#39;t see it and that&#39;s not the kind of person I am.</p>	0.889
And you're obviously a waste of oxygen	Of course that's my BS theory of middle children, not some profound psychological revelation, and all children and families are different, but it's something I strongly feel influences that lost middle child feel. As a pudding-potato baby/pregnancy , they don't have any anchor marking them as 'special' by default like first/last/oops/late lamb/multiple does. So it's all on their personality. If they turn out to be a menace, have issues, be amazing at sport/academically, they earn that position, but normal kids are just then...kids, and they didn't get that default first/last/'special' pregnancy status to give them memorability before they developed as children It's ALL on who they turn out to be, which may just be a normal person.	0.786
YTA. Fuck you. Fuck you so much. I hope he dumps you. You complete asshole	Your sister can carry on all she likes - doesn&#39;t change the fact she wasn&#39;t invited. She wants you to take her along, but you are under no obligation to do so. Don&#39;t let her make you feel bad.</p>	0.862
NTA. OP, just about everybody poops when they’re giving birth. It’s embarrassing, but it is 100% normal. I guarantee you his mother pooped when she gave birth to him. I’m sorry he’s being so insensitive, he deserved to be snapped at. If he’s okay with embarrassing you in front of everyone, he shouldn’t have a problem with you embarrassing him right back. He’s a jerk.	but it&#39;s a  whole different thing when they expect rent to be free. You have bills to pay too. If she wants to save up for a house she can slowly save up now while living in her current place or move to a cheaper place. Handing over a house to them is crazy. If anything just tell her you already have another family renting and nothing is available.</p>	0.887
It doesn’t suck. It just doesn’t exist.	<p>I’ve no issues with you being gay, but using sexuality as a way to get back at someone because you aren’t getting the living situation you want (which is entirely the fault of you &amp; your friend) just isn’t cool. You do have to live with this person so it may be smart to see if there’s some other arrangement that can be made so it works out for all of you. If the guy is homophobic, may I simply suggest that it may be a good teaching moment? You’re in a position to make someone rethink their attitude through your own actions &amp; who knows… you may make a good friend. Try not to assume the absolute worst until you know more &amp; have facts.</p>	0.894

 I hate you." No need to respond to this person again, if she ever even reaches out.	<p>From a strictly selfish perspective, you&#39;re making yourself look bad to the court. If you want more time with your kid, support them like a father should.</p>	0.86
Great, my kids are almost adults who go out like covid doesn't exist. My 19-year-old doesn't even have her vaccination. Stop comparing your kids that are not even teens to my almost adults who go everywhere.	<p>I will say I made the choice to marry an actual feminist who doesn’t care two figs what I do with my body hair or what I wear. Your wife might have made a bad call with you.</p>	0.778
>It sucks she missed out on the gift, but maybe this'll teach her that her actions can have consequences and to be a better person.  no... this will cause resentment in the family... it wasn't the intended punishment and it doesn't fit as the punishment for laughing at things other people said... for all you know she was nervous laughing and didn't really know how to handle it... we don't know her relationship to the other girls or how close of friends they actually are. she might have not wanted to draw their ire onto herself, her actions were not that egregious and you are ascribing maliciousness that was never proven to her actions unfairly.   beyond all of that this wasn't the intended punishment and resulted in huge ramifications to the daughter's life that none of her siblings dealt with.   now it's just inequitable treatment of their children in the eyes of the youngest. if op doesn't fix it they won't have much of a relationship moving forward...	<p>Side note: it’s also not great to call someone a bitch, so I understand why she would be upset about that. But that’s not the biggest issue here. Good luck!</p>	0.854
Yeah and now the person who committed is dead. People dont just have rainy day stashes of 40k to just hand out	<p>The sad truth is that now that he’s over 18, there is little that his parents can do to save him from the consequences of his actions. If he was still a minor, things could happen. But now, the only thing that could work is him having consequences for his behaviour. I’m watching my 23 year old niece being smacked around by life these days because her parents didn’t step up when she was younger. I literally told my sister ten years ago that this was not normal behaviour and that blaming it on hormones or just being a teenager would not help the situation. She’s been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but the I key treatment for it is cognitive behaviour therapy, which is hella uncomfortable and only works when the patient buys in to it and wants to change. </p>	0.903
Your parents should have beat you a bit more. It didn’t take	Amber ended up calling me herself a few hours later and reiterated what my son said. I thanked her again for the gesture but said I would rather all the kids call me the same name if it’s my choice. She said that isn’t the reason for the “ticket” and that she was really hurt I didn’t want a special bond with her baby. I ended the call by telling her we have plenty of time to decide since the baby isn’t due until September and it will be months before she will be calling me anything.	0.896

YTA. It would be different if your two daughters were younger but they’re more than capable of acting independently. They should be allowed to meet your new baby before 2 weeks & also see you before then. I feel you’re treating them like they’re extended family. At the end of the day, it is your choice who sees your new child but I think as your child’s siblings they should be one of the first people to meet them.

It seems more than just “time off”.  *Time off* is something she plans with her husband. *time off* very Monday morning that she hides from the husband is ridiculous.  The Monday appointment takes priority over the health and safety of a 5 year old - so it’s not “time off”. It’s something fixed and important enough for her to continue regardless of childcare. It’s important enough that her parents are helping her to do whatever activity it is and hide it from the husband. It’s important enough that OPs dad thinks it warrants OP skipping school to mind the kid.  Is she getting therapy? Medical treatment? Taking a class? Working part-time? Organizing her life to get away from an abusive situation? What could it be?  I’m wondering what would warrant that kind of consideration from the parents and behavior from the sister.	They obviously suck because when they realise they've gone about it wrong, they keep pushing.	0.882
nah but you both sound kinda stupid (and i mean that in the best way) but its so easy to learn how to jump start a car. ask a mechanic to show you/ explain once and you're done. youtube is another great source.

Thanks for your comment. I don’t want the money for myself, and don’t really know a lot of charity i could give to..	Sorry for the rant I just see so many people want to “pick a side” it seems. And they completely ignore or forget what it was like to be teenagers, or worse they are ignorant to the fact that it IS different now. We are all exposed to so much hyper sexuality in media and marketing that it is practically impossible to raise a kid in the current modern world without them being exposed to sexuality in one way or the other. So we shouldn’t just ignore it and pretend that it doesn’t happen and that your kids are never going to be tempted mentally and physically to engage in sex. We should be teaching them that they are MORE and worth more than just the fleeting “pleasures of the flesh” lol.</p>	0.87
yes... taking away a once in a lifetime event is never an appropriate punishment unless something egregious happened. not sticking up to bullies isn't what I consider egregious. it's not great and obviously behavior that needs correcting but it's also really common in teens in groups... they just need some course correcting... not taking away a once in a lifetime event from them that celebrates everything they have accomplished.   those mistakes don't negate the achievements...	It's not just disrespectful to you, but it's animal cruelty.  That's just such a huge red flag - anyone who isn't good to animals, is not good, period.  I worry for the unborn child.

Either someone needs to move, or he needs to invest in some noise cancelling headphones (which won&#39;t fully solve the issue either, but might help a bit).</p>	0.827

NTA at all. Does he realize how common it is to do that? The feeling of having to push is literally the same exact feeling of having a bowel movement, it’s literally nothing at all for any woman to be embarrassed about and I promise you the hospital staff doesn’t give a flying fuck about it. They care about healthy mom and healthy baby, end of story.   Sorry you had to find out after having a baby with this jerk, but your husband is a grade A asshole.

And now he&#39;s trying to pin his &quot;small mistake&quot; on you. He can&#39;t get it right either way--makes your celebration all about him, and makes his mistakes all about you.

NTA	<p>Growing up I&#39;ve always dreamed  of what my wedding dress will look like. I went wedding dress shopping with friends although my fiance wanted to go with me like he always does but of course he couldn&#39;t. I purchased a really really nice wedding dress that I instantly fell in love with. It is perfect in every aspect and it only cost $400 that&#39;s a great deal since wedding dress tend to be expensive here. When I got back and was so thrilled my fiance asked to see it then asked how much it cost. When I told him he was in dismay and started complaining saying I wasted that much money on a colorless dress that I&#39;ll wear for just few hours and should&#39;ve bought a 150$ dress or less. I said no wedding dresses are huge deal to every bride. He argued about how weddings and everything that come with them are just part of the laws our society keeps enforcing on us and that only smart brides save money instead of blowing it all on... a dress.	0.86
well if he was 40k in the whole the kid would have the money and probably wouldn't hate op.   op could fix this by having an honest talk with the daughter and committing to helping pay off the debt... not just cosigning so he's forced to if she blows her credit...	you had to close the door, there are pets in the house.	0.794

One of our biggest fights was when he was asking for nudes and I told him I was in a bad mood so I told him not now.

Hon, I’d have been terrified too. Like, putting a chair under my door and having three locks kinda of terrified. It’s not okay and you should never, ever have to tolerate this. And seriously, never do again. </p>	0.882
