If you buy the houses that city folks are buying you won't have city folks duhhhhhhh	Not necessarily all of them, mind you. There are some who move to them and embrace the atmosphere and culture they have, who want to change nothing about them and those, I have no quarrel with at all. I'm more referring to the ones who are basically moving to them to escape the mess of the cities they've helped create.  Now, most small towns are more or less perpetually frozen in time. There may be newer cars and trucks moving through the streets, but aside from that, you could easily mistake still being in the mid to late 20th Century. And that's the way many of us who live here like it. We like the old style atmosphere, the fact that nothing really changes, the quiet, peaceful air they have. We like the mom and pop shops and garages owned by the same families for almost eighty to a hundred years, the local coffee shops and small malls and bookstores, and on the coasts, the long lived fishing docks and plants. We don't care for high priced chain stores or coffee shops like Starbucks or any of that fluff. Now, not all like that, but those who don't simply move away to a place they like better, and we're fine with that. You live how you want where you do, and we'll keep to ourselves.  That is, until the type of city folk I mentioned above decide to flee to small towns. They don't integrate. They have no connection to the small town lifestyle, and they have no connection to the place's history, and thus care nothing for preserving it. They bulldoze historic buildings that are not under preservation status yet for the ugly modern aesthetics they created in the cities, they force the mom and pop shops out of business by bringing in the very high end and high price chain stores and coffee shops none of us wanted. They end up raising the prices of houses and apartment rent, forcing many of the families who grew up for generations in them out. They fundamentally change the town forever by changing the laws and regulations through sheer mass in their votes. They effectively destroy how it used to be and create a mini version of the place they just left.  And what could be the worst part of the whole ordeal? They stare with upturned noses at those of us who were here either our whole lives or long stretches of it. They have the air of superiority of being upper class city dwellers, self assured in the knowledge that they are better than us backwards plebians. They scoff and say with smug expressions that they're making the place better, that they know best, and how could anyone possibly want to live the way the town was for decades or longer before they showed up.   Until, that is, they effectively wreck the area and begin complaining about the same things they had before they came here, and go to another place yet untouched by them to start the process all over again. So, yeah. City people absolutely ruin small towns with their mindsets and changes.   And personally? I think they should stay in their cities and deal with the consequences of what they brought down on their own heads. Not everyone wants to live like you do.

Also, an actual depressive episode such as a bipolar episode CAN be triggered by life stressors, but that's different from feeling sad for a day because you had an argument and then otherwise feeling fine. Yes, I think it's important to talk and receive support for no matter what you're dealing with -- anxiety, sadness, feelings of being overwhelmed, etc. I just disagree with using the term ""depressed"" for it. I've seen a lot of posts on this sub stating things like depression doesn't exist, or people with depression just need to change their mindset, or you shouldn't medicate yourself to deal with life, etc."	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rs30br/people_who_self_diagnose_them_self_with/hqjsrq9/

I know people like you. Most likely an uppity liberal gamer who thinks he's the moral compass of society because they don't "go out to immature parties and drink poisonous alcohol"   Seriously, grow up.	I’m 26, with one kid and a wife. I watch Disney movies alone, which by itself isn’t that out of the ordinary. My father in law (48), on the other hand, won’t even play with the buttons on a child’s toy or wear a funny sweater because it might make him ‘look childish and he is grown.’ It’s corny and ruins the fun for everyone when the head of a household won’t even loosen up a little for fear of staining his image with.. fun?  I guess a moderately relevant example would be how I said something the other day about a hypothetical zombie apocalypse and somebody said ‘are we 5 years old? That is for kids who believe in stuff like that. It’s stupid to even have that conversation because we all know it’s fake and we aren’t kids.’ Which was just a mood killer by itself.	Sounds like somebody needs a nap.  There are so many comments like this one online.  Usually they use the phrase "grown ass adult," which I've always found funny... yes, our asses do grow, don't they?  But really, what a downer this guy is, if you actually listened to him.  He has an image of what a grownup "should be," (probably stitched together from Hollywood tropes) and he expects *you* to follow it.  He will learn one day.

I made an argument for having a balanced upbringing. 8 hours a day gaming is too much, so is 8 hours doing any one singular activity, but you can’t sit here and spew falsehoods like it’s a useless skill. A fun study was done years ago where [surgeons who played video games as kids](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSN2J30397820070219) showed higher success rates than their peers mostly due to the training of fine motor skills.	Not every young person with an older person is a victim of grooming but the underdeveloped frontal lobe of an 18 year old 'adult' makes them more susceptible to it. When there's clear red flags in a relationship where there's a large age gap, it is not unreasonable to question the motives of each partner. Red flags and age gaps almost ALWAYS meet in the middle, rarely does one have nothing to do with the other. There's always a motive when a grown ass adult wants to date some kid fresh out of high school."	<p>Some guy pretending to be friends with you so he can get in your pants or court you for dating is creepy indeed, but developing feelings for someone as they grow is an incredibly natural occurrence, and confessing those feelings to clear the air is the healthiest thing you can do for any kind of relationship, assuming the person you&#39;re confessing to is emotionally mature enough to handle the conversation like an adult and not get creeped out and defensive and shut that person out.</p>	<p>I know it&#39;s anecdotal, but I have an uncle who is every bit as &quot;naturally&quot; smart as either of us in many ways. Or at least, he clearly could have been. But where you and I cope just fine, he&#39;s got social anxieties he manages with ridiculous amounts of weed, and he started at like 10. He dropped out in 9th grade. Still a great thinker and does plenty of independent learning, but for all the metrics of success and SES that intelligence is supposed to help with, he&#39;s way down at the &quot;might not have electricity next month&quot; end.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rrxsl3/too_many_adults_are_completely_obsessed_with/hqknqvn/

And there's nothing your bitter ass can do about it. Fuck off	I’m 26, with one kid and a wife. I watch Disney movies alone, which by itself isn’t that out of the ordinary. My father in law (48), on the other hand, won’t even play with the buttons on a child’s toy or wear a funny sweater because it might make him ‘look childish and he is grown.’ It’s corny and ruins the fun for everyone when the head of a household won’t even loosen up a little for fear of staining his image with.. fun?  I guess a moderately relevant example would be how I said something the other day about a hypothetical zombie apocalypse and somebody said ‘are we 5 years old? That is for kids who believe in stuff like that. It’s stupid to even have that conversation because we all know it’s fake and we aren’t kids.’ Which was just a mood killer by itself.	Yeah why do you care so much? Who gives a shit? Live your life and let people live theirs. These people may be annoying but you sound miserable.	<p>You just want to forget every argument anyone else has made on this entire post and you just want to reassert your OP.</p>	See every time my response is ignored! We have been over this, it would behove you to not ignore what’s written.	But if you do shit behind my back? Fuck right off and gtfo. You're done and gone. And if you're not, I am. That's an uncalled for breach of trust and commitment.	If you convince yourself that things are bad, that every effort people put forward is pointless, that we are en route to annihilation within our lifetimes, that's all you're ever going to see. Now, I'm not saying life is all hunky dory, but a pessimist a savior does not make, the more of us who turn our backs on the future to just 'accept we're fucked' the more we'll actually be fucked come the time."

I have a pair of leather mittens with wool lining on the inside that I use for snowboarding. On top of being far more warm, dry, and comfortable than any pair of gloves I’ve ever worn, I believe they are also better for the environment than many synthetic gloves would be.   For one, this pair of leather gloves will outlast 2-3 pairs of synthetic gloves. Then once they do finally wear out they’ll actually decompose unlike the synthetic ones which will sit in a landfill for several hundred years.   Also clothes made from natural fibers won’t contribute to the microtrash problem. Synthetic fibers from clothes have been found in some of the most remote places in the world and are impacting our worlds ecosystems. These fibers will infiltrate the soil and be eaten by animals. Until we can create a synthetic fabric that is long lasting, durable, non toxic, and biodegradable than natural fibers will be better in most situations	Also materials like leather are waste products of the meat industry. Hardly any animals are being killed for the leather alone. If it’s not being turned into gloves, shoes, etc. it will be dumped into a landfill. Which sounds worse to you: leather on your boots, or cow skin in a landfill?	<p>Expose as much skin as you like, undergarments included, but understand I can not expose skin under professional rules, so those of us in collared shirts and (typically) long sleeves/jackets get to decide how cool it is. You are welcome to wear more clothes if you’d like.</p>	Expose as much skin as you like, undergarments included, but understand I can not expose skin under professional rules, so those of us in collared shirts and (typically) long sleeves/jackets get to decide how cool it is.

One chooses to get tattoos, in the same way as they choose how to dress.</p>	I'm not ugly by any means and far too young to actually have serious blemishes. I actually only started wearing make-up once I was confident in my own looks. Wearing make-up isn't just about fixing and/or covering someone's face to make it look better. As cheesy as it sounds, it feels more like bringing a part of yourself out in a really artsy way.	<p>By your logic all medicine, plastic, metals… pretty much everything under the sun should be free too?  Because its just molecular structures put together in a certain way to serve a purpose.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rs65fr/using_clothes_made_from_animal_skins_or_furs_is/hql2rqc/

You don't get to say shit like that then complain about people being bigoted you drunk wife beater	Not necessarily all of them, mind you. There are some who move to them and embrace the atmosphere and culture they have, who want to change nothing about them and those, I have no quarrel with at all. I'm more referring to the ones who are basically moving to them to escape the mess of the cities they've helped create.  Now, most small towns are more or less perpetually frozen in time. There may be newer cars and trucks moving through the streets, but aside from that, you could easily mistake still being in the mid to late 20th Century. And that's the way many of us who live here like it. We like the old style atmosphere, the fact that nothing really changes, the quiet, peaceful air they have. We like the mom and pop shops and garages owned by the same families for almost eighty to a hundred years, the local coffee shops and small malls and bookstores, and on the coasts, the long lived fishing docks and plants. We don't care for high priced chain stores or coffee shops like Starbucks or any of that fluff. Now, not all like that, but those who don't simply move away to a place they like better, and we're fine with that. You live how you want where you do, and we'll keep to ourselves.

Contrary to what you want to believe, I'd rather live in a world where those people are among us than one where anyone can come up with some bullshit justification for physically harming someone else because they just dislike that person. ""I don't like that person. Well I haven't seen them do X in a while, so they're probably racist. I think they are racist so now I can assault them physically"".	<p>I’ll be the first to agree that both individuals being drunk is a messy situation. However try posing that scenario to people. I have.  The notion that they are both in the wrong is not the common opinion, especially from women. There will be a significant bias towards saying the woman can’t give consent because their judgement is impaired. There will usually be no concern of the same for the guy nor any consideration that their judgement is impaired and thus they may not be able to judge the level of intoxication of themself or the woman very well. </p>	I’ll be the first to agree that both individuals being drunk is a messy situation.

Even if men do come out, we're belittled just like [Earl Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Silverman) or they’re gaslit into believing women have it worse as if the patriarchy gives us a free coupon for every hit or verbal abuse we take. The worst shit is when we’re being told that we’re taking up space. In the UK, [576,000 men and 1.2 million women](https://www.mankind.org.uk/statistics/) reported being abused and nearly 51% only reported their abuse. Let's also remember COVID-19 has shaken the table for a lot of victims in abusive relationships.	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rrmw33/city_people_ruin_small_towns/hqlk6bt/

Still curious how do you think 1% of the population still being around means surviving. Dumb pinko	Not necessarily all of them, mind you. There are some who move to them and embrace the atmosphere and culture they have, who want to change nothing about them and those, I have no quarrel with at all. I'm more referring to the ones who are basically moving to them to escape the mess of the cities they've helped create.  Now, most small towns are more or less perpetually frozen in time. There may be newer cars and trucks moving through the streets, but aside from that, you could easily mistake still being in the mid to late 20th Century. And that's the way many of us who live here like it. We like the old style atmosphere, the fact that nothing really changes, the quiet, peaceful air they have. We like the mom and pop shops and garages owned by the same families for almost eighty to a hundred years, the local coffee shops and small malls and bookstores, and on the coasts, the long lived fishing docks and plants. We don't care for high priced chain stores or coffee shops like Starbucks or any of that fluff. Now, not all like that, but those who don't simply move away to a place they like better, and we're fine with that. You live how you want where you do, and we'll keep to ourselves.  That is, until the type of city folk I mentioned above decide to flee to small towns. They don't integrate. They have no connection to the small town lifestyle, and they have no connection to the place's history, and thus care nothing for preserving it. They bulldoze historic buildings that are not under preservation status yet for the ugly modern aesthetics they created in the cities, they force the mom and pop shops out of business by bringing in the very high end and high price chain stores and coffee shops none of us wanted.

[removed]	text_not_found	some people just should not have children."	If you want to look for offence where none was intended, then that's up to you. The reality is, though, is that most heterosexual people aren't ""childfree"". They might not be able to have kids. The might not be able to afford to have kids. They might have missed the opportunity to have kids. But people who absolutely *don't* want kids are a minority."	Your argument is based on how it makes “no sense” when in fact it absolutely does. Not everyone has the desire to procreate. Not everyone has the opportunity to procreate. Not everyone wants to go through the process of carrying a child to full term (even though they can).  In all those instances someone may be biologically able but choose to go a different route.	Most people don't think these things about childfree people solely because of their decision to not reproduce. Except for the parents of the individuals in question, who might want grandkids, it doesn't affect anyone else whether or not these people want children. What people take issue with is the vitriol directed at ""breeders"" and indeed, at little children themselves. It's weird.	Others choose to opt out of that bullshit for many reasons, but largely because parents don't actually make it sound like that great of a plan. There's lots of complaining about well.... Everything to do with raising kids. All the time. Why the actual fuck would someone who doesn't want to have kids, put themselves through that?	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsceyc/saying_you_want_to_remain_child_free_should_be/hqlpwt7/

It's not necessarily that I (or anyone else cares about them) it is more so that (if nothing else) a law to dictate helmets/ seatbelts in order to reduce the chances of a kid getting traumatized from seeing someone splattered on the asphalt.	This justification leads to absurd safety regulations, freedom loss, and less fun in life. If applied everywhere, in earnest, would lead to kids not getting on a bus to go to school, or even in a car with their parents. Their wouldn't be cars, or alcohol, or stairs, etc.  It's a way to make anyone who opposes a regulation look like they don't care about human life while simultaneously making the speaker look virtuous.  It's the worst justification to buy into.	And that's the rub. 😁 Motorcycle helmet laws, I think, are interesting to consider as example. I ride with lots of people who don't wear a helmet. I think few would argue helmets would save lives, lots of lives, maybe even their's  but they all think helmet laws should be done away with. I do too, and I wear one.  How much gear and regulation should a biker have to wear/buy/follow because you (not necessarily actually you) think they should save their own lives? It's not like they're lack of use of a helmet might kill you.   Does caring about it have to result in laws/regulation/fines to prove you care?	If you want to wear a helmet so bad, just do it. I don't intend to argue why you shouldn't wear protective gear, as long as it doesn't make things worse you can if you want to. I wouldn't tell a pedestrian to not wear helmet if they want to, if they fall it could help. Same goes for most things you can do. But we don't wear helmets while we walk or while we drive cars, because the risk isn't big enough to justify the inconveniences that come with wearing a helmet. If you're fine with living your life with a helmet on at all times, that's your decision and I'm fine with you doing that.	<p>If you want to wear a helmet so bad, just do it.

Another way to make the back roads safer would be to ban cars off the road, (I'm not advocating for that, just putting it out there).

There is nothing more infuriating than being in the middle of a multi-hour road trip and having someone in the left lane who will not move over to let you by, despite going under the speed limit.  What makes the most sense is that you must yield to overtaking traffic if you are in any lane except the right lane (i.e. passing lanes).  For some reason, some people are either unaware that there are other cars on the road or they feel entitled to dictate the flow of traffic. Slow traffic not moving out of the passing lanes is what causes traffic jams and accidents due to many people passing on the right.  Slow driving in passing lanes is oblivious at best, usually inconsiderate, and dangerous at worst. Let the speeders do their thing in passing lanes, and let highway patrol do their jobs.	[removed]	text_not_found	<p>In general (not so much to OP) if you have the attitude that speeding is dangerous bcuz it breaks the law... I don&#39;t want to see you going 68 in a 65. Because then what you&#39;re saying is, &quot;I can choose what the limit is. no one should drive faster than what I decide is OK.&quot; BS. Now you&#39;re the law? Either obey the law (a sound principle) or GTFO for other drivers deciding LIKE YOU that they can determine reasonable speeds. </p>	In general (not so much to OP) if you have the attitude that speeding is dangerous bcuz it breaks the law...

My issue is seemingly only the driver being in the wrong in the situation. You don’t have the right of way, you’re making it look like you want to cross the road which may or may not make a driver nervous because they don’t actually know if you’re going to cross the road, you’re impeding traffic just by standing there, you may or may not be endangering other peoples lives by crossing the road when nobody is visibly stopping or slowing down to allow you to go.

[removed]	When people say free in this context they understand its not free. Do you get all upset when someone says Amazon Prime comes with free shipping? "But the shipping isn't free because you have to pay for prime!" No shit.  And maybe you don't care about other people, but I am happy to pay taxes that help benefit society.	All US central government spending is done by crediting accounts with money that it creates out of thin air, taxes and treasury bills/bonds don't fund it.	1) not really. I guess you didnt really say how youd do taxes for the GUBI, but I assume it would be something like a graduated income tax and separate from any national taxes, or a national tax where a government just gives a certain amount based on their GDP, and they are responsible for raising that money on their own. Either way, if the government just raises taxes on each citizen by the amount given by the GUBI, it does nothing to help citizens, and in countries with enough citizens and a low enough GDP, the taxes they pay would be less than the money they get. Basically, the govt would just take advantage of it to give people in the government that extra money, and it might not affect the people at all.	<p>1) not really.

They may not directly ban my publication but there are several different perfectly reasonable excuses they'll use (""we are cuting too many trees so we have to reduce paper consumption"", ""we have shortages so we'll only provide ink to essential services"", ""only fact-checked publication are allowed in official sotres"" and so on)	<p>The only real reason for the USA to convert to metric is for science as it stops mistakes in conversion when using US figures or the US using someone else’s.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rs6s8m/everyone_should_have_access_to_free_internet/hqn6lro/

[removed]	text_not_found	This subreddit is really something else.  r/UNPOPULARopinion, seems like I am having a very UNPOPULAR opinion here, yet getting no upvotes....so.... is my opinion popular?  Do people agree with me?  When I see top posts on this subreddit, it is of things people agree with constantly. Isn't that the complete opposite of what this subreddit is supposed to be about?"	<p>But the reality is that that is very, very small and even people most people find attractive don&#39;t get many of those benefits - they&#39;re usually consolidated into the upper echelon of the most attractive.</p>	But you might not be like my friend. You might be going off of a personal lived experience. Which is fine and all. I guess I’m just sharing my unpopular opinion about your relatively popular unpopular opinion.	<p>This subreddit is really something else.  <a href=""/r/UNPOPULARopinion"">r/UNPOPULARopinion</a>, seems like I am having a very UNPOPULAR opinion here, yet getting no upvotes....so.... is my opinion popular?

Isn&#39;t that the complete opposite of what this subreddit is supposed to be about?</p>	The problem is all unpopular opinions are like the second argument, even if it is debated really good, there is a reason why it is unpopular. So some people just can&#39;t relate to the argument in any way, so they just downvote it, more unpopular it gets more downvotes given, so it just turns to a popular opinions page. For example this opinion is pretty popular and known, but i will probably get upvotes anyways :)</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rsllnd/its_2022_and_pens_and_paper_should_be_free/hqn7ja8/

[removed]	If you can't afford a pen and paper or source them for yourself, I'm sure some partisan group would be more than happy to fight for you and your opinion in 3xchange for your support.	<p>In a professional setting (like an actual career, not a crappy retail or fast food job) where you have been treated well, it&#39;s a courtesy to the company that allows them a couple of weeks to find a replacement with less stress and should give you a couple of weeks to tie off any remaining tasks and get ready to pass things over to your replacement. I work for a small vet clinic and our HR/OM is in the middle of this process. She&#39;s cleaning out her office, organizing things for the next person to come in, just trying to get things together in general, so that when the transition happens it&#39;s much easier on all the staff and her replacement.</p>	<p>“Taking a few days off to relax, unwind and recharge the batteries after a stressful couple of months. So don’t worry if I don’t respond to calls and texts. I will be back on Thursday!”</p>	“Taking a few days off to relax, unwind and recharge the batteries after a stressful couple of months.

I finished my MBA, flipped to HR and now I get to tell people how to bend at the knees while lifting."	Is this an unpopular opinion??

OP literally said some people are too toxic and still keep being toxic after repeated attempts to talk to them, and that they aren't talking about those situations. You know if you actually read the post and didn't immediately go into negativity mode maybe youd have realised what you said was covered.	I've been on Reddit for a while, & I like the *drama* posts sometimes. I'm a bad person, I know. Anyway. So many times I see posts such as, "My husband of twenty years forgot my birthday!" or "My stepmother keeps taking my phone chargers!" or something equally trivial. The top comments on these posts are often, "CUT THEM OUT OF YOUR LIFE!"   I understand some people are toxic enough after repeated efforts & you just can't reason with 'em. I'm talking about things like minor disputes, misunderstandings, little spats. Excommunication shouldn't be the first thing people go to when honest open communication is the best option. I get more often than not, you can come to some surprising results when you actually talk to people.	Sometimes people do "minor things" that are "The straw that broke the camels back". Sometimes if you deal with someone's bullcrap for long enough, the smallest thing can make you realize that person no longer needs to be in your life.  Furthermore, if you see toxic patterns forming from the little things you see people do, cut those people out before those little problems grow into a larger pattern.  CUT THEM OUT OF YOUR LIFE.	<p>When someone tells someone something they don’t want to hear, most people would reply instantly. So there are rash and emotional decisions and having serious conversations over text can lead to misunderstandings and getting hurt even more. You don’t see the other person, you don’t hear the tone of their voice. So it can feel like they just discarded you. Granted, there is a chance that that’s precisely what they are doing… but still.</p>	When someone tells someone something they don’t want to hear, most people would reply instantly.

Im one of those people who can sleep through loud noises but I need like 20 minutes of complete silence and eyes shut to start the sleep. In my country, people tend to set the fireworks and firecrackers off at even 8pm and it's so annoying like save it for twelve midnight january 1. I really dont celebrate new year cuz I want to sleep. Like there should be fines ons setting of fireworks really early.	putting off fireworks in general should be illegal. its fucking annoying and its for a stupid holiday	Someone who believes in the ideals of Nazism is a fucking Nazi - I don’t care if they don’t make membership cards anymore."	<p>So calling Trump supporters fascist  is pretty fair in my opinion.</p>	<p>Someone who believes in the ideals of Nazism is a fucking Nazi - I don’t care if they don’t make membership cards anymore.</p>	You can do this with anything.

The issue is force feeding it to children, so young they don't even comprehend it's message or the fact that it's not mandatory, on daily basis in a school environment. Do you not see a difference there. That is what we are talking about, don't try to move goalposts.	[removed]	The Netherlands and Taiwan both have flag anthems. Italy has one which is really an abridged version of the anthem. And Norway’s is a bugle call.	I can't stand it when people say to get rid of math or whatever other basic subject to teach these things either. Let kids take what they're interested in and if they can get skills like critical thinking, how to draw logical conclusions, and reading and applying that information then they don't need a specific class for every little subject.	3. We have another problem with children pushing *their* ideas and thoughts on other children, who grow up to find out it has no relevance to their adult lives (and wasn't even that important back then, either)."	A child normally doesn't know any better. They *learn* all the time. And even if they were raised badly - you do not hit children. No, it shouldn't be legal whatsoever. This imo is not an ""unpopulae opinion"", it's just an excuse to physically abuse children and support that behaviour."	Surely you already knew this. Im curious as to why this issue sticks in your craw. It's not like we're here saying feed everyone for free. It's kids, ffs. They shouldn't have to go hungry at all since they've got no other way to get food besides going to school, if for whatever reason the parents aren't providing their lunch.	<li><p>We have another problem with children pushing <em>their</em> ideas and thoughts on other children, who grow up to find out it has no relevance to their adult lives (and wasn&#39;t even that important back then, either).</p></li>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rs266i/the_pledge_of_allegiance_is_authoritarian_and/hqnqzss/

Furloughing them, calling them back in, and if they don't show up you take em off the schedule sounds pretty fucking unfair. Calling them back in or taking them off would not fly with a union.

Construction is behind in applying tech and it's not hard to exceed the tech savviness of the older generation. The new people getting started are more savvy but it's a growth part of it. Essentially there's more modeling of what will happen before work starts. You will have to learn how to read plans but it's not a horrible thing to do.

But yes, there had always been a part that never wanted to be 'freed' in the first place. They think foreign soldiers are crusaders. We had all the time to show them a difference. And we did not.

Stores not being in walking distance, *that's really messed up laughs in European*  I definitely do ***not*** mean roads by stroads, there's two videos explaining how ridiculous your American fucking stroads are. I'd recommend the first over the second, however, since you're just another lousy 'Murican, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and watch the second.

Rude.  >Also, wtf is up with your ugly stroads  What is a stroad? You mean road? If so, I've found that our roads are mostly alright. Up north they can get pretty bad because ice destroys roads, but I'm from the south and generally have no problems with our roads.  >non-existing national public transit network,  Suburbs in the mid 1900s caused/were designed with the intent to sell cars. Most people I know will commute 30+ minutes by car each way just to get to work, and that is without traffic. I commute about 25-30 miles.  Now our way of life in our mostly empty country is designed around cars, with a 45-90 minute/mile drive generally being seen as "average" to people who live everywhere but big cities.  >inability to cycle  Same as above. Suburbs means that unless you live in a city, most stores are not even within walking distance. My nearest supermarket is several miles away. Also I do not go to the store every single day, so I am not going to carry all of my shopping on a bicycle back to my home.  Public transit and cycling is very common in cities where the above is not the case. I know many people from big cities (mostly NYC) who do not even own cars.  >and humongous congestions  Same as above. An average sized city has 200,000+ people in it where most of them need to get to and from work at approximately the same hour, and as stated before, many do not even live in the metropolitan area of the city they work in. It is an unfortunate side effect of the above.	<p>I can&#39;t think of a single instance where paying for a service can&#39;t prevent you from seeing tits, and I live in Europe where copyright laws are quite a bit stricter than in thw US.

Or you could check yourself if your still in mommies basement screaming about the wrong brand of chicken nuggets.	Most of us have probably been slapped by our parent before and it's considered "okay" for a parent to do so. But if a child were to slap back, it would be wrong. Not talking about like a 30 year old parent and a 7 year old, but for e.g. 45 year old parent and 20 year old child.  I've been slapped many many times growing up, during arguments simply because I was just verbally trying to defend myself.  FYI Getting slapped is extremely common in an Asian household	text_not_found	One time my mom told me a story about how her hamster killed her sisters and ate it’s brain out. Some Hamsters must be really crazy."	<p>One time my mom told me a story about how her hamster killed her sisters and ate it’s brain out. Some Hamsters must be really crazy.</p>	* *Derek Drymon made a comment about the SpongeBob theme song: ""Steve's idea was to try to make the most annoying song you can, to—so when Saturday morning, when kids turn the TV on and parents are trying to sleep, you have this pirate screaming in the other room for the kids to jump on the floor.""*	What specifically changed for me was a day in 3rd grade when a classmate called my mom a ""fat bitch."" My reaction was abbhorent and indicative of the racist household I was raised in. I will forever feel ashamed of what I said but my only offer of understanding is that I was 8 and unfortunately being raised by a a white junky racist step dad at the time. When the kid called my mom a ""fat bitch,"" I called him something I'd heard my step dad say at the TV or black charecters on TV...I called him a ""stupid N*****."" I honestly didn't even know what it meant, just that my step dad called black people that when he was pissed off and I was super pissed so...	<p>Last time we did one (pre-pandemic) was shortly after we reunited with our extended biological family. My mom’s adopted and is into genealogy. Our new teenage cousins were at that awkward age where they feel self conscious about everything so at first they were hesitant about the egg hunt, even though they were the only participants still considered children - the only participants for whom the egg hunt still made sense 😂 But once they saw that my late 20s sister and I, and our mid 30s men were not going to hold back, they let loose and tore ass all over the yard.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ru2edy/if_a_parent_can_slap_their_child_then_the_child/hqxuy35/

Kitty, you’re literally trying to correct a professional on the field they’re a professional at. How big is the stick up your arse to the point you feel you are righteous enough to correct everyone with a diploma. Don’t know what to tell you other than just because you have kitty in your name doesn’t make you a cat expert you know.	Tw; brutal descriptions  First things first, why i think this way. I want to state that i, Soy, am a *professional cat groomer*, i am what is the known as a CFMG, there are less then 500 of us worldwide so we arent very well known. To become a CFMG (certified feline master groomer) you need to take 4 written exams and many many practical exams with your ppi instructor. I have been practicing since i was 8 (my mom is a CFMG and had been for 11 years now so i was raised with cat grooming) i point this out to make it clear that i do in fact, know what i am talking about. I will use facts that i personally have seen regarding cats not being groomed on a regular basis.  now onto my reasonings  Reason 1; •Build up of dead fur and grease will cause matting• ~~Without proper combing and bathing, the dead fur and grease build up will cause matting/ pelting on a cat. (pelting being a more severe matting) These are incredibly hard to get out of a cat without harming them as their thin paper-like skin folds up into their fur. This makes the chances of accidentally cutting the cats much higher. Cats skin, being not connected to any tissue, if badly cut they can open up like a zipper.   Reason 2; •it is overall healthier for the cats• ~~once you get all the dirt, grease, and possible mats off of your cat, they will have a much healthier lifestyle, they’ll be able to run around and feel great while their coat takes time to recover from the neglect it was given. Their coat will be able to grow back healthier, cleaner, and much much better. Getting possible mats off will also help elderly cats with arthritis as mats weigh down cats causing them to carry much more weight around. In addition to this, note that infections can take place under those mats, such as feal bite dermatitis and stud tail. You can also find masses and other concerning issues that the mats have been hiding once you shave them off.  Reason 3; •Health for the owner• ~~Getting your cats washed on a regular basis will reduce dander on cats which will reduce allergic reactions, it’ll get rid of the saliva on their fur causing some reactions. If you choose to shave them you wouldnt have as much stress with combing them out and wouldnt have to worry about the amount of shed  Reason 4;  •Maintenance• ~~Cats as they are, are high maintenance, but keeping your cat clean and combed will make it easier to brush them and makes for a much cleaner house  Reason 5; •Possible health issues• ~~Bringing your cat into the groomer will allow you to know if there are concerns about your cats health, if your cat has any masses or other things we notice (such as fleas, acne, needing a dental, maybe liver failure, stuff like that) we will take note of it and recommend a vet visit (we are not vets therefore we are not able to diagnose anything, but we will point them out so you know what you need a vet visit for.)  With my reasons being stated i would like to back myself up with myths and the real reasons behind them.  Cats dont like water (Part false)         ~It depends entirely on the cat, some cats love the water, some cats are very scared of the water but will learn to like it over time, it just takes time and patience to get them used to  Cats groom themselves (False!)         ~Cats dont groom themselves, if you were to lick yourself all day without taking a shower would you be clean?? no, you would be covered in saliva. Which is what cats do, they cover themselves in their saliva so they mask any unwanted scents.  I would love to have a ^friendly^ discussion in the comments if anyone has anything to change my opinion, though i refuse to purposefully have an argument. I am open to questions and discussions but no attacks as this is my professional opinion backed up with facts that i have found, this is in no way an order to attack me in any way at all as that causes unwanted stress.  Edit; i got the notification of your comment though i am unable to see it, a friend copy and pasted your msg and sent it to me so i will reply here <3  “First off, I feel like you should have clarified exactly what you mean by "regular grooming". That is extremely vague.” •To clarify; By ‘regular grooming’ i mean being combed (not brushed, combing is less damaging) bathed and dried (with the occasional clipperwork)  “Long haired breeds may need it every day, especially in warmer months when they shed more.” •With that you are correct, though combing your cat too much will pull out all of their fuzzy coat and leave only guard hairs which is very damaging to them  “Cats absolutely do groom themselves.” •They do not, cats use their tounge in the ways you stated but that is not grooming themselves, that is simply doing what they must to take care of their fur best they can, they are still not clean and still covered in saliva when they are doing this, a recommended 6-8 week schedule of grooms will prevent matting and make sure they are actually clean  “Cats don't like water, that is a truth. Teaching a cat from a young age may change this, and each individual cat is different.” •Cats dont like water is, as i stated, *depending on the cat.* each cat comes with their unique personality which includes different takings to water, many cats like the water, lots are afraid of it, and very rarely we have cats that hate it  “Unless your cat is especially dirty or smells, a bath typically isn't necessary.” •Key word; typically. Cats still need baths, it dosnt matter how much they smell it gets rid of the gunk buildup and helps their skin  “A dirty cat is often a sign of an unhealthy home” •While this is true, a dirty cat is also a sign of them not being *washed* because their coat holds all their grease, it builds up over time leaving dander and grease build up that can cause infections  “You imply a human tongue is comparable to a cats. You're a cat groomer, surely you understand different species have different capabilities.” •A human and a cat are different, either way they both end up covered in saliva and if they were to lick something that something they licked would still have saliva until it was cleaned off  “You specifically talk about thin skin with pelted cats.” •nono all cats have thin skin, thats just how cat skin is, it isnt as thick as human skin therefore it’s quite easy to cut. it just depends on how fat or skinny the cat is to tell how loose and easier to cut the skin is. Fat cats have stretched skin therefore theres less of a chance of cutting them because itd already stretched  “The only people I have ever heard claim that cats grooming themselves is a myth, are cat groomers.” •Oddly enough more then just groomers say that.  “I also want to point out that as a cat groomer, you are very often seeing the worst of the worst. The vast majority of cats don't go to a groomer regularly because they don't need to.” •While that is true, the only worst of the worst we see are new cats and those who arent on a regular schedule, because of seeing and feeling the difference between clean and dirty cat, owners are able to tell when their cat needs a bath and when they do not  i do see your points, yes, but cats still need to be groomed	There's clearly a period at the end of the sentence. "Ok" does not constitute a sentence, but wow, you're clever.	It’s almost like I’ve lost a pet to the same kind of irresponsible behavior you’re condoning and learned my lesson after doing research for my next pet, so that I wouldn’t have to go through that again. It’s almost as if I have an indoor-only cat now who, through enrichment and engagement, has absolutely no interest in going outside. It’s almost as if the suggested method of care by countless actual animal professionals supports **my** assertion, not some self-righteous idiot who thinks they know more about cats than veterinarians.	<p>It’s almost like I’ve lost a pet to the same kind of irresponsible behavior you’re condoning and learned my lesson after doing research for my next pet, so that I wouldn’t have to go through that again.

Seems like an absolutely unrelated topic. But in my personal (not so PC) opinion, getting fucked up is how we become stronger and evolve. If you live your life in a safe barrier, you&#39;ll never feel the need to adapt, to overcome obstacles and to evolve. This just creates a generation of weak people. Sorry not sorry..</p>	<p>And nobody is Pollyanna enough to not think there aren’t always going to be problems. I mean why do people even say that? It’s so dismissive, pompous, and lazy. But if you are brainwashed into apathy you are Pollyanna’s do nothing sibling trying to wear the sober and reasonable hat as a disguise for cynicism, who may as well just be a cheerleader for corporations and a terrible status quo b/c that “nothing can change”, and “it’s too complex mentality” tropes are some tired excuses I’ll tell ya.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ru12qc/cats_should_be_groomed_on_a_regular_basis/hqy80mk/

Yeah well 3 years ago you said “f*** your mom” so therefore your argument is invalid	I've been on this platform since 2008 after lurking for a few years due to seeing little need to make an account and comment. After posting something on this thread and seeing it hit the Front Page (FP), I had a bunch of oddballs sliding into my DMs trying to sleuth personal information from my post history.  This account has been used over the years to help build my professional network and make new connections in topics of interest. It is sad to see some basement dweller use that information to try to harass or manipulate emotions.  I can only imagine what women go through on a daily basis.

So it's blowing your nose, shitting, pissing, vomiting.   It's not a weird expectation that someone make an effort to leave common areas comfortable for all. That's some selfish trashy "sweet home Alabama" shit.  And if my partner can't be clean and decent they can fuck right off. I've never experienced this issue through all my partners, but this incel neckbeard hillbilly shit isn't normal and shouldn't be normalized.	[removed]	If you think acknowledging that your partner and yourself have a normal body functions, which includes passing gas, is lowering relationship expectations.  You have really weird relationship expectations, lol.  If you don’t have sex with your partner because they fart, that’s fucked up. Everyone farts lmao	""Sitting around wishing things would improve helps no one"" no one is doing that. You just want people to go around doing dumb shit that visibly seems like helping.

Cuz I can say oh well my uncle has ocd or my best friend and those certain are not valid reasons to claim you understand what they go through and what helps. From my personal experience I know drugs and therapy didn’t help *Me* however I also can function perfectly normal outside just not in my own home. Drugs actually made it worse for me cuz it gave me panic attacks and more frequently. I’ve even been homeless a few times over the last 4 years once caused because I almost burned my house down due to therapy not working and fear that my house was completely full of germs.  Regardless my personal experience only makes up for my own experience not everyone who suffers from ocd, some have more or less severe cases and from different points and possible reasons. Just cause one person has it a certain way dosnt mean everyone dose. It just means you don’t have an absolute answer. In other words it’s “unknown” the condition is very much real but the reason for it is not yet known.	My friends have children who are not spoiled and they are cool . So in  truth I hate the fucking useless parents of brats too.   In the UK these useless parents take their children to the pub with them  so you can't even escape the little cu**s there either.. it's so fucking annoying ..

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/unpopularopinion) if you have any questions or concerns.*	I see this complaint  especially for books that focus on learning something or improving something.  When looking for new books to read and go through goodreads or amazon reviews. A lot of people complain about repetitiveness, e.g. " The overview was interesting, and the book had a number of good tips. However, it was repetitive" And give the book 2/5 stars.  I think there is value on being repetitive, there is a ton of research that "repetition learning **significantly increases the memory performance for detailed and associative information".**  This is why I dislike these Apps that summarize a book in 5-10 minutes. You do not receive the same value from reading just the highlights vs. completely immersing yourself in a book, and understanding different points of view of the same concept and multiple examples.	text_not_found	<p>My GP’s call system automatically puts you in a queue and regularly updates you of your position in the queue.

Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing. My lived in 2 cents.

In my opinion I agree with OP that the issue would be a lot of laziness on mens side to put in work for their partners pleasure.</p>	My experience is a little different to OP because I have only been with 2 women.

The husband works his ass off while the wife stays home at takes care of the kids, the wife gets bored because the husband is tired from work/doesn&#39;t pay enough attention or maybe some guy on social media is giving her attention and she decides to cheat on her husband. The husband finds out and then the wife divorces HIM and says she wasn&#39;t getting enough attention and that&#39;s why she did it, not only does she get custody of the children, she gets child support and potentially alimony and possibly the house. It doesn&#39;t matter if its 1 in a million, the fact that it can happen and does happen is just a raw deal. There is no way to prevent any of that, if you mention prenups there have been instances of those being thrown out because she signed it &quot;under duress&#39;. </p>	When these women hit 28-35, they often want to find a ""good man"" to settle down with, because they blow all of their cash abd have no other way to make an income.  The vast majority of men won't date or marry a former pornographic model or prostitute. Those that will aren't usually the men that these women want to be with.

Like smoking or using protection	The science is common knowledge, and every doctor will confirm the science. I don’t know why we should compel cigarette, or vaping companies from advertising (and further force them to advertise against themselves).   People say that they advertise to children, but this only appears that way because we have infantilized adults (look at the Congo line of 20-something year olds outside theatres when marvel movies come out).  We have addiction centers, support groups, families who might care, and you have enough agency to stop at any time. Fatalism cannot be rolled and smoked, the responsibility is yours, not society’s.

One of my favorite ""smart"" jokes was in the pilot for Rick and Morty\*. A scene where Rick and Morty has to go through galatic customs is preceded by Rick saying he hates bureaucracy. Moments later, they are fleeing the people at galatic customs, Rick throws Morty a gun, and tells him it's okay to shoot the guards because ""they're just robots"". After Morty shoots one in the leg and he begins screaming and bleeding out, Morty says, ""they're not robots, Rick"". To which Rick responds, ""it's a figure of speech Morty! They're bureaucrats!

But her on the other hand, she was asked more than once to shop and even said ""I'm gonna stab the fuck out of you, bitch"" as her last words.	That said, it does have a lot going for it. I found the themes quite interesting. I thought the scene were Rachel discovers she's a replicant and her life has been a lie, and plays the piano whilst contemplating the significance, or lack thereof, of her life and her memories, with that amazing soundtrack was well done. I also like the famous tears in rain monologue. It sounds poetic, but Roy's arc is too. He's a combat replicant, built to kill and has done for his whole life, yet for his last act he saves Deckard. Maybe all this pales in comparison to the book but I haven't read it. There's definitely more to it than a lot of other sci-fi ""classics"". I prefer it to a few of the other supposed classics I've seen, for example Aliens, which I really didn't think was that great(I do really like Alien though).	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7hoaq/calling_people_oversensitive_snowflakes_and/hta2vhs/

It has to be r/GRNCbyVegannation for me. they are helping the world one step at a time by making it easy for the consumers to easily find vegan-friendly products near them. You can download their app! #business #vegan	I like to argue on the internet a lot, but after a lot of 'debates', I've arrived at the conclusion that most of the time it's pointless to try to convince people why you're right, as basically no matter what, people naturally have conflicting interests and there is no common good. I believe that human society is too complicated for the human brain to design a perfect system or even to achieve one through democratic or any other collaborative process. A lot of the time people seem to think that they have the moral high ground because of what they think is right and that their enemy is evil for some reason. Essentially, my opinion is that it's perfectly fine to be mean and care about your personal interests or even to want your ideology to succeed and rule, but it's wrong to ever think that you are somehow better than anyone else with your 'righteousness' or that those who disagree with you are selfish assholes or whatever. A good example of this might be religious conservative zealots. On the contrary, people, often progressives, who despise the religious for supposedly the same reasons I give, are also ultimately purely subjective and often worship their ideology or the idea of being 'nice and open minded' just as much as one would worship a God.  I'm not even sure if this is an unpopular opinion, since I might just spend too much time around a bit more radical ideas and spaces, but then again reddit often seems to cause that.	text_not_found	We have an ethical obligation to support businesses like Amazon because they make their customers happy."

Or were you just salivating like a dog,  waiting for a response ? 🤣	earlier this month, we put down our dog of eight years. he was in declining health and it would have been selfish to keep him around. he went peacefully and, although he wasn\`t in pain anymore, me and my parents were still absolutely devastated.   an hour after my parents got back from the clinic, i went downstairs and asked my mom where my dad was. she told me that he had gone to work. i was absolutely stunned. what stunned me even more was that my mother was at her laptop, typing away and working. our dog had only been dead for one hour at this point and my parents still had to go to work(granted, they seemed fine but i know that they were absolutely devastated).  i personally believe that pets are a part of the family. i know not everyone shares that opinion but most pet owners do see their pets as part of the family. as such, the death of a pet should be treated with the same respect as when one of the employees loses a loved one. and that includes allowing employees at least one day off to grieve the loss of their pet.

Maybe I reincarnated from a dog. I identify as a dog.&quot; They spread that idea- it combines with trans and non-binary folk talking about pronouns - and they go &quot;I want pronouns too. Call me by dog/dog/dogself.&quot;</p>	<p>An easy test of this is, would you die for your dog? No, okay, well other people definitely would for their dog. That is the value of that dog to someone somewhere, a human life.</p>	Observes feral dogs for a while, we see a much different picture of that hypothetical dog (animal) that gives “unconditional love.”It is a very telling fantasy though!"	<p>Observes feral dogs for a while, we see a much different picture of that hypothetical dog (animal) that gives “unconditional love.”It is a very telling fantasy though!</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rstq2b/people_should_be_allowed_to_take_off_work_after/hta7nwc/

Majority of Germany once thought it was right to kill a bunch of Jews and gays and other people they considered degenerates. Mob Rule doesn’t make things right for obvious reasons and my excuse isn’t hate trans people need actual help not people feeding into their delusions. You wouldn’t push a schizophrenic person deeper into believing what was going on in their head was right why the hell would you do it for people with Gender dysphoria.

"Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"

Affirmation hasn’t proved the sort considering that those that do transition have shown to regret the choice and commit suicide at higher rate then any other group of people on this planet. If the best treatment is to push them to suicide congrats your doing it.	[removed]	The difference between pushing a schizophrenic deeper and affirming trans people has to do with the best practice and outcomes for each group of patients. Pushing a schizophrenic deeper into delusions results in poor life results for the patient, and is thus not best practice. as the outcome leads to a worsening in the patients health. However gender affirming care is considered best practice in modern day as its outcomes have been shown to reduce rates of self harm and suicide in trans individuals. In other words affirming care has been shown to keep trans people alive and healthy. you're trying to equate two wildly different conditions, it's just not how it works.	Except it doesn't.

[removed]	I want to talk about the pedophile analogy, because it creates a harmful narrative due to a key destination: it’s affect on others.   Pedophilia pretty obviously harms other people directly. I don’t think I need to go into specifics because it should be obvious and it’s clear you used that analogy because pedophilia is practically universally agreed to be a bad thing.  Now let me ask you this: who am I hurting by being trans?   So to normalize something that very clearly has a negative effect on people (often people who don’t consent or don’t understand what they’re consenting to) is very different from someone transitioning, which affects exclusively themselves other than others around them needed to change a few words when referring to them.  So tell me, what about someone transitioning affects others so much that normalizing it would be bad?

I love how you bring up slavery as if it’s only limited to just the two places and not a thing that has been around in every human culture. Countries that reform for the better are great but regressing into degeneracy isn’t get the idea? Ik you twisted fucks are into that but damn.	[removed]	The method was abandoned and wrong to start with, but it was better than what every other country was doing at the time to gay people, and the fact that they had passes for trans people, again they shouldn't have been needed but better than at the time anywhere else, still means that it was important.  I'm guessing your british or American, does the fact that these countries are linked to slavery mean you no longer want to live there, considering your need for histories to be squeaky clean, or do you only consider minorities should need to pass that test?	One thing that I do find weird however is that, even when we are rooting for Americans, they get oddly defensive about it. Of course i'd rather see them get better healthcare, better workers rights, better social security, etc... Im not here to laught at you because im better off, im here because i wish you all had it as good as us. But when we start talking about this stuff a large majority like to pretend that no healthcare is better for x, y, z reasons, that capitalism pushed to it's limit is the best thing in the world, that workers rights are for dirty commies and whatnot. Honestly it just makes me sad. I want to see them thrive, not read horror stories upon horror stories about things that could be easily prevented"	Focus on building the world you want and not tearing down the one you see. I truly think that's the path of least resistance and what is most likely to allow us to strip away racism in this country. Change is rarely a revolution that burns the old to the ground and when it is it is extremely painful for all involved and what rises is not always better.	De las casas himself btw introduced african slavery to the new world, so not exactly reliable when it comes to what is fair treatment of people. It's all just people trying to make others look bad and themselves look good. And even with that he hardly even had bad things to say about Columbus."	the reality is groups of people act pretty predictably given a set of material conditions. It's not really exclusive to black people, it's everybody. Hence why progressives care about fixing the material conditions that influences the behavior. It just goes back to conservatives be against like welfare or government improvement in social service and will post hoc justify it by saying you're the real racist for advocating for those positions"	<p>It&#39;s an insult to everybody who was (or still is) a slave to call someone who has a job a slave. You remind me of the fascists who talk about &quot;white genocide&quot;. There are also other options to get by if you don&#39;t mind having a small income and live in the conditions described by OP than don&#39;t involve having a job at all.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htasfaz/

I can also link you to a page that defines racism to mean that POC cant be racist because the definition of racism is prejudice + power.   Here's one from an actual dictionary: Gender: "either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones."  Much easier to see that its linked to sex here.	[removed]	https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/48642.html  Sex is usually categorized as female or male but there is variation in the biological attributes that comprise sex and how those attributes are expressed.  Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions and identities of girls, women, boys, men, and gender diverse people  https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232363  Sex” refers to the physical differences between people who are male, female, or intersex. A person typically has their sex assigned at birth based on physiological characteristics, including their genitalia and chromosome composition. This assigned sex is called a person’s “natal sex.”  Gender, on the other hand, involves how a person identifies. Unlike natal sex, gender is not made up of binary forms. Instead, gender is a broad spectrum. A person may identify at any point within this spectrum or outside of it entirely  https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/sex-gender-identity  What are the differences between sex, gender, and gender identity? It’s common for people to confuse sex, gender, and gender identity.  But they’re actually all different things.  Sex is a label — male or female — that you’re assigned by a doctor at birth based on the genitals you’re born with and the chromosomes you have. It goes on your birth certificate.  Gender is much more complex: It’s a social and legal status, and set of expectations from society, about behaviors, characteristics, and thoughts. Each culture has standards about the way that people should behave based on their gender. This is also generally male or female. But instead of being about body parts, it’s more about how you’re expected to act, because of your sex.  All three of these are simply just typing "gender and sex" that's it and there's many, many more articles saying the same thing	People just changed the meaning of gender and argue over it. It’s semantics. If gender means what sex chromosomes you have they’re are 2 (XX, XY) and if it’s and identity thing then it can be infinite or a spectrum, but the argument is just what the word gender means. People need to stop arguing over words it’s dumb as shit. Just get down to what the argument is—1 side says that all there is is XX (woman) people and XY (men) people. The other side says they’re are more genders then that but I don’t see why that side can’t admit that 99% or whatever gender you identify with or are even, still fall into either the XX or XY category.  So it doesn’t even matter, because someone calling you a girl (if you have XX sex chromosomes) is completely logical even if you identify as something else. Words have meanings and boy and girl just mean XY and XX.	<p>People just changed the meaning of gender and argue over it. It’s semantics.

Next I find the wording rather funny. Saying sex is assigned is somewhat dishonest as it implies it is not an objective, physical trait of a person but rather given to a person somewhat like a name is. Sex is observed, not assigned. They claim gender is along the lines of how a person self identifies as it relates to their sex. Perhaps a clumsy definition/ rewording on my part but close enough I think. Correct me if you think I’m wrong here. If this is the definition you want to use than sure I can agree there is a spectrum as different people make themselves into unique people and have different ideas on what makes a good man or woman. Regardless however each person is either a man or woman. Regardless of how you define your personality it does not change your biology. Speaking of changing biology they also mention trans people. These individuals are aware of the fact they are a man or woman but do not appreciate it and choose to make themselves more like and call themselves the other. This does not change the fact that they are a man or woman even if the individual chooses to undergo hormone supplements, surgery, changing their name, or anything else. Their outward look may change but it does not change what they are. No more than I can make myself a different race. My genes always remain the same. Also thanks for taking the time to reply. It is appreciated.</p>	This isn’t a study. More an explanation of a point of view. Nothing wrong with that but isn’t a study. Next I find the wording rather funny.

If we called either of those sexist, I'd be questioning that as well, simply because the fact that both exist contradicts the idea that there's any sexist, unequal treatment of one gender compared to another. Yes, Manic Pixie Dream Girl is applied to women, but there are male equivalents to it and all of them are pretty much just more specific sub-categories of ""the Mentor."""	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htat6jm/

I am very passionate when it comes to the homosexuals and bisexuals (seeing as I am bi)just not when people start feeding the delusions of people who think their something they are not. I’d say the more modern trans community shares more with nazis considering that they seem to scream how much rape should be done on someone if they don’t agree with their views or vandalize rape shelters for not letting in men.	[removed]	Im not trying to move the discussion, although i'm guessing your train of thought ran out of track on the main one, considering you've only responded to half, i was asking why your standards for queer history is so high when your standards for cishet history seems to be easily passable.   I think its safe to say that a person who refers to trans people being allowed to live in peace as degeneracy shares plenty with the nazis.	I’m not trying to partake in another round of the Gender Oppression Olympics. We can acknowledge that women face the brunt of gendered violence globally while giving the space for guys to talk their shit out too. When people started bringing up #UsToo during the Alexander Wang scandal, it felt like an afterthought (oh lol, men and trans men also get abused too, here’s your cute little hashtag, don’t take up more space than you should though!) and it’s a disservice to the whole point of the MeToo movement which is giving victims the space to share their stories. So why are we splitting survivors up by gender? I thought a movement was supposed to unite people, not divide us.	<p>It&#39;s actually homophobic af to reduce people to their sexuality.

When people started bringing up #UsToo during the Alexander Wang scandal, it felt like an afterthought (oh lol, men and trans men also get abused too, here’s your cute little hashtag, don’t take up more space than you should though!) and it’s a disservice to the whole point of the MeToo movement which is giving victims the space to share their stories. So why are we splitting survivors up by gender? I thought a movement was supposed to unite people, not divide us.</p>	<p>Perhaps you should reevaluate the way you approach sex content and porn. And specifically the way you approach female sex workers. There&#39;s nothing wrong with profiting off of an industry that continues to exist due to perpetual demand. Every other kind of industry does it. We only think it is wrong because of heavily ingrained cultural, and religious, ideas in our society&#39;s collective moral code. If you choose to personally follow that code, fine, but it&#39;s unfair to encroach on other people&#39;s agency or shame others with that attitude.</p>	<p>And before some triggered wokier than ever person comes in &quot;oh but objectification and rape and bla&quot; we all objectify people we don&#39;t know and find sexual appeal in and you do it too. Men get portrayed as muscular super sexies and women as curvy supersexies and both is unrealistic, cut it.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htatjib/

Thinking too much cheese is not good is not an unpopular opinion. "Too much" inherently means it has too much.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/unpopularopinion) if you have any questions or concerns.*	Clotted cream, traditionally on scones with jam gets a sort of crust on top, is too thick and has the word 'clotted' in it which sounds like you are just going to accept that it's going to give you a stroke after eating it.

However, I don’t think the claim that English food is bland is necessarily a matter of people dismissing other cultures or assuming their’s is the “normal” one.

Pedophilia harms no one, child rape does.	[removed]	I want to talk about the pedophile analogy, because it creates a harmful narrative due to a key destination: it’s affect on others.   Pedophilia pretty obviously harms other people directly. I don’t think I need to go into specifics because it should be obvious and it’s clear you used that analogy because pedophilia is practically universally agreed to be a bad thing.  Now let me ask you this: who am I hurting by being trans?   So to normalize something that very clearly has a negative effect on people (often people who don’t consent or don’t understand what they’re consenting to) is very different from someone transitioning, which affects exclusively themselves other than others around them needed to change a few words when referring to them.  So tell me, what about someone transitioning affects others so much that normalizing it would be bad?	<p>Let’s be honest. “Cancelling” and accusations do next to nothing even when they’re real (and false ones are extremely rare—you’re more likely to be rightfully accused and think it was false than to be falsely accused).

And most false accusations aren’t actually false—the majority of rapists and assaulters, even those convicted, genuinely believe the situation was consensual, and it’s extremely rare to have evidence to prove otherwise.</p>	<p>Not all sexual assault ia rape but all rape is sexual assault</p>	Let’s be honest. “Cancelling” and accusations do next to nothing even when they’re real (and false ones are extremely rare—you’re more likely to be rightfully accused and think it was false than to be falsely accused).

A lot of fetishes and kinks are fairly normal. Unless it&#39;s concerning there&#39;s no problem with it.</p>	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htawt2o/

Really your really ignoring all the shit posted about her but you’ll go along with all that how very convenient of you. Men don’t being in the women’s restroom and just to clarify cis women don’t feel comfortable with trans women in the restroom in general.	[removed]	No one wants her raped, i sympathise with her issues but taking out your feelings on innocent people is selfish, its pain for pain.  Also she's a massive homophobe and a raging neoliberal, along with being a terf, she's done some good but equal amounts harm at best.	Someone saying they don't like how Disney wrote Rey, for example, doesn't make them a misogynist, yet I've seen people snap back with 'you just don't like strong female characters'. Like, c'mon, it's got nothing to do with their gender and everything to do with lazy writing. If anything the people calling foul are even more guilty of it by primarily defining the character by their gender."	<p>I think it&#39;s totally fair for you to not want to read the books, but if you label anyone who is critical as a transphobe, then you will turn more people against you and well who does that help? I have nothing against trans people, I hope trans people face less discrimination and are more accepted by society - but I am still critical of the idea that anyone can invade safe spaces for women if they make the claim that they&#39;re also women - and according to you that makes me transphobic. I don&#39;t feel transphobic, but if the bar of phobia is some critique in some instances, then maybe I am. And if I am, then why should I support the cause?</p>	If you think trans women are just men in dresses, you're problematic. Genuinely just Google it if you wanna know more, however if you're transphobic you won't care what she did. This thread is full of transphobia."

Then your ""opinion"" is really fucking dumb.  Apparently me advocating equality means I hate women, but you advocating superiority doesn't mean you hate men.  I'm starting to wonder if you're an incel trolling/LARPing as a woman because otherwise this is just sad."	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htaxjog/

Probably though the good thing is modern psychology already throws out most of that only thing that remains is the trans crap.	[removed]	Wasn't some of the early psycologists really fucked up? So should we throw out all of psycology now?	Battlefield is pretty much the same story except it bothers me that they have repeatedly removed fantastic features and then when they go to readd them they are terrible version of it (Commander in BF4 is nothing like on BF2) of course MP use to be the only focus of Battlefield (and mod support)	<p>By your logic, all anyone can be is agnostic, as there&#39;s no &quot;proof&quot; for either-or. Except when there is, plenty of documented miracles, but let&#39;s disregard those unpopular examples for now. The point is, &quot;religious&quot; is a word that describes a belief, not a &quot;knowledge&quot;. It should be the same with &quot;atheist&quot;, but they barely ever talk about what they believe in, from my experience. They mostly define themselves via their negation of others&#39; beliefs. I&#39;m sure there are others, but since nowadays it&#39;s unpopular to think about big questions like this for oneself and instead adopt one of the simple labels, we have &quot;atheists&quot; who don&#39;t know what they believe in and &quot;religious&quot; people who openly claim not to believe in what their religion entails.</p>	<p>Battlefield is pretty much the same story except it bothers me that they have repeatedly removed fantastic features and then when they go to readd them they are terrible version of it (Commander in BF4 is nothing like on BF2) of course MP use to be the only focus of Battlefield (and mod support)</p>	By your logic, all anyone can be is agnostic, as there's no ""proof"" for either-or.
