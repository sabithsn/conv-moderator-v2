7j04w333	Society as a whole has a male to female gaslight going on. We’re taught that marriage and service to a man- cleaning his house, having his child, putting our career on the back burners is what we MUST do in life. What we should be happy to do, what benefits us- basically playing a secondary service role to men.  I was thinking how this larger misogynistic gaslight that occurs in the world at large is also mimicked in offices- most specifically law offices. The whole thing is one giant gaslight from a largely male class (attorneys) to a largely female, service underclass (secretaries).  You barely make any money as one and will pretty much never achieve financial freedom unless you- have other sources of money, a rich family, side hustle etc. They encourage us to support them so they can make 6 and 7 figures while barely being able to retire ourselves.  The way it’s framed is kind of insidious and manipulative like this is what you *have* to do and you should be so happy doing it. Yet they’d raise bloody hell if they ever had to do it themselves. It would never be good enough for their wives or daughters….You *never* NEVER see their kids getting into that line of work. They think they’re above it though they’d pretend it’s what you need to do so that they can continue to benefit from it.  I had a boss who tried to make it seem like such an exalted position to be his maidservant. Then came the time his own daughter was graduating. I was sitting at my desk just outside his office serving him of course. I heard him loudly on the phone talking to his friends. “Well I can’t have her answering someone’s phones for them.” He said laughing loudly and boisterously. Ironically, that’s *precisely* what I had been doing there for many many many years, answering his phones. And of course up to that point he’d always been acting like that was a noble and deeply respectable thing for one to do. Oh, what a help to him I am. He so appreciated my support. Never for his daughter, though!  It’s a professional gaslight. It reminds me of how men will disrespect and degrade their girlfriends refuse to marry them forever etc but then tell their own daughters to never live with a man etc.  Anyway, it’s a lie and a gaslight- professional one that takes advantage of womens caring nature to serve men. It’s another instance of us being used for free labor- this time it’s given a token, low pay though. They know the service to them is not worthwhile, not worth the time in our lives. They would never think of it as good enough to do themselves or for anyone they genuinely loved and respected to do- like their own daughter, they’d actively steer away from that as beneath them/ not for them.  When I hear how it’s talked about behind closed doors it’s like it’s not really respected or valued at all, just given lip service to make the women doing it believe it is so that they stay in these pink ghetto jobs against their own best interests financially and professionally. It’s laughed at kinda derisively but they’re careful not to show how they really feel about it openly so that the women don’t start to look down on the positions and abandon them themselves. They’re careful not to shoot themselves in the foot- free service and work and support wise. By letting the women secretaries serving them know their true feelings about that kind of work. They try and afford it false dignity and positive reinforcement that’s a lie to how they really see it, enough to keep you in there doing it and make you think it’s something to be proud of and aspire to do your best at. It’s like men who have trad wives and who praise motherhood as so godly and exalted but whom you know would never change a diaper or wash a dish themselves because they see that as lame womens work and that reveals how little they *really* actually think of it. Regardless of the fact that they lie and praise it to the women themselves to trick them into staying in it   I feel it’s a game and a large scale gaslight played on women to use and milk them for support while not really giving them much in return. And when they “get out of line” I see this really condescending, paternalistic kind of reinforcement is often used to kind of good girl shame them back into line and back into “doing what they should”.  I’m against taking pink ghetto jobs like secretary or receptionist long term. Level up beyond them. It doesn’t serve you and the men whom it does serve KNOW that. But in a sneaky way hope you don’t, so they can continue to benefit off your almost free labor to make themselves rich  They pretend to respect it to maintain the paradigm that enriches them and keep the women secretary who hold them up feeling good enough and special enough to do what they do all while smiling over their heads laughingly as what a losing game it is.  I’m not saying this to be unkind. I’m saying this as someone who had worked these kinds of jobs and seen behind the scene, heard how it’s *really* view by the men in charge and the men promoting women that do so. In general in life, it almost never pays for you to serve a man- not at home and not professionally in the workplace either  You’re almost always sacrificing more and getting *less* out of it than they would *ever* take for or accept themselves. In other words, being used or played for a bit of a fool/ taken advantage of. I don’t recommend it unless you can find some means to use them right back in a way that benefits you.  There’s a reason they would never hold this kind of job themselves or allow their daughters to. In a major law firm how many high rolling partners do I know that could easily use their influence in the company to get their daughter in as a receptionist or secretary? How many do i see doing it? None. Because they don’t want them in those positions. They think they’re above it and they don’t want their own precious daughters wasting time on it. In a firm with like 150 male attorneys you don’t see even one of their daughters coming in as a secretary or something of that nature? They recognize that as beneath them and send them to level up getting law degrees or masters degrees or something, anything else. I almost get the impression it would be an embarrassment to them among their other male colleagues of their own daughter or wife were there serving like that. But they’ll promote it as good, even necessary and a MUST to another lesser man’s daughter….  This may seem like a stretch but is born from many years first hand lived experience. Hopefully you all understand what I’m saying  Aim higher  Interestingly enough a lot of this paradigm is supported by professional female pick-mes of sort, women in HR and office manager positions who pretend to be for the people, the all-female secretarial underclass but privately support the interests of the almost all male attorneys by trying to play tricky to keep you lower paid (acting like they can’t pay you for promotions, asking what you made at your past job to lock you in at a low pay rate in a way that benefits the male attorneys and business but screws you) , working against your interests in disputes or instances of mismanagement in a way that gives the male attorneys the legal advantage even if you have been rightly wronged and should have recourse.  The whole thing is held up by female pick mes in middle management roles who play to the interests of the male overlords and not their fellow females.  They too are playing a game, while smiling in your face knowing it doesn’t benefit you. They count on you either not having enough knowledge to see or enough options to opt out. They play games with your pay, with your ability to advance etc etc	1642781110.0	s9e3ck	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9e3ck/male_to_female_gaslights_in_the_office/	Male to Female Gaslights in the Office

7vx4rtt7	Something feels off about the guy my mom has been aggressively pushing my way as a potential husband. He’s an electrical engineer, has helped me understand my current job in software engineering better, has sent holiday gifts and attempts to offer to fly me out to visit him.  But there are little things that I’m not sure is my anxiety or serious foreshadowing: 1. He tells my mom everything I tell him. I told him I’m not interested in pursuing a long distance relationship. Cue my mom telling me to reconsider how far I’m willing to go for a good man. 2. He doesn’t respect my boundaries - in following that I told him I’m not interested like that he calls his boss while we’re talking and introduces me as his girlfriend. I told him I’m not interested in gifts and he asks my mom to send it anyway. 3. I think he wants us citizenship badly. The way the system works here, the easiest method to becoming a legal immigrant is to marry or come thru family.    What are your thoughts?	1642941627.0	sastim	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sastim/advice_on_not_being_attracted_to_hvm_mom/	Advice on not being attracted to HVM mom introduced?
7j04w333	So I seem to encounter this a lot among older women or among women who are baby crazy, chomping at the bit to have kids themselves.  And it’s that you like for kids or desire to have kids is viewed as a gauge as for whether you’re actually a good person or not. It’s so stupid and annoying to me.   I sit next to a microaggressive rude, gossiping bully of an older woman in the office who’s been gossiping about me as a bitch since I got there for “being too quiet” and not catering to her conversationally enough. I notice she’s been on a campaign to march round from desk to desk turning people against me and disparaging me as a bitch and mean and nasty with no real proof. She’s been greeted everyday and treated respectfully, just not given a whole lot of OTT cheery convo. Anyway I reported her to HR who had to have a little talk with her and now efforts are being made to mend the relationships  She’s obsessed with kids and will not stop talking about how angry she is her daughter in law who suffers from anxiety and had to go through several rounds of IVF to had a child will not give her the child yo watch or keep. The first thing she asked me when we met was- WELL DO YOU HAVE KIDS??? Becoming angry and microaggressive, because she viewed it as a rejection when I said “no can’t say I do”.  Anyway she keeps keeps keeps forcing convo on me about my neices whom she’s never even met before but heard through others that I have. To her the kids MUST be used as the conversational bridge between us. I actually spend a tremendous amount of time with them as my family is very close knit and they come over several times a week. Even so, I’m not a woman who considers myself kids crazy or defined by kids.  What annoyed me about the convo (which was already a stretch because I know she’s been disparaging me) was that she kept asking do I watch them and do I like it? I could tell the assumption was being made that a tight assed bitch like myself would never like being around kids and as she’s obsessed with them it was being used as confirmation of and validation of why she’s correct to dislike me.  Like anyone who doesn’t enjoy hanging with kids is an automatic bitch and ugly, not-NiCe person.  I started thinking about a past exchange with a coworker in her 40s who obviously had psychological issues. She was hoping to adopt a child from like the Phillipines and would go it everyday and buy literally 8-10 sets of complete childrens clothes. Bathing suits + flip flops + headbands + sunglasses in all different sizes ranging from like 6 months- 8 years of age for the kid to “grow into”. It got so bad she filled an entire room in her house and started having yo hide the purchases from her husband by leaving them in the car or hiding them in the dryer to bring in later.  She’d had a poor childhood abandoned by a mentally ill mother who tried to kill herself and having to fend for her and her sister alone at like 8 for days in the house alone with not much to eat, depending on neighbors etc.  It seemed clear to me she had some unresolved psychological issues around her own childhood and that’s why she was so obsessed with having a baby and giving them the perfect childhood. It was to be a do over of sorts.  Anyway, she was asking me if I wanted kids one day and when am i gonna have babies. I was all of like 22. I said I wasn’t sure ai wanted them. She stormed off with her newly purchased baby clothes- SELFISH!!!!    Lmao.  It just made me think of how society loves to judge women who don’t want or particularly care for children (not that you even hate them may’ve you’re just meh) as hard hearted bitches who deserve to be kind of kicked around and microaggressed for being so mean and heartless.  Kind of like the Meredith trope in the 90s Parent Trap. Funny how pop culture has come full circle and now has people wondering why she was cast as the villain at all. Beautiful, successful with her own business, who would like a bunch of bratty kids playing mean tricks on you like sending a beat into your tent just because you’re dating their dad?	1642955643.0	saxia4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/saxia4/do_you_like_kids_being_used_to_judge_if_you_are_a/	“Do You Like Kids?”, Being Used to Judge if You Are a Bitch or a Nice Person

16ta3l	That is just not the case.  30/f.  In 2020 I decided to bite the bullet and lose 35 pounds. I didn't feel like myself and I wanted to feel better. I lost the 35 pounds and felt on top of the world.  I moved out on my own, I was paying my bills and taking care of myself. I felt really good about that. So good that I started dating again, but to my avail, I was going on countless unsuccessful dates.  This went on for 2 years.   I've done a lot of work on my inner self before the weight loss, after a turbulent life, but was still dealing with a deeply rooted self esteem issue and attachment issues. This showed up in all my unsuccessful situationships.  I didn't know why I was still fundamentally unhappy and unsuccessful.  It only hit me yesterday. Yes, my life improved, yes, I improved myself in many areas of life, but my fundamental issue of low self esteem and attachment issues was still at the fore front. I was putting my energy into something I am not ready to do just yet.  I deleted my dating profiles and I am vowing to take at least a year off dating to continue to level up my life and mental health.   I am grateful for the insight.

53ev4hvv	I stumbled upon a subreddit that is dedicated to a feeding kink and I am utterly disgusted. Some of the most popular posts are men bragging about "ruining" their girlfriend's body by encouraging them to eat EXCESSIVELY (6000 calories in a sitting, pouring a "cake milkshake" down a funnel to force-feed them).   Now, being attracted to larger women is one thing. But finding a slim, fit, happy girl and convincing her to gain 200+ pounds in less than a year????? They do all of this so they can own their "piggies"- bragging about how they can no longer do basic self-care tasks and pushing them to gain weight to the point of IMMOBILITY.   This is sick, depraved, subhuman behavior. Then they brag and laugh about how they are "ruined forever" and can never lose the weight or leave. I'm at a total fucking loss for words right now.	1642967678.0	sb28ey	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sb28ey/another_kink_shaming_post/	Another ~KiNk sHaMiNg~ Post
a5rzv6jn	A while back, I messaged a woman who posted in a dating subreddit about how her boyfriend's choice of porn - women with a specific body type unlike hers - made her feel insecure. She talked to him about it, he tried to assure her he loved her body, and of course continued watching this porn. She mentioned wanting to "end the relationship and let him go find his person". Men in the comments tried to gaslight her that "it's just a fantasy" and women in the comments sympathized with her but gave her no actionable advice.  So I messaged her, shared this post with her: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/psjkn1/why\_you\_shouldnt\_stay\_in\_a\_relationship\_with\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/psjkn1/why_you_shouldnt_stay_in_a_relationship_with_a/) that touches on men who watch porn of their physical type, and I recommended she break up with him. She replied that "he isn't porn obsessed". Uh not the point... I replied that he doesn't have to be obsessed, as long as he is putting porn above her happiness, that's reason enough.  She replied that she is sorry that "\[my\] experiences have traumatized \[me\] to think that way" and that "not everyone has the same issue with it." ...When she just made a post about how she has a major issue with it. I saw that she was in denial, wished her the best, and left it. No point in further engaging with someone who wanted to stay stuck in her unhappy relationship, and who chose to assume what I've been through to throw that "trauma" in my face. (To clarify, my ex watched porn occasionally with women who looked a lot like me - I later figured out through FDS that I was not okay with that either. No trauma, it was a learning experience. Not that this woman knew any of that).  Anyway, this woman is now posting on FDS. Maybe she's dumped the BF who wants women who look nothing like her, maybe she hasn't. Maybe she's coming to see the light. Qualified victory?  I still wish her the best and hope she's learned how to gracefully take the advice she asks for.	1642974874.0	sb50u9	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sb50u9/fds_rescue_mission_potential_success_story/	FDS Rescue Mission Potential Success Story?

172w3bkm	Hello ladies,   A man tells you you are way better than him, that you are more successful/smarter than he...  He might place you on a pedestal, but once you address and attempt to resolve conflicts, he might go belligerent, ballistic, or silent treatment. Then cue an orchestra of abuse, whether mental or emotional.  &#x200B;  What gives? Is it that he feels like he can’t measure up? That the better woman in question reminds him of his insecurities and flaws?  And if such a man dumps this queen, is the girl he marries at “his” level?   &#x200B;  You’d think that a LVM would work on himself, better himself to be worthy of a HVW, so that he won’t feel inferior.

4z5y91wa	The last time we talked was about 6 months ago, but I'm still sad about it.   I had a friend I met right after high school, when I decided to sign up for cosmetology. We met on the second day and immediately became really close. She had a boyfriend then, but he didn't play any part in our relationship outside of him being a pos and me telling her to leave him.   After beauty school, I decided to get married and leave the state (and mostly my toxic fam.) we said goodbye and kept in touch through our socials.  She told me she left the other guy and she was really social with me. We would talk everyday, but when she got a new man, she wasn't as present. Well, apparently he was great for her and they got ENGAGED. It had been 1 year and some months since I saw her last, and I visited her when I came home for the holidays. We had the best time. I loved her new fiance and we had one of the best nights I had in a long time. We all got along so effortlessly well and stayed together until 3am! When I went back home, my friend and I talked a lot more again.  Fast forward maybe 4-5 months later and I'm done with my ex. I could never forgive him for cheating a year earlier, And i just didnt love him anymore. The breakup was hard. I lost everything. My apartment, dog, fishtank, bed, clothes, and had to move back into my toxic home. But I was excited to go home and see my besties:)  For a few months we hung out as a trio, we would go to the movies together, we'd play videogames together, and just hang out. My friend and I hung out on our own often, as well. We were 20&21, and he is 28. She would tell me how eager and kind of pushy he was to marry her. She wanted to wait because of the pandemic, because she's boujee and wants to have a big wedding, and he's insisting they get eloped and have the wedding later. I IMMEDIATELY told her "no" because thats exactly what I did and we never had another wedding, and when I asked him about it, he rolled his eyes and said it was "pointless." !!!! Plus SHE was already making the payments on her own engagement ring while he wasn't making a lot of money, and trusting that he'll pay her back. 🥴She was also worried about all his debt.  Well anyway, he randomly stopped hanging out with us in the living room when I would come over, and just stay in their room. I really thought nothing of it. Then, he never wanted to come with us anywhere. I asked her about him potentially not liking me and she brushed it off, and said he saw me as his friend too. I was saddened by this tbh because we were all close at this point, I cared for him as my own friend. I just figured he didnt like that we didnt always agree on politics lol.   Anyway, my 21st bday comes up and I'm so excited. I have every intention of getting wasted and laughing until I cry. I  was 4 months single and needed to have a fun night. Well, everyone I invited showed up, but for some reason or another nobody wanted to drink with me, except for my one friend. Really sucked, but okay. At least I had her to vibe with! We were having fun and taking pictures in the bathroom, and when we came out, the waiter was there to ask if we wanted refills. My friend and I got our SECOND drinks of the night, and I overhear him tell her, "This is your last one, yeah?" I just ignore it because my friend isn't the type to let some man tell her what to do, plus we're having fun and its my 21st!!   After our second drinks, the waiter comes around again. My friend passes. She gets a water. I just got a soda or something because I didn't want to drink alone, and he was my ride home so I didn't want to be drunk if they were going to start fighting. We left really soon after that and another friend of mine there offered to take me to our park to hotbox his car and listen to music, he invites everyone, but just me and my one friend accept. (Seriously i miss her😕) Well I go in my guy friends car, and she goes with her bf. We get there and wait for their car to pull up, and we see him speed so fast into the parking lot, and brake into the parking spot with enough force to give you whiplash. My friend gets out and meets us, and her bf just stays in the car.  I ask her why he's in there and she says "he's pissed he had to bring me here. He's just being a b*tch idk." And she just sits and the 3 of us smoke together for maybe 15 minutes total while the entire time her phone is lighting up. He eventually calls her and I just say that she can leave if she has to, and she does.   We hung out 3 times after that, one time being we hadn't seen each other in 2 months because we were so busy with work, so we went to brunch. We had a few drinks and said "fuck it lets go to the bar." And we stopped by her house to invite him to go with us. They started fighting, and he came into the living room and told me "I dont care how you get home but you need to leave, now. I told [friend] that you aren't supposed to come over today and she disrespected that by bringing you here so you have to go." It was the most uncomfortable I've been in so long, and my friend quickly drove me home and apologized. We had a conversation about how he did not like me and I asked her why. Or if it was something else. She said she didnt know.   I texted her 3-4 different times and was left on read for each of them. I never asked why because I know its him and his weird jealousy, or maybe she told him the things I told her about him being too pushy or too insecure. Our friendship literally had 0 issues as far as I know.  It breaks my heart honestly 💔 I miss her all the time and I just hope maybe she'll come back when he's gone. I'm hurt that she ghosted me like that, but I still hope she's doing alright.	1643008553.0	sbg8er	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbg8er/i_lost_one_of_my_best_girl_friends_because_of_a/	I lost one of my best girl friends because of a scrote 😕

7j04w333	An unexpected side point of leveling up boundaries has been obvious resistance or anger from men (expected) but also anger from women who are not visible pick-mes and whom I know to be very boundaried themselves.  This is surprising to me and even more disappointing to me than push back from men, because male push back I expect.  An example would be:  I set boundaries with a male coworker who tried to be a little bit sleazy with me, trying to turn the convo to sex or making comments about his own sex life even when I expressed I didn’t want to hear it- in I think a way that was almost getting off on forcing me to listen. He also obviously wanted to date me as well. I stopped talking to him.  So I have a female acquaintance who is extremely boundaried and I’m sure would’ve shut any such behavior from a man down even faster, especially in a professional setting, even if it were far less offensive than what I experienced. She’s actually significantly more picky about her boundaries and her space than I am, to the point where it can be somewhat OTT and make assumptions about people’s motives that aren’t there. But I feel while she’s having next level boundaries on things that are areas of grey, an effort is  being made to deny me even very basic boundaries on things that are quite obviously inappropriate or unacceptable   Rather than seeking to see why this guy and I no longer talked and what he mayve done to merit it- I can tell it was talked around by her as me being a little difficult and nutty. Like I was acting strangely or switching things up with people in a way that was a little bit unstable and crazy but typical of me and also like it was me not knowing how to maintain basic relationships or have social skills- instead of what it actually was- me shutting something inappropriate down.  It’s strange that I seem to be experiencing versions of this from women who are extremely boundaried and picky themselves about what they allow in their space etc. but are suddenly kind of critical or mocking or assuming of it being a problem with me- when I take the *same* measures they would’ve immediately taken over far *less* offensive situations than the ones I was going through.  It’s like I’m being painted the villain by women who would’ve themselves set strong boundaries in the situations I was going through and yet I see it in several situations.  It’s a bit strange to me because I thought the most boundaried women in my life would also be most supportive of me developing stronger boundaries too.  I mean- what would she gain from trying to ridicule or tear down my boundaries with a man all while knowing damn well she never would’ve accepted the behavior either. In fact, knowing her she likely would’ve accepted even less of it than I did. Shut it down even quicker at the slightest sign.  It’s obvious to me what men gain by you not having boundaries (they benefit directly) and even what pick mes gain from it (it makes them feel better about their own choices and what they allow) but other boundaried women?? It’s kind of a mystery to me. Do you think it’s a form of sabotage to hold strong boundaries yourself but then be critical of someone elses basic boundaries like they shouldn’t have them OR just a lack of understanding. What troubles me and makes me doubt motive is that she didn’t *seek* to understand either, though she easily could’ve. She seemed almost happy to jump to assuming something wrong with me personally rather than seeing if *he’d* done something “funny” or inappropriate to merit my cut off. Ironically, when she cuts people off herself she can be very imperious and self righteously justified in it. Like she has her own reasons and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks and no one must question them at all. But I’m not afforded the same?  Frankly, I almost feel like it’s a way to tear me down and I don’t know if it’s hidden competitiveness or what. It just really annoys me for my basic boundaries to be used to ridicule me and pretend like I’m acting crazy by people with twice the number of rules and boundaries themselves. I’m beginning to look as it as a way to hold another woman down so you can be on top. By pretending that what you know and hold as good for yourself isnt good for her too.  She and I were much friendlier with each other and better acquainted than she and him too. Yet she automatically jumps to side with him, not even knowing or asking to know the story  She’s super boundaried about men minding their limits of what is appropriate with her at work- but basically acted like an apologist and even a ridiculer to what was really my sexual harassment in the same setting  I guess it doesn’t even pay to analyze- all you can do is continue living your highest good for you.	1643128970.0	schxx1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/schxx1/resistance_from_extremely_boundaried_people_on/	Resistance from Extremely Boundaried People on Basic Boundaries They Hold Themselves
3vtqsp16	FDS is mainly about developing an LTR with an HVM. I understand that, but I've had a lot of fun and gotten a lot of “benefits” 💰 recently targeting LVM's purely for financial gain. I'd like to do a lot more of that and do it better, so I posted a question about it on Diabla. Someone who’s there and on FDS assured me my question would be OK for FDS and would get more responses here because FDS has so many more members so:  What are some effective ways to learn a man’s insecurities and unmet needs, the kind of things you can use to target him for his money? Once I know a man’s vulnerabilities, I’ve done pretty well getting money out of him, but it’s not always easy to figure out what those are.  In some cases, it's obvious what kinds of buttons to push to get a man to open his wallet.  For example, a guy sitting all alone in a dance club looking at the women going by with a hopeless expression is going to be very appreciative of one who tells him how hot he is and that she can’t imagine why he’s there all alone. A single father with a demanding job and two kids will be very grateful to a woman who can put up with how little time he has for her and who can help him forget about all the stresses in his life.  Some guys, though, seem totally put together on the surface.   Their insecurities and unmet needs are harder to figure out. I’ve only adopted this kind of exploitative approach to men recently. I’m hoping some women who are more experienced with it might have some ideas on how to work a target whose vulnerabilities aren’t obvious. Of course, I always have my eyes open for HVM’s, but in the meantime I’m going to get everything I can out of LVM’s who deserve to be cleaned out!	1643153387.0	scr32d	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scr32d/how_to_learn_a_mans_vulnerabilities/	How to Learn a Man's Vulnerabilities
