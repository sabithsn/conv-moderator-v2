2bjcunu0	 I posted something like this on [r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/) a while ago and was met with stiff disagreement. That was before I knew this sub existed.  I feel the premise of people taking out their frustrations of the world by meeting up at midnight to beat the shit out of each other pathetic and cringey. Society is flawed and consumerist/capitalist attitude is poisoning the planet and people's brains. Anyone can see that and a lot of us end up working dead end jobs we don't like so we end up buying stuff we don't need in order to feel better in our lives.  That cycle is real and I have experienced it. I get the sentiment. It's the "the world is against me" attitude which the film seems to promote which is find not only disagreeable but damaging.   Anyway, I know A LOT of people love this movie, and there's many different interpretations of it. I actually think Ed Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are all excellent (and Meat Loaf RIP). I just can't get behind the message it portrays.	1642775993.0	s9c79v	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c79v/fight_club_is_a_film_about_self_pity_and_not/	Fight Club is a film about self pity and not taking ownership of your problems.

4judsaf9	I mostly play team based games like Dota 2, where disconnecting is punishable.  I understand some people play video games for fun after a day full of hard work, with their friends, just to chill and enjoy life. But for some of us, it's about someone winning and someone losing. I have been on the receiving end of complete mental breakdown and I have been on the giving end as well.  It feels good to make your enemy rage, to make them react like an animal, to make them cry. But he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword and I understand how stupid and cringy I look when I trash talk the enemy and then they snatch the win. It sucks, but I can live with that. It's part of the game.  What I can't live with is that in some games talking trash is more publishable than playing bad (maybe even deliberately). Like "we want this community to be a safe space for everybody and trash talkers are the worst of all people" (Overwatch), but I have to endure people who don't even try or throw tantrums at first glance of trouble and ruin the game for their entire team if they don't get what they want.   If I play well but talk crap, I don't ruin the game for my team. What's worse, I never talk crap at my teammates, that just diminishes my chances of winning.   It doesn't make sense to me that you can report people for it, I never did it. If you are a "grown adult" and don't give a flying fuck about what some "9yo edgy kid" has to say, why do you have to to tell everyone that you don't care what some "9yo edgy kid" just said and how you will report that "9yo edgy kid"? What do you want, for people to say "thank you for being a contributing member of the society"? Doesn't that prove that you all care?  You can already mute me, why do you need the option to cry about it to the company like a little brother that just got his ass handed to him and has no other option but to run to his mom? When I'm not in the mood to react I just watch people shit talking me or each other and it only makes the game more entertaining and memorable.	1642785240.0	s9fobp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9fobp/trash_talking_your_enemy_in_video_games_is_fun/	Trash talking your enemy in video games is fun
5uln56y8	I'm not sure why there is this obsession (in the US at least) to have to think of some original gift idea for all the loved ones in your life as if getting them exactly what they ask for is a cheap shortcut. Because even if you know someone really well, it's incredibly difficult to pick out a gift for them year after year.   If it's normal to have registries for weddings, it should be normal for birthdays, Christmas, etc. It's such a waste to always be receiving items that most likely you will not like or not use and then have to donate/return, or worse, keep because of guilt. I'm not saying picking an item off of someone's registry should be mandatory but it should at least be an option because no one knows you better than yourself.  Edit: saying people should be "allowed to" was the wrong terminology. What I meant is that it should be socially acceptable to do so. Of course anyone is technically allowed to make themselves a registry, but I have never seen or heard of anyone actually doing this in practice. It is definitely not common and not socially acceptable in most circles. If I gave my family a registry they would look at me funny and then laugh it off and never actually use it.	1642786472.0	s9g55d	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9g55d/people_should_be_allowed_to_make_themselves/	People should be allowed to make themselves personal gift registries for birthdays and holidays

8cvjbz4m	I guess I'll start with a little anecdote. I've noticed a big group of my peers (stereotypical alt style kids) have began to indulge in a 'hobby' (I guess) of consuming a lot of monster energy. In their social media they flaunt walls they've made in their rooms simply of empty cans and together they're always guzzling it. Many of their drinks are confiscated in school because they seemingly always require one to be in reaching distance of themselves.  Now, why did I mention that they're 'steroetypically alt kids'? Well, on TikTok, other people in the alt scene are also heavily consuming monster on their pages. I look under the 'MonsterEnergy' tag and see a legion of these people drinking them almost religiously. I'm assuming its caught on because its seen as cool or 'different' to be an avid consumer of these drinks...but honestly, I think it shows how unoriginal and ignorant these people are.  You don't look cool or edgy for sucking every last drop of caffeine out of a monster can, you look like a fucking spice addict. And let's face it, that's what half of these people are - addicts. They use monster because they've made themselves dependant on the caffeine and mostly because their friends were doing it or people online were. And no, its not some issue to be blown over - having 4 of the buggers per night is a kidney stone waiting to happen - and that's if you're lucky. Killing your liver over this energy-inducing piss is not worth it.  These people just ignorantly consume, consume, consume; they gloss over the fact that they literally cannot go a day having not had one without having withdrawal symptoms. It's not a funny joke to say you get the shakes if you don't keep drinking them - it's your body telling you that "hey, I have become reliant on this fizzy drug juice, and if you don't give me more I'll begin to shut down!"  It's like we've normalised casually snorting cocaine out of a can and it's utterly, utterly stupid.	1642789012.0	s9h4fq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9h4fq/people_who_binge_drink_monster_energy_arent/	People who binge drink monster energy aren't quirky or 'alternative', they need help.
1t8pof6z	In my school, as well as many others, they do not allow students to have phones on during class hours. In my school, they must be kept in lockers or they will be turned into the office. My school is very strict about phones with students, however, teachers have no repercussions for using their cell phone during instruction time.  Many adults always say that kids use their phones too much, but I find they use theirs way more than most children. Like come on, if a teenager can go an hour without using their phone during class, why can’t you, and adult, not use your phone too. It’s really not that hard and I find it incredibly disrespectful to the students and does not set a good example about following the rules. Now I understand they are adults, but they are working and using a phone in any other work setting would cause them to get in trouble.	1642789673.0	s9hdfj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9hdfj/teachers_should_not_be_allowed_to_be_on_their/	Teachers should not be allowed to be on their phones during lecture time if the students are not allowed to.
853td	Going to trivia night at a local bar always sounds like it's going to be a fun time, especially if the topic is something you're familiar with.  Once you get there you realize that it's the slowest, most boring time waiting for everyone to turn in their answers while half the people there "discretely" look up the answers on their phone. The questions asked are only able to be answered by the people that cheat or people that have some encyclopedic knowledge of the topic.  Every question ends up being something like "What color shirt was this one character wearing that only appeared once throughout the entire series?" so unless you've seen every episode a million times and memorized every detail you're just sitting there guessing for the entire game.	1642790031.0	s9hilv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9hilv/trivia_nights_suck/	Trivia nights suck

ghle3syu	New investors went through the 08 financial crisis and March 2020 looking to the market for an opportunity to rebound. And it worked for many of you. You made thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars in easy money. In fact, I was one of them. But I saw the writing on the wall and I cashed out about 6 months ago. Anyone that wasn’t fuelled by desperation or greed could see what was coming. We’re in the biggest bubble in history, and now the market is tanking. You tried to beat inflation and instead ended up poorer than if you did nothing. My profit was made off of investing becoming accessible to everyone.

I’m not obsessed with my resentment, and I think that’s why people are so unhappy in these situations. They feel the need to constantly act on their hate.

4e0qswt5	I don't know if it is as pathogenic everywhere as here in nort america, but people with PhD cannot clearly be referred as doctor since the title is reserved for the people that made medicine study and don't even hold a real doctorate degree. FYI PhD is a 3rd cycle degree with a thesis and MD is a [longer than usual] 1st degree normally without any contribution to the science (at least here in Canada).   What an insult to be told you're not really a doctor when you solely master some high-end biomolecular technologies. I'm not saying that physician etc are imposters but they should use some other title like medic or wtv they want without shadowing the whole scientific community.

apkiruyy	It’s not the same thing. Growing up with two parents who look nothing alike who are a different race than you but genetically your parents is an extremely unique experience. You can’t say you have the same perspective because you took an ancestry test and found out your parents both have 20% of whatever race in their background. You can’t hide from the fact that you are a mixed race person when both of your genetic parents look & experience the world differently from you due to being a different race.	1642795354.0	s9ji38	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9ji38/growing_up_biracial_with_two_monoracial_parents/	Growing up biracial with two mono-racial parents from different races is an entirely different experience than finding out you’re mixed race from a ancestry test

7ucmcawy	It never fails. Someone will post a picture of their hair, with the usual question of "Could my hair be curly? Is this a curl pattern?" Their hair is neither displaying a wave or curl, but it's doing something. Of course because the truth hurts, people will start saying "Yeah, you definitely have curly hair! Do the CGM (curly girl method) and you'll see those curls form!"  Although sometimes I am surprised that someone actually did have curly hair after a few months of doing CGM, but most of the time, they'll post a pic of their shapeless, greasy, and over-producted hair and ask "What am I doing wrong?" and people will respond with adding more products, less products, going for days without washing or brushing hair, diffusing on different temperatures, etc.  Maybe...its because you simply don't have curly hair?   I know proudly displaying your beautiful curly crown is now a thing these days (growing up with curly hair, having curls was seen as troublesome, and if not cared for properly, you looked like a mess) but I think this is the result of wanting to feel included in something.

5imde3xe	I love console wars! I think each console having their own exclusives is great. I remember as a kid visiting my friend who had Pokémon Stadium, Smash Bros, and Zelda on the N64 while I had the Final Fantasy games, Crash Bandicoot, Metal Gear Solid, and other games on the Playstation. Later on my friends got Xbox and played Halo, Splinter Cell, Star Wars KOTOR, and Jade Empire while I was playing Ratchet & Clank, God of War, Jak and Daxter, GTA and other classics on my PS2. PS3 had less console differences and the PS4 even less! With each generation these consoles lost more and more of their identity. It may be immature, but I genuinely enjoy the toxic fandoms and reading fun comments on social media ripping on each other and defending their console of choice. What's wrong with a little competition? I think it's great that Microsoft recently acquired Activision Blizzard.. Let's see if they can finally get some decent games out ;)  We need everybody doing their part to make sure the console wars continue for many years to come.

6qhtpwtm	 I'd honestly consider the one year wait if they gave us more episodes, but that's not the case. The average amount of episodes you see in series today is 8, and then you have to wait one year or more for the next season. After about year, you either lose interest in, or forget most of the storyline of the series. It gets more absurd when they release the next season of a series after 2 years or more e.g. Stranger Things (I've totally forgotten most of what happened).	1642798701.0	s9kri1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9kri1/one_year_is_too_long_of_a_wait_for_the_next/	One year is too long of a wait for the next season of a movie series.
e9x35lbi	 A lot of people lament how different groups are ruining the planet, but they themselves don’t even have children. How do you expect to pass on your values to the next generation if you won’t even procreate?   You won’t even take the most basic step of influencing the next generation by having your own children and raising them up. Why should your opinions on the direction of society carry as much weight? They shouldn’t!  Say what you will about religious zealots; At least they are carving out a place for themselves by having a lot of children. Meanwhile, some of the more mainstream subcultures have low birth rates.  When I hear child free people complain about whatever hot button societal issue (climate change, income inequality, etc..) my eyes just about roll out of my head.

da56gtva	Not sure if this is the right sub, but I’m here to rant nonetheless…  So, curiosity got the better of me, and I took a scroll through the truerateme sub. I was intrigued by the concept that people are out there, rating the facial compositions of these poor, insecure people on the internet.   It was somewhat as I expected; a lot of beautiful girls & guys asking to be objectively rated. I clicked on a girl who was literally STUNNING, interested in what people were responding… I was shocked to see the numbers 5, 5.5, 6 ‘at a push’ populate the comments. It soon became apparent that not even the prettiest of women (and I say women specifically, men get less bad of a rap) exceeding a 7. The average person got a 4. This confused me, so I investigated further. The self-proclaimed ‘raters’ consult a rank-list of male/female faces to inform what ‘rate’ they give. This list has stunning women (not so much men) at a 4, which just demonstrates the complete lack of objectivity (and perhaps agenda) this sub has.   I was then upset to find a post from one girl who received a 4.4, to which her response was ‘why was I born’. This broke my heart. I understand that people are willingly subjecting themselves to this, but there’s something that doesn’t sit right with me at all. It seems to me as though the sub is driven by a bunch of bitter, chauvinistic guys desperate to inflict insecurity on these inferably  insecure women, perhaps because they’ve felt slighted by women in the past (?).

9wneiynq	So I've seen this come up a few times if you google search it and 90% of the comments are saying it's disgusting. I don't understand this opinion at all, and it just leaves me thinking people are really dumb.  Spit isn't that gross, it literally comes from your mouth which is the main place in your body that you don't want gross things. Now, I do understand the desire to not have it spread to other body parts, but I sure as hell would prefer my own spit to shit on my ass.  There's always a few counter arguments and they just don't hold up. Bidets are probably awesome but most people don't have access to one. Showering afterwards is also great, but it's not practical to shower every time you go to the toilet. With both these methods I would still spit so I don't have to wash as much shit down the drain anyway. Wet wipes aren't flushable, apparently even the ones that say they are biodegradable are no good, and it's not convenient to carry them every where especially for men with no hand bag.  Spitting is cheap, it is less abrasive on your ass, it gives a cleaner finish, and if you don't do it because you think it's disgusting I have two things to say to you:  1) you're a closed minded savage. 2) you're also a hypocrite because you're the real disgusting one with your shitty skid marky ass.	1642803421.0	s9mk87	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9mk87/spitting_on_your_toilet_paper_is_more_effective/	Spitting on your toilet paper is more effective and NOT disgusting at all.

digk6r0s	recently nick and priyanka announced that they have become parents via surrogacy (congrats to them) but some of the reactions to this news were so weird. people saying that “adoption was right there”, “dont buy babies but adopt kids instead” saying that surrogacy should be illegal, that why are they contributing to increasing human population (???)  while i do support adoption, i also think that we should stop telling “adopt instead” to people who choose surrogacy as an option. there are some couples where the women is unable to give birth so she cant conceive naturally, so they go for surrogacy because they want a baby of their own, and there is nothing bad with it. if they are willing to give money, if the surrogate is willing to help the couple, why are you getting so angry?  i understand that alot of kids need home but shoving that same thing to couples who choosed surrogacy as an option is bit too much, and this is not for nick-priyanka, its for every couple. plus adoption isnt even that easy. you are bringing a child home who got abandoned by their own parents at an young age, the child might have some trauma or psychological problems because of that, they will take alot of time to adjust to new family and new surroundings, which i think would be too much too handle for first time parents  this is not me opposing adoption, absolutely not. i just feel like in “just adopt” there is no “just” because its a very long and tiring process. if you choose to adopt instead of giving birth or surrogacy, then good. if you apply for surrogacy instead of adoption, then also good. its your life, your child, your money and YOUR choice, so dont let anyone else tell you what should you do, or dont tell anyone what they should do. if you dont like surrogacy then ok, just congratulate the couple and move on, and adopt yourself when you can. as simple as that	1642807070.0	s9nx1g	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9nx1g/stop_saying_adoption_was_a_better_option_when_a/	stop saying “adoption was a better option” when a couple reveals they have become parents via surrogacy

But apparently as a young adult it is common for people to have first dates with multiple people at the same time?   I was under the impression that if you asked someone out that automatically meant that the two of you were dating. I personally wouldn't romantically pursue more than one person at once and had no idea people did such a thing. If I asked out someone and found out they had another date planned I'd probably be heartbroken.   Is this maybe an online-dating only thing?

Now I don't mind the actual plot of of Solar Opposites, Corvo and the family are fine and quirky, they have silly episodes but what I really look for is the wall plotline.  For those who don't know -Basically, the kid alien - Yumulack has shrunk a bunch of humans into tiny tiny people (via "sci fi shit") and built like a glass case for them to live in. This becomes their world and with that.....We have a storyline of power struggles, survival, revolution, love, and even life "outside the wall". It plays on classic parodies here and there as is usual with adult cartoons but I think it's graceful  personally.  I don't want to spoil anymore but I've come to the opinion this storyline alone has better writing than the most recent rick and morty episodes alone. I think it's Roiland and his team of writers finding a sort of second wind.	1642810595.0	s9p6xk	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9p6xk/i_think_solar_opposites_has_been_far_superior_to/	I think Solar Opposites has been far superior to Rick and Morty's last few seasons.

Trends come and go and sometimes trends come back. but alot of artist take influence from music they hear. who sais music can only be popular for some years of course people get influenced by it especially with the internet where eveything kinda mix together. music constanly evolves and there are so many more musicians than ever before, there arent alot of new genres which are complitely new most new genre are mix of other genre mixed together. its not easy making new stuff that doesnt sounds like something before	1642817922.0	s9rmny	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9rmny/i_hate_nostalgia_culture/	i hate nostalgia culture

People will do anything they can to find something wrong and it really hurts a business when you say "Everything was great! 4 stars!" Where the hell did the 5th star go?!  Some people have been able to eat "the best food in the word" and have a super wide scope of what "good" is...others have a super slim scope so it does not even make sense when we all are carrying different sized rulers. We need to switch to a pass/fail thumbs up or down system so people can't just waddle away their feels when comparing the local French bistro to their 4 years in France!

bn3u2lbh	A lot of people complain that they're working shitty jobs for low wages and it's not fair because they "want to college." If you do a little bit of digging you find out that they went to their local state school and graduated with a terrible GPA or a wildly expensive private college you've never heard of.  They learned no skills and they didn't distinguish themselves. It was basically high school 2.0 for them.   And graduate school? That's not very impressive either. Again, lots of small schools see graduate programs as a cash cow. They charge massive amounts, promise great opportunities, and admit everyone. Meanwhile nobody in the field has ever heard of them.   I was speaking with someone yesterday who had this exact experience. She has a graduate degree in a technical area she's never worked in from a junky school. All she's qualified for are entry level jobs she could have gotten years ago and she can't even get interviews for them. She complains non-stop about the "industry" being stupid when she's the sucker who made a terrible investment.   The systemic problem here is schools creating programs that will not help their students. Enrollment = money to feed their bloated ranks of middle managers. Schools need to cut that out. That's not an unpopular opinion.   My unpopular opinion is: as students of these programs it's time to wake up and realize you've been hoodwinked. You don't deserve a high paying job because you got a B- in microeconomics from South Montana State University. You are no better off than someone who went to work right after high school except with a lot more debt.

176si8	The title pretty much says it all, I really don't understand why we ever decided that professors shouldn't have to be qualified in teaching.  Yes. Professors are smart. They are masters in their fields and are likely to be published researchers. But being an expert in your field doesn't qualify you to teach it, those are two completely different skills. Every student I have ever talked to has at least had one professor who has had no idea what they're doing when teaching... that shouldn't be an expected hurdle that all students have to jump over during their educational careers.  Getting a teaching degree really isn't that much extra work. Most places offer them concurrently with other bachelor degrees, meaning you don't have to spend extra time on them. In Canada we actually have a surplus of Ph.D holders with few job openings, so I actually think this requirement would help out the job market as well.  Overall, the education you receieve in college is arguably the most important education you will ever receieve, especially since it'll help you get a job and live independtly... and yet, the professors who teach at them have the least amount of educational training out of any other educator, it makes no sense.  DISCLAIMER: I am aware that most professors prioritize research and often considering teaching a side job, but this doesn't diminish the importance actually knowing how to teach. If you're in a classroom setting, you should know what you're doing.	1642833233.0	s9w6xy	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9w6xy/collegeuniversity_professors_should_be_required/	College/University professors should be required to have teaching backgrounds
ac0lzzcz	Soo, since this is the unpopular opinion sub don't come at me lol.  I watched both films. And I also finished the Before trilogy. I enjoy Before Sunrise (and Sunset) because it's filmed in a unique manner (you know, all talking for 2 hrs through the city). Hated Midnight because the fight is way too realistic, reminded me of how my toxic parents fought. Only it never ended in a "well, I do care about you" vibe like Jesse and Celine.  In this post, I'm only taking Before Sunrise to compare with Titanic. Because there's the similarity of "two people fall in love in a short period of time" and "sense of wonder in discovering and knowing each other" plot.  In terms of romance movie recommendations, I often see people recommending the Before trilogy while Titanic is being categorized as "overrated and celebrated" simply because it's a big budget film. Jack and Rose's romance seems to be treated like a meme.  Personally, I re-watched Titanic more times than Before Sunrise. There were also many points in Titanic that moved me deeply, the love story just added the perfect touch to string all the moments together. I'm also a total sucker for "My Heart Will Go On" (the credits version) because it personally means more than just lost, grief and love for a romantic partner for me, as the listener.  With before Sunrise, my heartstrings were only pulled only once or twice, like "aww, that's cute and relatable!" then I'm just feeling cool about the whole movie again.  I'm not preaching that Jack and Rose's romance is realistic and perfect or whatever. It's just ROMANCE MOVIE-wise, Titanic > Before Sunrise. ok bye	1642836242.0	s9wzdi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9wzdi/titanic_tells_a_better_romance_story_than_before/	Titanic tells a better romance story than Before Sunrise

It's not like im trying to act like some genius master mind but the amount of people with mass amounts of student debt, regular debt, children,  massive car payments and absolutely no where to go. Did you really not see our systems falling apart? What put you in the place where you had to rely on a system that eats you alive? I'm not in the boat of just saying oh workers just need to pull themselves up by their boot straps and I can recognize how lucky I was to at least have one loving parent. So really what's your story? Do you think you could've avoided your situation by doing less "normal" things? What age where you and what was the world's climate like in your head when you signed up for something that didn't turn out?	1642844665.0	s9z0qj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9z0qj/if_the_world_is_clearly_in_a_complete_state_of/	If the world is clearly in a complete state of discord and disorder I can only feel so bad for people who try to ignore it and live "normal" lives.
569vk6ey	Using a picture of a stranger as the butt of the joke with whatever tag you find humorous is just kinda cruddy.   For example - Ben Affleck is a recovering addict & so many people just use a pap shot of him at his worst for their memes. People who have shared how they became a meme talk about how people screengrabbed them at their worst & went from there. Or people who make a silly mistake on camera with a wrong answer or unintelligent answer (Eg Popeyes fave food is chicken on some new Family Feud) just get blasted for it for the rest of their lives.   It sounds like a horrible experience to be the face of and butt of a joke/meme - so why participate in sharing, creating & doing it someone else?	1642846149.0	s9zdhe	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9zdhe/i_find_majority_of_memes_unfunny_and_just_mean/	I find majority of memes unfunny and just mean
gm5tgqyo	Too many parents are absolutely fucking useless and an obligatory course on how to parent properly would at least increase the chances of them not being complete fuck ups.

These things are actually pretty simple, so I find it sad that you have to tell many people nowadays because they are neglectful.

777w13gk	I genuinely mean it. Physically uncomfortable. I'd rather have my upper-middle class life atm or a lower-middle class life.  My uncle is a pretty rich person (owns an IT company). His furniture and house, while very beautiful, is very uncomfortable. I can't fatom living at his place. Not to mention his and his kids' diets aren't the best either. They literally have McDonalds everyday. I don't have anything against my uncle; I love him and he's nice but his house ain't it  Cars as well. Lambos and Ferraris are top flashy. And impractical with many road surfaces. Mercedes, Audi etc are better coz they're luxury cars plus they're very practical. Toyotas, Mazdas etc are practical plus they're pretty comfortable too  I really do hope to be CEO of a company one day (on my way to do a CPA after uni). But I wouldn't like to live an ultra-luxious life. I'd like a big house but with a upper middle class taste to it if that makes sense.   And let me tell you; there is actually a big difference between being upper-middle class and being rich. Being upper-middle class typically means you're a white-collar worker with a well-earning salary and you've got multiple assets invested somewhere be it shares or a bit of real estate. You might own a rental investment property. That's what my parents have. Being proper rich means having a few luxury cars, having your own company or being an outlier of elite white-collar workers.   Maybe this isn't an unpopular opinion, but a lot of people I see get gobsmacked when I say this. Or it might be that I'm out of touch with the general public; but that being said, when my family first came to Australia, we were living in a one-room student apartment together and we used to have multiple layers of blankets and sheets to not freeze during winter. So ik the experience of that. I wouldn't want that again neither do I want to be ultra-wealthy	1642859799.0	sa31hc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa31hc/living_a_rich_lifestyle_is_uncomfortable/	Living a rich lifestyle is uncomfortable
2my1wrlb	I’ve been working hard my entire career and personal life to ensure everyone feels equal and treated fairly based on issues seen in EEO programs but what I thought was only a fad by placing people in categories based off when they were born has been causing more division in my life than most others.   I work with individuals older and younger than I and lately it’s brought up that someone is a boomer, a X, a millennial, or a Z. This of course makes individuals feel like they don’t belong to a group and feel that others don’t understand them.   Even at home with my family it’s referenced a lot lately and it’s just made up segregated bs.   I’ve tried to explain to everyone I know, that plenty of people transcend this age separation by being amazing individuals. I know people who are 50 and above who get along with people who are 20 and vice versa. I get along with everyone almost, save the jerks who just can’t quit being genuine grade A butt heads.   I just want people to quit coming up with new ways to label and segregate each other. We have enough strife through other issues. We don’t need this too.

I wouldn’t put any distracting stuff on it like Games or Social Media on there  2nd. Only educational stuff  3rd. Only communication functions like E-mail, Instant messaging services, phone calls, chat, voice conference, video conference  4th. It can take pictures  5th. And other useful features like notes, ordering stuff, translate, watching the time just stuff that you ACTUALLY need  Basically just make it a utility tool, not addictive, no unnecessary features just a tool you can use for when you need it  Just a simple device for communication, education  No entertainment and shit like that (that’s what a TV literally is made for)  Nothing that’s distracting  Cause that’s the issue with modern phones they are too distracting and addictive  And the people who said they were gonna change the world for the better with that I believe instantly failed to recognize that these machines have failed simply once they started to have, too many features to really be used for something world changing.	1642861692.0	sa3ng3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa3ng3/phones_have_become_useless_and_failed_their/	Phones have become useless and failed their purpose

The issue is that like other mental health issues, the more it is normalized to talk about, the better the chance of recovery or seeking help there is.

They are planning for a marriage and I'm happy that the two people I love and care are happy and having a healthy relationship, rather than getting angry for a relationship that didn't last for a reason. First, I was sad and bitter even but I think its important to draw your boundaries and know where to stop. Its called "ex" for a reason, you do not control their romantic life choices anymore, or own them because once you were together. You aren't entitled to have control over your ex as much as your friend's romantic life. Just because they are your friend doesn't mean they should make their life-choices according to *you*, especially over a relationship which ended. You are putting both pressure on yourself and your friend over something which ended and has no value to it anymore.

32uyh29z	Most people experience love quite young, and most the time are not looking for it at all.  I will admit that it's an amazing, fantastic feeling unlike any other, and while it's in your life, life feels really good, and you look forward to the next day, because you may spend it with the person you love, or you may be one day closer to seeing them again.  Before you experience love, single life feels fine, and normal, but after you've experienced it, single life feels lacking and empty, and really lonely.  Simply put, once most people have had a taste of love, their life won't feel complete, or even enjoyable without it.  I guess that's a reason why people stay in relationships that are bad, it's why some people would rather put themselves through hell, than sleep alone at night. And that's why some people are just always dating diffirent people, because they can't stand to be without companionship.  Before I experienced love I was carefree, and content, now I just want to feel that again, and I can live my life and get through each day no problem, but there's an empty feeling, and a constant longing for intimacy that was just never there before I fell in love for the first time.	1642878305.0	sa9j9v	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9j9v/love_changes_you_and_definitely_not_for_the_better/	Love changes you, and definitely not for the better
i88d3tsr	 I knew someone who used to be like this, he knew I was depressed and was going through a rough time of no motivation goals in life, just being isolated which with all going on these past years was even worse than usual.  He knew all this yet never stopped boasting about how great is life is, as if he is tea bagging me and trying to piss me off, make me jealous or whatever, constantly just spamming the best moments of his life, portraying something like a perfect fake instagram page where all you see is just happy moments.  I am not saying that if you have a depressed buddy all you should do is mirror the behaviour and act like a crybaby who is just pessimistic all the time, I am just saying that acting like a child and screaming around because you are successful in your life is not the solution either.  To me its just like visiting someone who is dying in a hospital , needs a triple bypass and just flexing your 9% bf muscles while screaming around like hulk, some people might see that and appreciate it see it as some sort of motivation but I think most just think you are a douche.  I like the middle ground where you acknowledge that someone is going through a rough time perhaps even relate to the person and say something like "Look I was also depressed, I did X and Y which helped me in life and now I am here" in a humble, not bragging type of way.	1642879050.0	sa9sqt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9sqt/boasting_about_your_great_life_in_front_of/	Boasting about your great life in front of someone who is depressed is asshole behaviour.

i88d3tsr	If you are blessed with great genetics and naturally look really good, to a point where you could easily be a model then I believe you have the most overpowered aspects a human can have.  I know there are other things you can have which are also extremely overpowered, something like just being really disciplined and being a charismatic spokesman, you'd definitely be more successful in life however those are all things which you actually have to master and work for.  Life is not all about the looks, I get it, also good looking people have their own problems, just like how billionaires can also have their own problems.  However I strongly believe that just the face that you look good, you will go through life with much more ease.  You avoid bullying in your childhood which most likely makes you have less self esteem issues than people who don't look great.  Looking good for most people also equals being naturally charismatic, many teachers respect a child who just looks "cute" more than a child who says the same thing but doesn't look like he came from model parents.	1642881073.0	saais6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saais6/looking_good_is_one_of_the_most_overpowered/	Looking good is one of the most overpowered aspects you can have as a human being.

74oqmu1r	So a couple nights ago someone on Reddit posted about her boyfriend making it clear to her, that if she was to become pregnant, and she didn't abort, he would break up with her, not supporting her or the child whatsoever.  I replyed as much as I believe in both participants having a voice in this huge decision, it needs to be discussed in adult conversation, with both coming to the conclusion together, supporting each other. That's what a healthy relationship would do to problem solve this. His way, or the highway, with threats is announcing, not only is he volunteering, he'd be a deadbeat dad, its a loveless relationship.  If you love someone, you wouldn't threaten,  threats. I was bombarded with people saying they were offended because they don't want kids and the guys being honest and has a right to not want kids so she shouldn't break up with him. I explained that the guy is 100% aloud to feel this way, but he's admitting he would be a deadbeat dad, if she didn't obey his wishes. One person even made the argument that a deadbeat dad is someone who has a child, and then doesn't support it. Apparently your not a deadbeat dad if you tell the female before she gets pregnant that you won't support her and the child before she's pregnant, you're off the hook if she gets pregnant.  So I'm not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, or if it was just a handful of lost souls , clueless what life's about.  Heres my unpopular opinion........  If you're responsible enough to play hide the weenie, then you're responsible enough to understand,  with playing hide the weenie, there's a chance of creating a child. If you announce to the person involved that if she doesn't obey you and get an abortion, your not supporting her or the child, that doesn't get you off the hook.  With this mindset, then every single adult life decisions that come up that you don't agree with your partner on, your breaking up with them. This is called controlling someone. It's also called mental abuse. It's also called toxic behavior creating an unhealthy relationship.  If these are your view's, than find someone who shares these views to have sex with, or quit having sex until you take responsibility for your own birth control.  With sex comes responsibilities.  Accept these responsibilities have consequences if something goes wrong during sex. Own that responsibility.  You can get your point across without threats. And you don't have to have sex if your partner doesn't agree with your commands.	1642882043.0	saavlc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saavlc/let_me_educate_some_members_of_reddit/	Let me educate some members of Reddit!!
3ox7wa97	Caffeine is considered a non issue by majority of the population. People let there kids have it without batting an eye. The amount of adults that can't function without a cup of coffee in the morning is ludicrous. The amount of people giving themselves or exacerbating anxiety and sleep problems is off the charts.   Caffeine should be treated like alcohol or cigarettes. Make it at least 18 to buy to keep kids from getting addicted to it at a young age and make the branding of it less attractive to children.   On a personal note, I drank about 3-4 mountain dews a day from the age of 10 to 18. Didn't officially stop caffeine until about 6 months ago. I sleep better, I don't feel like a junky in the morning looking for my fix, and my anxiety has pretty much entirely evaporated.   Obviously some people can handle caffeine and I have no issue with people using it. I think as an adult you should be able to do whatever you want with your own body.

I’m not only speaking of my personal experience (I took shrooms once and that’s it), but also on others people experience.   I think it can only make you more empathic, prone to understand and admit different views and be more human to a certain extent.  It’s not possible to get an addiction from shrooms, and it’s one of the least dangerous drugs (including alcohol).    For those reasons, I think it should be a good idea to make everyone (obviously excepting people that could not handle them for health reasons) try them at least once.	1642888197.0	sad2cw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sad2cw/everyone_should_experiment_shrooms_at_least_once/	Everyone should experiment shrooms at least once.

3f1v9lc6	Ok imagine if there's a crisis in Namibia and you want to do something about it. You try and raise your support but people are going to ask why do you support or care for Namibians? If you say because they need our help and it's the right thing to do, are you being really sincere or are you showing your kindness as a way for wider public to pay attention to you and for you to be revered as a saint?   Unfortunately it's mainly the latter. It's seem that so called allies are only interested in the praise they'll receive from the communities they claim to represent and people in general. Well excuse me but I think that's incredibly disingenuous. If you only care about something or someone because of what others might think than what's the point of bothering with that thing in the first place? Ask yourself why virtually every celebrity panders to every cause under the sun but do little to nothing to better the problem. Only for people to say that you're a good person or you're such a powerful ally but here's the thing: You aren't actually a good person but rather a selfish bastard who lectures others for not sharing the same views as you and protests at every instance as  a way to stick it your parents.  It's the same with most abolitionists of the 19th century. They hated slavery but had quite the same racial views as the slave masters, proving that they were only interested in praise and appearance. I believe that is the same principle on why straight men want to stick up for rights of men with different orientations but are many times repulsed at the idea of those same men living with them. And yet these same people call the rest of society bigoted.   Now is this to say all people who speak up for causes they support are like this? No of course not but it is a difficult pattern of self-righteousness and vanity that really harms the conversation rather than advance us forward. I believe this trend is much more greater than it was in the past thanks to social media. Now millions of young people are advocating for something that doesn't affect them on a personal basis. Why don't you go seriously work down at soup kitchens or go to this foreign country and work with the people there? Because you find it much more satisfying to get confirmation from people who are not of that situation rather than people suffering.   If you truly want to make a difference, start by abandoning the feeling of smugness and just assist someone regardless if you get attention or not. Then you can be considered an ally.   TL;DR: People with absolutely no struggles at all try to speak on behalf of said community need to take a good look in the mirror and realize they're no different from everyone else.   P.S. Bojack Horseman was the show that help me realize this.

But I really don’t feel like it is that insufferable of a place.   Sure, it has its flaws; the social credit system, micro-management from the government and whatnot. But, for the most part, I can imagine living in China to be quite a eye-opening, beneficial experience, providing you follow the rules.   Mainstream media and plain word of mouth are what I believe to be the cause of this hatred towards China. We shouldn’t frown on the country because it’s governed different and because their culture is different compared to wherever you’re from.

3sfdxt1i	Depression is at an all time high in human history and for most people, their depression is the result of a poor diet consisting of highly processed foods leading to an unhealthy gut microbiome. What is our gut microbiome you ask? The gut microbiome is an incredibly diverse array of organisms that exist in every person's GI tract. It is believed that there is more bacteria in our intestines than there are cells that make up an entire person (that's a lot of bacteria). This microbiome is responsible for many functions in the body including regulating your immune system (very important right now for obvious reasons), regulating metabolism (you wonder why you can't lose weight no matter how hard you try?), and producing 95% of our bodies serotonin (the hormone responsible for mood regulation, well-being, and happiness). If you only eat highly processed foods and drink sugary drinks, you are not fueling your gut microbiome correctly and damaging it. That means your serotonin output is drastically lower than it could be and that could be the root cause of your depressive symptoms. Fixing your gut microbiome and allowing the bacteria to produce enough serotonin could very well cure your depression along with helping you become a happier and healthier person.  Here is a link to a research article if you would like to read more about this topic.

d46i4sug	I've been slowly cooking up this opinion by some posts I've seen about the fact that kids are starting to take part of sexual acts from even a younger age than before so let's cut to the chase.  The only viable solution I see for kids to get actually educated on this matter and to not go towards this is by getting educated on it, no more taboo and no more "Pollen" or "The Stork" talk.  The birds and the bees need to disappear and this are the reasons why.  Numero 1: We live in the easy access to internet age, where everything is about sex because the majority of it's users are teenagers and adults and that's what they like to see. The problem roots from the fact that even young kids are able to use it and because of the fact that they are born with it, they can surf it really quite well, so even though if you think that your child is innocent let me tell you, even if that's true it won't be for long due to modern media portrayal of arousing images for horny spectators that YOUR KIDS can easily be aimed at.  Numero 2: You keep treating them dumb or feeling uncomfortable around the idea of explaining it and instead of going right to the chase you create this whole big story of a really important matter. Sex is as important as... I dunno... some subjects taught school... There's a whole world behind it and being part of sexual acts is just the tip of the iceberg, the more you keep posponing it the less time you have to teach your kid what's important. So throw away the stigma you have for this subject, is sex and it might be uncomfortable for you but in the near future it might mean everything for your offspring to know about. If they are not educated enough they are prone to the bad part of sex life (STDs, accidental pregnancies, infections, etc)  Numero 3: This might be the most unpopular one of them all but you need to grow the fuck up. Sex is real in this world and as long as your kid is part of this world it will be very real for them too. The best way to treat this is face forward and with honesty: Do not scare them away from it, do not lie to them about it, do not pospone the talk longer than necessary, and certainly do not avoid any involvement from it.  &#x200B;  **BIG SUMMARY:**  There's no way your kid will never know about sex, it's only natural for a kid to develop sexual tendencies at a certain age and therefore to try and participate on them. And not only that but they probably ain't that stupid, they know how to use a computer, even if they do not get aroused yet they have some exposure to sex already.  Tackle the problem from the root and educate them before they grow some unhealthy ideas in the back of that small head, is better to be educated accordingly to a taboo matter than to be ignorant towards it, may it be for their age, gender, race, religion, education, learning abilities, or YOUR knowledge about it.

7ylnyir6	When a person or group says they practice tolerance, what are they really saying?  At first glance, it sounds great! It seems to convey inclusivity as an action. In reality, however, it isn’t an action at all. Consider the following definition, courtesy of Oxford Languages dictionary.  Tolerance:  the capacity to endure continued subjection to {something}.  By definition, tolerance is the act of doing nothing.  You can even hate what you tolerate. How likely is that to effect long term change?  I think tolerance is a buzzword and a shortcut to critical thinking.   So what is my answer, since I am criticizing a whole movement?  Kindness:  the quality of being generous, helpful, and caring about other people, or an act showing this quality. -Oxford Languages Dictionary  Kindness requires both action and empathy.

45u5fpzn	I’m sorry, but I’m done listening to people taking a jab at the pharma industry and how they rip you off of money to get basic healthcare.   First of all, what is “basic” healthcare? A disease, irrespective of how basic or complicated it may be, takes about billions of dollars worth research to make drugs for. Discovering a new drug is a tedious process because it involves understanding a particular pathological process at a molecular level, then picking out one biomolecule from one of the steps in this process, synthesizing hundreds of compounds that would bind specifically to this target biomolecule, selecting the one with the best effectiveness and the safest side effects profile, formulating that compound in the most optimized drug delivery system and then sending it out for clinical trials. All these steps takes money, buddy. And by the way, this is probably an oversimplified version of the actual drug discovery and development process. The actual process is a lot more challenging and intricate than what I just described.  And reaching the clinical trails may sound like a big feat, but it only gets brutal from there. Only 1% of all these drug discoveries ever make it through all three stages of clinical trials. And on an average, a clinical trial for a drug costs about a billion dollars. Imagine the loss of capital in those 99% drugs that don’t make it through clinical trials.  If we don’t pay the price for these medicines, the pharma industry wouldn’t have the resources to sustain it’s Research and Development process which only aims at improving the quality of our lives.  Yes, this industry at times has not had a clean slate of records when it comes to ethical practices. And I also agree that healthcare needs to be more accessible.

4ojvm0o6	To preface this, I actually like the styling of both, however I am speaking from experience of living with both cars.   The only advantage to a hatch is manoeuvrability, and it’s ability to hold large cargo such as boxes (which for most people is a very rare situation to be in).   Sedans are better in all other aspects:  Gas mileage, cabin room, better safety in a crash, overall comfort, highway stability.   On cargo: Sedans offer nice deep trucks, which are better for storing a higher number of smaller items, which in my opinion is a more common situation than that one time you need to transport something big from Home Depot. (It is also underrated how small hatch trucks are when’s the seats are up) On top of that, if you have something long like a pipe, hockey stick, etc, sedans will actually perform better since they are physically longer.   Don’t get me wrong, I do think they are useful, but not as useful as they are made out to be.

I do like sending normal pics and I don't care if she wants to send me pics but idk just not into taking some of myself. It's not that I'm afraid of shit ending up on the internet either I could honestly give a fuck less if they did.

2g4rcmcb	Working aucks. Working in an office is okay. But I noticed that approaching work like a game makes it more enjoyable. I have no loyalty except to myself and my salary. I focus on my output because it makes the day go by faster for me personally. My primary objective is "leaning" every aspect of my job resulting in lower effort but higher output. I was hired into a department/role that was demanding the resources of 3 employees (including myself). Once I was familiar with the job role, I opted out of all the unnecessary habits (IE over detailing email attachments for archive, over detailing internal notes, sending an email reply only saying "thank you"  both internally/externally, using hard copy reference instead of digital and much more) that were trained to me. I did not let customers or colleagues that I didn't report to manage me. Within 6 months, colleague # 1 got promoted out of the department. Colleague # 2 (my supervisor) clashed with upper management, was revealed to be inefficient, and emotionally driven when making high impact decisions. Colleague # 2 eventually quit and I became the department for a year until we hired another employee). Title/Salary bump + autonomy over department parameters/company written processes.  I play all sides when it comes to internal politics and communicate neutrality when there is conflict between colleagues/departments. I try to maintain frame when there is an emotional situation (frustrated colleague, high maintenance customer, mistakes across multiple departments resulting in x dollars) and avoid matching tonality so I appear to be the more rational person in the room. Most colleagues are intimidated by upper management. 3 years later and I now report directly to the CEO after starting as an entry level employee. Although I'm much younger than upper management, I'm treated as a peer.	1642927709.0	sapar3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sapar3/i_enjoy_climbing_the_corporate_ladder/	I Enjoy Climbing The Corporate Ladder

ekspac4j	When I was little Cinderella was always my favourite princess.   My mum told me before she died to work hard and always give much more than I get and the world would look after me. So I definitely had a soft spot for her and I can’t stand how she’s viewed as a bad role model.   My mum was the kindest person in the world, and would get taken advantage of often, I always thought how she should be more distrusting. But somehow she ended up so rich in so many ways. everything she gave out into the world came back double. By actually caring , she inherited property, businesses, opportunities, support, respect. In a roundabout way, even the times when she was absolutely, unmistakably used by people (I’m talking months of unpaid labour type used) she always ended up benefiting (twice fold).   I look back and think of where she would have been if she was not so kind, she would have been working a 9-5 for the rest of her life, with no property or anything.   And I have had the same experience. So I honestly believe there’s a lot of truth to the story of Cinderella. Trade the fairy god mother for society. And Prince Charming for success. I think giving time and love without ever expecting anything is such a good way to live. And it does lead to success relevant the to the current time.

15bv8f	Millions of animals die every day and eating their meat is fine. There's very little difference between the suffering a sea creature endures during typical preparation, and what it endures when a mukbanger is cooking it up. Besides, if you tried to boil up a whole live octopus with no former experience you'd look pretty cruel while doing so as well. "But they shouldn't film it for the world to see!" Some say. Why not? A crab doesn't have any moral objections about being recorded while it dies, and the outcome of its existence is the same regardless of what happens to it prior. The only reason why people get up in arms about the video aspect of it is because it makes them face the fact that meat comes from animals. I don't like watching animals suffer, and I don't watch videos of them doing so, but I just think there's a lot of cognitive dissonance going on here.	1642939243.0	sas6fo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sas6fo/i_dont_think_theres_anything_wrong_with/	I don't think there's anything wrong with mukbangers preparing live animals

The acting (for most part) is extremely good especially from Jamie Lee and Donald Pleasance.

Heck back then people listened to the same 100 songs on their CDs for a thousand times.

abcbavcn	This is probably super unpopular considering the average age and emotional intelligence level of reddit BUT here we go. I think i’m in the right sub.   I was very insecure and jealous when i was younger (in my twenties). I wasnt controlling but i was often making a big deal out of small things because of jealousy. The worst i could imagine was if my boyfriend had physical desires for another woman. I felt undesirable and worthless if my boyfriend was attracted to someone else. I saw infidelity as the absolutely worst thing you could do to someone.   Now i am 32, i have a kid, i have lived in 4 different countries, i speak 6 languages and i have worked all over the world. I have had several relationships in my life and i am currently with the father of my kid.   Now I understand that if my husband get physical with another woman, it has nothing to do with me. I understand that i am not to blame. Like, i deeply understand this now. I believe it into my bones. I would be heartbroken if he did it, but I wouldn’t let it mess with my feeling of self worth. So it wouldn’t impact me as much as before.   Also i see other things as much worse. If he emotionally abandons me. That shit is 10 times worse.   Lets set up 2 scenarios:   1. He is there for me/us. He wakes up in the night when the kid needs us. He is there for me emotionally, checking in on me. Makes me my favourite dinner and picks up my dry cleaning so i can take a long bath and have a break from the mom-stress. And then he makes a mistake: he gets drunk and ends up making out with his co-worker at the office christmas party. Major idiot, i agree, but scenario 2. Is worse!   2. He stops being there for me and our kid. He starts working late hours and when he comes home he is grumpy and annoyed and goes directly into his office and has a phone-call with a client. He forgets to take our kid to the dentist and makes my life so much more complicated because i then need to reschedule and fix everything. He doesn’t look at me anymore and he just wants to have sex and then fall asleep and couldn’t be bothered with how i am feeling. But he is being “faithful”.   Scenario 2 is far worse for me.   For me, “cheating” shouldn’t be solely the act of having physical relations with others. It should include not respecting the unwritten agreements you have with your spouse. If you support each other and help each other and actively love each other and you somehow neglect your spouse in these matters, youre also cheating!   The world is too focused on 1 problem being the oh so horrible thing.

35tsmheu	We have this perception in America - perhaps driven by some sort of cowboy nostalgia - that “Real America” is a *man* on a horse with a hat tending to his herd on a wide-open ranch with mountains in the background. “Real Americans,” so it goes, are the people who best match our largely incomplete history of the American frontier.  What a load of bull - pun intended.   First of all the implication that there is an “unreal” America or American is preposterous, period. What does real even mean? Does it mean “most representative?” Does it mean “best epitomizing our frontier past?” We can ask this question any one of dozens of ways, but I am focused on representativeness - what does America look like for the average American demographically speaking. As an aside, race and income play into this question MASSIVELY, but I cannot write a book today. In terms of demographics, the critical fact is that most the population in this country is urban, nearly 80%. Our top 100 cities have approximately 60 million people within their respective city propers. Approximately 15% live in the narrow Northeast metropolitan zone alone.   Meanwhile, somewhere in Iowa, there is a town with a population of 150. It is predominantly (if not 100 percent) white with people who have rarely if ever left their state. If there is a such thing as “real America,” that ain’t it.  Instead, if we’re going to push this notion that there is a “Real America” somewhere out there, people are going to have to get over the frontier version and start acknowledging it is a city. A busy city corner is the heartland of America.	1642962442.0	sb06le	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb06le/real_america_is_the_corner_of_a_busy_city_street/	“Real America” is the Corner of a Busy City Street - Not a Farm in the Great Plains

You probably also act like a creep, with how you conduct yourself, how you gravitate towards the children first instead of breaking the ice with the adults, etc...

ctgpzmtf	This is an unpopular decision within my generation gap (Gen Z and/or Millennials) but nobody is entitled to a text/call back the same way you don’t have to text/call someone in return. People nowadays become so sensitive and overdramatise the time it took for someone to respond as if it matters. Some people don’t like to be on their phones and prefer to have hobbies and things that don't revolve around social media or technology. Others might not be in the mood to be social and like a lot of people, they simply forget. Does that make them a bad person? Fuck no.   The entitlement that reeks from people is beyond me, it is almost toxic even that people believe that if you don't text them back within (insert time bracket) then they’re a fake friend/partner or whatever even. As if they’re any better and all high and mighty that they never forget a text/call and have never left someone on seen.

a2q0xca8	This is a GENERAL statement based on MY experiences  There's no denying that drunk people, statistically, are more of a danger to themselves and others. There's also no denying that getting high (on weed, that's what this post is talking about) is less bad for you than getting drunk, when done the same amount of times. But high people are waaay more annoying than drunk people are.   Despite the stereotype, most high people are extremely erratic. I've seen my high friends blow their carts into smoke alarms and set them off, cover my floor in minced garlic, almost start fist fights, and through ice at people. Drunk people can be crazy, even erratic, but their behavior is more predictable. When my friends are drunk, they mostly just dance around, take stupid pictures and videos, and attempt physical stunts that result in pain. The normal dumb shit drunk people do is usually less spontaneous than the dumb shit high people do.    High people create a huge mess. This is especially a problem when your trying not to get caught smoking the weed. It's because there's so much paraphernalia you need to smoke bud. Rolling a joint, the least lucrative but also least efficient way to smoke involves small papers and filters, a grinder, and a lighter. Compared to other drugs, this is already quite a bit. With alcohol, you need nothing but the container it comes in, with cocaine, you need dollar bill, and credit card. Same for ketamine. For LSD you need nothing. If you plan on smoking with a bong, you need a paper clip, lighter, water, somewhere to clean the bong, and possibly running alcohol. It's really hard not to loose any of that when your high. The pungent smell that attaches itself to everything is also very annoying and hard to hide. The eating is also nuts. I've had high friends ruin countless kitchens and create so much to clean up because their stomachs are just bottomless pits.    High people are dumb as rocks. That's why leave their paraphernalia everywhere. That's why they get irrationally paranoid all the time, which is annoying to listen to. Drunk people can be idiots too but they're never paranoid and aren't as forgetful unless they've blacked out.    High people are just generally more of a hastle, and I often find myself babysitting when my friends get high. O and also, people who are inexperienced fucking vomit, cleaning vomit off a carpet is awful. I think this unpopular, don't know about you, would love to hear in the comments.   TDLR: high people are erratic, smoking bud involves more paraphernalia, munchies make messes, high people are paranoid.	1642967358.0	sb23wl	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb23wl/high_people_are_more_annoying_than_drunk_people/	High people are more annoying than drunk people
fnrsjl3s	 If you like FNF, its okay. I respect your opinion. But i dont like it,  1. Ruined Newground characters such as Pico, And others, (R34)   2. The mods are horrible and repetitive, it’s always 3 phases and even then my friends and fans defend them by saying “oh there ()”,   3. It’ll be forgotten in a year or 2, as the Devs don’t seem to care, they haven’t even given big news out since the patreon released, I’m still going with the theory that the devs ran off with the money,   4. The fandom. It’s so fucking cringe and toxic, nothing more nothing less.   5.

They know they do not naturally have what another human would want so they have to make up for it in others ways to get intimacy or attention.   Most humans want the feelings to be mutual.

Never giving up is not a guarantee of success. But the act of trying something means that you are doing something in exchange of the opportunity of doing something else.  Do not never give up on something. Do your best, try hard, put a lot of effort and enjoy the ride. But if failure comes, set aside some time to make a good assessment if it is worth the trouble of trying it again.

7t6g09i	Not only do companies completely ruin the experience of players by making their games gigantic chore simulators so they can increase these metrics, but the concept doesn't even translate correctly to videogames like it does in other products.   It's naive to think that higher engagement metrics correlate to higher revenue in a videogame since in a lot of cases the bulk of the revenue comes from whales, who actually engage less with the content.  And as an investor you'd have to be a complete idiot to think that engagement metrics are a useful indicator of the health of a game since it's very evident that companies that care about that will do whatever it takes to artificially increase those numbers, painting a false picture of how they're actually doing in that regard. You're trusting the numbers from a business partner that disregards your intelligence to sell you smoke.  So if it ruins things for the players and damages the product experience, and if the numbers are manipulated so they look bigger to investors, why do we accept companies maneuvering around them if it only benefits the company and fucks the other two parties which are the ones actually interested in the product?   It might be the reddit bubble, but I see so many people defending this absolute garbage of a practice under the pretense that companies NEED to present this "vital" information to the investors, as if it was something actually useful to them, and so they're justified in ruining perfectly good games by adding horrendous time-wasting mechanics.	1642977014.0	sb5vdt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb5vdt/engagement_metrics_in_videogames_are_the_dumbest/	Engagement metrics in videogames are the dumbest shit ever and are unjustifiable.

3nghtcqp	So I live in NYC and a couple of times a year myself and my SO like to go out to some pretty fancy restaurants in Manhattan and sometimes to see show or the opera. Stuff like that. The reason I’m addressing this is that I frequently see a lot of tourists who show up dressed incorrectly and are turned away  at the door and absolutely lose it or if they’re seated they just look at everyone there completely infuriated. Also I’ll add that I can count on one hand all the restaurants in Manhattan this still require a jacket so it’s not like these people didn’t have other options.  Why I feel this way is simple. When we decide to go out to dinner, we aren’t just paying for the food. If we were, we would have gotten take out. We’re there because restaurants are fun. We enjoy the environment and at a nicer place you’re paying for a beautiful and elegant space to spend dinner in and everyone around you contributes to that or in this case detracts from it.   You aren’t dressing up for yourself. You’re doing it for the people around you and to convey to staff and possibly the owner or chef that this experience is of significance to you. That you feel a sense of privilege to be able to experience such a nice meal.   When you’re wearing jeans you’re suggesting that this meal is meaningless to you. That this isn’t the best meal you’re going to have this month so it’s not worthy of the best stuff in your closet.   It seems to me that people have somehow decided that anytime they’re spending money inside of a restaurant, they’re suddenly entitled to be as inconsiderate and selfish as they want and it’s something I absolutely can not understand. What’s wrong with being someone who others enjoy being around? When did people start equating trying to be pleasant to be around with caring too much what others think? And why? What’s good about that?	1642977501.0	sb61yg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb61yg/showing_up_underdressed_to_a_nice_restaurant_or/	Showing up underdressed to a nice restaurant or event is pompous and rude

But I believe none of this works in developing countries where education from an institution is very important to secure a job. this no college education and still getting a job theory comes from a very privileged, ignorant belief and can't work for everyone. besides the fact if you don't have a college degree that doesn't equate to doing small courses and having commendable knowledge. you still need to study to get a complete understanding of the subject or get trained even if you aren't in any university.  And trust me I work in one of the big MNC e.g, Google, Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Facebook. And when we say no degree required, we meant highly talented young people 😀, and the job inside is not as easy as to just watch YouTube tutorial or StackOverflow, majority of the knowledge required are concrete fundamental and a lot of creative thinking.

16rg2a	Yes, the WNBA sucks compared to the NBA.  Yes, some of their players are delusional wanting the same salary as NBA players, even though they don't bring in even nearly the same amount of money.  Yes, if it wasn't for the NBA and its financial support, the WNBA would probably cease to exist.  Having said that, I feel like there's waaay too much hate towards the WNBA. If there's a single post about the WNBA on any social media, most of the comments are just pure hate + mocking the players how much they suck.   Like I said, I agree the WNBA isn't that great, but the amount of hatred it gets is undeserved, especially from some males who I doubt have achieved more in life than any of the WNBA players out there.	1643010652.0	sbgs4m	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgs4m/the_wnba_doesnt_deserve_the_amount_of_hate_it_gets/	The WNBA doesn't deserve the amount of hate it gets.
s84u9zi	For long, long time we are being thought that ever life matter and everyone should have equal chances in life.      The terrifying truth that all of these are lies. Not every life matters and we will never have equal chances in life. It is not only about material issues, it is also about ability to learn, intelligence etc.    Second truth of the day is that the fact you were born as human is not the same with becoming Human. By Human I mean being able to live within society, with reasoning based on knowledge, logic and common sense, who is not being radicalized into delusional fanaticism.  To be able to step out of self-centrist point of view and look items from other perspective. To grow as entity in the world.      Sadly there are people who does not meet minimum criteria of the above. Their existence is being reduce to just be, consume, and not die another day. Not because they stuck in low paid job, just because they don't care. Some of them are filled with some delusional thinking about race superiority, or that their way of be is best and everyone should follow.  People who stand against living in society in aggressive way. And there like like no logical explanation to keep these people alive. There is no input from them into society. Well it is good if they at least are not damaging common good.   &#x200B;  The only two reason for not purging community is :  \- Moral hesitation of killing other living being   \- lack of metric you can use to make it.... reasonably right.	1643010709.0	sbgstn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgstn/big_part_of_society_should_be_dead/	Big part of society should be dead.
8xrz99r4	I recently started watching some reality tv sprinkled into the other shows I watch. The shows I watch consist of ‘successful’ leaders in their field typically, and while I know success varies widely, it’s great to see people who excel in their fields. I don’t care the context of how awful they probably are IRL or if they got there by nepotism, there’s things to be learned from everyone’s perspective.  I watch awful management situations and cringe remembering past personal experiences. I’m a woman in a male dominated field, seeing successful women drives me to be better. Juicy situational and industry drama drives the rest of the thirst  I know a lot of the shows are scripted but if you watch them knowing that, the experience is terrific.	1643015410.0	sbhzfq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbhzfq/reality_tv_is_inspirational/	Reality TV Is Inspirational

4w0y5xwu	I had an altercation with my parents and relatives. Some personal stuff was involved, I was shocked to see how much immature my relatives are. They kept bringing up past mistakes that I made as arguments, anf when I told them that I fixed my problems or I'm working on it. They say that they don't care and it is my business not theirs. So much Hypocrisy. And when I called them out on it,they get mad. And I don't I always talk in a calm voice. And whenever I'm called out I keep my cool, And acknowledge when I'm wrong. They don't...      I Realized that a bunch of adults act like that...  Always hypocritical when they are given the chance. Never acknowledge your mistakes as an adult And always get mad when someone calls you out or hearing sommething that you don't like...  This is how children act when they are like 10.  Children have an excuse of an underdeveloped brain, and they haven't learned how to argument on different topics... but adults have a fully developed brain. This unfortunately affects the whole world imo. Many people think that being immature is being childish, but being immature is not thinking twice on what you say or do, and having a short temper. There should be lessons in school, that tought you on how to acknowledge your mistakes, on how to be always calm in arguments. This is not something that past generations do. This is something that is being passed out by parents to their children. I would guess that 70% of parents in the entire world are immature, and that gets passed when the child becomes an adult. And it is a circle that will never stop until a child realizes how to be mature in life.	1643024972.0	sbkfit	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbkfit/it_is_incredible_that_there_are_so_many_immature/	It is incredible that there are so many immature people on this planet

Started out as a small ache and surprise cancer!” Which then has me googling whether I’m going to get cancer too   Or its, “look at this terminally I’ll child being cute” then I start thinking of the parents and their pain.

h4n9pysw	The integration of technology in today's society has created an internet addiction epidemic that negatively impacts a majority of individuals in many ways such as decreased mental health, lacking social skills, and confirmation of delusional beliefs by means of misinformation.  I think the latter may be the worst aspect.  It gets people riled up over events that don't directly affect them and it causes fights in comment sections or with peers. It divides us as people.  I can't stand seeing it.  I was reading a book recently (I forget the name) and it posed the question along the lines of, "how much time in a day do you spend in your own thoughts thinking about your own life, not including the shower or in bed."

ul76y	Been called one time in the past and had another time where I was a reserve and not needed but still had to get my work covered. In addition even if you are not called as a reserve juror in the morning you still have to call at noon to check if they need you that afternoon. I understand the importance of the process of a jury but honestly the amount of time and money that is wasted/lost at my computer during my absence is unnecessary and I would gladly pay even a larger sum ($1000+) to just have them move on to the next person. I would be in favor of them using that money any way they see fit whether that was paying current jurors more then the crap the offer now. I googled and my area is around $25/day. For those of you who are going to scream about income inequality, I agree this is  going to be purely used by those who have the means but as I said go ahead and give it to folks who do show up. Assuming you have a pool of 30 jurors (no idea) and you have three that can pay you just bumped the pay that day to $135 per person. At least then you are starting to approach livable wages at that point and maybe that single mom can afford the childcare she is being forced to pay for.	1643040806.0	sbppf0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbppf0/you_should_be_able_to_pay_to_get_out_of_jury_duty/	You should be able to pay to get out of jury duty.

d9jdbkfo	For context, I was the shopping cart-getter at a drug store in high school - Skaggs if anyone remembers them :) I was happy when people would leave their carts out in the parking area, the further the better.  I was able to get outdoors, have a chew, get some exercise and be away from the fluorescent lights and customers.  I guarantee all these self-righteous asshats who condemn people for not putting away their cart have never done that job.  If you had, you would realize it's one of the better tasks.  People have also been conditioned to perform tasks that used to be offered as complimentary services at grocery and drug stores, like having the clerk take the stuff out of your cart and having the bagboy take the cart to your car and unload it.  Now, god forbid if you put your handbasket on the conveyor without first taking out the items.

sdomd	My wife and I welcomed our first child recently. We held a baby shower months before the delivery date and did the cordial formality of sending hand written thank you cards to everyone in the months between the shower and arrival. However, cue a few months later, a very rough delivery, and two sleep deprived parents, we continued receiving gifts but from people further outside our social circle (almost entirely neighbors/friends of our parents). We are grateful for the thoughts and gifts; however, we are also receiving increasing pressure to send hand written thank you cards to these people as well. It may seem petty, but this feels very archaic and is not a high priority for either of us. Everyone recognized that, as new parents, we would have little time for anything other than care for our newborn, which partially is why a baby shower was planned months beforehand and why we wrote thank you cards immediately afterwards when we had the availability to do so. I would hope people understand that, when sending a gift after a major life event, the individual or couple may not have the same freedom to prioritize formalities like thank you cards like they did before. Instead, respect any thank you you receive at a much later time or verbally.	1643058066.0	sbwdgo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbwdgo/dont_expect_a_written_thank_you_when_giving_a/	Don’t expect a written thank you when giving a gift for a major life event that has already passed.

Not all sociopaths or psychopaths are these chronic criminals out to hurt everyone around them. Some of them are very normal people who cause more suffering to themselves than to others.

Or you have this bullshit new blend between country and hip hop so they can pander to a broader audience because without it country would fall off the damn map.   I one up you that bluegrass is FARRR superior because they can and do talk about drinking, relationships, and being country. But it's still incredibly authentic in it's sound and lyrics.

One thing that has always annoyed me is when people tell me that I don’t understand what hating someone/feeling sad about losing someone feels like because I have never been in a relationship break up.  Trigger warning for this next paragraph about abuse as a child..   However, I know that some people may have not experienced toxic family but I have. I was raised by narcissistic people. I have had my fair share of family “break ups”. As a child I was emotionally, physically, and sexually abused so I know what it feels like to go through severe pain. It was to the point where I was severely depressed and considered suicide in my early teens. I have gone through the broken trust from those who were supposed to love me the most.  I feel like that pain is equivalent at least and I’m tired of being told it’s not because I’ve never had a bf/gf breakup.	1643156831.0	scsci9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scsci9/that_family_break_ups_pain_is_just_as_bad_if_not/	That family “break ups”/ pain is just as bad if not worse than relationship “break ups”.

First of all if this was a real threat there would be massive troop movements.  Second, it has been shown over and over that mostly all media is controlled by someone, and the internet has only made it easier to push a narrative on the people.

One day space travel may be possible, but when? For now we should just be done with everything regarding Space. Other than satellites in the sky, I can't think of another groundbreaking reason why we should stay in space.

They should be able to go and become a good person and in the future I'm not excusing their behaviour but it is harder. And for the parent, it disgusts me how fully grown adults will have a child if they cant be a parent. If you can't even discipline your own child you are lazy and shouldn't be a parent. I'm so pissed at all these adults who act like they're victims because a little kid threw a tantrum. You're not a victim, you're just a shitty parent who's causing problems their child will have to suffer through later in life because theyre lazy. And then most of the kids will change but even as an adult after they would have become a better person having once been a bad person will often make it so others will judge them and they will likely have low self esteem knowing they once did bad and will still feel like they are bad.

er9duki2	The Mario franchise has gone to shit, we haven't had a good game since Galaxy 1  Galaxy 2 is just a cashgrab that took 3 seconds of development, reusing assets and the levels are poorly designed.  All of the "New Super Mario games" are basically the Fifa or Iphone of the mario series.  The only effort that went into Odyssey was the graphics, the rest of the game has terribly designed worlds, with shitty power moons that show Nintendo cares more about quantity then quality.  I'm surprised people are actually critical of the side games in the franchise like the paper mario series or the Mario party games, considering how everyone pretends everything the main series pulls out of its ass is a 10/10 masterpiece.  3d Land is so painfully slow at parts and they completely butchered the Raccoon suit.  3d World is just another rehash, im surprised they actually made new assets instead of reusing shit from 3d Land.  Bowser's Fury is just an excuse not to put out any actual Mario games for the next 6 years.  Luigi's Mansion 3 is somehow worse then Dark moon, another case of the only effort going into the visuals, which sucls because the original Luigi's mansion is one of ny favorite games out their.  Now back to the Mario movie.  Shigeru Miyamoto was clearly high on cocane when casting the actor's and he most likely has no actual involvement after the casting and marketing so that they can score praise for being Mario.  Illumination is a studio infamous for its garbage movies, the only good one being despicable me 1, and writers from Teen Titans Go are writing this movie.  This film will be garbage and even if Miyamoto is involved in the direction and story, executives are going to make him change shit to make more room for fart jokes.  I sure can't wait for this to be praised as one of the greatest movies of all time, simply for having Mario slapped on it.	1643182988.0	sd0j1q	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0j1q/even_though_the_mario_movie_is_gonna_be_shit/	Even though the Mario movie is gonna be shit, Critics will blindly praise the movie soley for being Mario.
hrxojhws	I'm not talking about when the post is hateful, bigoted, contains threats, or anything like that. I'm saying when all the things have is opinions. Let's say you think yellow and red look beautiful together, but there is a video on YouTube and the title claims yellow and red look ugly together. Why the fuck should you click on the video is all you want to do is complain? But I feel like people are going to think I'm defending hate which I'm not, thats a separate issue, I'm only talking about opinions in general.	1643185578.0	sd16ge	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd16ge/complaining_about_videosposts_you_choose_to_click/	Complaining about videos/posts you choose to click on is stupid
dydi06hj	Articulacy is a soon-to-be thing of the past, as the general population seems to have an exaggerated usage of slang, and it makes you sound incredibly stupid, illiterate, and uneducated. I will absolutely think less of you if you refer to another person as "bro", "brah" and any variation of it, also if you're using "lit/fire" to describe your opinion on a subject matter, you will come across as immature, and your point ends up being discredited as you fail to communicate across the social norm in a formal way.      There are of course exceptions where slang is perfectly fine, but I am referring to sloppy usage of the language, not dialect.   Every generation has its own variation of verbal tics and "like" is clearly one of those.  Slang – a way of speaking that articulates an alternative linguistic culture, I would still want to argue that it's fine on the basketball court but serves to keep its speakers in a linguistic ghetto if used, in – for example – a school classroom, or a job interview. I would want to argue for the importance of understanding that an internationally recognized norm is a must.	1643189116.0	sd205s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd205s/using_slang_makes_you_sound_uneducated_and/	Using slang makes you sound uneducated and ignorant.

1f55wkn4	First: Fuck Vlad, he is munching on that big mental sausage.   But seriously guys. There have been countless articles and news information about Ukraine that were utterly bad worded or plain wrong like jets that were supposed to be send off from the Netherlands to Bulgaria, the UK stating that Russia trying to place a puppet regime with literally no source to back it up or troop movements of big battalions that in reality consist of 90 soldiers. Also the US advising families to leave Kiev because of an imminent threat even though the Ukrainian government stating that the situation is nothing from the ordinary and that everybody should keep it cool.   So if you want to bash on those Putin fanboys, sure go ahead, but at least use sources that aren‘t on RT/Bild level.	1643195567.0	sd3ltd	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd3ltd/reddit_has_a_war_fetish/	Reddit has a war fetish
4k3wyjdc	I know a few couples struggling with fertility and some are near financial ruin trying to conceive a biological child and won’t even consider adoption as an option. I just think about all those children in the system that deserve a lovely home and loving parents that sink through the cracks and are just forgotten. My sister scoffed at me when I asked if that was an option due to her troubles, I know some might not be able to adopt for reasons but the people I know have big houses and lots of empty bedrooms and no criminal records and stuff so they would definitely qualify. It just breaks my heart for those other children left behind for reason out of their control who could have a massive bedroom and plenty of toys because they deserve it.	1643195772.0	sd3no1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd3no1/people_who_only_want_biological_related_children/	People who only want biological related children are shallow.
hxb2lm9c	I hope no one attacks me after this! But I've come to a belief they just don't. I know that there is a difference between a p'do and a child molester, but essentially speaking a p'do will act. It sounds really illogical to say that there are p'dos who don't want to act, who haven't seen any illegal content and don't want to, and who are distressed. I may have understood it wrong - maybe they WANT to act but resist themselves, if that's what makes one then ignore everything I wrote and will write.  If you're attracted to someone, you feel happy thinking about whatever you're thinking about. You may feel guilt and shame but you don't feel anxious or bad about it. You just cannot be attracted to someone and be panicked, upset, and want nothing to do with that person. It leads me to thinking that ''non offenders'' are just people with POCD (a subtype of OCD - hence they are NOT p'dos but fear they are and are distressed by the idea).   I know this may sound controversial but think about it this way - a man/woman loves being around children because they've always been kind and caring, but they start thinking what if they are attracted. Whenever this idea comes up they are terrified, distressed and avoid anything to do with children. They never want to do anything, it doesn't seem pleasant to think about, don't want to search for illegal material, and feel sick at the idea. If they had a choice of being with an adult or a child, they would always pick the adult because the idea of being with a child is terrifying and makes them feel sick and anxious.  You just can't be a p''do and not feel the desire for it. If you don't want to do anything and the idea makes you fearful and distressed, then you just can't be one. If you are resisting some sort of impulses and genuinely are controlling yourself then yes that is different, but if you find the idea repulsive and then feel fear then you just cannot be one.	1643197824.0	sd474b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd474b/nonoffenders_dont_exist/	Non-offenders don't exist
69fklo6e	The education system is literally teaching us how to be workers…   No one escapes the working life, you don’t work, you don’t eat.   We get deluded into thinking life is sweet and responsibility doesn’t exist   We get abruptly thrown into adulthood which consists of working, a lot.   The dread we feel stems from the fact we spent 18 years doing nothing and thought life was a dream.   Those of us who had to work early to support parents flow seamlessly into this role without complaint.   I’m interested in hearing opposing thoughts because this isn’t a fully developed opinion	1643202912.0	sd5q9o	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd5q9o/child_labour_should_be_legal_but_regulated/	Child Labour should be legal, but regulated meticulously.

87uwqj6e	(This is my first time posting to reddit so sorry if I don’t know what I’m doing.)   Don’t get me wrong, they’re right about the history of these studies and many horrible acts did happen (just like in every study, look at psychology or anthropology.) However, many things have changed to make things modern and more sensitive to exploited groups.  To explain, mordern archeology is not grave robbing anymore and there are a number of laws and ethics they have to follow if they find anything. Many of them even work with the groups the artifacts belong to. .   I understand that many groups want they’re artifacts back and I’m by now means saying that museums shouldn’t face their past. So what I think is the best response to this is for museums to work with the groups of these artifacts and come with plans to properly store and preserve them. Who knows, maybe the group feel the artifact is safest in the museum or they want it placed in their own national museums.  Or, many museums have rotating/traveling exhibits so maybe they can create something like that and then more people from all around the world can learn about these cultures.	1643211965.0	sd8xk4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd8xk4/the_museums_are_full_of_stolen_artifacts_crowd/	The “museums are full of stolen artifacts” crowd doesn’t understand how modern museums/archeology works.
dmmks76g	I have taken many psych classes in college and found them to be very interesting. I have also been to multiple therapists and the whole process is just mind-boggling. In the classes you learn that there is this desire to learn about behaviors and mental processes, so that we can better understand people and why they do things. We are basically taught that normal doesn't exactly exist. Anytime I have done therapy, or learned about specific therapies, it is always about altering yourself to fit in with others. It's like people who do screwed up and hurtful things will get told they are doing the best they can and get huge amounts of understanding. If you have a thought process or anything that doesn't fit the status quo, you aren't really given that sane understanding, you are just "forced" to do better for everybody else's sake.	1643212620.0	sd965y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd965y/psychology_merely_attempts_to_alter_a_person_to/	Psychology merely attempts to alter a person to fit in with others
