6kozuib6	So there is this myth that Levant/ Al Sham had no Arabs in it and they are 'Romans descends' we often hear this statement from some Arabs and non arabs . If we look at pre-Islamic Arabic kingdoms , we can Cleary see that Arabs existed in levant before 'Medina / Mecca' Arabs arrived there . Here is some kingdoms you can google or read about.  * Kingdom of Qedar (800BC- 300 BC) Egypt-Jordan-North Saudi Arabia - Parts of Iraq and Syria * Nabataean Kingdom (400BC-100AD) Same as above , reached Syria Damascus (also parts of lebanon / palestine) * Kingdom of Osroene ( 132 BC  - 100/150 AD) : Iraq , Syria , parts of turkey .   (not an arab empire , however, had large arabic communities living there and some of its kings were Arab) * Emesene dynasty : 43BC - Lebanon /Syria * Kingdom of Hatra : 100 AD  North Iraq * Ghassanids : 200 A - 638 AD (located in most of the levant) * Lakhmid : 300-600 AD (Iraq , kuwait and North east Saudi arabia)  There are other instances of Arabs from Syria being roman emperors (like philip the Arab) in addition are many other figures who descended from north Arabia  But i guess this is enough for this post.  Note : The reason I did not include any old empires / kingdoms  from southern Arabia (gulf / yemen) is because I don't think it is relevant to this post. 	1643047496.0	sbsak5	/r/arabs/comments/sbsak5/why_do_we_assume_levant_al_sham_had_no_arabs_in/	Why do we assume levant / Al Sham had no Arabs in it before 7th century?
