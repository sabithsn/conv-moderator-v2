4bms149b	Curious as to what you do for money in this capitalist society. Do you like or hate your job? If we lived in a socialist society where you can have a high standard of living no matter what job you work, would you switch to something else?   I personally wouldn’t bother with education and just work some general labour job that contributes to society, and I’d be quite happy overall. I don’t really have a lot of passions. Most people only go to college to make a higher and more secure salary. Under socialism, there would be less incentive to do that and people would only pursue higher education if it was for something they enjoyed. I think we’d see a much smaller number of people pursuing a post secondary education if we didn’t live in capitalism.	1642648013.0	s88hcq	/r/socialism/comments/s88hcq/what_is_your_current_job_would_you_do_something/	What is your current job?

71e47odx	So i remember that i saw someone saying that Fidel Castro used to say how a long time ago if you were to ask a slave if he ever believed that the current system would change they wouldn't believe it, and then later when it did change if you were to ask a serf if he thought that the system would change and he would also say no. And so if you ask a proletariat if now he thinks the system would change he would also say no therefore the system would probably also change. I clearly remember seeing a quote just phrased differently and I'm pretty sure that i read that it was from Fidel Castro. So does anyone know how exactly the quote went?	1642836098.0	s9wy2i	/r/socialism/comments/s9wy2i/help_with_finding_a_quote/	Help with finding a quote

Buddha rejected hierarchies and brahmin traditions (like priesthood and sacrifice), allowed women to join sangha (community) and teach anyone who was willing, Jesus basically fucking despite rich people and said we should share our possessions. I'm not religious btw but given the historical time period they were kind of radical, it reminds me that we have struggled for egalitarianism and equality since dawn of time.	1642849137.0	sa03ye	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/	Buddha and Jesus were both revolutionary

12pgr6	In today's world, we're still incentivized to compete with each other, to see others as our opponents. We haven't differentiated ourselves from other animals in this regard. Individual's gain is always at the cost of someone else's loss. There is no sense of community. Why can't we thrive together?  Additionaly, competition doesn't make sense from a deterministic standpoint, either. A person is born with certain dispositions which, together with events that occur in his life, decide how capable the person is going to be. Competing in anything is really no different from competing in dice rolling, yet it's the singular thing that decides one's quality of life.  "We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing." -- Charles Bukowski  I'm just an ignorant kid with a pipe dream, but socialism still feels like the most reasonable way of going about things, yet many people seem to repudiate it without a moment's hesitation.	1642930101.0	sapvnu	/r/socialism/comments/sapvnu/isnt_socialism_the_first_step_towards_making/	Isn't socialism the first step towards making people care for each other?

iticuphb	Hi I’m new to the socialist ideology and am starting to show interest in the idea but there is one thing that I’m still curious about, will I be able to enjoy sports cars?  Im not one of those dude bros who wants to buy a flashy car to show off in social media, I personally enjoy the art of speed and drifting, and even enjoy the amount of work and design put into the manufacturing of one. I consider it an art but I feel as if socialism is against cars and I’m violating the ideology by enjoying and learning about cars. Am I in the wrong? Or am I just misinformed?	1642995557.0	sbcbnj	/r/socialism/comments/sbcbnj/will_i_still_be_able_to_enjoy_cars/	Will I still be able to enjoy cars?
