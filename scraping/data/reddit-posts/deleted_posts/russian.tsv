3trllvp4	Hello my dear Russians, I am a guy from the Netherlands, but my parents thought me Russian. I can’t spell really good in Russian so that’s why I type this in English. So, what are some good Russian rappers according to you?	1642363967.0	s5kdrz	/r/russian/comments/s5kdrz/what_are_some_good_russian_rappers/	What are some good Russian rappers?

3kd3yfdw	Sorry if this feels like the laziest post, am in a hurry and couldn't think of any other place to go for assistance :)   The story is as follows:  В конфликтный ситуации, не надо раздражаться.    Должен выражаться спокойно и ясно, не нужно ссориться.    Если конфликт начал, нужно общаться.    Не говорить во время конфликта: "ты виноват, я прав!"    Надо обсуждать с другим человеком, чтобы узнать, в чём дело.    Надо стараться слушать с другим человеком, признаться в своих ошибках и извиняться.    Тогда можно предлагать решение или найти компромисс.    Надо отстоять своё мнение, но тоже прийти к общему мнению и мириться.	1642694215.0	s8m41b	/r/russian/comments/s8m41b/is_this_short_story_grammatically_correct_tysm/	Is this short story grammatically correct?

2y5iebtw	I'm still pretty fresh into learning. I use Memrise and Busuu in tandem and both use "А вы?" when responding to either "Как дела?" or "Как поживаешь?". I'm confused as to why it wouldn't be a singular "А ты"? My only guess is that I've noticed plurals are used when a sense of respect is trying to be addressed to someone, but that doesn't seem right.	1642910539.0	sakm7u	/r/russian/comments/sakm7u/а_вы/	А вы?
4izqwn1a	Hi! I'm from the northwest in America and I work at a float spa. Recently, we've seen a lot of new Russian clients, as I suppose the word is spreading in the community about our services. I find it very interesting that almost all of our Russian clients seem particularly interested and curious regarding our sanitization process and the cleanliness of the facility. We have top notch filters and clean each room extensively between client use, so we've been able to satisfy most questions, but one woman says her brother will have nothing to do with us anyway, since he assumes it simply can't be cleanly enough! I find it amusing and somewhat endearing, that each time I show a room, I am asked question after question about our cleaning process. It has me wondering whether this is a shared concern for people back in Russia? And whether cleanliness is something everybody discusses or is concerned about all the time there? I don't know very much about Russian culture at all, to be honest, and I am so curious. Please inform me!	1642922386.0	sanyms	/r/russian/comments/sanyms/question_about_cultural_values_surrounding/	Question about cultural values surrounding cleanly public places.
e4lo1	Hi, everyone! I've got a question about nuance in Russian. I have no knowledge of Russian at all, so I figured I'd ask the native speakers here. Here we go:  Recently, a Russian speaker started following me on Twitter. They left a comment on one of my screenshots which I felt was kind of uncalled for: "too simple". I told them that the way they phrased their answer could be seen as rude, and they responded with "\[paraphrased: I've taken a lot of these screenshots myself.\] **I'm sorry if I offended you**". Pushing aside the fact that I wasn't asking for critique or feedback, simply posting an image I liked, my question here is about the last line.  If this were an English speaker - either native or near-native- I wouldn't consider this much of an apology since they're not apologising for what they've done. The meaning of this way of phrasing an 'apology' is closer to: "Gosh, you feel that way, huh? Too bad". I don't know how this works in Russian, however, so I would love to know: does the Russian equivalent of the phrase carry the same connotation?  The reason I'm asking is that the person in question says they use Google Translate for a lot of their English communication, so this kind of nuance would be lost on them, but if the same connotation exists in Russian, it may be a different story.  I hope they mean well, but I was a bit stressed out this morning so this comment did not sit well with me. Thanks in advance for any replies and I hope you're all having a lovely weekend. \^\_\^	1642947026.0	saugvr	/r/russian/comments/saugvr/question_about_nuance_im_sorry_if_i_offended_you/	Question about nuance: I'm sorry if I offended you

aqokjnr1	Hi everyone! I'll probably move to Russia in some months and I would really like to learn some Russian before going there. I tried learning it on my own some years ago but I didn't get good results because of a mix of low motivation and way too many materials that resulted in a big mess. Can you recommend me online resources to start with in an organized way? I know that many resources have been mentioned in previous answers but I was wondering what your secret mix is:) If it could somehow help for what concerns advices, I am an Italian native speaker.  My main goal would be to be able to say and understand at least something for what concerns daily life activities  Partially unrelated: if by any chance someone is also learning Italian and is interested, I can help you in exchange for the super basic questions I will have once I start:)	1643795949.0	sikx3o	/r/russian/comments/sikx3o/how_to_start/	How to start?

e68vjpp0	Привет друзья из r/russian!   So, I've been studying the russian language with a friend for a while now (I started taking it serious in december). I've been doing great thus far, and It's been wild to explore this language and, consequently, the russian culture.   I try to study both grammar and vocab at the same time, and my best friends are Anki for vocab and The New Penguin Course for grammar.   However, I still have trouble with the cases. So far I've learned the Prepositional, Accusative and Genitive cases, and I make a lot of mistakes with these. The issue is not knowing *when* to use them, just *how* to do it. I make a lot of mistakes that could be avoided, especially when it comes to adjectives and plurals.  So, I had the idea to use Anki to help me memorize those bad boys. Thing is, I have no idea on how to put them together in a deck. So, have you guys used Anki with this purpose before? Is it helpful?
