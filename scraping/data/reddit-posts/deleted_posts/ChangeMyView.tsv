c8g8pbdr	I wholeheartedly believe that Scotch Eggs are the most efficient food on the Earth right now. For such a small item of food, you get so much. Its basically a mini breakfast that you can keep in your pocket. You can season it and spice it up however you like and completely tailor it to your taste. Not only are the portable and filling, they are also very cheap if you buy them from a shop. I just bought 4 scotch eggs for £1.   They are also pretty easy to make if you are the kind of person who likes to cook things yourself. Last time I made them I think they took 20 minutes to cook which is pretty quick.   They can also be pretty healthy if you decide to bake them instead of frying them. I've never tried it but if you wanted to you could swap out the sausage meat for turkey mince so you have a healthier option.   Idk I love scotch eggs. I'm interested to hear about other efficient foods that I haven't come across. I don't think anything will beat the Scotch Egg though.	1642598878.0	s7q4ej	/r/changemyview/comments/s7q4ej/cmv_scotch_eggs_are_the_most_efficient_food_in/	CMV: Scotch Eggs are the most efficient food in the world.
tmmp5	Sorry for the shitty clickbaity title it's a hard thing to express but let me explain: i think you can either define "masculine" and "feminine" in terms of biology or society. If we do it the first way (ignoring everyone who has biological anomalies such as hermaphrodites, which are rare and represent a justified use of the word intersexual or nonbinary) we say that everyone who can impregnate is a man and everyone who can get pregnant is a woman. Following this, we can ignore anything that is socially constructed upon the concepts of masculinity and femininity, and we can say that for example a man wearing make up and heels is exactly as masculine as one wearing traditional masculine clothing.  If we do it the other way, we can define countless genders based on how much masculine or feminine a person is or is not, but aside from actual biological hermaphrodites which are rare and probably represent less than 1% of people who identify as non binary, what does it actually mean to "feel half female and half male"? To me, if you have a penis but feel female because you like wearing heels and make up you are inherently saying that being a female *means* wearing clothing that is traditionally feminine, and how is this not sexist and contradicting the idea of equality?   If nonbinary people don't actually think this, what do they actually mean by "feeling female" or something? And what about trans people? I think if a man wants to have a vagina and be a female it's fine but if they only wanted to dress or behave in traditionally feminine ways can't they just be men who like make up and dresses? It would be like someone who likes men but doesn't want to be gay so they become a female to be straight women.   What am i missing? Please cmv!  Edit: awarded some deltas, all deltas made me realize the same thing, that my reasoning is correct but society as a whole can't magically be changed just because a different framework would have more sense, so in the meantime people use workarounds that understandably have internal contradictions. Feel free to continue giving insights in the comments, but the cmv can be considered solved and i probably won't reply to most of future comments, thanks to everyone	1642601103.0	s7qtzy	/r/changemyview/comments/s7qtzy/cmv_thinking_theres_more_than_two_genders_is_in/	CMV: thinking there's more than two genders is in itself a social constructs and contradicts gender equality
hx82pzkr	 It is better to have a loving mom and dad and decent extended family relations aka cousins, aunts, uncles than having romantic success. Having a loving family gives you an excellent backbone for the rest of your life. If you are someone blessed with a great partner but a shitty mom and dad and no real family you will always be insecure bc a partner can always cheat (even if you are blessed with an amazing partner you will still have your doubts)but a mom or dad cannot really cheat on you. Having a great mom and dad can also increase happines in childhood and teenhood by a lot and a happy childhood often relates to a happy adult hood.	1642654935.0	s8ar4f	/r/changemyview/comments/s8ar4f/cmv_having_better_luck_in_the_family_you_are_born/	CMV: Having better luck in the family you are born into is better than romantic success
661trcwt	Recently i have found an ongoing trend through social media, there is a sort of stigma against having children when you're young (approximately 25-30 years of age), healthy and unfortunately poor. I argue that people wanting families when they're young is far more responsible than waiting until you're old if money wasnt a factor. People just want something that's natural (a family) in an unnatural system (unfettered capitalism) that punishes them for doing so.  This is how capitalism will consume itself - It is one of the many capitalistic paradoxes. Capitalism is great at producing "stuff". However, to produce said "stuff" it needs a strong workforce. Capitalism needs a strong workforce, yet it punishes those with families and rewards those "work hard, play hard" single types. This of course leads to a decline in families, which leads to a decline in population and workforce, which leads to capitalism imploding on itself.   Capitalism is sustainable, we've managed to make it this far by using it. Correction, Humanistic Capitalism is sustainable. Unfettered/run-away Capitalism, however, is not. When a company has more financial incentives to harm its community than help it, it will destroy its community in the pursuit of profitable gains. The type of capitalism that is indifferent to the natural basic needs of its citizens is doomed to be destroyed by them.  Weve already seen clear signs of unfettered/run-away capitalism; Companies make record profits while a million americans perish to a pandemic. The same companies that made record profits take advantage of ongoing inflation by creating their own counterfeit inflation to even further exploit the already suffering populace while many are also financially struggling. Nurses and doctors fighting off the pandemic are forced to use personal time off to cover for when they get sick to maintain the profitability of their clinic for the CEOs and other executives who treat human life as nothing more than financial gains or detriments. And of course our leaders are bought and sold to the highest bidder.  I could go on forever. The people who have families are not being "irresponsible" (mostly), they're being punished for doing what is natural and the powerful have conned most adults into thinking they have to enslave themselves with a "good" salary to achieve the basic dignity of doing so. All while they casually laugh at us, while theyre earning 900x your base salary to pretend like they're the all knowing captain of the ship.  Edit: here is clarification for the term runaway/unfettered capitalism that I've used. --  "Runaway capitalism" means one big winner in each sector. This is the result of the "frictionless economy" - distance doesn't affect cost much, and organizations can scale to planetary size. It started with shipping containers and faxes, and continued to cloud-based services and the attention economy. So we have Google, Facebook, and Amazon. (China has Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba, but they need the Great Firewall to compete.) The US is down to four big trillion-dollar banks. (Bank #5, the Bank of New York, is about a third the size of #4.) Telecom is consolidating to AT&T and Comcast. These companies act like monopolies. They stop competing on price and influence government and culture instead. While organizations, rather than AIs, they optimize for size and shareholder value. That's runaway capitalism.   Change my view?  TDLR: Capitalism needs a strong workforce, capitalism harms families, families cant afford to have children, capitalism implodes on itself. Having a family isnt wrong, punishing people for having a family is wrong.  (Edit: I looked at this post this morning to see if anyone had any interesting points of view, they didnt. If seems that most comments have devolved into poorly opinionated lock in step regurgitating of points I've already debated. If anyone has anything actually interesting to say I will reply. Otherwise, I have better things to do than get caught up in pointless political ideological battles. My view remains unchanged.)  (Edit: For many who are confused by the term "unfettered/runaway capitalism", I've decide to add something to the end of my post.)  (Edit: Man it's hard to keep up with so much debate hahaha. I'm enjoying the conversation but its...a lot. Not convinced yet! But my responses are going to have to be more delayed. GF is giving me "the look".

7qe6iuic	It’s all in the title. When it comes to the occasional lifting post across my feed from various subs, I almost only see glorification posts of people doing really heavy deadlifts. I am of the view that the Olympic lifts (snatch and C&J) or even a full back squat are far more technically difficult, impressive, and even athletically relevant.  I’ll change my view with some type of argument that speaks to the complexity or training required to perform a high weight deadlift, relative to the other, way cooler lifts out there.	1642790744.0	s9hrkw	/r/changemyview/comments/s9hrkw/cmv_the_deadlift_is_an_uninteresting_lowskill_lift/	CMV: The Deadlift is an uninteresting, low-skill lift

In my experience, coworkers you regularly interact socially with are much easier to deal with.  Heck, me and my team leader bonded over our mutual love of 60s Sci Fi despite their being a 40 year age gap.

5dkg4	Disclaimer: I’ve never owned an NFT and don’t plan to own one soon. This isn’t an attempt to play devil’s advocate; I genuinely disagree with most arguments I’ve seen online about the uselessness of NFTs.  The execution of introducing NFTs to the public has been absolutely awful for many reasons. Almost everyone involved, buyers and sellers alike, have very obviously got in with the hopes of making an easy profit. Associating art with the underlying crypto marketplace was an incredibly stupid decision. No, a poorly drawn image of a monkey is not worth anything to the vast majority of people. Let’s move past that.   I began to question my own perceptions of NFTs after seeing [this TikTok.](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdrWWmaL/) I can’t remember where I saw it, but the image was sold as an NFT after the video went viral. This is an example of something perfectly suited to be an NFT:  1. Not easily replicated with a screenshot   2. Can only exist in a digital format   3. Not created with the obvious intent to be sold quickly (think AI generated monkey NFTs)  If an NFT follows the rules listed above, then it completely avoids most of the gripes most people have with the current state of NFTs.  Looking at the argument that NFTs are innately useless from a technical standpoint (that having “ownership” of a piece of media means nothing); it seems like that argument isn’t unique to digital art at all. I can find millions of photos of The Mona Lisa online; does this devalue the original painting? No, because there’s likely several ways to verify that the true Mona Lisa is authentic. Why can’t something like that exist for the digital space?  People seem to gloss over the fact that society already places a premium on the authenticity of physical artwork. If a $1 million painting thought to be made by Pablo Picasso is revealed to be made by some nobody, the value of the painting would instantly drop. Nothing about the art has changed; we just associate authenticity with high value. So to me, it kinda seems illogical that someone would dislike NFTs specifically for this reason when the problem is with art as a whole.	1642812381.0	s9ptkg	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/	CMV: there’s nothing inherently wrong with NFTs outside of the awful execution of them
fj3tzmjp	In my view, the greatest shoe is the shoe that maximizes value over cost. For example, a great shoe, such as the adidas ultra boost, has seemingly high cost of 300 bucks, but value is far higher in terms of durability, comfort and fashionability. For adidas ultra boost, really really high value / high cost = great shoe.  &#x200B;  The Croc is a game changer. These shoes are like 10 bucks, but these are some of the most durable and adaptable shoes on the whole market. You can sprint and play backyard sports in these things. They also double as sandals, shower shoe, you name it! And to top it all off, they're probably better for your posture/gait than adidas ultra boost, since walking on a cloud isn't necessarily good for your feet.... The only thing you should definitely not use Crocs for is working in a shop environment where you may drop something heavy on your toes. But the same goes for ultra boost.   &#x200B;  While the croc is not so fashionable, it is exceptionally functional, and exceedingly inexpensive. This is why Croc is greatest shoe ever made.  &#x200B;   For Croc, really really high value / really really low cost makes it greatest shoe ever made	1642820480.0	s9sg7w	/r/changemyview/comments/s9sg7w/cmv_the_croc_is_the_greatest_shoe_ever_made/	CMV: The Croc is the greatest shoe ever made
iexro413	Meaning, for example you're a man and a woman in a relationship, and (besides the man she's in a relationship with) the woman is only allowed to have sex with other women, and the man is only allowed to have sex with other men.  I'm bi and this is a super unpopular opinion in the bi community, and I don't understand why.  Let's say my boyfriend was really into a super specific fetish that I was not. Or natural redheads, or whatever. What would be so wrong about saying, "honey, it's fine that you want cock and ball torture once in a while, even though I can't provide that for you. But it would sting a little if you vanilla fucked some other girl you met at a bar just because she was pretty and available, so please don't".  I think the above boundary (you're bi, you miss same-sex or opposite-sex or non-binary sex once in a while, so you can have sex with a gender your romantic partner is not) is perfectly reasonable and unless you're against monogamy and "jealousy management" in general, I don't see how it's logical to be against that.  **Common rebuttals:**  *"It's just jealousy, they should learn to control it".* Again, unless you're against monogamy in general (and even poly people usually *do* in fact take measures to not make one or more of their partners feel jealous), I don't see how this isn't hypocritical. People have all kinds of boundaries in their relationships, why is this one so bad? Why should they "learn to control it" and other people shouldn't?  *"It often comes from a biphobic place. For example a man who thinks lesbian sex is hot, and women aren't threathening to the relationship because deep down women crave dick, but would feel threathened by another man having sex with his girlfriend".* I agree. It often does. This does not mean it always does and that non-biphobes in this arrangement should be punished for biphobes'/sexists' actions.   *"It perpetuates bi stereotypes"* yes, and gay men being feminine perpetuates gay male stereotypes. But gay men should still be allowed to be feminine, shouldn't they?  *"You should be 100% sexually compatible with your partner"* why? If both are okay with only being 98% compatible, then who are you to say that's inherently unhealthy?  *"Bi people who feel this way are poly and should not be in monogamous relationships"* what people are really saying when they say this is that they're against "monogamish" agreements (like either you're 100% on board with multiple deep romantic relationships at a time, or you should be completely monogamous). I'm curious to hear why?	1642859553.0	sa2yzi	/r/changemyview/comments/sa2yzi/cmv_its_okay_to_be_in_an_open_relationship_where/	CMV: It's okay to be in an open relationship where you're only allowed to have sex with a specific gender
11g6h8	While I think the concept is interesting, like many others, I don't appreciate what NFTs have become and the hype around them, and how NFT owners are acting like they are amazing - while they aren't.  But I don't understand why people are acting like it's a horrible non-sensible pyramid scheme, and not simply dumb just like modern art.  In my mind it's the perfect analogy, but opinions online seem to make it out to be much worse.  - Both are only worth something because someone paid for it. - Both can be made by anyone and don't require any talent. - Both are used for money laundering/status symbols and not actually for art. - Both are easily reproducible.	1642876681.0	sa8y0a	/r/changemyview/comments/sa8y0a/cmv_nfts_arent_any_different_than_modern_art/	CMV: NFTs aren't any different than modern art
8sq3v	I developed this view during some title IX training a few years ago, but it's come up again for work.  My view is that you should not have to continuously tolerate someone you don't get along with for whatever reason. Such reasons can include:  1.)They are socially awkward in an untenable way. I.E. They drag morale down when they are around, they constantly start bickering at every chance, when they "get going" it's hard to stop them etc.  2.)You should not have to deal with people who are aggressive or passive aggressive towards you at any point in time.  3.)They don't have good boundaries, I.E. you invite them for drinks one time and they drink too much and you never invite them over again because you don't want to babysit or clean up vomit or w/e.    If downstream of that, your mutual friends spend less time with such a person, that's not bullying either. This is what I would consider to be klout/connections or social pressures. If you are valued higher by your friend group and they migrate toward you and stop spending time with this other hypothetical person I fail to see that as bullying. Especially if you are not complicating things by making statements like "If you hang out with them, I won't hang out with you" or things along those lines.   I hold this view because I don't think you should have to continuously subject yourself to misery in social settings to make nice. While that is a *skill* it's also a skill to know when to steer clear of actors you're incompatible with. It's simply a mentally healthy thing to do.  Finally, I think labeling such behavior as bullying creates [*Missing Stairs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair) anyway, which seems like a much greater social offense than just being honest with the person you want nothing to do with.	1642912286.0	sal5ni	/r/changemyview/comments/sal5ni/cmv_not_inviting_someone_to_stuff_or_having/	CMV: Not inviting someone to stuff, or having interpersonal klout/connections that lead to them being ostracized via social pressures is not bullying.

13mao47a	*First, I am not on the boat that says "everything can be learnt on the internet or on the job, away with universities." I think that university offers many benefits that aren't easy to get anywhere else including the opportunity for networking, mentorship, extra-curricular activities, various forms of support,  being taught people who actively research their field, and access to special equipment, facilities and resources that only a university can afford to provide,*   *Btw, I'm mainly focusing on undergraduate degrees and maybe also postgraduate degrees that don't belong to law school or medical school - as these are practices and I can only assume that everything taught here is relevant to the job.  However, where I'm from, you can get into law school or medical school through an exam. The exams have an undergrad degree requirement (ANY degree), and I think my perspective can be applied there.*  **It should become established practice to study at uni and receive government loans on a course by course basis without the inane requirement of completing a degree with a particular university** **- as if taking individual courses is absolutely worthless if you don't do them in a particular set of 24/32 that constitutes a particular 3/4 year degree.**   **This will have a series of positive educational and economic effects:**  1. Students will be there because they WANT to be there. Not because the course is compulsory for the degree they are enrolled in regardless of, student preparedness, interest, course quality and employability of skills gained etc. They will take greater responsibility for their learning, hence achieving higher grades and learning more.  2. Teachers will have a classroom full of enthusiastic students. We like to blame teachers for a bad educational experience, but imagine having to face and teach a classroom full of students with little interest in the subject that the lecturer is actually passionate about,  treats the subject like a chore and asks zero questions. 3. Students further benefit from the individualism that comes with greater freedom. They elect their courses, so they explore their interests, diversify their skills and knowledge, carve a path towards a career for themselves that they are more likely to stick to (guided by experienced mentors that they will all but have to seek out or they'll feel very lost very quickly - I personally think mentorship is enormously important for success and should be a pillar of tertiary education). 4. Bad courses will be eliminated as the students begin to consider reviews of a course by other students before choosing to enrol. Courses that don't get enough enrolments will naturally die. Good courses will be rewarded with higher enrolments and revenue. 5. The price of a course will be determined by supply and demand as students can take a course on a subject they are interested in from ANY university they wish as they are not bound to complete a degree with a particular university. This will likely lead to a drop in the price of courses on average. Good courses will have a higher price of course, but you'll get what you pay for (see point 4).  6.  Eliminating the fixed price of courses and the degree-loan system will eliminate economic inefficiencies:  *  There are huge dropout rates of up to [40%](https://educationdata.org/college-dropout-rates) in the US. With the degree system, a dropout's entire tertiary education goes unrecognised even if they've completed a significant portion of a degree and could probably be qualified for an entry-level job in their field with what they've learnt. This represents a loss of skilled labour. * A high percentage of graduates don't enter into the field they completed their degree in. In the US, this figure was [63%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/). Without the degree-loan system, this would figure would significantly drop and people would be better poised to contribute to the industry they enter (see points 1 and 3). Another hit to skilled labour. * Lower loans and debt. The government essentially gambles with taxpayer dollars when they provide loans on degrees, they expect each student to benefit enough from the degree to get an economically productive, stable and well-paying job that will allow them to repay the debt. However, in the US, [10%](https://educationdata.org/student-loan-default-rate) of graduates default on their student loans which represent billions of dollars in defaulted loans. Without the degree-loan system, the price of each course will be lower (see point 5) and the number of subjects they complete will likely decrease but will be up to the individual's future plans (see point 3) and the better education (points 1 and 4) will lead to higher-skilled workers that can contribute more to industry and are generally better paid. Hence, lowering student loans, loan default rates, and an increase in "GDP- improvement-to-student-loan-ratio". Freed up tax dollars can go to other things.  I'm not hating on universities for operating like businesses - I mean that's pretty much how any large organisation can hope to operate in the world.  My issue with them is short-sightedness. I think the reason they stick to the degree-loan scheme is the shortsighted need to guarantee a fixed and significant amount of revenue from each student that enrols with them.	1642946321.0	sau87z	/r/changemyview/comments/sau87z/cmv_university_loans_should_be_able_to_be_taken/	CMV: University loans should be able to be taken out against individual courses, the concept of (undergraduate) degrees should be abolished.
cltponzq	This is specifically in regards to anyone that’s known by the public. For instance, take a celebrity. To say that all publicity is good publicity for a celebrity just isn’t true. If a famous person’s name is trending and being talked about in the spotlight for something they’ve done good in their career or something they did positive to impact a person or situation, of course this is good publicity. But let’s say that same person goes and does a criminal act, or in involved in a situation that brings a negative light towards them and his/her brand, this would be a example of bad publicity. Which is why I’m saying, all publicity isn’t good publicity, that saying just isn’t true. If one wants to take the approach that as long as ones named is being talked about, that’s all that matters and it’s always good, I don’t agree with that. I feel there are times where there is good publicity with situations, and they are times where there are bad publicity for certain situations.

s44shi	when a person sues it is (usually and should be) over a claim of violated rights. the idea that a person should be able to sue over libel and slander is based upon the idea that a person owns their reputation and that their reputation is being harmed by lies.  i assert that you don't actually own your reputation. your reputation exists in the minds of other people and you cannot own the minds of other people or demand, with any legitimate authority, that they think one way or another about you.   a secondary point that is less crucial is that the laws to protect a person's reputation from lies is not even necessary. the reason why we use those laws is that we have, to some degree, become dependent upon the government to tell us what we should think about things. if the government wasn't involved in shaping our minds we would do more to fact-check what people say ourselves.   when a person or company is caught lying we would not believe them or trust them with future data, nor would we be as likely to patronize them or their businesses. in this way the people are capable of responding to libel and slander, independently, free of government.	1642983904.0	sb8dxm	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8dxm/cmv_you_shouldnt_be_able_to_sue_over_liable_and/	cmv: you shouldn't be able to sue over liable and slander.
ad2ipf3u	First reason being that its very difficult to jerk off when your hand can't wrap the whole way around which results in having to pick which side of the penis you're trying to stimulate. And anyone whose ever used a banana peel or something similar to masturbate knows how important it is for  a "closed circle" stimulation to occur all around the penis instead of just on whatever side the palm is facing. Hmm interesting how a banana peel resembles the very skin that was naturally there to begin with. Only for it to be removed when I was born WITHOUT MY CONSENT.   The foreskin is living mucosa tissue. Circumcision permanently exposes this living tissue to the air and this causes what is known as keratin to form on the surface of the skin. Not to mention the constant stimulation of all the nerve endings from walking and moving around causing hedonic adaption of the exposed nerves to increase the threshold needed for the nerve endings to register a signal, which is why so many people jerk off with too tight of a grip, or even go to lengths like using banana peels to jerk off.	1642987185.0	sb9j0i	/r/changemyview/comments/sb9j0i/cmv_circumcision_at_birth_causes_permanent/	CMV: Circumcision at birth causes permanent desensitization and should not be allowed unless absolutely necessary.

It’s calories, I don’t enjoy it and even 2 honestly leaves me so much weaker the next day. Sometimes if it went to even as little as 3 (full stomach, water, vitamins and all) I’d still be puking the next day. My body physically cant handle. I don’t think I have a problem, and in stating my past drinking I’m just trying to say I did all the partying I needed to. Looking back, college is a funny way to say alcoholic.   Went to brunch with my friend from the Midwest in NYC today and she was so patronizing so unable to see WHY on earth I’d want to quit drinking (after she tells me about how her boyfriend pukes on himself Everytime he drinks, and she had to drag him Out of a wedding, he had to walk down the street shirtless and when she was holding his puke covered shirt- she puked). She kept asking if I had a problem why didn’t I come to her, like I lived for a glass of wine by myself at night (I don’t do this, I would only have them socially). Like I was a second from tipping over the fckn wagon.   Now I’m seeing all this weird culture of moms and their “mommy juice” “rosé all day” type of liquor memes, we keep passing around and it gives me the CRINGE. Liquor gives me the cringe. But with her it seems I’ve broken our unspoken social contract, where when we go out we’ll get fucked up.. and I’m just as fun on nothing at all, I truly am.   She was trying to tell me maybe I could still just have a few and try some vitamins, those have helped her with hangovers… but hangovers are your bodies way of telling you something is WRONG. Am I the only one that sees this as if someone’s asking me why I can’t drink poison every weekend because me not drinking makes her uncomfortable? Makes her have to question her relationship to alcohol. Why am I made to feel like this is my last time hanging out with her and like I am the one with the huge problem because I quit. I think she has the huge problem. Thoughts?

p4dsm	Let me preface this with 2 things:  1) I have asthma. Specifically exercise induced asthma. I know what it does to your body and how hard it can make running (specifically the breathing portion).  2) I'm not saying asthma doesn't affect your running. It absolutely does. Asthma can absolutely be the reason you may never be a competitive runner.  That said, I have asthma and have known many many people with it. Many of them, like me, are active and can play sports or run to varying degrees of competitiveness. Every single person I know who has ever said they can't run (or do other cardio or intensive sports) because of asthma, without fail, has been out of shape and almost always overweight.  Asthma absolutely makes running harder. My lungs are on fire after a run in ways those without asthma can't fathom. And when I have had an extended sedentary period of little to no exercise, the next few runs are torture. **But**. It gets better with time. Cardio improves heart and lungs, which helps with your asthma. If you exercised more, asthma would be what limits your potential and slows your growth, but not the reason you can't run.  **Tldr**; Asthma impedes your running (especially your upper limit and improvement times), but the reason you "can't run" is simply because you don't do it.	1643008026.0	sbg3dd	/r/changemyview/comments/sbg3dd/cmv_the_reason_you_cant_run_isnt_asthma_its/	CMV: The reason you can't run isn't asthma, it's because you're out of shape.
h30mpe0x	Hi so this isn’t to argue that astrology is real, or that evidence for it exists.  My view is that, say, we pulled up info on every adulterer in the US. We have a magical database that magically records tens of millions of people. And one attribute of that dataset was their ‘birth sign’. If birth sign x has significantly more than 8.333….% occurrences, this would more or less prove segments of astrology to be fact.  The only caveat I see is that some months may have an affinity for more or less babies to be born. This would mean we would have to adjust the percentages that should make up 12 twelfths of all the birth signs.  TLDR; if an ideology claiming your birth month may determine behavior as an adult is false, there should be a pretty much equal distribution of birth months along individuals with distinguishing behaviors in all examples.	1643029417.0	sblrig	/r/changemyview/comments/sblrig/cmv_seeing_a_correlation_in_data_between_birth/	CMV: Seeing a correlation in data between ‘birth signs’ and general behavioral patterns counting for unequal babies born every month would immediately prove a causation for astrology
62kyxam2	The ONLY reason Americans' still have to file taxes is because tax filing services have lobbied congress to prevent laws from going into place allowing for automatic filing. ~~This rotten corps of a democracy gets worse every time you think about it.~~  It's really simple how to fix this.  1. The government sends employers updated tax brackets and they take out all the taxes accordingly. Which is already done.  2. The IRS and state/local tax collection agencies send you a receipt with the math and allow you to check it.  3. You either do nothing or go online and fix their math. Getting your return.

59pv59dq	Women's sports, and trans people in them, is a pretty common topic here. There more I look into it, the more it seems like the problem isn't trans people, but rather women's sports.     Women should be able to play sport and have fun with it, but as it becomes about winning, things get messy. So maybe women's elite level sports, like the Olympics, or women's leagues like the WNBA, don't really have a place.     Firstly, gender is a spectrum and the idea of splitting anything into binary gender categories is outdated. Society gathering around binary gendered institutions probably isn't good for non binary people.     Secondly there's no actually physical differences between the categories. There are gender differences between cis men and women, but that's not all there is. Choosing "hormones" is arbitrary as there are trans people who aren't on hormones.     These issues will only become more apparent with time and society increases its acceptance of trans people beyond narrow transmedicalist definitions.  &#x200B;  I see the arguments about women needing role models or something to aspire to as they enjoy their sport. But sports people aren't good role models as the average person can't actually aspire to be an elite athlete. Plus all the performance enhancing drugs make things tricky there.     It also seems like society won't actually miss women's sports all that much, given the lack of support women's sports leagues get. If we're looking for a second tier of sports, there's better and less ambiguous ways to do it than hormone expression (e,g, age, or the paralympics).	1643037966.0	sbonhl	/r/changemyview/comments/sbonhl/cmv_competitive_womens_sports_are_untenable_in_an/	CMV: Competitive women's sports are untenable in an era of trans and non binary acceptance, so we should do away with the women's sports competitions.
9gphfw6b	(disclaimer- I'm speaking from United States)   I know that we have a lot of programs and assistances for those who need help, but I don't feel that those do enough to help the vulnerable.  I can't help but feel like we view vulnerable populations like expendible people who deserve less in life. Whether it's because of age, health, disability, age, race, gender, sexuality, religion, or whatever else, the vulnerable should be protected. Not that we actually believe that these people are lesser, but it's as if we treat them as less.  In fact, the vulnerable deserve more attention and care, not less, than the average person. Their vulnerable state means they should be protected, not just trampled over.  I know that humanity has some sense of competition, greed, and selfishness built in, but we oftentimes seek our own self-interest at the expense of others. But those who have more privilege should use their privilege not just for their own interests, but also to help those who do not have the same privilege. We shouldn't view life as a race to the top and survival of the fittest, but more of a cooperative effort sort of thing where we're only as good as our linkest link.  I don't know where we would draw the line of how much we should have a responsibility to help others, and I'm hesitant to say that we have an absolute duty to help others if we're capable because that gets morally complicated really quick, but in general, we should be less selfish and more willing to help others at our own expense.	1643048740.0	sbsrxr	/r/changemyview/comments/sbsrxr/cmv_we_should_be_protecting_the_vulnerable_not/	CMV: we should be protecting the vulnerable, not taking advantage of them

But when it comes down to it if you dress a certain way you will receive certain attention. You can’t get mad at people for sexualizing you if you are wearing sexual clothes. Now some people will sexualize you no matter what you wear. But if you’re gonna wear something don’t be shocked at the reaction. When someone wears something sexual regardless of age it doesn’t take away the sexual meaning. People shouldn’t sexualize minors but that doesn’t mean they won’t.

c92q9	First, let me say that I am not an anti-vaxxer and not anti-mask.  I am fully vaxxed and boosted and generally follow the guidelines put forth, so this post isn't coming from a anti-vax cult point of view.  The CDC has been wrong every step in the COVID crisis.  Being wrong is understandable since the virus is new and they have to make predictions based on limited to no data.  But they have been wrong on everything, in big ways, and in some cases have not come out and changed guidelines based on their errors in thinking.  Friday, March 13, 2020 we heard "two weeks to flatten the curve".  It seemed reasonable.  Let's flatten the curve and then we will get back to normal.  Well, that didn't work out.  Not even close.  Two years later, here we are.  The CDC told us not to wear masks, which made absolutely no logical sense to begin with.  Then wear masks.  Then two masks. There was even recommendations to wear masks outdoors at one point.  The N95 mask is the only good mask.  Then the KN95 is okay too.  Even today, I challenge anybody to read their message on masks [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) and come away with a clear recommendation.  Even with the news giving conflicting guidance on masks, the CDC hasn't come out with clear direction on their web page to clean up the confusion.  The six feet of social distancing comes from influenza guidance because the flu is mostly transferred via drops and not aerosolized.  By June of 2020, the CDC had data that showed that COVID is transferred mostly via aerosolized droplets, which means you are no safer at 1 foot than you are at 20 feet.  They knew this, but businesses were still constrained, by law or corporate rule, to do away with revenue or stay closed because of the 6 foot rule.  This data also suggested in early 2020 that cloth and procedure masks were essentially worthless.  With regard to reopening, Texas was widely criticized for going against federal guidelines and opening up "too soon".  Yet there is no data to show that the states who opened up "too soon" ended up with more COVID cases per capita because of it compared to states that stayed in lockdown.  As cases in Texas stayed low after opening "too soon", there was no acknowledgement of error allowing other states to also open up.  When vaccines rolled out, the CDC didn't prioritize people who hadn't already been sick with COVID.  Everybody was to get the vaccine, and we were told that the fact that we already had COVID wouldn't protect us.  However, data from the Delta variant surge has now shown that people who had previously contracted COVID but unvaccinated were more protected than people who never had COVID but were fully vaccinated.  The vaccines in the early days should have absolutely been offered to those who had never had COVID to protect the maximum number of people.  The CDC has completely ignored the fact that recovering from COVID in the past puts you at extremely low risk for hospitalization due to a new infection.  Then Omicron lead to three conflicting story lines from the CDC.  Some were saying that at some point, nearly everybody would get omicron.  There was also new recommendations by some that everybody wear N95 or KN95 masks at all time indoors.  Finally, it was said that Omicron was much less severe than earlier variants and unlikely to result in serious illness for most.  (In fact, far more people were hospitalized by Omicron but ICUs were at a far lower capacity than with earlier surges)  The reality is that if everybody is going to get Omicron at some point *and* previous infections are extremely valuable in fighting off COVID in the future *and* that Omicron is unlikely to be serious then the CDC should actually hope the entire population is exposed to Omicron right after their round of boosters.  If you are saying there is near 100% chance of somebody catching a disease, then why wouldn't you want them to catch it when their immune systems are protecting them the most and when the variant is mild?  Suddenly wearing the N95 virtually guarantees that we will get it further from our booster or with a worse variant if everybody is going to get it anyways.  We need a CDC that gives clear, easy to understand guidelines.  We need a CDC that evolves guidelines when new data becomes available, but not give whiplash that isn't covered by clear data.  When guidelines change, we need a CDC that can clearly say, "we recommended this, but data has shown that we were wrong and need to now recommend that" and make it super-clear on the web site.  We also need a CDC that engages only in science and stops the political sparring with the Republicans who want to demonize them.  In reality, the CDC has made themselves very easy targets and I don't think anybody truly trusts them on COVID at this point.	1643059665.0	sbwzd7	/r/changemyview/comments/sbwzd7/cmv_cdc_leadership_should_be_summarily_fired_and/	CMV: CDC leadership should be summarily fired and competent leadership put in place
3i8j0bav	I understand this is a touchy subject but please bear with me and hear me out.   For starters, no I'm not Black but I am a POC. I grew up in a barrio (basically a hood but for Mexicans) with a small Black and White population. I only say this because since I can remember, most of us were saying it and it was never a problem, even if it was White people saying it in front of Black people. Looking back, it seemed to be more of a privilege you had depending on your economic status, not so much your race.    However, in today's sensitive climate, the word has become more exclusionary and you can easily be subject to being canceled for saying it if you're not Black, as we saw with Morgan Wallen (who mind you, wasn't saying it in a derogatory way at all)   Herein lies the dilemma because 'nigga' has become a term of endearment and can be used to REFER to anybody (think the movie Ted 2 when the Black cashier is referring to a White couple as "those 2 White niggas") and it's also in just about every hip-hop song there is where it's not used in a derogatory way. Of course, it CAN be made derogatory by adding the 'hard r' which I do find very offensive to the point that I don't even feel comfortable typing it out. There's also been some hip-hop artists who aren't Black but have used it in their music anyways like SPM, Fat Joe, Immortal Technique etc., and if I'm not mistaken, many POC in NYC especially use it liberally and it's not a problem.    Nonetheless, I don't believe its a word that only POC in NYC or rappers should get to use without repercussions, but rather everyone should be allowed to use it considering that although it's a 'cuss word' it's become a term of endearment and is not derogatory. There's obviously a time and place for profanity so I'm not saying that use of this word should never go unpunished, I'm just saying it's a bit backwards to punish someone for using ANY word solely because of the color of their skin while another group gets to say it with zero consequences.   With that being said, I've realized that it's much more likely that a POC will say it than a White person would. I understand the logic too, after all there is a long history of the White man oppressing POC so the context changes dramatically when White people use the word. My argument though, is that if this word is off limits to one particular group of people, it should be off limits to everybody. And even if we were all to collectively agree that everybody EXCEPT White people can use this word, I would still find that to be regressive and hypocritical. I'm of the mindset that the only way to move past our disgustingly racist history is to learn to see beyond skin color and treat everybody equally and with humanity.    So where am I wrong?

12dehk	I live in eastern europe, grew up with Israeli propaganda in the news "let's feel bad about this nation being attacked by 'terrorists' " without going too much in detail.   And after I got older I learned/read about it. The thing is, this conflict doesn't affect me in any shape or form. Israelis doing genocide to Palestinians is the same as China doing genocide to Ughyurs. I consider it bad and the least I can do is learn about it, but in the end it won't affect me personally.   My problem is that, compared to China, we don't have so many Chinese people pushing their propaganda in the west, how the genocide wasn't real, how Ughyurs are doing better now, how China deserved to do that and so on..  I saw many Israelis and non Israelis being 100% convinced on their pro Israel views while pushing propaganda or when discussing about it on their subreddit. Anyone who doesn't agree with them is either uneducated on the matter or learned from "Palestinian propaganda".   They use the same talking points and they believe those are the "cold hard facts" that shows Israel is in the right. I'll go over them now.   1. "Israel haven't done / isn't doing genocide"  Many scholars from around the world have agreed that what Israel did at the start of the war and then continued doing through killing and displacement is genocide. People who specialize on this matter agreed on this.   [Here is a source (link for pdf)](https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/Background%20on%20the%20term%20genocide%20in%20Israel%20Palestine%20Context.pdf)  Israelis use a cheap and flashy argument that the Palestinian population is growing -now-. But that doesn't hold value on how many they killed and for what reason.   2. "Israel deserved to 'reclaim'(conquer) the land because of Zionism / aka their ancestors lived there"  We don't even need to go back to history to say this argument means nothing (I still went but I won't go into it here).  It doesn't matter if your ancestors lived on a land hundreds or thousands of years ago. Other people ended up living on it for generstions, built on it, made their lives on it. And are currently living on it.  Your ancestors had a right "to reclaim it" right after they lost it, you coming back thousands of years later means nothing. It means conquering it back.  Palestinians just lost their land. Ironically they have the moral right to claim their land that they just lost.   So this argument doesn't mean anything but they keep using like it gives them a moral high grown for doing atrocities to conquer land.    3. "Jews needed a nation"  If you are wealthy enough and powerful enough to get US on your side and be able to start a war I believe most of your people were doing fine enough.   They could have mass migrated to a nation/territory, even palestine. But no, they wanted a nation only of jews. They wanted that territory cleansed only for them. Run by them. That's why they conquered the land. Greed.  If they wouldn't have done that they would have lived just fine without making another population live through hell.    4. "The west is against Israel / there is a lot of Palestinian/Hamas propaganda"  I feel most annoyed by this argument.   Israel is the rich and powerful side in this conflict. They have US on their side. They can afford to pay media, silence experts, push propaganda. They have their wealthy kids studying abroad pushing propaganda wherever they go and debate on the internet.  Can Palestinian peasants do that? Really? Then Hamas is pushing propaganda in the west? One faction who is painted badly everywhere as a terrorist group? Really? Hamas can only push propaganda on their own people. Only Israel can afford to do more than that.  The only "propaganda" we get about palestine in the west is the reality of the events, which Israel can't completely downplay. The events are so bad that no amount of power can hide them.    5. "What's happening now to Israel is bad, Hamas is bad, Palestinians taking their land back is bad"  There is this argument that because Israelis settled in (not fully, they are still doing displacement and stealing homes) there shouldn't be any fight from Palestinians. Any if they would take their land and homes back it would be as bad as Israel taking them in the first place.  I find this argument insane.  Palestinians have all the right to fight back, they just lost their land and lives. They have all the moral ground here to do so.  The hamas faction, even if they are doing atrocities, have all the right to fight back and rain rockets on the city.  The Israeli people cannot cry about it or take a moral ground. They choose to keep conquering the land / settle on the unsafe land. Put their kids in danger. They choose that. Palestinians had nothing and were forced to start from nothing.   "What about the kids who were born in Israel, do they deserve anything?" Ask that from their parents. They chose to make them and raise them on just conquered land.  It's very convenient for Israelis that a faction started fighting back, that gives them excuses through mental gymnastics to continue doing their atrocities and consider Palestinians -as a whole- even more subhuman.  [One small interview](https://youtu.be/1e_dbsVQrk4)    I think this is enough covering, I can respond more in the comments.  I think I got my point across. I truly can't comprehend how someone who lives in the west who has nothing to do with the conflict looks at it and chooses the conqueror and believes they are in the right.  That's why I came here to get some answers.	1643112886.0	sccd93	/r/changemyview/comments/sccd93/cmv_the_israelis_arent_in_the_right_and_they_are/	CMV: The Israelis aren't in the right and they are pushing a lot of propaganda on reddit, on the media and in real life.

2vycztd9	Some people may be offended by my view but this is my genuine view and mean no offense. Please let me know if I am missing something/ how I am wrong. Honestly I don't really understand what's the point of relationships or friendships and mostly seem like a waste of time.  Thank you!   &#x200B;  Relationships have 2 main offerings.  1. “Partnership” i.e. someone to talk to, share burdens etc. 2. Improved Sex Flow i.e. similar to smoothing your cashflow, relationships allow you to have a sexual partner on retainer  Here’s why there are better options  Partnerships are the payday loan of mental strength and resilience. Why is this? Partnership solves a problem you should not have. An individuated righteous man or someone on the path to becoming one should be able to deal with any mental or physical burdens on their own, it is hard, but it is necessary if you wish to become an individuated man. Your own inner mind is the most interesting and powerful object on this planet. Instead of using another person or crutch, enter your own mind, pay attention to everything you do, say, & think. Analyze why you feel what you feel. Notice the different personalities in your mind and start to fortify, mature, & individuate. The taller the building the greater the foundation must be.  And if you choose to use a crutch you will pay dearly in loss of freedom, time, & money. You will spend time talking to the person which could have been used on other tasks, you will lose money on dates, gifts, missed opportunities, and heaven forbid you get married and become successful, you’ll then have gambled 50% of your life’s work on a coin toss. Most tragically you’ll lose a large amount of freedom which is any human’s most valuable resource.  Secondly sex:  This one is easy, a women’s sexual peak is around 21 and begins to taper off after 25, while man’s sexual fitness slowly increases over time and peaks at round 40-50. Essentially women are buying low sell and selling high. They try to trap you while you're young and have a fairly low sexual fitness and will then divorce you once you have accrued wealth and their asset has devalued, it's basically an investment. Don’t let that happen to you, let your sexual fitness reach maturity, you will have access to much higher quality sexual partners and you will retain your wealth.  Don’t fall for the trap, your monkey mind will trick you into replicating and hot women will try to seduce you into hunkering down, don’t sell early, don’t listen to the sirens call.

It’s made people obsessed about the act to the point where they drop everything else around them.   Had a friend not attend me and my friends birthday party because he was too busy getting his dick wet. If you care about sex that much, why even have friends if you prioritise sex over your friendships?   Then the same dudes who prioritise sex, come back crawling to their friends for emotional support when they break up. Shows you how spineless these people actually are.   People have sex because they enjoy it, [which isn’t a problem], the issue is when you abandon everyone else around you because you prioritise sex over your friendships.    No one’s asking you to put your bros at the no1 of your priority list, but at least have balance in your social life.   If you choose to abandon your friendships because you’re too busy getting your dick wet, then handle your fucking breakups alone.   CMV with a valid argument, and tell me why I shouldn’t think someone isn’t a POS horrible person when they abandon their friendships because they care about getting their dick wet.	1643137330.0	scl51f	/r/changemyview/comments/scl51f/cmv_if_you_sacrifice_your_friendships_and/	CMV: If you sacrifice your friendships and relationships over sex, you are a horrible person.
ea2k4ajx	I feel like it's important to bring this up, since Taiwan and Ukraine are fear porn topics for the MSM. I have never understood how Americans (really westerners in general) get afraid over the idea of a foreign nation taking over the US government, it's irrational and simply will never happen. Prior to the age of ICBMs, invading and conquering another nation was an immense task (still is now), even if you won, you had the liability of babysitting an entire population of people. There is no scenario in which a country like China or Russia would even want to take over the United States, there is not only nothing of value for them, but controlling nearly 350 million people is something no one can do.	1643141924.0	scmvdm	/r/changemyview/comments/scmvdm/cmv_fear_of_being_invaded_and_occupied_by_a/	CMV: Fear of being invaded and occupied by a foreign nation in the year 2022 is irrational for Westerners
7899d	People die every day every day waiting for an organ transplant. We should prioritize the rights of the living over the rights of the dead.   90% of Americans are in favor of organ donation, but only 60% are registered donors. It takes a bit of effort to register, and currently, people can apathetically not check a box. With an opt-out policy, we might get much closer to 90% donors, which would save thousands of lives every year.   I would be willing to bet that of the 10% of Americans who say they are not in favor of organ donation, 99% of those 10% would gladly accept an organ to save their own lives. So I would take this a step further and say that those who opt out should be dinged on their transplant 'score' when they are trying to get on the list for an organ donation.   I expect to hear about religious concerns or bodily autonomy arguments, and I say fine, you can opt out. But you should live with the consequences and know that you will be passed over for another organ recipient in a similar state of health.   This is not just a theoretical discussion to me. This is a policy change that should be enacted immediately.	1643153433.0	scr3o3	/r/changemyview/comments/scr3o3/cmv_organ_donation_should_be_optout_rather_than/	CMV: Organ donation should be opt-out, rather than opt-in

This kind of thing has been going on since money was invented. It's just like [tulip mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) in the 1600s, or internet stocks in the year 2000.  They all end the same way, with values going back to reality.

5u2kw	In the majority of Theist vs Non-Theist debates I have seen and had, the most common and often first problem occurs in the defining of the terms Atheist and Agnostic. I personally believe most Theists abuse the misunderstandings of these definitions to intentionally misrepresent or strawman their interlocutors position.  The view that I have been challenged on repeatedly and would be open to hearing legitimate challenge to is this: Religious belief is not a binary proposition. It is not a choice between two positive beliefs. It is not "God does exist" or "God does not exist". Theists present it this way often and I believe this is a false dichotomy. This can, in my opinion, be proven by defining the terms "Theist", "Atheist" and "Agnostic" correctly and I do believe they have objectively "correct" definitions. I do not believe what these words are intended to mean is up for interpretation. I think that is the core of the problem.   &#x200B;  >"Theist"   >   >Root: Greek "theos"   >   >Meaning: "God" + "-ist"   >   >\[Formal Definitions\]   >   >Oxford: "Belief in the existence of a god or gods"   >   >Collins: "a person who believes in the existence of God or gods"   >   >Webster: "a person who believes in the existence of a god or gods"  It is clear in literature, scholastic use, and etymology that this word is intended to mean someone who has some God belief.   >"Atheist"   >   >Root: Greek "atheos"   >   >Meaning: "Without God"   >   >\[Formal Definitions\]   >   >Oxford: "​a person who does not believe that God or gods exist"   >   >Collins: "a person who does not believe in God or gods."   >   >Webster: "a lack of belief or a strong disbelief in the existence of a god or any gods"  This overlaps Agnostic a bit when it comes to the Oxford and Webster definitions and in practical use in Greek where it was used to refer to those who believed Gods did not exist as well as those who were ignorant of the existence of the Gods however as time went on the scholastic definition of Atheist became solidified as meaning strictly a positive belief that God does not exist.  &#x200B;  >"Agnostic"   >   >Root: Greek: "agnostos"   >   >Meaning: "Unknowable"   >   >\[Formal Defintions\]   >   >Oxford: "A person who believes that nothing certain can be known about the existence of God or anything else beyond the material"   >   >Collins: "a person who holds that the existence of the ultimate cause, as God, and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable"   >   >Webster: "a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (such as God) is unknown and probably unknowable"  Here we see that Agnostic does not mean what the majority of people seem to believe it means. While the Greek root "agnostos" is somewhat ambiguous in its use similar to atheos again we see the scholastic definition of this word rooted firmly in the premise of unknowability not just a lack of knowledge. Agnosticism is a positive claim that it is impossible to know if God exists, not a lack of belief in God.   Here is the problem, there is a large subset of non-theistic "belief" that is not covered by any of these terms and it is, I suspect, the overwhelming majority of non-theists. A lack of belief about God entirely.   Theists in debate will try to pin non-theists into either the Atheist or Agnostic world view because those are positive beliefs that can have a burden of proof put to them. What Theists seem to be entirely unwilling to do is accept that a lack of belief is not only possible but is the position of the vast majority of self proclaimed "Atheists" and "Agnostics"  I have been told outright on many many occasions by Theists that no intermediary position can be held, that religious belief is a yes or no proposition exclusively. I can not find a way to accept that premise.  I believe the only intellectually responsible position to hold on Theistic belief is a position of no belief because no Theistic belief can be demonstrated to be valid. Until that changes there is no rational cause for asserting a positive belief about something that can not be positively demonstrated.  Is there any convincing argument for asserting a person must either be Theistic, Atheistic, or Agnostic and nothing else?	1643170024.0	scwvit	/r/changemyview/comments/scwvit/cmv_belief_about_god_is_not_a_binary_proposition/	CMV: Belief about God is not a binary proposition and Theists who insist it is are being dishonest.

ew0aknw0	https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_of_Wealth_Inequality_source.png#mw-jump-to-license  The above image shows, I think, just how useless it is. Every Scandinavian nation is at a different level, despite people generally pointing to basically any of them as models for success, as though one Scandinavian country is as good as another, but judging by the Gini Coefficient, that’s not true, and the nations cited the most (Norway and Sweden) are actually “worse” off than countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In fact, according to this, Sweden is “worse” than most of Africa and South America. We are also supposed to believe that China, a national that utilises slave labor, is better than the US.   The majority of westerners seem to live in very “unequal” countries, despite being the most privileged, well-off people.   I find it especially ironic that the USA & Sweden, one the poster-boy for capitalism, the other the poster-boy for Social Democracy seem to be in the same Gini Coefficient range. There doesn’t seem to be any major correlation between state intervention in the economy and having a high or low Gini Coefficient.   This metric for economic health seems utterly useless unless being applied to extremes. It feels like when people try to judge a movie quality on passing the Bechdel test, when the two metrics are totally unrelated. Neither metric is suitable for judging any kind of quality, rather they just judge a very specific and seemingly irrelevant metric that others have assigned value to, but doesn’t actually have any real consequences for whether something is good or not. And just looking at the criteria, it is as follows (by wealth, not income)  “Miserable” (<10K USD)  “Poor” (10K-100K USD)  “Middle Class” (100K-1mn USD)  “Millionaires” (over 1mn USD)  So…you could be worth $80,000 net worth and this coefficient considers you “poor”?   Even countries that appear “mid-range” on the GC are actually high. Were one to glance at this map and try to find any correlation between color and country, they’d fail. Economic system, highest tax rate, healthcare model, education system all seem irrelevant to the GC.	1643198014.0	sd496o	/r/changemyview/comments/sd496o/cmv_the_gini_coefficient_is_largely_useless_as_a/	CMV: The Gini coefficient is largely useless as a metric for economic health or stability
1d7ws21h	Instead of buying a new iphone that I didn’t really need, I could have given that money to charities feeding starving kids, charities helping the sick, etc. And yet, I did not choose to do the moral thing. I only believe in doing the moral thing if it is convenient to do so. And also not doing anything blatently immoral. (I am sure one could make the argument that buying from a company that does not justly pay its works is immoral. However, in my view this is ammoral as I am not the one directly doing the wrong thing; rather I am just turning a blind eye) Is that a bad way to live life? Please change my view.  Note: Arguments about the technical and minute details about definitions of morality will not change my view: In this context, moral actions to be whatever a reasonable person would consider moral.	1643198978.0	sd4j35	/r/changemyview/comments/sd4j35/cmv_being_amoral_doing_what_is_moral_if/	CMV: Being amoral, doing what is moral if convenient and not doing anything amoral is not a bad way to live life
