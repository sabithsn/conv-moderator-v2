5xg8z09e	I am unsure whether my understanding of sexual violence during warfare (particularly medieval) is correct or blurred by the entertainment I have consumed. I would like some clarity. Many depictions of war in entertainment formats (whether books, video games or tv shows) often make sexual violence a commonality in wartime (particularly in more historic settings).   Sexual violence is often depicted as commonplace and something which inevitably occurs as a consequence of war. Particularly graphic representations I have seen are the mass of references in the fantasy game of thrones books but also more historically based entertainment such as the vikings tv show.  My question is ‘just how common was sexual violence’ and how accurate are the depictions we see in media, is the presumption of permanent sexual violence in wartime a tv trope or does it have historic truth? If it is truth, why?  I am not asking for examples or occurrences. I understand these things happen. My question is more why it was so commonplace in older times (if it indeed was). Modern examples I can think of seem to have at least some reason or logic behind them (even if the reasoning is incredibly sick and twisted). Horrors such as Nanking have a (again, sick) reasoning behind the violence (the Japanese brainwashing troops with a sense of racial superiority). Same as the soviet attack on Berlin (based largely on revenge) and in Rwanda (as a weapon against a scapegoated community - Apologies if i'm wrong my knowledge is poor on this topic). These are all horrible but notably stand out and are known as horrific exceptions (I think). We know about the perpetrators, the victims and the reasons people could bring themselves to do such things.   In medieval entertainment however sexual violence seems to happen every time possible. Surely every single medieval soldier was not eagerly anticipating their first chance to perpetrate sexual violence and then able to comfortably live with themselves and their families afterwards? Also if it was the case, why was this violence accepted so? Pillaging a settlement and then exterminating the entire populous wasn’t a guaranteed norm (I know it happens, but not every time). The saying is not pillage and paedophilia, so why was sexual violence to women seemingly so standardly accepted?  The story of Boudica comes to mind. According to Simon Schama, revenge for sexual violence to her daughters was a motivating factor in her rebellion against the Romans (a history of britain, ep1: Beginnings). Wouldn’t a sexually violated conquered populous be all the harder to control and less likely to accept their new rulers (therefore making it a politically bad decision too)?	1642707662.0	s8r5r2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5r2/sexual_violence_in_wartime_depictions_in/	Sexual violence in wartime; depictions in entertainment vs reality.

entu2nn7	I have no experience in historical research and I am looking to explore the prosecution of LGBT people in the military. I am aware of some instances of a subculture that allowed homosexuality however I keep reading about supposed punishments and such although there are no sources listed at all.   What I'm looking for are primary sources and possible secondary source books and studies. I would also like to find some pimary sources myself however I don't know where to start. I have tried to look in court martial records in The National Archives but they are really a giant spreadsheet with no specific laws broken (I suppose indecency can mean anything). I would also like to know what specific laws were people breaking by being gay etc at the time period with sources and records if these were carried through to the military also.   I would also consider interviewing for first hand accounts but I cannot fathom how I would collect them.  I have limited access to sources as I cannot afford to pay for any. I can access local (South England) and The (British) National Archives in person.   Any help would be much appreciated.	1642721862.0	s8w501	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8w501/how_do_i_go_about_finding_primary_sources_of_the/	How do I go about finding primary sources of the prosecution of LGBT soldiers during WW2?

u2bk9	Hello all you fine folk!  I'm interested in reading about the Crusades but I have quite a lot of material but I noticed I don't have any books regarding the Middle East's situation during the time. Therefore, I want to consult you! Do you have any recommendations on the Middle east's situation during this time period?  Also, how relevant is the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in regards to the Crusade? I hear a lot of people (usually Christians or critics of Islam) throw around that conquest as the reason why the Crusaders (300 years later) decided to mobilize against the muslims. As you can hear, I am skeptic towards to this, but yet unsure, so any help here would be of gratitude!  &#x200B;  Thanks for any and all recommendations, have pleasant morning/day/evening/night!	1643142992.0	scn9pg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scn9pg/the_middle_east_during_the_middle_ages_mainly/	The Middle east during the middle ages (mainly during the Crusades)?

1itclhx8	Why wasn't Chuikov awarded the Order of Victory? His command is seen as key in holding the city of Stalingrad against the German 6th army and without him Friedrich Paulus probably would have succeeded in capturing the city.  Why wasn't he given this award? Was it because it didn't cause a "radical change of the situation" but more of a critical maintaining of the situation or was there another reason he didn't receive this medal?  According to translated sources the Order of Victory was awarded for:  >Conducting combat operations involving one or more army groups and resulting in a "successful operation within the framework of one or several fronts resulting in a radical change of the situation in favor of the Red Army"	1643191256.0	sd2idt	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd2idt/why_wasnt_the_order_of_victory_awarded_to_vasily/	Why wasn't the Order of Victory awarded to Vasily Chuikov?
