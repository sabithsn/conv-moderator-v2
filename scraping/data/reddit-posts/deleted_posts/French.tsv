hmbf2xwo	I have my orals in 2 weeks and I don't know how to prepare. I mean, I did prepare as much as I can but I can't find anything such as model answers for french orals and I have no reference point as to whether I'm prepared enough or not! Also, are there any tips or something I should keep in mind for my orals? Please help.	1643098223.0	sc8ou5	/r/French/comments/sc8ou5/igcse_french_speaking_0520/	IGCSE French Speaking 0520

6h5g9dwx	Salut!! J'apprends le fran√ßais dans une universitaire, mais je cherche un ami fran√ßais avec qui parler, donc j'apprends davantage le fran√ßais  et je peux enseigner l'anglais. Merci!!! (I think that's right).   I minor in French at my college and I was wondering if there was any native-French speaker that would be down to be my friend so we can speak French together and just chat ahha! Totally casual, please let me know!	1643242774.0	sdkr25	/r/French/comments/sdkr25/conversation_buddyfriend/	Conversation buddy/Friend??
6cvs4hbd	I‚Äôve been learning french in school for the past 6 years now. However, I am not content at all with where I‚Äôm at. I know nothing. Nothing. I have some grammar rules drilled in my head, but don‚Äôt know even the most basic of vocabulary. This spring I‚Äôm supposed to take the DELF B1 (which I‚Äôve done practice tests of multiple times and always passed). I know I‚Äôll pass the exam, but realistically my level is not B1. So, I‚Äôve been thinking of completely restarting and learning french from the very beginning. What would be the best way to do that on my own? I know that the best way to learn a language is to live in a country where it‚Äôs spoken, but currently that is not an option.	1643293314.0	sdzi2i	/r/French/comments/sdzi2i/how_do_i_learn_french/	How do I learn french?
6p4kjoln	Hi,  I'm a French student and need to make a French CV for my year abroad in September. When I look online, all the templates are so different from each other. I remember in my first semester, our classes had to mark a bunch of CVs, so I know there are specific differences but I have completely forgot what they are.  If any native French person has some free time and wants to help, I'd appreciate that lol.

zyv44	I'm a native English speaker hoping to learn practical, conversational French (B2? Is that the level where I could function in French society?) with no particular timescale in mind. My hope is to someday live in France; ideally I'd be able to get an English speaking job in my field so that I could try and learn immersively, but my (entirely anecdotal) perception is that it's harder to do so in Francophone countries than other European countries.  The most common bit of advice I've seen for learning French - or really learning any language -  is to just consume lots of media; books, internet forums, movies, podcasts, etc. That makes sense to me, especially once you have vocabulary down, but I'm confused on how to study before you reach the point that consuming media is really practical. I studied French in secondary school and I'm surprised at how much vocabulary I've retained from that, but given how little I cared about French then I think it's safe to say I have no real experience with language learning. I've seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdFf1SbBO1M) video floating around the sub before and was wondering if you guys thought it would be a good way to start. I understand language learning can be pretty individual, but the hardest thing to me seems to be starting, so it would be nice to have some kind of initial framework.   Another thing worth mentioning is that I have several native French speaking friends who've offered to converse with me in French once I feel comfortable with that (woo! Eat shit iTalki, I'm getting language partners for free!). This feels like a pretty great advantage to have, so I don't want to waste it. How do I best utilise this? Should I just throw whatever French I know at my friends each week and see what they have to say?  Merci beaucoup for taking the time to read my somewhat rambling post!  Edit: Just remembered to put this - I'm still trying to figure out how much time per day to spend learning. I'm in my final semester of university right now so I'm trying to make sure I'm not neglecting my studies too much. Is 30 minutes of 'active' learning (textbooks and the like) + 30 minutes of more 'passive' learning (TV shows, podcasts, etc.) a day realistic?	1644022407.0	sktp52	/r/French/comments/sktp52/where_to_begin_best_way_to_use_language_partners/	Where to begin?
