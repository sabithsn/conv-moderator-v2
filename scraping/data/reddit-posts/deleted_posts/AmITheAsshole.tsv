84o5vsij	My (26F) cousin (27F) and I are very close. I’ve been there for her for everything and I help her a lot, she helps me a lot too. She got divorced recently and it broke her and I saw how upset she was (she still is) .. anyways she met this new girl and she got happy again. Thing is the new girl has a girlfriend (which she was honest about) and she talks to my cousin whenever SHE wants too.. she ghost her for days and then talk to my cousin like nothing. My cousin knows how she is and she’s all like “ I really like her and she likes me too” the girl told her straight up she will not leave her girlfriend and if she does leave her girlfriend she will not date my cousin. The girl and my cousin had sex once before. And she tells my cousin she loves her but they can’t be anything serious. Obviously this girl is a mess and she loves messing with my cousins head and my cousin is so into her. My cousin will not meet other people cause of this girl and she’s like well I know she likes me and I know we will be together one day. I said she made you cry like 2 times and she does whatever she wants with you. Anyways It happened again and my cousin started crying because the girl was posting her girlfriend on social media and my cousin asked me if she can come over because she felt sad. I told her no because I already warned her about this girl and she doesn’t listen and the girl takes my cousin as a joke. My cousin said I was mean for not being there for her.. AITA?    TL;DR- my cousin was heartbroken over a girl that has a girlfriend and told her she will never be with her.	1642771905.0	s9asz7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9asz7/aita_for_not_being_there_for_my_cousin_when_she/	AITA for not being there for my cousin when she got heartbroken?
h2wfytri	Ok so I (16f) was walking to the restroom i got there and when I was about to walk in I heard some girl laughing, i waited by the door (mainly bc i have a bit of social anxiety) while i was waiting i heard one of the girls say "Go back to where you came from you illegal" then the other said "No one wants you here go back to Mexico" I was shocked af, when they walked out it was 2 African American girls. I went into the restroom and tried to see who they were talking to, it was a Hispanic girl, she was crying her eyes out. I asked her if she was okay, and why they were saying all this stuff to her; she said that they have been this mean to her since we had started school. She did have a heavy Spanish accent, more than mine, and as a Hispanic girl i knew what she was feeling being told to "go back to Mexico" or "Your an illegal".  I don't know what came over me bc all my anxiety was out the window and I helped calm the girl down, and walked her to her class. I asked to speak to her teacher, her teacher came out and i told her what happened, her teacher brought all 3 of the girls out. The 2 bullies were mad and said that they were just joking and that me and the other girl should learn to take a joke. I then asked them, "How would you feel if someone came up to y'all and told y'all to go back to Africa?" They said that i was racist and that i was in the wrong for saying that to them. I told them that that's basically what they are saying to the Hispanic girl. They didn't want to understand. The teacher sent them to the principals office and they were suspended for 3 days.  When I went back to my class I realized I was gone to the restroom for almost 1 hour, my teacher was mad MAD she started yelling at me and asked me to explain myself. My teacher was understanding but said i was in the wrong for saying "How would you feel if someone told you to go back to Africa" she said i went to far,  and that i shouldn't have gotten them suspended; but i told her that that's what they were saying to the other girl. Some of my friends are also saying I was  wrong for saying that. I keep telling them i didn't say it all I asked was how would they feel if someone said it to them.   So AITA did I overreact, was I wrong for getting them suspended?	1642772970.0	s9b50p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b50p/aita_for_getting_two_freshmans_suspended/	AITA for getting two freshmans suspended
ivdf83sf	My parent got scammed and I let it happen. I should've known better but we're both desperate for money. It got the best of me so I failed to think rationally.  At first I was against it. They brought up the idea a few times before but I kept telling them no. This month we ran out of money. Literally. We sold things already but we didn't earn enough to cover everything. So then my parent mentioned this investment thing again. It was shady but I got desperate and tired and sick of living like this. Before this happened, I even thought of...ending myself a few times. This time, I stupidly agreed and they made the deal. The scammer told them that they needed more money. They told the scammer that they didn't have any money left. The scammer told them to borrow money and they did and I stupidly agreed with their decision! I hate myself for it. I'm usually not this dumb but desperation got the best of me and now we have more debt than before and I don't know what to do.

e3fprlip	I just get really scared to speak to this teacher (who I'll call A) since the last time I had a meeting with them, they refused to help me find any other pathway academically and essentially told me I should just leave the school. Long story short, I still go there because my psychologist managed to get me a 'second chance' with conditions that essentially mean I can't apply to university this year. I believe Teacher A dislikes me. They've been short with me on the regular, probably for undermining their authority by getting a second chance when they told me there would be no room for negotiation about the initial decision where I either had to drop out or continue attending with a withdrawal from taking any final exams.  Today, I missed a mock. Teacher A emailed me to come upstairs so they can have a 'chat' with me about it. I was studying in the library and got an awful wave of anxiety when I saw the email; this teacher is the same one who told me I had no choice but to drop out of high school and pay 30k (which I don't have. I'm 18 and financially depend on savings) to a tutorial college, essentially. I figured the whole situation about the missed mock would be talked about in the 'review' of how I've been doing next week- understandably, none of my teachers like me, and I don't think I did so well during the exams that I didn't miss, so I kind of foresee being kicked out permanently at this point.  I responded with, "*I hope you are well. I would like to foremost apologise as I had real difficulty sending this email and would appreciate your understanding. I find sudden meetings with academic teachers anxiety-inducing and less beneficial to myself than planned ones, so if we could schedule a conversation for another day, I would be very grateful. I am happy to discuss the situation the meeting that I believe you have been invited to for Monday if you aren’t available for any other day. I am very sorry for the inconvenience*."  Their response: "*We are again in a position where we have almost no assessment data for you, and it seems that I cannot even have a chat with you to help you. A quick chat is hardly a sudden meeting! I know we have a meeting* \[which is the review\] *booked in for Monday so let's leave it at that.*"  I've had a lot of shitty circumstances happen to me during my time in this school. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ptsd, an eating disorder, and recently, adhd. I only got medicated for any of this stuff in October, and the only therapy I was offered would have meant I would miss school and Teacher A made it clear I would be forced to withdraw from exams if my attendance dropped for any reason. I'm estranged from my parents (long story, but this happened in my time in this high school as well) and was hospitalised for a particular incident in my first year. Before that, I was a shell of a person and my attendance was very awful, so I can't tell if that was a disrespectful thing to say on my side or a given. **Was it wrong of me to say I didn't want to have the chat? Am I overthinking?**  I don't have any friends (I isolated myself and ignored texts for all of the last two years, definitely my fault) and my family's out of the picture, so I figured I'd ask the internet. Advice on how to handle any of this would be very much appreciated, too. This is so hard to navigate alone.

7lhs7	There have been a few instances where my girlfriend cannot sleep and seemingly gets upset when I don't stay up with her. Last night she woke me up at 430 am and said she can't sleep. I apologized and acknowledged how frustrating that is but I fell back asleep because I'm exhausted and I work at 8 am. She woke me up a second time and told me the same thing, that she couldn't sleep. But what can I do? She knows I work early in the morning and this is the second time in 3 days that something like this has happened. She acts as if I'm letting her down when I don't stay up with her or wake up with her when she cannot sleep. 3 nights ago at 10 PM she said she was feeling anxious because she was tired but couldn't sleep, and I ended up staying up with her until 1 am even though I worked the next morning, which was a terrible shift because I was absolutely fatigued. On top of this, she didn't at any point turn the lights off or attempt to go to bed. I know it sucks to not be able to sleep when you're tired, but at least try to fall asleep first. AITA?  EDIT: To clarify a few nights ago. At ten we turned the lights off for maybe 2 minutes. And then she declared she couldn't sleep and we turned them on again. Then we stayed up until 1, and we finally settled in and fell asleep. But it ruined my entire work day and made me not be able to function properly.	1642777811.0	s9cv18	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9cv18/aita_for_not_staying_up_with_my_girlfriend_when/	AITA for not staying up with my girlfriend when she can't sleep?
4zhlub3g	Me (26F) and my bf (32M) have been together for over 2 years.  Last week he ex of 3 yrs (I will call her D) to whom he ended the relationship amicably asked to meet. She wanted to ask him some advice and he was someone that she trusted and familiar with the issues. I was okay with it but still overthinking a lot. He was aware of it. After the meeting, he came back to tell me how it went. He mentioned meeting her reminds him the reasons why she wasn’t the one and how much he appreciated me. I asked if he would keep texting or meeting her over the advice she needed. He said he didn’t say no follow up but also didn’t say to ask him if she needed anything. Today, after sensing him quickly turn of a chat box, I asked him why and all other things i’ve sensed over the past days. He told me to check his phone. I checked and saw her message 18m ago. She was sending a photo of her new pet and he replied something like looks nice, congrats. There was no prior message and he admitted he deleted them cuz he doesn’t want me to overthink. I blew up and said all i wanted to know is if she texted or wanted to meet, i am entitle to know. The fact that he deleted the texts made me feel like there is something to hide. He asked if i could feel his love. I know he loved me but kept replying her text because he was being polite and not telling me because he thinks it’s nothing isn’t something i am comfortable with. I know for sure he loved me and 100% over her. But i still want to know if she does text him.

4qm0d7r9	My fiancé is one of 3 boys. Ever since we’ve started dating his entire family (MIL particularly) has blatantly favorited his older brother’s wife (SIL) to me. In the beginning I could understand, as they had known her longer and I was the “new SO”. However, we’ve now been together for over 4 years and it’s only gotten worse. I’ve never been anything but kind to them and tried hard to develop a relationship with MIL. Since we’ve gotten engaged my feelings have been particularly hurt. SIL announced she was pregnant with first child a month before we got engaged and that has completely overshadowed our entire engagement. Every conversation revolves around the pregnancy. MIL and SIL talk on the phone multiple times a day and the family group chat is all about ultrasounds and how she’s feeling. Our engagement is rarely talked about and MIL says do whatever for the wedding because she “already had her big wedding with older brother and SIL”. Their wedding was similar to how everyone is acting about the pregnancy- it was all anybody talked about for months. My fiancé doesn’t seem bothered by this but it hurts my feelings, especially since my own mom died when I was 8 so I don’t have any other mom figure to celebrate this with. I told my husband I want to spend less time with his family during this time and he says I’m being unreasonable.

8b5ut99x	I work 60 hours a week and often have trouble having "me" time.. time to do whatever I want. Usually Monday night after work is the only time that I have alone time to do whatever I want and need. I have elderly parents that I try to see every weekend but they are over an hour away from me and so that usually eats up a large part of either Saturday or Sunday. This Saturday I have to work a 12 hour shift and so there's no time for me that day. That means Sunday I'm going to see my parents. So this week.. I didn't think I'd have one single evening or weekend day to do things I wanted or needed to do.   I have a girlfriend of almost one year who sure seems wonderful.  She's had a really stressful work week... probably the worst one of the year. And some mild things to deal with at home.. Kids leaving their rooms messy, etc.   Her work was stressful Monday and Tuesday. She was very upset Wednesday over a work incident and was texting me about it. I replied and tried to be supportive. However, I also mentioned in that text that I'm feeling a bit strained this week because my parents are sort of guilting me into seeing them Sunday when I really just don't have the time. She was upset with me for not being supportive to her in that text and for working in my own kind of stress, when she needed me then.  We both worked 16 hour days Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday... Like 9am - 1am.  Normally we get together on Thursday nights but work has been so stressed for her that she messaged me Thursday 230p that she really didn't feel like hanging out Thursday night after work and was just going to go home, relax, maybe grocery shop. I wrote her back and said that if she'd like I'd go grocery shopping with her so that way we could at least see each other. She wrote back, thanked me for my offer and said she was just going home and didn't want me to come over. She texted back and said if things change she'd let me know and maybe we can get together.   Since she didn't want to get together I used that as an opportunity to have me time and after my work day ended at 5pm, I worked out Thursday night and started a home improvement project. Around 7 p.m. she sent me a text that she would feel better if we got together. However I didn't see that text until 7:45 pm. I told her that I was already wrapped up in things and that I wouldn't be able to come see her. Also, I figured that if I went to her house I wouldn't be getting home until midnight or so. We both haven't slept much this week because of work.   Long story short, she wanted me to stop what I was doing to come spend time with her and I said no.   Am I the asshole for not stopping what I was doing to support her while she was having a rough week, when I struggle to find time to do things I need (and want) to do? If I'm wrong I'll own it, but I don't think I'm wrong..   (I tend to be a people pleaser and always put others needs ahead of me and I'm trying to not do that so much anymore)   Thanks in advance for your thoughts...	1642783029.0	s9etaa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9etaa/aita_argument_with_girlfriend_whos_right/	AITA, Argument with girlfriend, who's right?

This Saturday I have to work a 12 hour shift and so there's no time for me that day. That means Sunday I'm going to see my parents. So this week.. I didn't think I'd have one single evening or weekend day to do things I wanted or needed to do.   I have a girlfriend of almost one year who sure seems wonderful.  She's had a really stressful work week... probably the worst one of the year. And some mild things to deal with at home.. Kids leaving their rooms messy, etc.   Her work was stressful Monday and Tuesday. She was very upset Wednesday over a work incident and was texting me about it. I replied and tried to be supportive. However, I also mentioned in that text that I'm feeling a bit strained this week because my parents are sort of guilting me into seeing them Sunday when I really just don't have the time. She was upset with me for not being supportive to her in that text and for working in my own kind of stress, when she needed me then.  We both worked 16 hour days Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday... Like 9am - 1am.  Normally we get together on Thursday nights but work has been so stressed for her that she messaged me Thursday 230p that she really didn't feel like hanging out Thursday night after work and was just going to go home, relax, maybe grocery shop. I wrote her back and said that if she'd like I'd go grocery shopping with her so that way we could at least see each other. She wrote back, thanked me for my offer and said she was just going home and didn't want me to come over. She texted back and said if things change she'd let me know and maybe we can get together.   Since she didn't want to get together I used that as an opportunity to have me time and after my work day ended at 5pm, I worked out Thursday night and started a home improvement project. Around 7 p.m. she sent me a text that she would feel better if we got together. However I didn't see that text until 7:45 pm. I told her that I was already wrapped up in things and that I wouldn't be able to come see her. Also, I figured that if I went to her house I wouldn't be getting home until midnight or so. We both haven't slept much this week because of work.   Long story short, she wanted me to stop what I was doing to come spend time with her and I said no.   Am I the asshole for not stopping what I was doing to support her while she was having a rough week, when I struggle to find time to do things I need (and want) to do? If I'm wrong I'll own it, but I don't think I'm wrong..   (I tend to be a people pleaser and always put others needs ahead of me and I'm trying to not do that so much anymore)   Thanks in advance for your thoughts...	1642783029.0	s9etaa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9etaa/aita_argument_with_girlfriend_whos_right/	AITA, Argument with girlfriend, who's right?
ivh0fjyu	Hi everyone, This is a throwaway account as my boyfriend follows my main.  A little background info:  My boyfriend (31M) and I (27F) are both going to community college to get a diploma that will enable us to go to university.  We were both Highschool dropouts for different reasons. So last Wednesday we had a math exam. We both agreed that we want the weekend to ourselves to study, so we didn’t meet up. But apparently he didn’t study much at all and spent his time gaming or watching YouTube. So fast forward to Wednesday and the exam. The subject wasn’t too difficult, and therefore the test had more advanced wordproblems that required a little more thinking outside the box.  As we sat in class I noticed my boyfriend just staring at the paper. Apparently he had a difficult time. He left early to wait outside class because he always takes me home (I don’t have a car and I asked him if it’s okay) I finished my paper and went outside.  I wasn’t sure where he went so I texted him, but he didn’t answer. I waited for 10 minutes and asked a classmate if he’d seen him.  He told me he already left and I was a little worried he forgot to take me with him. The problem is it’s a night school and it’s in a bigger city. It was already pitch black outside. Anyway, I went outside to see if he was there. He was standing there and I already knew he wasn’t in a good mood. So I asked him what was wrong but I didn’t get an answer. I didn’t want to poke around so I just let him be. If he doesn’t want to speak that’s fine. On the ride home he didn’t say a word and he didn’t say goodbye either. The only thing I got was a text with a thumbs up after I asked if he was home.   I left him alone for the evening and also the next morning. I texted him before school cause I didn’t know if he was coming to class. I got no answer, so I organized an other ride home.  He arrived late and didn’t speak with me.  At this point I was a little mad cause I thought it was ridiculous he would ignore me. I wasn’t at fault he didn’t do well on the test.  After I got home with my other ride I texted him that his behavior was childish and he’s a grown man. I understand being angry about the rest but ignoring me completely and not speaking to me is just stupid.  He then texted back that everyone is annoying him and how  he isn’t allowed to be in a bad mood but everyone else is and he avoided the people to not annoy him. I said I can understand he wants to be left alone but a simple text telling me that would have been enough to let me know whats up.  I was worried something else was going on because I couldn’t understand that he wouldn’t even tell me if he’d come to school.  So after this I was still mad and I didn’t text him since cause he made it clear he wants to be left alone.  AITA for being mad or did I overreact?	1642785400.0	s9fqh9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9fqh9/aita_for_being_angry_at_my_boyfriend_after_he/	AITA for being angry at my boyfriend after he ignored me for two days ?
7z6y88iz	so me f20 and husband m21 have been having this argument for like a day and he doesn’t see why I’m upset.  We just moved into a new house on a military base in I would say a tourist destination state and his friend m23 and friends gf f23 want to come out and visit. HOWEVERRRRR, I was not informed that there are set dates that they have asked to stay at OUR house. For context I have met this friend once for like two hours and never met this gf (said friend has a bad track record with dating and women in general and he’s been dating this girl for a solid three months) so I have no clue who these people are and my husband just invited them to stay in our house for a week while we both work.  So yesterday when all of this came to light, I said these exact words, “I don’t know a nice way to say this but I’m not comfortable with (friend) and his gf staying at our house”. He claims that the way I said this was “the worst way I could have possibly brought it up” And it turned into the absolute biggest argument and carried over into the next day. I just wanna know if I’m overreacting at all?  Also want to clarify we are on a military base so if they stay with us they have literally no way of getting around and can’t really do much on base without either of us.	1642787768.0	s9gmsa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9gmsa/aita_for_telling_my_husband_his_friend_and/	AITA for telling my husband his friend and friends gf can’t stay at our house?
2buod686	I am a younger (34) member of a Unitarian Universalist congregation. We have a memorial garden on the side of the building. There was a cherry blossom tree planted there and it recently died and we had it removed. I work for myself doing sustainable landscape and design and saw this as a good opportunity to transform the space into a more sustainable area, focusing on natives and edibles. I applied for a grant for the congregation to start a community garden and was awarded $500 for the project. I reached out to the head of gardening and floated the idea of the space being a community garden and planting a native fruit tree there. She said that it was not a good idea because the memorial garden is a sacred space. Many members that are cremated have some or all of their ashes spread in the area. For me, I feel like it can be both, but older people in the congregation feel that it is not a good area for having a garden and want to keep it dedicated to being what they see as a sacred space. I am inquiring the opinions of others because I don’t know if it is a difference in generational mindset or if I am an outlier in general for not caring as much about sacred space as about planting natives and edibles in a sustainable way.	1642788913.0	s9h35b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9h35b/aita_for_not_caring_to_keep_a_memorial_garden_a/	AITA for not caring to keep a memorial garden a sacred space?
7d11ccz6	I live in a private gated community. There’s  about 12 houses and apartments in the community and two gates for entrance/exit. There’s a long “road” that’s really just a circular private drive that goes around in a circle leading to both gates. It’s not narrow and there’s definitely enough space for two cars to drive in opposing directions. There’s a small sign saying 5mph (8kmh) but I never paid it any attention. The drive is not a city, county, state, or federal property.   Several families in the community have young children. One of my neighbors who we’ll call “X” politely asked me to slow down because of their kids. I admit I have a lead foot and often drive fast without noticing. After X talked to me, I made it a point to limit my speed to 10-20mph (16-32km). However, X’s mother was not satisfied and rudely approached my car on several occasions telling me I need to “slow my ass down.” One day we got in an argument over me driving 15mph (24kmh). She insisted my foot should not even touch the gas pedal and I should just let the car coast while in the community. However it did come out during one of the arguments that she knows someone who lost a child in a parking lot accident.   Recently a family complained to maintenance about my speed and they politely reminded me. I have a strong feeling it was the same family because no other families have ever said anything to me, but there is a small chance it was another family that doesn’t like confrontation so they went through maintenance.   In my opinion 5mph (8kmh) is just excessively slow. Most gated communities in our area are 10-20mph (16-32kmh). Even school zones, driveways, parking lots, etc. are 20 mph (32kmh) where I live.

holn95gx	To give some background (names have been changed), I (28F) and a friend Dee (22F) have planned a weekend trip. This trip was to be my birthday trip and have been planning it since last year. When we had agree to the trip, Dee had asked me to invite my best friends to which I did. Unfortunately they are no longer going to make it, due to work. I had let her know my best friends won’t be able to make it and Dee had said we would still have fun just the two of us. We have been on several trips just the two of us and it’s always been a blast. My friend Dee recently messaged me and said she had talked to her co-workers about our trip and they had ask to come with us. I didn’t know why someone who I never met would even want to jump in on trip and why my friend also thought it was a good idea to ask. To also note that she never hangs out with her co-workers, so I’m just honestly confused and want to flat out say no. So question is WIBTA if I tell my friend I don’t want her co-workers on the trip?	1642789969.0	s9hhrr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hhrr/wibta_if_i_tell_my_friend_her_coworkers_cant_come/	WIBTA if I tell my friend her co-workers can’t come on this trip with us
9ic3n255	My wife and I usually watch tv for a few hours each night after the kids go to bed. We usually watch about 1 or 2 episodes of whatever show we’re watching at the moment. Currently we are watching dr who.  Last night I wasn’t in the mood to watch more then 1 dr who episode. When we finished watching the first episode at 10:15 I asked what Jenny wanted to do because I didn’t want to watch another dr who episode. I wanted to watch the show I started watching individually instead, and I let her know this. I also was a little tired, so I said I probably would go to bed if she chose to stay downstairs in the family room and watch something else. I didn’t feel like watching anything other than the show I wanted to and would have chosen getting more sleep over watching something I didn’t want to watch.   This resulted in her getting very upset and she claims I’m an asshole for wanting to watch a show I was in the middle of and for refusing to watch anything else by saying I would go to bed instead.   Am I the asshole for refusing to watch what she wanted to or is she?	1642790550.0	s9hp7v	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hp7v/aita_or_is_my_wife_the_asshole/	AITA or is my wife the asshole?
ikfnayqt	In about 6 months my brother in law is getting married in an extremely expensive place to travel to, and stay at,  destination. IMO destination weddings are kind of dick to expect a lot of people to come to unless everyone you’re inviting is well off. If you’re okay with only having a few people there, it’s fine. But to expect people to travel so far and spend so much money for a wedding is asinine.   My husband and I have been hit hard by the pandemic. We lost 3 forms of income in as many months and I’m currently the only one working. My job is in the restaurant and hospitality business. That’s important to keep in mind going forwards.  Last night, my mother in law wanted to book the flights. I had told her months prior that going for over a week wasn’t really a possibility for us because of my job and my husband's lack of one (when starting a new job it’s not a great look to immediately take off nearly two weeks for a vacation).  The whole thing is that they’re giving us this “vacation” for “free”. Aka they’re using the points they have from an airline and their timeshare to get us out there. Which is still very kind, but not when I get no say in how long, when, or how I get there.  She told us,not asked, told, that she was booking us and it would be for 10 days we would end up being away. She “asked” if we were okay with that time period. When I said I would need to talk with my boss if that was even possible, she flipped out saying she needed to book right that minute, and that we were getting a “free” vacation. So then, she calls my husband cause I’m scrambling to try and figure out if that would even work, and my husband commits to it because she was acting like we either come on her time schedule or not at all. I told him that there is no way she would just not have us come but he continues pushing that she would. So I decided that fine, I wouldn’t come at all. I would rather be poor at home but working than poor in a timeshare room in a vacation spot not making any money. On top of that, it was decided we would fly to his sister's home first and then spend a night there and then all go on the same plane together… adding an additional 2 days onto the trip. Why can't we just fly straight there? I don’t know but it’s not a good enough reason to miss even more work.   She “asked” us if we were okay with all of these things. When I said no, however, I would prefer to do this or that, she became upset and kept saying she was giving us a “free” vacation.   At this point, I don’t want to even go. I’ll go to their reception they’re holding later for all the people that don’t want to spend thousands of dollars to go to someone’s wedding. Not once has my opinion been taken into consideration, and we are really struggling financially. I don’t get PTO, if I miss work, I don’t get paid.   You could make the argument that it’s the brothers wedding so it’s so important to be there… but for over a week? That’s insane. His parents flew into town for 3 hours to come to our small wedding when we eloped. Then when we had our bigger wedding, his sister didn’t come, and his other two siblings drove in with his parents and didn’t even stay for 48 hours. They didn’t go to our rehearsal dinner or any of our pre wedding events. That’s why it’s so important for us to fly in so early and not directly to the destination, because “events start Saturday”.  His parents supported all his siblings financially all the way through college, in some cases, graduate school. They haven’t helped my husband since he was 19. I’m just trying to show the difference in how we’ve been treated versus his siblings. They’re not obligated to do anything for him or us, but they could respect us and listen to us a little. It seems they openly favor his siblings and can’t even be bothered to spend any real time with us on our terms. They’ve never come to visit us where we live for more than a day. Typically for only a few hours.   So last night, I was getting ready to just tell her to forget it and that my husband would be going alone. My husband and mother in law kept saying that that was an option too, the only other option than going totally on her terms. But when I went to take the option, he freaked out saying he would be really mad at me and embarrassed. I felt like that was fine, but he keeps pushing it while his mom is telling us she already booked the flights so now I’m trapped. Then she says if we want to check bags we have to pay for it ahead of time or carry on only. Yeah I’m sure we can fit nearly 2 weeks worth of gear in carry on only. The point of that proving that she wasn’t actually spending real money for us to go. So now if I want to have an appropriate amount of clothes and supplies I have to pay to check a bag. Even though I only wanted to go for an amount of time where checking a bag wouldn’t be required.   The most annoying part is, that should one of his siblings or their spouse need to leave early for work, (they’re using points to get tickets for all of us) they would bend over backwards to make it happen. Why, you ask, is my time and schedule not as important? Because my job is beneath them. They’re also incredibly elitist people and the way they talk about certain jobs and people is awful. In fact, my other brother in law makes a point of only going to family functions the bare minimum of time. But because he works in the medical field, his job is more important than mine.   Yes, what they’re doing is very nice and generous. If we were in a better position financially, I would be thrilled and just let my mother in law bully us into doing things her way. But we’re not making our rent or utilities right now. So going on this trip, for that long, when I don’t have PTO to even cover some of the difference, is insane. It’s even more frustrating because no matter what my husband tries to say, the trip is going to cost us a great deal of money we don’t have, even if we don’t have to worry about getting there.  They said the options are don’t go, or go for way too long. But apparently not going isn’t even an option. Every time I’ve been “asked” if something is okay, when I say it isn’t, it doesn’t matter. My husband tried to pretend like he understood where I was coming from, said he wasn’t angry at me (though what he would be angry about I’m not sure), but then would get upset when I tried to find some middle ground or compromise.   I’m at the point where, depending on where we are financially when this comes around, I’m just not going to go or I’m going to go and then leave the day after the wedding and pay for it myself. Sure I would love things to turn around dramatically for us in the next few months, but I’m not that naive. So am I the asshole for being angry about the situation and not wanting to put myself at further financial risk and hardship?

5tb5zq2s	 Original post is in Relationship _advice, I was told to post here but because of character limits its just the jist of it.  No excuse for grammar I just suck   I F30 and M28 have been together 7-8 years have 2 kids, 4yrs and 2yrs   A year ago he got into chess and he's brilliant at it, he got an online account and all is well. Later on he starts having fits when he looses or makes a bad move, hitting things, swearing or yelling. Some ppl will say "phys abuse is next" he is a very large intimidating man but when he hears a child crying it brings him to his knees. I'm more then capable of doing the same to him. I'm not nor will ever be afraid of him   It got to the point that if 1 of our kids interrupted him he'd freak out. Mult incidents and fights later after making rules when to play and him never following through. It ended up being that he could only play online chess when the kids aren't home Board all he wants but nothing online. He agrees to all of it.   One day we're getting the kids ready for daycare, I was with my 2 year old and my 4 year old asked him mult times for help while he was sitting on the couch. I got his attention to help and he went off. Yelling about how he never has time for himself which is utter nonsense btw. He games, reads, and this silver back gorilla looking mother fucker is at the gym everyday. I settled the kids and they went to daycare. Time to add that when we fight about chess his brain takes a vaca in his ass because nothing he says makes any sense at all. We had it out and he apologiesed a couple days later as it takes a bit for his brain to migrate back to his head. I told him the next time we would be taking some time apart.   Week later we are at my sisters, I'm in the kitchen while he is in the living room with kids. My 4 yr old knocks over a glass of water and he lost it. Yells at him to find something to clean it up with, a 4 yr old would know where to find towels in an unfamiliar house right? I knew right then he was playing. I calmed the kids and saved the fight for when we got home, as it would scare my kids more to watch me tear him a new asshole. I should mention the kids were never there for any of these fights. At the end of the fight I left and didn't come home for a few days, when I did come home he apologiesed. Still I sent him away for a week and It came down to if I ever see the chess game again he would be moving out and we would get lawyers.   Since then he hasn't played online, yes I know how to check I'm better at tech then he is. Mind you he has been able to play board whenever.   In the last month he's been asking to play, saying he's grown out of it. I'm not about to allow any tom-fucking-foolery in my house so it's a no from me. I've been told I'm too harsh and bare minimum should make some rules for him to play.

ivoezxwz	Have worked w/this co-worker for 10+ years. Have always gotten along.  Co-worker has been struggling personally for the past 6 months (does not share why) but is obvious to rest of office and has affected work performance.  Recently got in big trouble with owner - due to work errors.  We all return to office after holidays - small office area - I am there 90 minutes and they inform me that I should keep my distance as they have a sore throat and a runny nose. I ask why the heck they are here in the office - and they use the excuse that they are in such big trouble with the boss - they didn’t want to call in sick.  We are friendly enough that they could have texted me this info - and I could’ve addressed it how I saw fit.  I DO raise my voice and express my dis-pleasure with how they have handled this.  They then leave office.  When my boss comes in (awhile later) I inform them of what went down and MY expectations of a safe work space - which they agree with.  Co-worker is out of office for next 6-days.  Everyone back in office the following Monday.  I walk in and co-worker is extremely cold/pissy (and has not addressed any of their behavior with me).  So I figured - they’ve set the “tone” - and I’m fine with that.  We went thru this past week not really speaking - I can tell they are now trying to get back in my good graces - but I’m not having any of it.  I believe I am owed an apology.  And if they are pissy that I raised my voice when I asked why they were in the office, when sick - I don’t think that was out of line.  Am I the asshole?  For not just letting bygones be bygones?  I really believe I would have - if they had not “set the tone” that they did - I think we would’ve gotten thru this.  But they did - and that really pissed me off.	1642794493.0	s9j620	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9j620/aita_coworker_etiquette/	AITA - Co-worker Etiquette
4rfee5ic	I (27f) feel very guilty and conflicted. For the past two years I haven’t been able to work from home from mine and my husband’s apartment because it’s way too tiny for both of us to wfh (husband is in meetings and on sales calls all day). For the past two years I have worked a combination from (a) the office, (b) my parents’ house and (c) my in-laws house. This starts to get very old, as your entire day is spent in someone else’s home using someone else’s microwave and bathroom and it starts to feel pretty crappy being in your parents’ back room all day or your sister in law’s old bedroom.  I just got a new job and I get to work from home once I reach my 90 days. My dad (60m) has a mental handicap where he has trouble speaking, comprehending,  and making connections quickly. He is on disability and relies a lot on my mom who is a full time teacher. My mom wants me to work from home from their house once my 90 days are up so my dad has someone there (he can do everything for himself, so I would be a mostly silent presence in the house so that he’s less lonely).  I love my parents very much and it pains me that my dad has his condition. My husband and I are always free to help my mom with my dad (or just hangout with them) after work and on weekends. but it stresses me out a lot thinking of my work day going back to 8 hours at my parents’ house.  I feel guilty that I would somehow be making my dad’s situation worse by not being there. My mom has asked me several times when my 90 days is ending. But I would honestly rather work every day from the office than wfh from my parents’.

igop4clf	I’ve had pelvic pain since I was 17 (now 25) and I found out that I had a cyst on one of my ovaries. After multiple different gynecologists, providers, imaging tests, ultrasounds, and blood work over the years everyone is saying I’m fine and that I just have a “functional cyst that will go away sometime in my cycle and every woman gets them”. I recently told a (new) gynecologist (since I have to get multiple opinions which can be expensive - USA) that I have pelvic pain that’s only getting worse as I age, it occasionally impacts my ability to walk, and there is random stiffness like my pelvis turned to rock or rusted metal and I literally cannot move. I told her this happens at least once a week and I’ve felt my cyst burst twice since I was 17 and the pain was excruciating. I mentioned the idea about getting additional ultrasounds/laparoscopic done to rule out PCOS, Endometriosis, or PID and my gynecologist told me I don’t have any of those, explained why (saying if I had PCOS I wouldn’t have a regular period etc), and said to just let her know the next time I am in pain so she can document it since I wasn’t in pain during our visit. She then said even if I think it’s any of those only hormonal birth control or getting a hysterectomy (thus entering into pre-menopause) will fix it. I told her due to a family history of a blood clotting disorder that I cannot be on hormonal birth control as a side effects are blood clots and she basically said I have no other options besides those two. I told her I was going to another doctor since no one can tell me what’s wrong with my pelvis/reproductive organs since I’ve heard this for years and she said “that’s fine, they’re just going to tell you the same thing. You need to trust the professionals. There is nothing wrong with you and tests prove that”.	1642795179.0	s9jfc6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9jfc6/aita_for_telling_a_doctor_shes_not_a_good_doctor/	AITA for telling a doctor she’s not a good doctor?
5na9rvlz	Long story short, someone I know plans on confessing their crush to one of my best friends tonight. It is a group meeting so I will be there, along with a bunch of other people. I'm happy for them! I love that my bestie can find someone that they want to spend all of their time with (besides me ofc) and someone that really truly cares for them. I don't think that the person is a bad person. I don't think that they would make for a bad girlfriend. However the three of us and one other person sit together at lunch and I don't want to be around them if they start dating.  I've had issues with this before where I vetoed sitting with someone significant other just because I didn't want to be part of the drama and I didn't want to see all of the lovey-dovey stuff. In the end their relationship was completely full of drama and I was glad to not have been a part of it.

3siem5hz	My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to a year and for the most part things have been perfect. She was in an abusive on and off relationship with an ex boyfriend for 5+ years and started to date me almost a year after they broke up. Before we were official, I caught her texting him back and forth in rapid fire, angry mode while cuddled up next to me. I brought it up a night or two later and she accused me of not trusting her because she had told me nothing was going on between them and not to worry about it.   She broke things off for a couple days and then realized her mistake and ran back to me. Since then we’ve had a few bumps in the road but things have been pretty damn great. She started a job as a cart girl at a big golf course near our hometown in the fall post graduation.   Over this weekend she told me that there had been instances of guys asking for her number and her giving it out to them because she was afraid they wouldn’t tip her if she said no. I was not comfortable with this when she told me about it but briefly brushed it off as nothing to worry about.   Tonight, I brought it up and mentioned that I had thought about it and I wasn’t comfortable with it.   Her: “most of them just ask me if I’m working if they come back. I told you it doesn’t mean anything. I don’t understand why you let these things bother you and then bring them up”.   Me: “it didn’t bother me too much in the moment, I thought about it and realized I wasn’t comfortable with it”.   Her: “it never goes anywhere. I told you that”  Me: “it never goes anywhere?” . It’s hard to understand why you can’t see why I’m not necessarily comfortable with you giving your # out to other men”.   Her: “it’s basically part of my job”. They text me and ask if I’m working gets me more tips and I get to know the fun people. It’s really not a big deal whatsoever. It’s this great thing called trust”.   Me: your job is to give other men your number who more than likely are asking because they think you’re attractive?  Her: I said part of the job. And actually it’s not most o them like I said ask about if I’m working cause they are regulars. Like I said, trust.   Me: it always leads back to trust. This is t about trust this is about me not being comfortable with it. Two drunk guys on the course having a bet to get your number doesn’t sound like regulars to me   Her: they were so drunk oh my lord I told you I didn’t reply. Why are we having this conversation again?    I go on to explain that I’m just not comfortable with it and that if the roles were reversed she wouldn’t be comfortable with it at all. To which she told me, she would be comfortable because she trusts me (which isn’t true because she barely trusts me around friends who are girls being around me when she’s around me at the same time; never given her a reason to not trust me)	1642797349.0	s9k96p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9k96p/aita_m24_for_not_being_comfortable_with_my/	AITA [M24] for not being comfortable with my girlfriend [F23] giving her number out to customers who could be potential regulars?
71b8ln66	Context: I am currently attending a Secondary High School. In my grade level we have 4 class sections. Our math teacher is gay(as in lgbt) and he never responds to our questions in the dms. We only do online classes atm. We do our research in groups to do activities. My math teacher invited a few panelists to attend the research presentation. My math teacher rarely does class sessions to us(including to the other class sections).  In our 2nd term, he NEVER gave us a single class session. He gave us a research paper to do about a certain subject and that he will let us present our research. 5 of my classmates was really upset about it because he never even discussed the topics, and he never answers our questions in the dms, so John complained to our adviser in our homeroom and our adviser talked to him about it. Few days later, he posted in the announcements saying "What is your problem? Why do you keep complaining? I never gave you a mountain of homework. What's your problem?" I privately sent him a civil message about the situation on our side hoping he'd seen it.  Time skip, we present our research that day, everyone in our class were preparing to present. The two class sections had to do their presentations first, we heard they never had to do their presentations, and that they just have to submit their research papers and presentations. When it's our time to do our presentations with the other class section, we HAD TO DO OUR PRESENTATIONS. We receive a LOT of destructive criticism and less constructive criticism during our presentations.   After our presentations, he said it himself that he experienced something bad from both of the sections and that he's "fine" and then after having his fake nice talk he went all out scolding our class section with everyone in the meeting on why "we complained too much of the hOmEwOrKs", talked about how bad and irresponsible we did in our research presentation when we can't even communicate with him in the first place. He said a lot of nasty things that should be enough to convince someone without context that our class section is the worst. My classmate explained the situation on what was really on our side saying "Sir we weren't truly complaining on our homework, we just want you to have a class with us so that we can easily handle what we should do with our homeworks" but my teacher said "And then? That means you're also really complaining on the homework I gave you all."  My classmate never said anything out of respect. And he continued his dilly dally "We are the worst section" talk to us, talked about how "this is the new normal and that we should deal with it." Also "we are the most irresponsible class ever, you all need to change." The panelists even said "If the problem isn't in your teacher then it's on you, and it needs to change." They really sided on our teacher. It was unfortunate.

hl98ryty	We have two children, our son who is 10 and our daughter who is 7. My husband always tries to put on age rated 12 movies for the children to watch on our family movie night. It really bothers me. I have tried to make a joke about it and normally manage to persuade another movie. When I'm away he always puts these movies on for the kids. Anyway I eventually caved and decided that our 10 year old is probably able to process a 12 movie and recently allowed him to watch one. This evening though my husband but on a 12 movie that he thought our 7 year old daughter should be allowed to watch. I said that's ridiculous she is only young and we have all the time in the world to watch movies but tonight is for the kids. He got really angry stomped off and said he was going to work instead.

dtl5lmde	Me (23f) and my boyfriend (23m) have lived together in a house with our 4 other friends for two years (3 guys and one of their girlfriends). I recently had to move out for many reasons (I’m disabled so I can’t drive and need to have access to public transit, I’ve had some problems with how our friends have handled Covid and need a space I have control over etc). My boyfriend couldn’t move out with me because he’s in a band with two of our male housemates and needed to stay to make music with them.  A month after I decided to move out, Katie and her boyfriend Mike tell everyone that they all need to find a bigger house because Katie has anxiety and needs her own space. They decide they want to find a home with a basement apartment where Katie and Mike can live, and everyone else will be on the main floor. The only problem with that is finding house with two units in their price range is very hard to find in the city we live in.  Everyone agrees to moving out, as long as Katie and Mike take care of finding a house that works for everyone. Big shocker but the only house they find is on the outskirts of the city. My boyfriend agrees to move out there in order to make Katie happy, despite me saying 40 minutes is way too far (it’s an hour and a half to bus there). Now they’ve already signed the lease and are moving in a couple days.  I’m upset because the only reason my boyfriend and everyone else are moving to the middle of nowhere is for Katie. If they didn’t need to find a house with a basement apartment they could’ve found something in the city.  I think my boyfriend should’ve refused to move somewhere so far just to make another guys girlfriend happy but he says that since I won’t be living there it doesn’t effect me. I’ve asked him to give me space and now we’re fighting. I’m sad he agreed to live in a place that is totally inaccessible for me just to appease his friends girlfriend.

4m1gwkd8	So basically, my last two exes used to be friends in college but they had a terrible friendship breakup after they graduated. We are all now 25 -- I didn't go to college with them or anything, I met them both, separately, when we were all 23. I found them both on the app Bumble.  We'll call them Ex1 and Ex2. I dated Ex1 for the first half of 2020 and Ex2 from around August 2020 - August 2021. My relationship with Ex1 was never deep or serious.  My relationship with Ex2 was a lot deeper as in we both had a lot more feelings for each other and respect and dated for longer than Ex1 and I did. Basically, Ex2 has a burning hatred for Ex1 from whatever happened in college with them. I don't know what exactly happened aside from "he was really shitty" and apparently was very mean to Ex2 and pushed him to the point of going on antidepressants when he was already at a terrible time in his life. I don't know more than that.  ANYWAY. Yesterday I met up with Ex2 for a drink after work, to catch up since we haven't seen each other in like 5 months and we wanted to try to be friends. He initiated this. It started out fine and good, we just talked about what was going on with work, friends, etc.  However, eventually Ex1 came up in the conversation and I mentioned something about I had talked to him a bit after Ex2 broke up with me. Ex1 did NOT like that and was visibly irritated. Then Ex1 straight up asked me "Did you hook up with Ex1 after we broke up??" I said yes because I did and I didn't want to lie about it. Well, this sent Ex1 into a total frenzy and he ceased all conversation, wanted to leave immediately. I finished my drink and we left and outside he started telling me how I was basically a terrible person for hooking up with Ex1 after Ex2 broke up with me.  He said that he still has a lot of feelings for me and he can't believe that I betrayed him like that (by hooking up with Ex1) and that it means I never cared about him or our relationship (which is not true at all...). Now, he doesn't want to be "friends" or talk to me ever again and thinks I am a bad person.  I completely understand why it sucks for Ex2 but my decision to hook up with Ex1 had nothing to do with him. I was not trying to "get back" at him or anything at all. I just wanted a hook up and didn't want to find a new random guy so I hit up my old ex, that's literally it.  AITA for doing that? I don't think I am but Ex1 is making me second guess myself. I'm also sad now because we had been on good terms even though we hadn't seen each other in months, and now he hates me and legit thinks I am a bad person.  Let me know your opinions. I feel really bad that I upset him but at the same time, I don't know who is in the wrong here and I feel like he flipped this whole thing on me.	1642800660.0	s9lic1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lic1/aita_for_not_lying_to_protect_his_feelings/	AITA for not lying to protect his feelings?
hzufwf4c	The teacher who I’m talking about is 56F and she is close to my mom in the work place, I go to school my mom goes to and she casually talks to me and my sibling. Needless to say, this teacher is very explosive and scary sometimes,  and can honestly cause a storm over anything. She also has a thing about shaming people and saying things out loud, for example one child had said that they are “fat” and this teacher had said that this child is basically “pretty much anorexic” Needless to say she thinks she’s so quiet,she even gave us all a 5 minute detention because the class was “too loud” and that all of the good kids would shame the bad kids through peer pressure into behaving.Tbf on her she has some pretty chill rules, like for example you can have headphones in. I thought me and her were pretty chill we sometimes talk  The issue was today when I was in my geography class, which was opposite to the teaching room that she teaches in, and we hear outside of the classroom massive shouting, a TA from the school was shouting at a child, all that could come out of the sentence was “I HEARD YOU MOCKING ANOTHER STUDENT!” and then more shouting, the people in the class recognised the face and picked up that it was Hannah. It wasn’t really until after class and lunch that thinks kicked off, I had sat down in her class like I usually do, until my mom finishes up her school work. I said kinda facing her but not really, “I heard shouting in third period today near the *Room*” she got very defensive and called out “Yes and the TA who said that got abused and I saw it” she then got angry and her face turned red then she said “If you implied- that I was gonna tell you because your the teachers daughter, then your wrong, I treat every student fairly! I will not talk about a teaching assistant behind her back” I had then looked down red faced as my tutor kept talking, at this point, Sandra’s daughter had walked in as she also walked there and honestly seemed scared. I honestly wanted to cry, and the more I think about it why did I even say that? I was clearly looking for an answer like what she said. But then a part of me is saying maybe I just wanted to talk to her and I had nothing to say. By this point Hannah had walked in and briskly said “What’s wrong?” before walking to the back of the classroom fast. She told Hannah everything and even said that I asked her about it. I didn’t even ask I said a statement. Sandra then told the rest of the TAs and my mom that I asked, and that she had told me off for it. After explaining to my mom the situation she was fine and chill, but am I the asshole?	1642801935.0	s9lzx8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lzx8/aita_backhanded_comment_to_teacher/	AITA backhanded comment to teacher?
glwxvp43	For context I (19f) had wisdom tooth surgery on the 12th this month. It wasn’t the worst pain but I didn’t feel great and my mother offered to help take care of me (I live with my grandparents and I didn’t want to put that responsibility on them). I got prescribed hydrocodone (norco) and it hit me pretty hard, I was extremely nauseous, couldn’t sleep, in a lot of pain and drowsy to shit. My mother had to be constantly reminded through text by my boyfriend to give me my meds and some food. I never asked her for anything once. 2 days after my surgery (I was still on pain medication and incredibly drowsy) she essentially made me go drop my grandmother off at the hair salon because she was too busy watching tv with my sister. So I had to go and drive my grandmother while still under the influence of opioids (I know this is my fault but my mother wouldn’t let me stay home). I  dropped my grandmother off and immediately had to pull over on the side of the road and puke because of how drowsy and nauseous I was. My boyfriend found out about my mother making me drive and confronted her about it and she just acted like a victim and tried to blame it on me for not taking my meds correctly (I was). Because of my pain meds (that I’ve been off of since Sunday) ive been very constipated and haven’t been able to use the restroom for over a week. I asked my mom today about possibly going to the hospital because I’m having severe abdominal pain, tried many laxatives, coffee and water and I called 3 different urgent cares who all told me to go to the ER. I called my mother to ask if she’d be okay with it because she’s the primary on my insurance and I might need some assistance with medical bills and she basically told me that the hospital wouldn’t help me and I’d be too scared of getting an enema (I’m not I’ve already tried one)  Tomorrow is my mom’s birthday and I’m reluctant to see or even say anything to her after what she did to me. Does that make me an asshole? Should I say happy birthday to her regardless or for my own sake should I just keep to myself and not be bother?	1642803286.0	s9mieu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9mieu/aita_for_not_wanting_to_say_happy_birthday_to_my/	AITA for not wanting to say happy birthday to my mom after what she did to me this week.
ca2hlbet	 Am I the asshole for not wanting to tell my SIL when we get pregnant?   This requires a bit of background. My boyfriend and I got together fairly soon after he ended a relationship with his ex. She broke up with him after cheating on him but was still upset when he moved on and kept begging him to take he back. He ended up blocking her but not her number as he was friends with her older sister who died and wanted to keep a line open in case she had any kind of issues with it.   This ex told a close friend of his that she was pregnant soon after we moved in together. She also posted about it on Facebook but then took it down. My boyfriends sister who I will refer to as SIL told us about going out to a bar with her as they are friends and my boyfriend was confused about why as she was supposed to be pregnant. My SIL said that she was not pregnant nor was she ever that she understands. I suspect that she did it for attention after learning we moved in together but I am not sure. She does drink regularly and could have miscarried or just lied but the SIL believes she never was and did not elaborate.   My boyfriend and I have talked it over and are trying to conceive. We want to wait until it is easier to travel before having a wedding as we have extended family and friends around the country that we want to celebrate with us. We have the money, the space, the stability on our relationship. But I am dreading having to tell his sister because of this ex. I’m worried she will try to come back into our lives. I only have Facebook as my social media and have about 50 people on it who are only family or very close friends. I otherwise have no other way that she could personally contact me but still worry that she would get my number somehow.   I wanted to tell my sisters we are trying and when we find out as I am the oldest and it would be the first baby in our family.  Otherwise I want to wait until the end of the first trimester to share any news.   However I would not want to tell my boyfriends sister due to this. I know she would not mean to let it slip but they do drink regularly together and I would be afraid of something being said. I don’t know how much this girl wants to still get back together with my boyfriend and I completely trust him but I don’t want any kind of added stress or anxiety.   Would I be the asshole if I didn’t tell my SIL I’m pregnant when I want to tell other family members?	1642803588.0	s9mmee	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9mmee/aita_if_i_do_not_want_to_tell_my_sil_when_i_am/	AITA if I do not want to tell my SIL when I am pregnant?
d4efh80x	I (28f) have been in a relationship for 2 years with my partner (26m). He is pretty liberal (left wing) and generally believes in people being able to identify and express themselves as they wish.  I am very passionate about human rights, gender equality, racial equality, etc and often go off on long rants about peoples rights to exist and not be discriminated against.  Recently we had a slightly inebriated conversation about a couple of comments from work colleagues (we work at the same place), I knew of these comments before had and I also knew of my bf’s offence at them but I admit to at I had assumed he offence had stemmed from the comments being sexist. It came to light during said conversation that he had been offended because he found the comments belittling not sexiest.  For context the first comment was in regards to him crossing his legs and him being called gay for this….. the second comment was him being called “a girl” because he liked stationary.   I initially agreed that these comments were offensive, but the revelation during our most recent conversation had me telling him they were not offensive for the reasons he quoted, I.e. being belittled, but we’re in fact offensive due to the assumption being “gay or feminine” was derogatory. He said I was holding him to a high standard of morality for not picking up on this and that I should know him better. I disagreed and said that he clearly had some internalised misogyny he needed to work on.    The evening ended with him expressing I was being unfair and I ran out of energy to defend my stance so I left the conversation.  Am I the asshole and do I hold him to an unobtainable standard of morals?	1642804555.0	s9mzl4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9mzl4/aitah_when_i_questioned_why_my_bf_was_offended_by/	AITAH when I questioned why my BF was offended by a sexist joke
ivtj5w3x	Hello everybody!   I (22nb) moved back in with my family last year due to an emergency. So I now live with my step siblings. For context, my step siblings were adopted and are all different races. They’re Mexican, Black, and Indigenous. They were either adopted at birth or as toddlers so grew up with my stepmom, who is white. To my understanding she has done her best to keep them tied to their cultures as much as possible.   Ever since moving in I’ve been a tad isolated. I’ve made a few friends online from gaming and lgbtq+ groups.  There’s one girl (19f) I’ve become especially close to and have talked to her about my family situation. For context, she’s Indigenous. She has expressed concerns about a white family adopting people of color, but as I was a child and didn’t even know my stepmother when she adopted them there’s not exactly anything I could have done about it at the time. I do now try to help them if they show any interest in their culture and try to be sensitive and understanding about the disconnect they might be feeling having been raised in a white household.   She’s mostly let it go despite a few quips and seems to realize it’s not exactly in my control.   However we have a new problem. We were video calling while playing a game online and I got up to use the bathroom. I flipped the camera from my desk to my bed so she could see my dogs and not just my window.   By the time I got back she had hung up and had thrown a whole bunch of messages at me that she saw my dream catcher above my bed and that she refused to play with someone that appropriated Indigenous cultures for aesthetics and that it was no wonder my siblings felt disconnected from their cultures if they lived with a racist like me.   I tried to explain to her how I got the dream catcher and the context but she refused and blasted me in our online group chat, telling everyone I’m a racist that is probably terrible to my POC siblings.   Now to explain the dream catcher. I know now that if you’re white and getting a dream catcher that you should only get one as a gift from an Indigenous person or support them by paying for their work. But I got this dream catcher nearly 16 years ago and it was homemade by my older sister. I was around 6 and she was in her freshman year and learned how to make them in one of her classes as an arts and crafts project. When she came home with one I asked for one too, and she gathered what’s supplies she could find and helped “me” (I mostly watched seeing as I was 6) make one. We made it out of rubber bands and my moms yarn and some cheap plastic beads and feathers. I loved it because we made it together (well she made it) and it’s been above my head in every place I’ve slept since that day. It’s old and raggedy now, but I can’t ask for a replacement from my sister, as she passed away nearly 5 years ago in a car accident. I have maybe an unhealthy attachment to it, as when I moved here initially and it was still at my exes home I cried and couldn’t sleep until I got it back.   I don’t want to offend anyone, but I’m struggling with the idea of throwing it away or hiding it out of sight because it feels like I’d be hiding my sister away. But I’m scared to offend anyone or to be harassed for being racist for it. So WIBTA if I just left it where it was?	1642805156.0	s9n7le	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9n7le/wibta_if_i_didnt_get_rid_of_a_dream_catcher_even/	WIBTA if I didn’t get rid of a dream catcher even though I’m white?
ivwg95il	Recently, I (M23) organised a dinner with friends as a get together as I hadn't seen some of them for a while. I did all the cooking and put a lot of consideration, time and effort into it. One of my friends (M24) said that he would bring wine. I told him that I could buy the wine myself, but he insisted so in the end, I just let him bring it.  However, on the night of the dinner, he arrived with ONE bottle of a cheap $5 wine that had a screw cap. So yeah, I got upset at him and told him that if he's going to bring shit wine, then he shouldn't say that he will bring wine at all.  Some of my friends think I was an asshole to get upset at him for this since he only wanted to help out, but I've never asked him for help and if you make things worse by helping, then you're not helping. I want to note that this is not a broke man, he makes much more than me. But even if he couldn't afford any better, it's irrelevant because once again, I never asked him to bring wine.

4wq4uihl	I, 16F, have a friend, 16M, and he has an ex-GF. They weren't on good terms apparently and I made it even worse. Basically today, he texted me that his ex-gf and her friend got high and decided to go out (at night) with two random guys they met on Omegle in their car. He told me she stopped responding and he got concerned (rightfully for many reasons) I too got concerned because I thought they could easily be endangered.  Here's where I fucked up. I convinced him to try and call her, he did and she or her friend didn't pick up. I thought maybe there were other mutual friends they had that he could get to contact her, he said he didn't know anyone. She didn't have her location on Snapchat either. I told him to try and call her again a few times, she ignored his calls and I thought I would try to call her too from my foreign number (I live abroad) just to see if she would pick up. She did and I quickly hung up and texted him that she's safe. I was really worried for her safety considering the situation, little did I know how much I actually fucked things over.  She then texted him to "stop", probably to stop calling her and stuff like that, they already weren't on the best terms but we both hoped maybe they could somehow work things out and I realized how much I made him fuck things over even more with her. She's probably even more annoyed at him now and I feel absolutely awful. I know it's all my fault and I feel really guilty. I apologized to him a lot and can't imagine how bad he must feel.  I thought I was just encouraging him to call her for her safety, I probably shouldn't have gotten involved in this at all...

b1k1m7sc	I found out I’m expecting which is amazing news and all family members are elated.     My family lives in a different country apart from my younger sister who studies in the town where I live. She’s financially supported by my family who send most of the money they earn to get her through uni.  I’ve said to my mum many times that I wanted her to come and help me when I have kids and she’d always say yes. This is very common in our culture.  Recently my mother told me that she will come and help me with the baby for ‘a month or so’ when I return to work. I’ll be off for a year on maternity. I’m going to be a first-time mom, the whole thing petrifies me and the only person I’d want by my side after I give birth is my mother.   She and dad said they’ll come to visit once the baby is born but can only stay for a few days.   So I’ve been feeling upset because I want my mum to be here. I understand it’ll put a financial strain on them but also my sister can get a part-time job and this will all be sorted.  My sister is turning 23 an it is now obvious she likes not working and wants to keep it this way. To know that’s the reason why my child won’t see their grandparents for longer seems pretty unfair to me.    So this has been brewing for a few weeks now and the pregnancy hormones are not helping either. It got to the point where I couldn’t pretend everything is okay anymore so I said to them to leave me be (sis included).

f8q3ru6j	Hey everyone, I [26, M] have been talking to this guy [26, M] who was mega into me for so long. I started working with him at Lush (briefly, he left for another job that was lined up somewhere else).  I swear he used to be mega into me and then suddenly… when I was available, he wasn't. And now I'm getting mixed signals rather than a clear indication one way or the other on how he feels.  He avoided me after I started working with him, sexted me and said he just dissociates in work and told me he wasn't for dating because of a recent break up.  Then he got back to avoiding me and replying to the odd message (when I sent a snap to loads of people) with awkward small talk.  I spent a while yesterday making a really nice personal message of a thing he might like tonight, only for him to reply "thanks x"!  That's when I decided fuck him I'm done.  He had been initiating sexting with me for months but I guess he either dreads anything more than just sex or he just saw me as a body.

i6w1yl9c	I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years. Our relationship is very strong and we are both very happy. I work at a part-time job, it’s a really nice jobs where I can schedule the days I want to work. My boyfriend works full-time as a manager at a popular restaurant so he makes bank.   So on break while at work I was talking to my work friend, She was talking about the guys she was talking about laughing at the red flags they are giving and just having a good time. We hadn’t seen each other in a couple weeks so we were just updating each other. After she was done talking I made a comment how I seriously lucked out in the boyfriend department. I told her how he pays all the bills and helps me if I need money. I then went on about all the stuff he got me for my birthday and etc (she was just asking about her ex and how stingy he was with money). Someone who wasn’t in our conversation at all and I really didn’t know, like never said a word to him… just laughed and said “that’s not healthy that’s really toxic” I was taken back and was like “no my boyfriend and I have a really strong relationship, we both are really happy” and my friend was also backing me up too. He then went on to talk about how I was “dependent” on him and etc. I was really annoyed because he doesn’t even know who I am and all he knows is this small conversation not explaining anything at all. He then went on to say what would I do if we break up and I just started ignoring him.   Currently my boyfriend is planning on proposing, so I’m no way near worried about us breaking up. I’m also not planning on having him provide forever. I’m currently on a waitlist to a college to work towards my dream job. I actually hoped he would take off but he doesn’t like not doing anything so he’ll more than likely continue to work.   I decided to just write a “case” to HR about it because it really annoyed me. Now Im starting to feel bad, so AITA?	1642810787.0	s9p99i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9p99i/aita_for_reporting_my_coworker_to_hr/	AITA for reporting my coworker to HR?
1roqc7er	My wife's friend is on the chunky side and is always complaining about her weight. She is a Real Estate agent in a large pricey city. So I get that looks would matter in her profession. She already got a breast augmentation done and gets lip injections.  She plans to get liposuction done soon and was talking to my wife about it. As someone who does excercise regularly I told her to hold off and try dieting and exercising first.  Liposuction is meant for people who are already maintaining good eating and excercise habits and want to remove stubborn areas. Not against her getting the procedure done but she has not made any effort to change her lifestyle.   I told her liposuction can only remove so much. It also doesn't stop the body from storing fat. It just means that fat will get stored elsewhere. It also means that you can end up with more visceral fat (the bad kind that clogs your arteries). So it would be in her interest to try and lose weight the healthy way first.  She got upset and said I am fat shaming her. Told me as a "skinny person" that I don't understand the struggles overweight people have to endure. I know I could have kept my mouth shut but I was trying to give her some advice.

bpdccv7e	I (26F) have been dating a guy (30M) for a few months now. As a bit of background, I was in a long term relationship with a man before this who tried to maintain financial control over me, and was always trying to manipulate me to doing what he wanted. Since I've gotten out of that relationship, I am EXTREMELY independent and will not be manipulated.   Now, I am getting my masters degree as well as working 60 hours per week at 3 jobs. I am always extremely busy, and essentially only come home to sleep. My free time is essentially afternoons on Saturdays and Sundays so I use it to study and see friends and family typically. I usually alternate who I see depending on several factors.   Recently, the guy I've been seeing has been very clingy. He gets extremely upset if I choose to see other people on my day off and if he's not invited to it if I do. It's been extremely annoying, but I also do feel bad as I know he feels neglected.   A couple of days ago, he asked me to quit two of my jobs (leaving one I work around 25 hours per week at). I said this would not be possible. He then explained that he felt extremely ignored, lonely, and that I didn't care about him. He also said that my roommates see me everyday. I said I apologize that he feels neglected, but I do text him any chance I get, one day per weekend is typically dedicated to him. I also mentioned that the most my roommates see me is when I eat dinner, then immediately go to bed. He said that he still felt like I wasn't taking his feelings into consideration.   I then told him that my financial situation wasn't great, and asked what bills he could pay for me if I quit. He said that I could ask for a raise. I said this still would not cover my bills at all. He then went on a long rant about how he felt like he wasn't even in a relationship, because all he does all day is sit around and wait on me. I said, "Well, that sounds like you should maybe get a hobby."   He got up, said "Yeah sure I can get a hobby, not just date a girl who actually wants to spend time with me." and stormed out. It's been a couple days and he's texted me a couple times to see if I've quit yet and I haven't said much. I will not be quitting unless it's something I have chosen to do and is financially feasible.  My friends said that while they don't agree quitting my jobs is right, my comment was rude and condescending. And that it probably affirmed him thinking I don't care.

564h2yoi	Throwaway because I don’t want anything personal tied to this and I’m on mobile, apologies in advance for typos.  I’ll monitor this account for a few days before getting rid of it, so if additional information is needed, please comment.   I work in an environment that deals in a lot of emergency situations and information collection.  Recently, 4 of my coworkers began to brag about using drugs and it’s evident that they have shown up to work intoxicated in some way.  Recently though, one of my coworkers gave money to another to purchase drugs for them.  I spoke to a supervisor and gave him my blessing to go to management.  Now, the entire shift is suspended, excluding me, and pending investigation.  They’re already asking around on social media to try to figure out who reported them.  I know at least 2 of them liked the job and one has a kid, which if he gets fired he will lose his income.  I fear they will retaliate if they find out it was me.

27v8h11d	My partner (35M) and his sister (32F), who I'll call SIL, lost their remaining parent halfway through 2021, following a terminal illness.   At the time, my partner and I lived separately. SIL had lived with their parent prior to their death about 75 miles away.   My partner offered to let his sister stay with him while she got onto her feet with a job etc in our area.  She hoped to buy a house near us.   My partner believed she had no savings for a deposit. He wanted to help by letting her stay with him.   SIL did not move down. She took more than 6 months and did no job hunting at all.    In that time, I moved in with my partner. I own my own house and my plan is to finish doing it up and sell it.   SIL eventually moved down after I found her a job. SIL made it clear that she did not want to "share her space" with me, so asked to move into my house. My partner assured me she would be happy covering the cost of the house (mortgage is small and bills are low) and would be fine with us continuing to do small pieces of work on the house. I said I just wanted to have basic expenses covered, which essentially amounted to a room rent rate. She was furious. I was accused of trying to profit from her, she stated she was due "free living".  My partner and I suggested moving my own sister in to one of the other rooms (she needs somewhere to stay) and they could split the bills. She refused.   SIL stated that we would compromise and moved in. The "compromise" turned out to be refusing to pay a penny in rent. She quit her the job I got her after a few weeks (she has now got another).   When I wanted to collect some of my personal belongings, I was told it would be breaking and entering. She is not allowing access for us to do small jobs in the house.  She ran up huge energy bills in my name by having the heat set to max. She ignored me when I messaged her about it.  I told the energy company that I'd moved and she is now having to pay her utilities. Since then, the heating has been turned down.   She's been in my house for 3 months and shows no signs of leaving. I've suggested she ask the bank about a mortgage and have asked her for a timescale. She won't give me a timescale and has never called the bank. Turns out, she already has a deposit saved!    I've been frozen out as she only really communicates through my partner. My relationship with her has gone. She is  liking living essentially for free and, unfortunately, now that she is in the property, she has legal rights.  I want to serve her an eviction notice, which would give her 3 months to leave. My partner was deeply upset and says his sister needs somewhere to stay.  She is my partner's last family member. My partner's desire to help her is because it's what their parent would have wanted. I may be being unfair.  AITA?   TLDR: SIL moved into my house. She refuses to pay rent or say when she will move out. I want to serve an eviction notice to protect myself. My partner is upset with me for this.	1642812500.0	s9puzd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9puzd/aita_for_wanting_to_evict_my_sil/	AITA for wanting to evict my SIL
ivzd9ed1	Sorry for bad format, I'm on mobile  Hi, so when I (24f) born, my dad rushed to the hospital and stopped by the gift shop to buy me a little stuffed bear. It was always special to me and I've kept it ever since. Recently, I got pregnant and found out I was having a girl. I was super excited, and I was going to give my bear to her to pass it on and such.  Well, Ive been helping my boyfriend (28m) raise my stepdaughter (7) for about three years. Her mom skipped town and then came back, but is probably going to skip town again. She's not I'm my stepdaughters life much. I treat her like my daughter and I care very deeply about her. Most of the time, I refer to her as my daughter and she calls me by my name.  Well, the problem is, I was talking to my boyfriend and I told him I wanted to give my bear to our baby when she's born. My stepdaughter overheard and told me she wanted it. I told her no, that it was special to me and I wanted to give it to her baby sister when she's born. My stepdaughter said I should give it to her since she's my daughter too. I told her no, but that made her angry.  She told me I was horrible for not letting her have it and left. I felt horrible after she left, but it's something I really want to save for my baby when she's born. Am I the asshole?	1642812779.0	s9pygz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pygz/aita_for_not_giving_my_special_bear_to_my/	AITA for not giving my special bear to my step-daughter and to my real daughter?
hm9g5r2s	My roommate and I live in a small, rural, Midwestern town in an apartment complex in town. When I mean rural, I mean 20 minutes to the next decently sized town. There is a small university in our town and quite a few fast food restaurants, but only one coffee shop. That said, I love coffee. I drink it all the time. I also love going to coffee shops to do my homework (as I am currently a college student).  My roommate works at the only coffee shop in town which is about a five minute drive away from where we live so obviously I frequent it quite a lot to get work done. The next nearest shop is in the next town over which is about a 15–20 minute drive depending on how fast you drive. Certainly a more economic decision to go to the shop in town.  When my roommate and I first moved in together I quickly found out that we were both coffee aficionados: we both own several methods of brewing coffee and the kitchen is always well-stocked with fresh coffee. Nobody else in my life really shares this passion for coffee that I have, and in true ADHDer fashion I would talk about it quite frequently. Admittedly, probably too much. She told me at a certain point that she'd appreciate it if I would refrain from talking to her about coffee when she was off from work as it felt too much like "talking shop." I thought it a bit of a strange request but of course I obliged, I wouldn't want to come home and talk about making pizza all night. So I thought that issue was resolved.  Now, as I've established, I go into the coffee shop where she works quite frequently, several times a week. I certainly stay out of her way and don't engage in unnecessary conversation unless she prompts the conversation, I try to be a normal customer and get in and get out. You know, basic decency. Well, tonight, I got home from work and she had been back for a few hours (she worked the opening shift, I worked a midshift and had gone to get a bit of homework done for a few hours prior). The long and short of it is that she told me that she would appreciate it if I would stop coming into the shop and instead maybe go to the one in the next town more often than not. She said that she didn't like having the person that she lived with at her place of employment when she was working, she said it would be like her coworkers hanging out at our apartment when she wasn't working. I said that hypothetically, if I were friends with one or more of her coworkers, that it would be unreasonable for her to expect me to not bring them over to visit on her off days, and therefore—using her own analogy—it's unreasonable for her to expect me not to go to her workplace to get work done frequently. She of course disagreed, the conversation more or less fizzled out, and it was left unresolved.

54zxcc06	We’ve been best friends for 8 years and have only ever fought once. This winter break (we’re both in college) I would text her to hang out and we had plans to celebrate her birthday, but she always had an excuse to not hang out. I also went through a break up and was really sad about it, and we texted about it and I just wanted to spend at least an hour just to not feel alone. I don’t think she’s purposely avoiding me, but she didn’t even try to find time to hang out and we didn’t see each other for a month. I didn’t think much of it, I just decided to stop reaching out and wait for her to.   Today she texted me saying I should go out with her and her other friends, and I said I could come but I’d have to come 2 hours after they planned because they didn’t want to miss happy hour. She told me so last minute or else I could’ve made it, and it seemed like everyone else knew and could plan for it. AITA for asking to wait like 2 hours? I just feel like I would choose my friend over happy hour and go out a little later because we all would usually go out later anyways. And AITA for being upset? I don’t want to ruin her night with her other friends, but I just feel a little disappointed. She told me to go out tomorrow with them, but I have plans with my family. I could leave earlier to make it and I wanna go out and see my friend, but now I just feel in a bad mood about it and idk if I should go.

dylhoquf	My mom has been taking classes to try and get a certificate so she can inspect homes. She’s in her 3rd year of retirement and did very well for herself, so this is more of a “for fun” type of thing to keep herself busy.   I’m a designer who works for a very big name tech company. I make a very good living, but I work long hours and my job is stressful.   My mom approached me the other day and told me that she’s planning on putting together a website for her “new business”. She asked if I could help. I told her “of course you can come to me with any questions you have!” But she wants me to design her a website from scratch. This is my day job so I know how much work goes into designing even a website with a couple of pages. I asked her if she knew what she wanted on this website, and she told me “no, I was hoping you could figure that out for me”. I’ve freelanced before, and a project requiring research, prototyping, testing, interface design, possibly logo design… normally I’d charge a lot for that. And with the amount of corporate work in my portfolio already, this isn’t even something I could showcase for myself.   Additionally, I feel that she’ll do a couple of home inspections and then lose interest, and then all of my work will go down the drain. She has no idea how much work goes into starting a business.   I got annoyed at her and told her how long it would take me, and how I didn’t really appreciate being asked to do something this time consuming for free. She got pissed and said she couldn’t believe I was asking to be paid when she’s my mother. I haven’t texted her back, I just feel taken advantage of.

ivx026f3	 My daughter and her husband (both 20s) are expecting a baby boy, Shortly after finding out the gender the name discussion has occured. I called my daughter to try and have a conversation about potential names she and her husband might consider and she kept putting it off til yesterday when she and her husband said they had already decided on a name. I wasn't too thrilled about because big deals like names should be consulted with family but that is not the entire issue. They went ahead and announced the name which, and to be completely honest, I did not like at all. In fact, I told them it was a poor choice and kind of expected because they didn't consult us first, my husband agreed. But my daughter and her husband got very upset that they couldn't even finish dinner and left in a hurry.   My daughter called to let me know that I spoiled her joy by my reaction to the name and said there is an emotional story behind this name and I disrespected that. I apologized but said that was my opinion. She argued that I was just acting salty because I didn't get a say in the name but it really wasn't about that and my opinion on the name was just my honest opinion. She hung up after saying I behaved terribly.  I think that I was just giving my opinion regardless of anything else, really. I don't know why they got so worked up over it.  The name they picked is : "Ayrton".	1642817155.0	s9rdxk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9rdxk/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_and_son_in_law_my/	AITA for giving my daughter and son in law my honest opinion about the name they picked for my grandson?
eptkqbyf	 My husband had a work thing at a new brewery/restaurant and asked me to meet him there when it was done at 6pm for a date night.   We have an infant so haven’t been out in awhile for a date or to this new place.   When I arrived, there were at least 30 other people waiting for a table and my husband was sitting at the table they used for the work thing which was capable of sitting at least 15-20 people.  It had their dirty plates and cups still on it.  He was at the table alone, waiting for me and when I sat down he mentioned that he was sitting at that table because he saw the line and didn’t want to get a new table for us (and thought we should sit at the huge one that his party had just left).  He also said he already ate.  After mentioning that we shouldn’t take up a huge table for just us and realizing that he already ate, I asked what he wanted to do - go somewhere else, etc.?    He didn’t really offer any ideas and seemed like he didn’t really care so we walked around the area for a few minutes and drove back home separately.   At home, I told him I was annoyed that I spent time getting ready and out of the house (with a baby!) and asked him why he asked me to meet him there.  He now says he “would have eaten more” and that he is annoyed with me because he went to the trouble of making plans at a new place and I am ungrateful.	1642817301.0	s9rfj5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9rfj5/aita_or_did_my_husband_ruin_date_night/	AITA or did my husband ruin date night?
iw2fq7g8	My boyfriend (25) and I (23F) have been dating for close to a year and a half, not a crazy amount of time but a decently significant time period together. His mom, (43) I feel has disliked me from the beginning.   I have always been civil towards her and have tried to be kind and treat her with respect. She did the same in the beginning but soon after we passed the 4 months mark she began becoming cold and rude towards me. She would constantly give her opinion on topics that did not have to do with her and that had been a private topic my bf and I had been discussing, she would give her opinion and when I or my bf didn’t agree with her she would get very upset.   This continued for a while until she seemingly reached a breaking point when my bf had asked her when they would be getting back from a family trip to Florida and when she replied with the date he realized he would be missing a day I invited him to join my family in because my extended family would be in the state for a funeral and I wanted him to meet them. He told her this and she became furious and began screaming at him and telling him that he cared more about my family than he did his own. She also told him that she didn’t recognize her son anymore and that I was changing him completely. This was all while my bf was trying to leave to go to work. He told me all of this, plus more that she had said and I didn’t know what to feel. I didn’t feel as if I had done any of this or had tried but I immediately felt like an asshole and attempted to change my behavior going on.  Skip foreword a couple months and the same issue occurred but this time on his birthday. I had told him to open the birthday gifts i had gotten him before we went to dinner with his family so that his whole family didn’t have to see him open cheesy gifts I got him that were only special to us, his mom chose to watch him open these gifts. One of the gifts was a promise ring that I wanted to gift him at the location that we first met. After we got back the same thing occurred with his mother flipping out about me but talking to him about it and this time she told him I caused his eating disorder. I stood crying in the corner not knowing what to even do. I struggle with an ed myself so this comment was hardest for me to hear.

ic11vq5v	I (M30) have been with my partner (F25) for a year. Her friend Alex is the only friend of hers I’ve met (lockdowns, pandemic etc). I don’t mind Alex, but neither my partner or I are particularly fond of Alex’s partner Riley.   Riley and I have quite different worldviews and values, and it’s lead to tension in the past. Riley is, politely, quite old fashioned, comes from an old money family, with very traditional views about women, sexuality and immigration. I’m the exact opposite. Until recently though, I’ve had no problems playing nice with Riley for dinner and drinks, but a couple of months ago, while helping them move apartments, Riley decided he would treat himself to a session in the new apartment complex’s sauna, leaving the rest of us to assemble his furniture. After, I expressed to my partner that I was done with biting my tongue around Riley whenever he made a misogynistic or self-centered comment, and that I’d like to reduce the amount of time I spent around him. My partner agreed, and I thought that was that.   Last week I found out that Alex pitched a couples’ ski trip to my partner next month, which she agreed to without consulting me. I have no interest in skiing - I’ve never skiied, I don’t have any equipment, and I don’t like the cold. If it was something my partner wanted to do just the two of us, I would probably bite the bullet and give it a shot for the sake of our relationship. However, getting trapped in a cabin with Riley for a few days is not something I particularly want.   I have never, and would never, pressure my partner into spending time with people she’s not comfortable with. When my partner broke the news about the trip to me, I was a bit annoyed, but politely stated that while I didn’t mind if she went, I wasn’t really interested myself. This has now started a huge fight between us, with my partner saying that couples trips were “expected” among her friends, and that saying no would disappoint and offend Alex and Riley, and possibly end their friendship.   My partner then said that while she “understood my concerns,” her “life would be a lot easier” if Riley and I got along. I pointed out that she didn’t like Riley either, and her response was “if I can pretend to like him for Alex’s sake you can,” and “relationships mean you do things you don’t want to”. I asked if one trip would be the end of it, and my partner conceded not. She isn’t taking no for an answer.  I’m annoyed because I feel like my partner pressuring me to keep to a plan that I wasn’t consulted about makes me feel like I’m being manipulated, because my partner seems to care more about losing face and disappointing her friend than causing a rift in our relationship, and because the ideal of an instagrammable couples’ vacation seems to mean more to everyone than the reality that it will probably be an unpleasant time for all of us.

Ash and I used to work together until she moved away with her husband and daughter, her husband is in the military and got restationed.  Skip to a month ago we ran into eachother, turns out she moved back and her husband got out of the military. Also, turns out she had another kid, a boy. We become friends of Facebook and she starts immediately wanting to hang out. We make plans twice to hang out and both times she canceled. A few weeks rolls by and she messages me asking if I can watch her pets, because her landlord is coming over and asked the pets and children be removed from the premises. I said, "My apartment is having some work done and I'm not allowed to have more then 1 pet. I have a dog already, but maybe we can work around the dates that they come to have the work done" she asks me, "ok when will they be there?" I said, "idk let me find out I'm sure they will be here on Monday or Wednesday" (Mind you I don't pick what days they come over to do this work) she immediately messages me back and says, "well I just scheduled it for Monday so I will be there Monday." I felt this was very rude but I let it slide.   Monday comes, her dog vomits all in the car and as soon as she pulls up she starts demanding I clean it, Ash seemed like a very sweet person up until this point. I kindly told her no, that I would help her and bring her stuff to clean it. As she's cleaning it I bring the animals she had into my apartment and getting them all set up. By the time I come out, she's done cleaning. I ask if she'd like to come inside and she said she wanted to go out. I get in her car and we go to a shopping center. Then entire time she's talking about how she has no money and wishes she could buy this and that. She's a SAHM and both her and her husband are living off his retirement money, (he's a bit older then us).   We decide to come back to my apartment as soon as we got in the car she says, "oh I wish I had a pizza, I don't have money for pizza" I thought this was werid and just ignored it. When we were getting the kids out of the car she said, "oh wow yeah my kids would love pizza they really love pizza but I don't have the money" again I ignore her. We get inside and her kids instantly start getting into things, dumping water, and causing a huge mess. She doesn't do much to stop them, kinda laughs it off. I wasn't really mad about this bc they are kids and I expected them to be curious.   She then is sitting on my bed playing with her pet (my bedroom was where I put one of her pets) and talking about how her and her kids NEED pizza and starts showing me a ton of ads for pizza. At this point the only thing she'd talk about is pizza. As she's showing me the ads her husband texted her that they were all done. She quickly whips her phone back swipes the notification away and shows me more pizza. I start getting her, her kids, and her pets ready to go down stairs.  She gets clearly frustrated and asked if I would by her pizza. I said, "isn't your inspection done?" She said it wasn't and they are really really hungry. Mind you we've only been hanging out for a few hours and I've offer her and her kids food but she would only except a pizza that's delivered. (she knows that I've been looking for work and have been out of work for family care and I felt like she was just trying to use me at this point, that this wasn't just a friendly engagement) I said that I already ate, and again, she's allowed to have anything in the fridge. 'Suddenly', she says the inspection is done and starts going to the car. I help her put all the animals and her kids back in the car and she confronted me about not buying her stuff or pizza. That it was really rude to 'invite' her over and not buy her stuff ESPECIALLY since she has kids and I should have put her kids first. I said, "well maybe we can get pizza next time" just bc I wanted this to be over so bad. She left.   She got home and messaged me about the inspection and how she will probably have to have me watch all her pets and kids with her again at my apt and will give me 24 hrs notice each time. I said, "well maybe we can just hang out one day for fun" she said "maybe idk about that" at this point I stop opening up her messages and stop replying. She can see that I haven't read her messages. She has now over the past week sent me 20+ messages about how I need to run her multiple more favors and do a ton of other things for her. She keeps saying she really needs me to do this. I feel really bad, but I also feel like I'm just being used. AITA for not helping her even tho she might be kicked out if I dont?	1642822195.0	s9sz2y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9sz2y/aita_for_not_helping_a_friend_in_need/	AITA for not helping a friend in need?
14q7dj	I went to the dollar store and when I pulled into the parking spot I noticed this womans car *filled* with garbage and other belongings, to the roof. personally, thats her decision. it just caught my eye. some people mentioned that she may be living in her car, again, thats not the issue i have.   when i went into dollarama, i forgot a mask so i had to go back to my car. when i looked into her car, i saw a small dog (shitzu/multipoo/mixed breed) visibly shaking. i figured the owner must just be coming out. i go in the store for 45 minutes and when i come out, this womans car is still there and the dog is still there. at this point im alarmed and another woman said that she had been there for a half an hour before i got there and the car was there when she pulled in.   obviously alarm bells went off and i went into protective dog mom mode. i asked the dollar store if there was anyone that had that car in the store, they paged the overhead system multiple times to see if she would come out, and she didnt. I went to other stores in the plaza to also do an overhead page, and nothing. This took an additional 20 minutes. They eventually just told me to call the police, so i did.   finally 10 mins go by (at this point its almost two hours) while im at the car trying to figure out how to get this dog out to be wrapped up in a blanket, this woman comes out of the dollar store (after ignoring all of the pages) i asked her if this was her car and why she let her pup sit in there for such a long period of time. its currently -15, i saw no food/water for this pup and he wasnt wearing a dog coat. ofc the police didnt show up, but they gave me a number to report the incident to PAWS and send the videos.   people are saying that im TA for filming the altercation between us, where i called her disgusting. I called her disgusting for leaving her dog in the car, not for the things in the car. I recorded the things in the car to show that even if the dog wanted to try and find a warmer place to be, it couldnt due to the amount of stuff. Her living in her car was just an assumption made by others based off of the interior of her car. I dont feel like I’m TA, as it was a dangerous situation for her dog.   Personally, i feel like since she left with all 4 windows in tact and her dog, she got lucky.  *The lady left and the dog was able to get warm.*  tldr; a woman (who may or may not live in her car) left her dog in her car in -15 weather for almost 2 hours, i filmed the confrontation after trying to find her for 30 minutes and called her disgusting after briefly showing the interior of the car to show the condition she left the dog in. People think I’m TA.	1642823267.0	s9tb4g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tb4g/aita_for_filming_a_confrontation_with_a_woman_who/	AITA for filming a confrontation with a woman who left her dog in the car in -15 weather?
57usfyqn	Am I the asshole for requesting a raise for myself and my employees?  I currently make $10/hr cash. Minimum wage in NY is $13.20/hr but obviously taxes and all that jazz are taken out. The employees under me only make $8/hr.  For context; I am related to the owners of this store and have been apart of this store since they opened 5 years ago  I manage the store. I work 5 days a week, complete all the orders, handle any employee or customer issues, make the schedule, hire/fire people ECT. The owners don't work in the store at all. A person responsible for these tasks at a larger store would be making more than MW, as they are in a supervisory position.  I've previously brought up an increase in pay to the owners. I was basically told that our jobs are not that difficult and what we actually do during a shift is only worth what we are being paid.  I admit, even my job as the store manager isn't difficult. The store is small, laid back with a good amount of downtime between customers on slow days. My regular customers are great and I really do enjoy the field I'm working in, but can't help but feel that we are being taken advantage of when we could all easily make $5 more per hour, at least, at any big store.	1642824157.0	s9tldd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tldd/aita_for_wanting_to_be_paid_minimum_wage_at_a/	AITA for wanting to be paid minimum wage at a family owned small business?
81txqwum	Last 2 days me and my girlfriend started arguing and we've been a little distant. She was mad at me and today we started taking and almost Broke up. We where talking about our relationship and out of now where she said she wanted to die, I was so confused and asked why and my reaction was not that good since In the past she has tried to manipulate me when arguing saying thinks similar to what she said today and all those times I stopped arguing and try to make her feel better. But this time it was different because in the past weeks she was fine and happy and we have talked about how we felt and everything was apparently good. If she had told this before of course my reaction would have been completely different but she said it just when we were discussing If we should break up and I started asking her why now and not before, why would she said that to me in the worst possible moment. Why when I asked before how she felt she told me she was feeling better than ever, and now that we are fighting she completely change what she said 4 days ago, also she told me this is recen and she started filling this way this week.  Because of my reaction she told she is never going to tell me her feelings again and left. I don't know if should have acted differently but I think she was just trying to make me feel bad. I'm really worried it's true what she said and I don't know what to do, she doesn't want to talk me.	1642824774.0	s9trxw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9trxw/aita_for_having_a_bad_reaction/	AITA for having a bad reaction

g0qbgsgk	For context: I have an ex boyfriend Mark (fake names) and he has a friend named Kyle (fake names) and Seth (fake names). Mark and I ended on bad terms and he has been talking bad about me without me saying anything. I’m on a discord server with them, and whenever I join call Mark will say “who invited you” or say something snarky or mock me. One time in a call, while i wasn’t there, Mark was saying some pretty vile things about me. Like “they’re annoying” and “should’ve taken kyles advice when he said not to stick you d*ck in crazy”.  Kyle was laughing and saying some things about me being annoying too. Seth recorded this interaction and told me and sent me it to let me know what was happening. I was hurt by both of them, and i ended up sending the clip to kyle and confronting him. at first, he seemed surprised and genuinely sorry, then he started going after Seth about violating their privacy and breaking their trust. Kyle kept saying that he could never trust Seth again.   So, AITA for being involved in this as the title says?

iso114f1	Hi, I am working in a company that plans and conduct activities for teenagers related to civil defence. I love the job I’m doing and always puts in my best effort to contribute. However, hard work never seems to be rewarded in my case. I have a coworker who is very popular with everyone, let’s call her Sarah.(not her real name). Sarah is very outgoing and keeps up on the latest trends, so our coworkers really like her a lot.I am the complete opposite of her, and I cant communicate well so I get misunderstood most of the time, which is why you could say I don’t have more than 2 friends. The thing about Sarah is that she acts really immature and says rude things like it’s nothing like a teenager who hasn’t grown up. But because of her youthful personality, our coworkers love her, but not me since I have a bad feeling about her since day 1. The problem lies here. Whenever I make a mistake, I get harshly criticised by my coworkers. But for Sarah, she laughs it off and our coworkers let it go, even when the mistake is extremely serious. When our superior said that all of us were going to take tests for promotion, and be head chief of planning for a big event, I was excited. I started doing everything I can, but all I see Sarah doing was laughing, making snide remarks, lazing around, basically doing nothing. When the big news came, our superior announced that Sarah was chosen to be promoted and be the head chief of planning for the big event. I was upset. Because 1. My hard work went down the drain. 2. This was not the first time I was not acknowledged for my hard work and contribution.( context: my company makes me do the dirty work that no one wants to do, and never acknowledges me nor thank me). We went out for company dinner to celebrate Sarah’s promotion. While everyone was praising and saying that Sarah totally deserves it. I muttered under my breath,” must be nice to have everything handed to you so easily huh, you don’t deserve it”. Unfortunately, Sarah heard, and everyone got mad. Sarah then told me,” you should shut up, you bitter b-“ now everyone hates me. So am I the asshole?	1642830451.0	s9vfi4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9vfi4/aita_for_saying_that_my_coworker_gets_everything/	AITA for saying that my coworker gets everything handed to her on a silver platter?
55v5nsot	When I was 23, I moved back to my hometown to go back to school. I was doing fine in my new town, but I wanted to be around my old friends. One of those friends clued me in about a room at a house he was living in. After some fumbling around, I was able to move into his roommate’s house. At first, I was unsure of the homeowner, but my hometown friend assured me he was a good guy.  I spent a couple weeks getting to know the homeowner, and he turned out to be a super genuine guy, we smoked and drank together, and he slowly became one of my closest friends. Fast forward a year, and we are inseparable. He has trouble reading and paying bills, and I can help with that. I have trouble with girls, and he helps me with that. But then, my high school crush shows up with our friends at our bar… it’s on. I asked her out, but it turns out she fancies him. She rejects me, and they start dating. Fast forward another two years, we have dogs and new cars and life is good with our squad. Except, he isn’t moving anywhere with her, and I’ve fallen deeper and deeper for her. Nobody knows how I feel, but it’s getting harder to hide it. I go out for the Navy, begin working out for MEPS and doing everything I can to focus on getting my own place, life, and love. The day I leave for MEPS, she breaks up with him. 12 hours later I get rejected for the Navy. I move out to a new place and fall apart.  Life is shit for us both. 2 weeks later, her best friend tells me my HS crush knew she made a mistake.  4 weeks after they break up, I kiss her. I told him immediately, face to face the next morning. At this point, I’m no longer living there, I’m a mess, but she finally wants me. We date for a year, buy a house, get engaged, and a year later marry. Fast forward another year, and he has (sort of) forgiven me. Squad is still squad, but there’s this animosity. Tonight, I announced that we are 3 months pregnant to all the guys. 2 hours later, he says, as he usually does, “Fuck you, but I’m happy for you.” Am I the asshole for breaking the Bro Code for my dream girl (who I am OBSESSED with to this day) and finally being happy?	1642829820.0	s9v91x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9v91x/aita_for_having_a_baby_with_my_wife_my_best/	AITA for having a baby with my wife… my best friend’s ex?
ihtu68m8	So to start it off, me and Hanna have been friends for 8 years. Throughout those years I have picked up some red flags but then dropped them because I just fear losing her. Some are way too specific but just upset me in general.   Now the whole insensitive joke starts in the bus when Hanna makes a pretty rude comment about a random 6th grader. I got quite defensive and told her that she wouldn’t like it if someone had told her that, but she just brushed me off. Now, I and Hanna have this sort of inside joke where we combine 2 different words to insult each other. (For example, Hanna calls me a swollen hippo and I call her a burnt ostrich. It’s so weird but we’re middle schoolers what do you expect. 💀) I told her that she wouldn’t like it if someone called her a deranged orange and started laughing. She gave me an exaggerated shocked expression and laughed it off. When I got home my friends started calling me. Hanna wasn’t in the call so I just assumed she was eating. We were casually talking when she brought up a text Hanna had written saying how “OP always points out my fucking insecurities,” in a group that I wasn’t in. I was extremely confused and texted her about it asking what she meant. She told me what I had said on the bus and something I said at lunch. (I told her her face was melting because she brought up a pimple on my face.) I didn’t see her response though and left her on delivered. She later called me an hour later with two of my other friends cursing me out and telling me how much of a jerk I am. she cursed so much I almost couldn’t make out a single thing and everything was blurred together. I thought at first it was a joke because she and the others were giggling throughout it so I shot back and told her that It was because she said something intensive first. She then told me that I body-shamed her at the bus by called her an orange? I told her that I would never do such a thing and how she misinterpreted it, along with the the fact she obviously knew it was a joke, or I hoped so. She also mentions the whole melting thing and I told her that was obviously a joke and her face wasn’t actually melting. She then started to make a joke out of what I said and basically started acting all dense and said, “But I actually believed my face was melting. You were bringing up my acne (which I didn’t), you know I’m insecure about that .” I was honestly so pissed and told her that I wasn’t stupid and brought up all the things she had said to me, including her making fun of my ethnic features and comparing it to male genitals. (Oddly specific, but still made me upset.) The argument lasted around 5 minutes with her interrupting me here and there with swearing and me calling her out on her BS. I honestly hate people who think swearing automatically makes their statement correct. I soon ran out of things to say, then one of my friends spoke up and said in the most annoyed and irritated tone, “Are you done yet ?” I was absolutely embarrassing yet upset when she said that, this proves that she didn’t listen not care about anything I said. I just decided to play it of a say yea in a cool tone, but after that it was awkward. The other 2 friends in the call proceeded to tell me to apologize to her and call me mean and a bully.  I again defended myself but not so much as I did with Hanna and tried to be as calm as possible. They then sighed and with no enthusiasm good Hanna to apologize,. They didn’t want her to? She then got offended and left the call, which lead to me leaving the call as well. I’ve been overthinking this situation, my friends, me, and Hanna herself.

6matts9w	I'm expecting ESH. But, I'm mostly posting for confirmation that I am not the sole antagonist. However, if it turns out that that is the case, I have decided to accept that.    My brother and I are both autistic and we were raised as Jehovah's Witnesses. However, I left before being baptised, and he didn't.  He called to talk. I told him that I had a partner and got onto the topic of relationships. He said he wanted to have a family.  Then we talked about our parents and how he was struggling with our elder dad whom he lives with.  He said he wanted to live with a different family he knee (he just wanted to - the option to do so was not on the table) so I suggested he look into moving out. He said he couldn't because he was scared of going out on his own.  I told him he would have to learn how to do those things if he wanted a family, and he said his wife and kids would take care of him. So, I brought up scenarios where they might not.  Me: "what if there was an assembly and your wife was sick?" Him: "I'd stay home with her."  Me: "what if she was working?" Him: "Then I'd work, too."  The next question I shouldn't have asked. But, I wasn't thinking. Me: "what if she didn't want to go?" Him: "I'd put her in a box and mail her to China."  I told him that was disgusting. We had an argument, and he said he was joking. I told him it was a horrible jokes.  Then I asked another stupid question. Me: "What about your kids? What if they didn't want to go?" Him: "I would tell them they have to leave and find somewhere else to live."  I told him he would be making his child homeless. He said his child wouldn't be homeless because they could live elsewhere. I explained that if you kick your child out, until they find somewhere to live they are homeless. But, he didn't understand.   In the end, I told him that I hope he never has a wife or children.   Afterwards I felt bad, so I asked my mum to call and make sure he was okay. She told me that he is depressed and in a bad environment - he could live with our mum, but he is too afraid. She's in a different city.  I texted apologising for yelling.  I know that skipping meetings and assemblies is a serious JW offence. But, I got lucky when I left, so it's not something I think about.  He has depression and is not getting a lot of social interaction beyond our dad and stepmonster. I could have provided a positive social outlet and instead I yelled at him for a "joke".  JWs warp your understanding of what is acceptable. I could have guided him to more healthy views.  While we are both autistic, my brother's autism has a greater impact on his behaviour and social awareness. There is a drastic difference in our diagnosis ages (9 for him and 19 for me - he might have been diagnosed sooner, but we thought it was brain-damage).	1642830678.0	s9vhyh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9vhyh/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_hope_he_never_has_a/	AITA For telling my brother I hope he never has a wife and kids

Recently, she was caught in a not so flattering position and it just makes me so disgusted. They got back together tho as *those couples* do…   Anyways, I brought up in discussion with my future MIL that I really don’t want her at my wedding. She told me that’s not fair because the brother is going to be the best man. So I came up with a new stipulation:   She is to be no where near the venue until it is time for guests to arrive.

i4jg5lqr	We have this argument from time to time, and I think Reddit should finally tell me who’s being an asshole here.   My older sister goes to a certain university A, and I go to a certain other university B. Hers is near home so she commutes, but mine is out of state so I live there. In fact I elected to go out of state to leave my chaotic home lol but that’s unrelated.  Anyway, before I got into my school (I’m only a freshman now), I wasn’t ever sure I would go there. I always had my options open. My sister was already at university A so naturally she encouraged me to go there to. However I had very little intent of going there because, to tell the truth, it’s a phenomenal university but I’m bluntly uninterested in the campus life, and our high school is a feeder school for it so I never really saw it as that crazy of a school.  Everyone at our school wears its brand, everyone talks about it, lots of people get in. It’s somewhat hard to get into, don’t get me wrong, but I just didn’t really see the hype. I was indifferent to say the least.  She gets angry when I say her school is  in the top 40 (she stubbornly believes it’s in the top 20 because of some different odd methodology she uses) and she claims I have malice towards her school. I maintained to her that I have no malice, just disinterest.   I’ve said that since like 15% of our entire high school class gets into that one school it isn’t really a huge deal to me (compared to schools like Harvard or Yale or Princeton where like 2 kids from our school get into every year!) Again, she got angry because she accused me of saying her school was “easy” to get into, when that wasn’t what I was saying at all. She’s saying I’ve trashed her school’s name into the dirt and she got defensive.   Was I an asshole for mentioning my view of her school as uninteresting to me (due to its meh campus life and since so many kids from our school go there anyway) or should I have kept my mouth shut since she goes there?   Keep in mind I was in the process of searching for schools and evaluating my options.	1642837483.0	s9xab5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xab5/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_was_uninterested_in/	AITA for telling my sister I was uninterested in her university
iwcm64gj	My dad's fiancee is an educator, so she gets off work right around the time me and my brother get out of school.  My brother was unlocking the door to our house when I heard someone walking up to the door behind me, and I screamed. She wears these wedges that are really loud and ugly-looking.  I asked her what the hell she was doing at our house when our dad wasn't home, and she said that our dad had sent her there to watch over us.  I told her that we were older teens and that we could be left at home alone and that we'd done so for years and she just shrugged and said our dad sent her there.  She does really annoying things, like try to hug me and ruffle my hair and ask how my day was and yelling at me to do homework and taking away my phone when I get distracted.  I guess one plus is that she makes snacks for us and buys me my favorite food and drinks sometimes, but other than that, it's all negative.  When I let slip that I had a huge Spanish test one day, she literally made me sit down and study grammar and vocabulary for hours even though I already speak Spanish fluently because I had a B+ in the class and she teaches Spanish and psychology. My grade went up to an A- after that, but I was still annoyed because no one has been that strict or authoritarian with me before.  And generally, when my brother and I do homework, she sits next to us, grades papers, and watches us like a hawk.  I asked my dad again today why he made his girlfriend babysit us and if he pays her to do it and he said that we need an adult to watch over us and that she doesn't get paid.  Literally how does she even agree to this arrangement of babysitting kids at school and then doing it for free again after work?	1642841009.0	s9y55n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9y55n/aita_for_asking_my_dad_why_he_makes_our/	AITA for asking my dad why he makes our babysitter work for free?
iwebggox	I have a child I never managed to connect with. She’s very emotional and anxious and I feel like she and I just don’t get each other. I’ve never felt much affection for her as a result and just go through the motions.  On the other hand, her stepmom seems to love her to pieces. Whenever I drop her off, her stepmom’s face lights up. She always comes out to get her and squeezes her and says she missed her.   At a holiday celebration, I even saw my kid and her stepmom watching movies together and snuggling with each other for hours straight.

82xyjwwd	So it’s not as bad as the title sounds. I met a guy in March 2018 and we were together until December 2018. The day after we broke up (due to him not being able to prioritise time with me, wonder why right?) via my sisters social media I found out that he had a girlfriend and he got engaged in July 2018. I had never checked before because I don’t have social media and he told me the same thing.   So I screen shot his engagement pictures, including the one of him wearing the suit I unknowingly helped pick out and sent them to him saying I found out about his fiancé. He blocked me and never responded. I didn’t tell his fiancé at the time because he had pictures of me in a bikini and in our culture that is a huge no no and I know he would have sent them to my brother. I know it doesn’t seem like a big deal but it is a huge scandal to even wear a knee length dress or sleeveless tops.    It’s been a few years now I have my own family and I hold no ill feelings towards him. If I didn’t find out I wouldn’t have met my current husband and appreciate him for the wonderful human being he is. I just haven’t ever been able to get over the guilt of not telling her. I just feel as though if it was me I would want to know. WIBTA to now reach out now?

iweckaxe	I (24F) married my husband (29M) almost 6 months ago. Before we got married my brother-in-law (21M) always got second hand phones and had a job which paid him the bare minimum. BIL's phone broke a few weeks before I got married and as per my husband's request I gave him my old phone. That day I told my husband that he should by BIL a new phone because he keeps getting second hand phones which are in bad shape. Fast-forward a month and my husband buys BIL a phone. I didn't ask for my old phone back.  BIL and I were close. Or so I thought. I treated him like my own brother and we were extremely close up until his cousin (33F) moved back home 4 months before the wedding. He became distant from me. She's the only girl in the family from the mother's side and husband has only brothers. And since we are from South Asia, extended families are extremely common. They grew up considering her to be their sister even though she's just a cousin. So I knew something was wrong and that they were talking shit behind my back but I had no proof to show my husband. So a few days ago I took the phone BIL gave me and gave it to my nephew without resetting the phone knowing fully well that he would snoop. In all honesty, I needed the proof.  Alas, I was right. My nephew snooped and found conversations BIL and cousin had where they called me a gold digger and were criticizing and judging me for every breath I took. They called my husband "henpecked", called me ugly, shitted on my cooking skills and so on. I got over a 100 screenshots of them talking shit about me. Also, I also got screenshots of BIL and his gf where they said I can never bear the child of my husband and if I want kids I would have to get with another man.  For the record, I didn't marry my husband for his money. He's not rich but he does earn a decent salary. I have a job too and I pay for everything I do, with the money I make and everything else goes into savings.  I sent the screenshots to my husband and confronted them. BIL had nothing to say even when I asked him why he said all the nasty things about me. The cousin on the other hand held her ground and didn't even bother apologizing. She said I was an asshole for taking the phone, invading someone's privacy. BIL did apologize in an I'm sorry I got caught kind of way.

iwg2mc65	Brother and I were very close growing up. We always cared and loved for each other, but I don't think our relationship is the same after he stole from the poor.   My brother is the kind of person where if he wants something, he wants it under any circumstances. He doesn't care about optics or money or if somebody owns it, just nothing. If he wants something that he likes and set his eyes on, he wants it.   So, he set his eyes on a prime property owned by a small poor farming family. The family was dependent on that land because they were into agriculture. That was their livelihood.   So he threatened the poor family to sell their property to him, but they didn't. He then somehow using his business contacts tried to ruin their life and harass them to the point where they just couldn't take it anymore so they sold it to him.   From the time when this happened, I went no contact with him. I hated it how disgusting my brother became.   Not only this, he slept with his female coworker because he wanted her. That is how fucked up my brother is.   So after my daughter was born, I decided not to invite my brother to her 1st bday party. The bday is due in a few weeks, and I straight up told our parents that I'll not be inviting him, but they are emotionally blackmailing me to invite him because he's family.   I don't want him anywhere near my family.   My parents are calling me an asshole for not wanting to invite him.	1642848856.0	sa01mp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa01mp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_brother_to_my/	AITA for not wanting to invite my brother to my daughter's 1st bday party because he stole from the poor?
hxzpeuqa	I live with my friend and her kids. She believes that everything her kids ask for they should get. Majority of reasoning is that I supposedly don't use it or they are kids. Recently I was asked to give her oldest a welder I had cause he could use it and supposedly I didn't need it. Then found it for sale and then confronted the oldest. Then I got blasted for complaining as oldest isn't asking much $ for it and I gave it away so it has nothing to do with me. It wasn't about the selling price it was about the principle.

ba4hd72c	I’ve been at school all week, I wake up earlier to drop my younger sister off and then I take myself to my college. I’m very busy at the moment as this year I will be going to a university which has high entry requirements and as a result I need to put a lot of time into my coursework. I am also quite sleep deprived and generally exhausted.   My mum works long shifts and I understand this so I’m ok helping out during the week. My dad works full time.   But this morning, I was woken up early on the one day I wanted to get some sleep, to babysit whilst she dropped my sister off to her event. (Dads not home atm) I was already angry but the thing that tipped me over the edge was when she was gone for over three hours so I called her and she had just taken herself out to go and care for her horses (very time consuming and expensive idk why she keeps them). She didn’t even fucking ask if I was ok babysitting. The house is a mess so I’m also expected to do the piles of washing up and laundry.  My younger sister is whining because she is understandably bored because I don’t want to play with her because I’m exhausted and have work to do. I called my mum and snapped and told her I think she’s inconsiderate and selfish.

b11yoqwc	My husband asked me for a divorce. I was shocked, sad, and desperately wanted to reconcile. I went digging in his computer to try and find evidence of an affair, and I discovered an extremely escalated porn/sex addiction (and an affair). The amount of depravity on full display was shocking as well as illegal. I think you get what I'm implying here...  When I confronted him about what I saw, he went blank and admitted that he's been engaging in this activity for a long time, before we even met, completely hidden from family life. I have no tangible evidence, and he has since moved out with all of his devices. He refuses to get help, or even admit that this may be something that he cannot control. He told me that if I knew everything that he's done, then I would 'probably set him on fire'. Since I found out his secret, he's been acting very mean and aggressive towards me and my seven year old daughter.  He has a history of violence as well that I never reported--he strangled me until I blacked out before our daughter was born, raised his fist to me in front of our daughter recently, and told me he would throw me across the room.  For these reasons, I have been keeping my daughter from full visitation. I do allow facetime calls and supervised visits, however. He's getting pissed because he can't spend one-on-one time alone with her to maintain a relationship, but I think I am justified in my actions to protect our daughter. Some people have told me that since he's never hurt her before I should let them have their time together. It just feels wrong.  I have hired a lawyer and I am in process of getting all the legal stuff sorted, but I wanted to ask strangers on the internet for some unbiased opinions on visitation specifically. I don't want to look like the bitter ex who uses her kid to get back at a cheating spouse.

iwh06wr0	I (25F) live with my mom (59F) in a house that she owns. Our bathtub is broken, but we don't have the money to replace it (we got a free estimate and it costs around $4,000). She applied for a Communtiy Action rehabilitation, but she only included her income on the application because my income alone is over the limit for the program. They came over the other day to inspect the house and I asked her to tell them that I live with her because 1. You can clearly tell I live with her; and 2. It said on her application that if she lied, then she could be fined $10,000 or even go to jail for fraud.  They inspected the house and she told them about my income. They wanted to fix our bathtub, but they can't do it now since we are over income. AITA for asking her not to lie about our income?

iwizajqm	My husband and I had to attend a work event last Friday night and our usual baby sitter just moved to a different state for college. Our maid recommended one of her nieces who has experience babysitting so we asked her to watch our 11 year old son that night. About an hour into the event I check our home cameras to make sure everything’s going well and I see two other boys and the babysitter sitting around drinking our champagne while my son was off watching tv.  I informed my husband and we decided to call the cops to get my son since we were an hour drive away from the house and needed to make sure he was safe. My son was okay in the end and we pressed charges again the teenagers. We let our maid go but I heard she was spreading rumors to my other friends she works for that I was blowing things out of proportion. I of course am going to let them know what really happened since I have literally have the footage of these people drinking in my house.

4dnxhd3a	 So I live with a friend, renting out a room in an apartment that he owns. he regularly goes on vacation and work trips.   Over the last year he has made a habit of never letting me know when he is leaving the apartment for a few days until the very day he leaves. He also never tells me when he will be back e.g. one time he disappeared for 4 weeks after saying he'd be gone for a few days.  My feeling is he does not like me knowing when I have the apartment to myself and his preferred approach is for me to never know when he's coming back so I keep the place clean and don't have a party or anything (he's quite OTT about keeping his place immaculate). I feel like this is a manipulative move and kind of inconsiderate as tbh I would plan more dates etc if I knew I had a free appartment   Anyway I called him out on this and said it would be considerate if he gave me a heads-up when he knows he's going away for a few days or let me know roughly when he's coming back.  He said that I'm being ridiculous and should not care when/where he is going as it should make no difference to me. I feel like he has a point, but then again it doesn't seem normal that a friend you live with just leaves at short notice without warning and never tells you when they will be back?  Am I the asshole for asking him to let me know if he's going away?	1642855948.0	sa1vqr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1vqr/aita_for_complaining_at_my_housemate_for_not/	AITA for complaining at my housemate for not telling me where he's going?
cz4so2fw	Me (27f) and my husband (33m) got into it again this morning. This has been ongoing the last few months. My husband can't seem to be "nice" in the morning.  Just about every morning he hits me with some comment that ticks me off. This is usually within the first five to ten minutes of me waking up.   This morning: Him: *comes into our room with the dogs and I wake up* Him: why is the fan on? (He fell asleep on the couch, I was in the bedroom.) Me: idk it was probably still on from last night. Him: no it wasn't. I remember it being off last night and now it's on. Why is it on? Me: (getting frustrated as it's 630 am) I don't know I was sleeping. Him: leaves room and calls me a name as he walks down the hallway.  I'm just extremely frustrated because I feel like rather than waking me up to cuddle with he and the dogs he continually wakes me up to complain about something. (That doesn't effect him.)

31bie7xf	So I(29m) have a friend H(29f), we’ve been really close friends since college. Few months back she moved out of the city we lived in and moved to the west coast. Since she’s moved whenever we’ve meet up we’ve hooked up. I’ve told her I want an exclusive relationship but she wasn’t interested. Another college friend of ours B(30m) lives in the same city as H. In college B used to date H’s Bestfriend G(28f). G and B had a really bad break up several years ago and G made it clear to H she is uncomfortable with H and B hanging out. H assured her nothing was going on and she wouldn’t do that to her friend. But B and I share iPhone locations from a passed trip and it seems to be B and H had a little sleep over last night.

4xw83zlf	Recently, my Chihuahua, Cocoa, gave birth to two puppies, King and Pudding. I love these puppies with all my soul, I would do anything for them. Obviously, they're not allowed out right now because not only are they unvaccinated and still just tiny babies, but it's way too cold right now where I live anyway.   My nan, grandpa and cousin all live together in the next town over, and every weekend my three loud, annoying and extremely grabby little cousins stay with them. My cousins are all 12, 5, 8 and 2. Now, my nan has two dogs of her own, most namely a stupid, hyper, noisy German Shepherd called Izzy. I love Izzy, but she's like every excitable big dog ever; has no idea how big she is, doesn't know how rough is too rough, doesn't know boundaries and never shuts up. She gave Cocoa a major phobia of bigger dogs when my mom took her to nan's when she was only a little puppy and Izzy had attempted to play with her, badly hurting her.   I went downstairs this morning to greet the puppies and Cocoa, only to find they weren't there. I immediately called my mom to ask if she knew where they were. She told me casually over the phone that she had them, speaking over the screams of fear from Cocoa and her babies, the screams of delight from my cousins and the super excited barks of Izzy. I freaked out, yelling at her and calling her a fucking idiot for taking the tiny, unvaccinated puppies outside, let alone to nan's with their anxious mother! They're still way too young and fragile!   My mom is now upset with me for yelling, saying she was only trying to make my cousins and grandparents happy by letting them see the puppers and that it didn't matter because she'd taken them out once before, to her friend's (an incident I made clear I disapproved of, whether she only has a calm Jack Russell or not). I felt a bit bad, like I could've handled it better. So Reddit, hit me with it, am I the asshole here?	1642858042.0	sa2i4l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2i4l/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_for_taking_my_dogs/	AITA for yelling at my mom for taking my dog's puppies to my nan's without my permission?

Today, she made me change into a god-awful Mickey Mouse two piece and wouldn't let me wear my original outfit because I looked "homeless and unkempt" even though it looked pretty good. She wouldn't leave me alone until I finally wore the outfit and she left with a smile on her face. Now, my sister (F14) was wearing elephant flared jeans and a shirt that's open at the chest, but laces up and she never said anything to her about it. When she kept telling me to wear it, I felt that I was going to cry because I was getting frustrated and I wanted to be left alone and now that I have it on, I feel even more frustrated and I want to cry even more.

gxgc8x7	Yesterday day morning my grandfather passed away. He was 92 years old and lived a very long and mostly joyful life. As most people do nowadays, some of my family members posted their grief on social media. Some made posts or changed their profile pictures to old pictures they had of my grandfather.   One of my brothers recently went through another bad divorce about three years ago. It was ultimately his former wife's decision to divorce. She chose to divorce because my brother was suffering from a chronic illness and could no longer work. So she fell out of love with him as she told one of her former step children. My family does not like his ex-wife because of how she treated my brother's children. They have to go to therapy because of some of the emotional and mental scars she has left and continues to leave by trying to be a coparent to them despite the fact that, only one out of the four children is hers.   In the flurry of social media posts, my former sister in law changed her profile picture to my grandfather's picture. In the heat of the moment, I commented on it saying that it was disrespectful of her to have my grandfather who just died as her profile picture because she is no longer a part of our family and that she was using his image for clout rather than to pay respects. She then blocked me and screamed at my brother on the phone. Her apparent reasoning for the picture change was because my grandfather was a great grandfather to her child. I admit I acted in haste, but still stand by what I said.	1642867652.0	sa5oor	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5oor/aita_for_commenting_on_my_exsils_profile_picture/	AITA for commenting on my ex-SIL's profile picture because it was disrespectful to my family?
diqxom24	I came over to his house and we laid in bed together. We hung and I brought up something that had been bothering me about us while I cried. I guess he was respecting my space to cry because he turned off the lights while hugging me. He didn't say much. We just laid there hugging in silence. Time passed and from what I could tell he fell asleep which I was a little WTF by because I brought up something that concerns us in the future. I fell asleep eventually.   When we were both waking up, he said he was feeling unwell. He felt dizzy and loopy. His mannerisms appeared as if he was drunk except he doesn't drink. I was stand-offish so I wasn't saying much and he asked what's wrong and I said that now isn't the right time as he's not mentally present. (He had similar loopy episodes before) He assured me that he's listening and so I brought up that I felt taken aback by his response of which he got offended by and went on a tangent of saying things without a filter.   Things such as "I wish you're stronger" and "You're so emotional". I have anxiety and before this I was already feeling anxious. With the things he said, I was starting to hyperventilate and was trying to shut out the things he said.   He knows he was being incoherent and was apologising and told me to leave but I said I'm not going to leave him when he's unwell (he mentioned he was feeling hot and very weak). I stayed and told him to stop talking of which he said he can't. He continued to say hurtful things which eventually led me to a panic attack.   After I calmed down, we had a mini disclosure conversation and I went home feeling hurt. The next day, I texted him asking him if he could apologise for the things he said of which he refused to of which his reasoning was it was my decision to stay whilst knowing what he was saying was hurting me. He found my reasoning of staying for him when he's unwell dumb because I was essentially torturing myself with his words. Additionally, he was already pologising when it happened. It got blown into a very big argument.   To him, saying sorry is taking blame and I said that I'm not blaming him. I just want empathy for the things he said because they really affected me. I just felt very hurt as I have been battling depression and his words had worsened how I felt about myself. He said he can't give me that either because I had put myself through that.   AITA?   TLDR; He was mentally incoherent and said some really hurtful things. When I asked him to apologise the next day, he refuses with reasoning that it was my decision to stay when he told me to leave whilst knowing what he was saying was hurting me.

ebvbuq0o	I (f22) would like to go across the country to do my honours at a prestigious university that I have been accepted at. However my father works 6 hours away from home and only comes back every second week. This means if I go my mum would  be alone with my autistic brother(M 23).  He is a bit much. Please understand that I do love him and I know he is struggling due to his condition. He can take care of himself but constantly gets into trouble with other people or acts up. He has daily meltdowns where he gets more and more agitated and anxious.  This can lead to violence.  In my childhood I have had to sometimes stop this. I also pick him up from the facility he goes to during the day and I look after him for 2 hours as mum finishes work later. At this point I'm not sure if she will manage without me as she is already spread thin due to dad not being here.   I have tried to move before once I started university but ended up home due to mental health issues( Existing childhood and life events that occurred left me very depressed). Furthe last year (final year of my degree) I ended up in the mental hospital for being extremely depressed (diagnosed bipolar type 2). I am not 100% sure I will manage on my own but it's a good opportunity. I would also like to have a normal life and be able to invite my friends over or go out and not stress about him having a melt down. It would also be nice to come home to silence and not chaos.   In terms of funding, I have none. To ask my parents to let me go would also be asking them to take on a huge financial strain. I want to ask but I can't bring myself to do it as it feels soo selfish. My parents don't acknowledge the toll my brother takes on me so I can't explain that to them as a reason for going. In their eyes this is normal, they are great parents and I have lived a normal life. Furthermore I could fo the same postgraduate degree in our town at the local university.  It's not as well accredited as the other ones in the country but I guess it's the same degree.   I feel like it's too selfish to even mention.

3nxj3kfo	Hey everyone. I'm (26M) an extremely picky eater, and that's something that I clearly see as a bad thing. Usually when I go out to eat (on multiple restaurants) I ask to remove certain items in my food (for example, champignon, olives, some seafood etc.), however most of the time that request gets ignored. I asked several times for these things to get removed after the plate gets delivered, but they always say that there's nothing they can do now that the plate is in my table.   I realized that saying I'm allergic to these stuff beforehand reduced the amount of times that they come to my plate to almost zero, however it still happens sometimes. I already considered telling the waiter to remove the plate because I said that I'm allergic to X stuff, but I know that this would cause the food to be thrown in the trash and whoever was responsible for the mistake to pay for this food, when most likely it was an honest mistake. However there are people who are really allergic to these stuff and could get in serious danger, and "reporting" when a mistake like that happens could prevent it from happening in the future with someone who is actually allergic.   So, WIBTA if I asked a plate to be removed from my table because I'm allergic to X stuff and I informed it beforehand, even though in reality I'm not allergic to that?	1642868909.0	sa644q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa644q/wibta_for_telling_restaurants_that_im_allergic_to/	WIBTA for telling restaurants that I'm allergic to something that I don't like?
gssngv1h	I’ve (f18) been dating my boyfriend (m20) for over two years, well we broke up for 6 months and got back together, during that time I obviously talked to other guys. For context my boyfriend isn’t the jealous type and he never was, but sometimes he has no logic when it comes to me talking to other guys. Example would be that I had sex with another guy who lived with my best friend, he was okay with me going over to her house knowing he still lives there but I had to block my friend on social media because I was interested in when we were broken up? I had no issue doing that but I couldn’t see the logic. Recently a guy I talked too made his way back in my life, let’s call him Joe. I tell my boyfriend everything so of course I told him he added me back on some socials and he didn’t tell me to block him after I told him our history, after having a few talks abt this i decided to keep him on my socials since it was okay with my boyfriend, he actually told me it was okay to hang out with him if i really wanted too. I declined to hang out with guy friends before because I feel weird hanging out with another guy ALONE. I’ve actually been trying to make Joe feel better about himself and relationships so he can find someone. Last night Joe and his friends were driving around and I asked if they wanted to come pick me up. They did and my boyfriend got mad at me for leaving, saying he wasn’t okay with me hanging out with Joe and his friends because he doesn’t trust them, but told me it would’ve been better if me and joe hung out alone. I did something he said it was okay to do, and I thought the more the merrier? He trusts me alone with other guys but not a group of them.  I’m not too sure if i’m in the wrong, we’ve also been arguing every day the last week and a half about almost everything. So everything’s a touchy subject. We’ve also made it very clear that we both have different boundaries when it comes to things like this, he could be fine with me doing something that I wouldn’t like him doing.

w8ygp	Me (32M) and my girlfriend (37F) have been dating for a little over two years. For context, she has children (the youngest is 13, but the other 3 are 17-22). She is divorced, but her ex-husband is very well-off, still pays for everything regarding the house and kids. Because of this, and the type of lifestyle my girlfriend has led, she has a certain standard of life that’s alien to me as a public school teacher. She regularly buys expensive purses, shoes, clothes, etc (everything in the THOUSANDS of dollars). Goes on trips whenever she gets bored. Just bought a $40,000 sports in cash because she was bored of her SUV, things like that. She does have a business, so she makes two or three times what I make monthly besides the money from her ex. I, in the other hand, live in a $600 apartment, drive a 2013 Malibu, and I’ve been saving for the past year to buy a slightly newer car instead. Worlds apart in lifestyles. About two months ago she mentioned how it was time we moved in together, but that this place was going to be just for the two of us, and her kids would be keeping the house their father pays for (not sure about time-sharing details, every time I ask about the kids she says she hasn’t figured it out yet). But the most concerning thing to me is the financial aspect of it. Yesterday she started telling me how when we move in together we need to buy all new furniture for the apartment, and I told her that would take us some time because I can’t just spend thousands and thousands of dollars to furnish a new place right away. Then I asked how we would be splitting the apartment costs, and she went quiet. After a few minutes she said that she was used to not paying anything for costs of living, since her ex paid for everything. I told her it was unfair to expect me to do the same thing, but she told me it was a cultural thing and she just hadn’t devoted any time to thinking about it. I hadn’t even asked her to split costs evenly according to income, I had said we would be splitting costs 50-50. Then I asked when I would be able to purchase a newer car if she expected me to spend thousands of dollars for us just to move in together (furniture, because she doesn’t like mine, not talking about actual move-in costs), and she got upset because she thought I was being dramatic and we would never buy furniture like this. I told her if she wants to live with me she needs to understand the financial limitations I have. Now she’s told me she needs to seriously think about things, and I told her I need to do the same. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here, expecting her to pull her own weight if she wants to move in with me, but I submit myself to your judgment. AITA? TLDR. AITA for expecting my well-off girlfriend to pay for half of the living costs in a new apartment?	1642871067.0	sa6w35	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6w35/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_we_will_split/	AITA for telling my girlfriend we will split costs when we move in together?
8pq0mqnr	Last year my wife had an emotional affair. It ended, and we've been working the repair our marriage. In the fall my wife's friend got married, and before the wedding I found out my wife asked her friend to not post pictures online of my wife and I. Her reasoning? She didn't like seeing pictures of her affair partner and his wife (latent feelings), and she didn't want to make him feel bad if he saw pictures of the two of us. My response? Post as many pictures of my wife and I and our family as possible and tag her. Her response? Block me in Facebook.  It's now six months later, I'm still blocked and despite us doing much better now, she's not in a hurry to unblock me.   And so Reddit, AITA?	1642872038.0	sa791i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa791i/aita_for_posting_photos/	AITA for Posting Photos?
3agp2h6h	Hear me out.    Yesterday my gf, myself and my gfs friend (A) were walking to our car at the shops. A and I were talking about stationary for our kids and the bargains she got at another shop. Anyway. My gf saw a lady and presumably her husband walking and apparently the guy gave all 3 of us dirty looks, only my gf saw this.    So fast forward to last night. We were chilling at A's house with other friends present and all of a sudden my gf starts ranting about this couple she saw at the shopping parking lot. She kept talking about the woman's clothes (shiny red high stilettos, very, very short leopard print mini skirt) and how the guy wore normal clothes alongside her. She kept saying he's flaunting his wife in public and using her like a trophy wife. How this lady had no self respect by dressing like that in public.    All of her friends and me were laughing at her and at some point I told her to just let it go. I told her she's making assumptions. We have zero clue who those people are or what their deal was and it's none of our business, but she kept on hammering about it. Until we started asking her questions on purpose to get a reaction and then we'd laugh about it even more. Eventually my gf got a bit upset and emotional and went to play pool at which point A's husband told my gf to get a grip or take her stuff and fucking leave if she's gonna continue acting like this.    A is pissed off today still because my gf made a scene about something that's got absolutely nothing, NOTHING, to do with any of us. A is also pissed that my gf immediately went to apologize to A's husband but didn't even say a word to her about her little outburst. My gf is still trying to explain to me why she lost her shit about this random couple, but i don't get it. I don't get why she's so pissed about a woman wearing what she wants in public, nor do i get why she's pissed the guy gave us dirty looks. I cannot give 2 fucks how people look at me. They don't know me, i don't know them.   And yes we did try to reason with my gf, but she wouldn't stop hammering about these randos, at that point we stopped trying to reason and just went along with it and laughed at her.   Anyway, AITA for making fun of my gf and laughing at her with her friends?	1642872445.0	sa7ehv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7ehv/aita_for_laughing_at_my_27f_gf_37f_along_with_all/	AITA for laughing at my (27F) gf (37F) along with all her friends and making fun of her?

9djdm951	Recently had our first baby with my wife, we're at about 3 weeks.  Sitting on the couch she's breastfeeding and watching TV she's getting frustrated the baby isn't latching on to eat and baby is screaming. Then claws at her hair and my wife aggressively starts putting it into a bun and puts a clip in. This is where this go sideways...  She's clearly uphappy on the hair clip placement and starts yanking to pull it out and it gets all knotted up. I let her know I'm happy to help take it out for her she says no. She then yanks on it and it's a giant mess. I then plead saying let me help you you're obviously pissed off. Again, no. I then move off the couch and get in front of her and say " you need to calm down you're making it worse please let me help you." - no response.   "You're clearly pissed off please let me help you" - no response  I then said " you need to fucking calm down this is getting out of control".  " Fuck you ass hole leave the room please!"  So I left the room - like sure maybe I shouldn't have yelled or cursed but her hair was completely a mess and our child is right below you and I don't want her getting an elbow to the face while you throw a tantrum.

7lbwdfi8	Sorry in advance for elaborating- but this needs some context.   I (33 F) recently lost my grandfather. This is the father of my mother and the most beloved person in my life other than my husband and children.   My mom and grandma have treated me like a shit my entire life. They also have a horrible relationship with each other. Before I decided to cut them off a few months ago, my mom would constantly call me to complain about some thing my grandma did, and why she hates her for that thing. Historically, my grandma and mom have only come together to pick on me, and this has been consistent my entire life. On the other hand, my grandfather has always been the kindest soul and became my father figure, as I never really had one. I have only good memories of him and he always supported me.   My beloved grandfather passed away very recently. I visited with him in his last days. I held his hand. I told him I loved him and that I would always be with him. During my visit, I had to bear the pain of being around my mom and grandma who are now best friends again. The whole time they made comments to each other pertaining to how my mom is now this “perfect daughter” because she has planned 95% of the funeral arrangements for my grandfather.  Daughters in my family are expected to cater to their mothers like servants. My mom made me raise my five younger brothers and treats them like gold. She throws my brothers catered parties for graduating high school, but wouldn’t spend a dime toward my brunch when I graduated college. This type of treatment has always been the chief complaint of our arguments, as I’ve always felt unworthy to her. So when the arch enemies/ best friends reference “perfect daughter” it’s just a jab to me.   I asked my grandmother if I could say a word at my grandfathers funeral and she refused. She instead insisted that I write a note with a two sentence limit to add to the back of his obituary. It was due last night. Two hours after requesting this from me. My grandmother said that my mom was allowed to speak at the funeral, and that if I had something to say, my mom could read it on my behalf. She knows my mom and I aren’t speaking.   So here we are.. I have decided not to attend my beloved grandfather’s funeral and instead do something at home in his honor. I don’t want to dishonor him, but I don’t want to be a puppet in my mom and grandma’s silly games. I don’t see a point in attending if can’t contribute and am forced to bear the inevitable rude treatment from my mom and grandma. I can’t help but feel a little selfish but I keep convincing myself that I was there when he needed me, and that’s all that matters.

e74fi763	Hi, first post here! For context, I'm a 23 year old person, im disabled and autistic as well. Both are important here for reasons you'll all see. (Sorry... this one is a read)   I've lived with my mother pretty much my whole life, she has been for the most part my rock! There when I asked her to be. I've always really wanted her to find happiness, because even now I do think she deserves it. After her second divorce she and I got a townhouse and we lived there for about 7 years. It was never intended to be permanent. During those years I really lost myself to my illness, I struggled a lot, and while she was there for me it was difficult to speak to her about things.   Regardless, she supported me through it all and I am going to be thankful for the rest of my life, because I'm confident I would've lost my fight without her.    Now, it's the new year and she and this man she's been dating for just over a year are moving into a new house 12 hours from where we live now. Which, im happy because I know she hates cold weather and wants to be closer to her cousin. I however have a whole life up here! And I told her as much. The plan was that I would house-sit their new house for about 2 months while she and her boyfriend finished packing their own things and my mother in that time would also sell the house we lived in. She would then give me x amount of dollars from the sale to put a down payment on a condo up here so that I can stay.  I agreed, because let's face it. I don't actually have a choice (I'm not incapable of holding a job, but I dont currently have one! I sell artwork though and feed myself normally) so I agreed to pick up a job in the area of wherever I'd live. It was simple imo.  Now that I'm here, in the south, I have so many doubts. Nobody will stop talking about how ill 'like it' here. How ill 'have a place' down here. It scares me, because if they decide that I do, regardless if I actually do, I won't have the resources to help myself. I had full plans to live in a condo by myself and sell artwork and go work at Walgreens. Just be a regular poor person. It's what I want more than anything. I've expressed my unhappiness to my mother, ("what can I send to the house to make it better"). Not to mention a million other things, like the fact I was rushed out of the house without packing all my things, or that they don't close on this house for 3 more days. Or the fact I'm not straight or cis and these people we are around express nothing but dislike for "those people". Or that her boyfriend says the N word hard r. And thinks covid is a conspiracy. Or that in this tiny cabin we are in they decided it would be fun to do the nasty with the doors open at 8am. The more time I spend here the more I grow to hate it. However, this is what my mother wants. Its her life and her happiness. I'm conflicted. I want to go home. But if I ask to leave I'm the biggest inconvenience in the world	1642880689.0	saadwt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saadwt/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_life_is_getting/	AITA for being upset that my life is getting uprooted?
ebiy3rxa	I (28f) am 6 months pregnant. I don't have a bad relationship with my IL'S but I wouldn't say we get along fabulously. They blatantly favor their other children over my husband, and that has spilled into the grandkids as well. Mostly money/gift related, but they practically raised the other grandkids so volunteer to spend a ton of time with them, where we used to had to beg them to see us. We let it go, as nothing changed or they don't see anything wrong, but it's sort of escalated the last few years, especially with my younger SIL'S (neither work, they pay for their apartments and things, basically fund them and give in to whatever they ask) and our eldest (8f) had started to notice, so we've not exactly kept our distance, but don't see them as much.   We have the youngest grandkid (1.5 M), and at first they were so obsessed. Out of the blue, trying to come over all the time, trying to parent like they did with the others, trying to get me to leave him for overnights as a newborn. Just really overwhelming me. When they realized I wasn't going to hand them my kid to raise, they backed off just as quickly. He sort of recognizes them, but isn't fond of them. They still do things when we're together that annoy me. Take him out of my arms, feed him candy or other things I've said no to behind my back or sometimes right in front of me, try and scare him to make him laugh, or hand him coins "but they're shiny!" to try and get him to like them.   I try and get my husband to deal with these things, as he's usually on the same page as me, and as the saying goes "it's his circus", but he's pretty passive and will only say something if I give him a look. They usually just ignore me or try and brush what I say off, and I got tired of being called a helicopter mom, so I never bring the kids around them by myself.   My husband does snow removal and is on call this weekend. I knew it would most likely snow during the dinner, but my husband went ahead and told them we'd all be there. Lo and behold, he got called in, and now is making a big stink about me bringing the kids out anyways, and saying if the roles were reversed, he would bring them out if it was my family. Of course he would, my families idea of helping is keeping the kids in their seats, helping to feed the youngest, helping my eldest order, keeping them occupied so we can get a break. His families idea is letting the kids run around the restaurant, or laugh while I struggle to chase them, feed them treats or pop, giving coins and not watching to see if youngest will swallow it (it's my biggest pet peeve), and then when the food comes watch us struggle while they then dig in. I've told him it's hard enough eating out even when he's there to help.   I honestly don't want to go alone. But the eldest wants to (her cousins have been pestering her about it), and my husband is weirdly trying to guilt trip me about it. And I feel bad making it an awkward situation, simply because I'm anxious at the thought of it, and don't know how it would actually go.	1642881086.0	saaiyg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saaiyg/wibta_if_i_skipped_my_fils_dinner_last_minute/	WIBTA if I skipped my FIL'S dinner last minute since my husband has to work?
iwxdhovi	 My F/30 boyfriend's M/32 birthday was days ago, I had my period at the time and had some really bad crumps that I could barely walk. Yet, I toom it upon myself to bake him his favorite cake and set up decorations and welcome his family who came over to visit.   This drama started when my boyfriend's mom looked at the cake when it was brought in and asked "what the hell happened to it?". I found that really rude but I told her this was all I could come up with. She blurted something then my boyfriend shouted "Mom! Don't mind her! She's on her period...she always messes things up when on her period" infront of everyone who began laughing, I was infuriated. I told him if he, his mom and tje rest if the family didn't like the cake then they didn't have to eat it. I took it to the kitchen and his mom started asking the hell I was doing. I told her to leave and she picked an argument with me. She left then the rest followed. The party ended obviously and my boyfriend asked wtf I just did, I told him I spent money, time, and effort to bake this cake amd he and his mom and everyone else made negative comments on it and I felt hurt because of that. He started arguing that I ruined his birthday and his relationship with his family by treating them like that. He took his jacket and shouted "You're crazy! You need to get a fucking grip" at me while walking out. He later sent me pictures of him and his family at the restuarant at 7PM celebrating his birthday and called me uncaring, nuts, mean and that I caused this to happen but they were clearly enjoying theur time.

(17M) also these are all fake names.   some background info; sal and ally are best friends, they knew each other the longest. they also love watching and binging shows together. me and jordan are best friends as we always talk a lot and have a brotherly bond. so it’s kind of a “split” friendship but we are all still really good friends.  anyways, me jordan and sal have a game we play together. Ally used to play aswell but got bored of the game and stopped last year in 2021. we continued to play this game but it was on and off. but she always got upset when we played that game. she wouldn’t tell me and jordan but she would always get mad at sal and sal was always forced to apologize to her if she wanted ally to talk to her again. this has happened multiple times as we play the game on and off. ***i also want to make it clear that we ALWAYS attempted to play another game so ally could join and we could all play together.*** she would always refuse or ignore us so we would play the game she didn’t like because we love it.  this last week, we’ve been playing and once again, ally has been upset with us. we’ve asked her time and time again if she would like to play anything else but she’s been ignoring us. sal complained to me last night about how she is sick of having to apologize to her every time. she told me she thinks it’s unfair how her wanting to play a game with me and jordan is always a problem with her. she began venting and telling me that she’s upset with her because she thinks of us as her friends too but ally is trying to take her away from us. she also saidbshe wishes ally acted like me and jordan because we don’t get mad when those two watch shows together. because when they do, they barely talk to either of us for days. but we don’t mind because we don’t enjoy binging shows.  i told sal i’ll talk to her and messaged her that night. i just sent her a message talking about how it’s not right to always control sal and that she needs to stop acting childish that we are playing a game she doesn’t like. especially since we ask her to play other games instead so we can play as a group.   now she’s mad at me. sal messaged me telling me that this morning, ally called her and was furious with me. i felt really bad about it but sal is telling me i did the right thing. also jordan has no idea about any of this.

iwvsv9is	Throw away because I don't want my name associated with this. A long time ago, in 2013, when I\[22F) was around 14, I met this girl on a forum about some rubbish fandom I was in. We quickly exchanged emails and began talking on google hangouts. Something inside of me looked up to the relentless sassiness of this woman, I idolised her in a sense.   I was shocked that she didn't care for the fact that I was 14 and she was 21. Not too far into our friendship, she discreetly asked if I would 'fuck her'.   I didn't really think of much of it when I'd initially read it. I had no reason to take her seriously; I was just a kid. I said no, and she took it horribly.   We started dating a short time after.   Eventually, instead of talking, we would role-play every day. She'd have me roleplay as fictional characters she was attracted to. More often than not, this would turn very sexual very quickly. If I were to take a break from this RP, she'd insult me relentlessly. She'd constantly use horrible methods to guilt me into roleplaying with her, despite my discomfort.   This went on almost every day.   When I'd called her out on her behaviour, she'd express remorse and promise to change. Yet, she never did. My life was a daily dedication to a fake world wherein I'd constantly have to act out sexual deeds to my distress.   It was so relieving to finally get her out of my life.   This past week, I got a DM from her. I got a sinking feeling in my stomach. At first, I didn't know how she found me.. until I'd realised that a friend had thought she'd been redeemed and directed her towards me. She hadn't changed a bit after all of these years.   I want to confront her for what she did, but I don't know if I should hold it against her. I'm not sure if what she did was severe enough to even justify my anger.   So, WIBTA if I were to confront her and tell her how I truly feel?	1642881919.0	saau0t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saau0t/wibta_if_i_confronted_someone_from_my_past/	WIBTA if I confronted someone from my past?

iwyo7mf4	 We had a new neighbor (Nick) move in recently, he's a single-dad to an infant, no mom in the picture and I still haven't found out what happened to her yet. To be frank, Nick seems to be having a hard time taking care of his son. He'd ask the female neighbors for advice all the time (he does it via group chat and I see it) he gets his son out in the backyard without his carrier or anything of the sort, just holding him in his hand while walking around or sitting, he also brought up some instances descriping how his son fell of the bed or getting sick and giving him home remedies instead of taking him to the ER like most parents do.   I got worried, I took my husband's advice and went to check on Nick to see if he was doing fine and also brought up the stuff he does that I find borderline neglectful to his son, he acted confused and said he was doing just fine. I told him I was worried but he indirectly said it was none of my business how he raises his son. I told him that everyone is a mandated reporter and that I would cobtact cps with my concerns if I needed to. he didn't take it well and told me to leave his house.   I didn't get why he reacted like this to my concerns, but what bothered me the most was the ladies in the neighborhood who said I went out of line and should never have even mentioned cps because he's "clearly" struggling but doing all he can to make ends meet. Besides the concetns I listed don't warrant cps involvement so they called me ridiculous but I don't know, I feel like if he thought he was doing it right then he should not have reacted like that when I voiced my concerns and also mentioning cps.

a0fdwj92	I’ve(F19) been friends with Sarah(F19) since the third grade. She used to lie A LOT and was constantly contradicting everything she said.   Anyways, about 5 years ago, we got into a pretty bad argument. It ended with her calling me every insult she could think of when I called her out. I didn’t talk to her for 3 years after that.   What was the argument about? She told me that blind people could drive. She said that her cousin, who has two glass eyes, got her license and was driving her around downtown. I knew she was lying, but I asked her how her cousin knew how to get around, when to stop or what to do if someone jumped in front of her vehicle.   Her response to everything was “(cousins name) has a really good sense of direction”.   I told her that wasn’t possible. My cousin is completely blind in one eye and she cannot get a license. It’s obviously not safe. Sarah did not like me calling her out and that’s when the insults started.   After that, we started talking again in the eleventh grade. She still lies occasionally, but whatever. I don’t consider her a close friend.   Last night, Sarah and I were out with a group of friends. Not sure what we were originally talking about, but Sarah brought up the topic again. This time, she said that I was the one who lied about having a blind cousin with a license.   I was pissed and my friends knew it too. They knew she was lying. I told her to “grow the f*** up and stop lying. You’re not a little girl anymore”. She got mad at left after once again, calling me a bunch of names.  My friends think I should’ve just let it go. Sarah had cancer when she was 11 and they believe that she lied because she didn’t have much of a childhood. So AITA?

79894qxo	I 15 f own a lot of animals,  they rang from small animals to birds.    I had happened to recently get 2 rats.    They have all the room they need.    They are both 2 young male rats, one is fine with being handle and etc.    I tend to like to take pictures of my animals and go on long rants about them.    My ex friend H use to own 2 male rats too we had stopped being friends due to not getting along and we both think of one and other as awful people and we try to avoid one and other. But sadly we have a few classes with one and other.   H rats did not live long, maybe 5 months at most and they didn't like her. They were both male adult rats who had better things to do than be around her and would often bite. They both died and I was there for her. She oddly mentioned wanting to dissect her one dead rat, to where she had put it in the freezer to do that. We are both 15, I personally find that strange but each to their own.   Because of hearing this, I assumed she didn't care for the rats and would often yell at them.   I had gotten these rats after a few months of us not being friends and etc. Their name is Chip and Dale. Both white and red eye rats, but sweethearts. I started talking about them in school and sharing pics of them online. These are both young male rats. And some of my friends in classes would ask me about them and I would talk about them. H seems annoyed when I mention them , even though I don't talk to her. She will talk more loudly and scream at her friends when she hears me.  She seems to get mad. A few people have told me its because she is still upset about her rats not working out with her and she is upset about seeing me taming them is going well. She is annoyed that I keep talking about them and why can't I talk about my hamsters or something else. I have thought about it and choose to not stop talking about them. They are something I am proud of and adore. I adore all my animals and love talking about them but my friends tell me its rude towards her.

9uvhywtv	AITA for not wanting it to go back to the way it was?   A few months ago, I posted on here how I was incredibly embarrassed and felt crappy about my girlfriend asking me to sleep in another bed. (I've since deleted this post due to privacy concerns) Basically I have sleep apnea, and she couldn't sleep. So she kicked me to the other bed. At the time, you guys told me I was the asshole for being upset about it, get it over it and also see a doctor.   I took your advice, put on my big boy pants and successfully changed my outlook on it. I also am waiting on that doctor's apt.   Here's where things get a little tricky.   I fucked up and because I was a little embarassed, I asked if we could not tell other people. I selfishly posted on here to figure out if I was the asshole, she creeped my reddit and found the post. She was really upset that I had asked for an agreement to not talk about it, and not thinking, had posted on here.   However in the following months I've since grown to like sleeping apart, I'm a very tall guy and the extra space is super nice. The other bed is also comfier.   Last night she told me she understands how I felt in the beginning now, and wants things to go back to the way they were. Am I the asshole for having changed my view point and enjoying it now? Am I a dick for pulling the uno reverse?  We haven't argued about this, and I'd like some other view points before I talk to her about it again. Some advice and grounded discussion about it would be super appreciated as well.	1642887861.0	sacy43	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sacy43/aita_for_not_wanting_our_previous_sleeping/	AITA for not wanting our previous sleeping arrangements?
9z84u7d3	My (27) best friend (28) was in a bad spot and needed a babysitter for her five year old so she could go to work. I agreed to babysit him as I work from home, and also have a five year old so I figured they could just keep each other entertained.   I thought this would be a temporary thing, but it turned into me babysitting nearly every day for about three months. It really started taking a toll on me so I started getting unreliable and just saying I had a lot of work to do and couldn’t do it. I wasn’t even getting paid for my services, except every now and then.   Eventually, she found a babysitter. This worked out for about a month, and then the babysitter had to quit due to circumstances in her life.   The other day, my friend hinted around that she needed me to babysit and I ignored her. She told me today she couldn’t go to work because she didn’t have a sitter and seemed angry with me. Now I’m feeling like a jerk for not just helping, but I’m sick of babysitting.

6n7qbe3u	For context my (29f) wife (30f) owns a tattoo shop along with our best friend (33f). I work with them as a receptionist and I invested part of my inheritance on the shop.   They have an apprentice (20f) that even though she “cleans” she never dusts the shelves or furniture, she  rarely watches them tattoo and if they need something handed to them my wife usually has to ask me since the apprentice doesn’t ask her what she needs or sometimes she is hanging out with the piercer. We all agreed that we wouldn’t reprimand her all together as she takes criticism really hard and becomes moody, my best friend has talked to her 1 on 1 about what she needs to improve, but it falls on deaf ears. We even made a list of tasks she has to do and still doesn’t do then. It’s been almost a year since she got here and she still asks me what she should or shouldn’t do.   Bear in mind usually apprentices have to pay for their apprenticeship but we decided not to charge her. It seems unfair to me that they have to basically teach her how to tattoo without nothing in return.  I feel I might be the asshole because I’m not an owner or an artist for that matter  but it frustrates me to see the shop dirty and I end up doing it myself so health department don’t trip.	1642888595.0	sad7h0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sad7h0/aita_for_getting_mad_at_the_tattoo_apprentice/	AITA for getting mad at the tattoo apprentice?
ix1ldilv	  Basically the title, to add some context:   My wife and I just welcomed our daughter, We're first time parents and I admit that we struggle with most tasks, that is why we always call mom for help and she's been very helpful.   Yesterday, my wife had to visit the doctor and we called mom to ask her to come stay with our daughter til we get back. When we got back we found out that mom had given our daughter a bath, my wife for some reason lost it, she started arguing with mom telling her she had no permission to bath our daughter. Mom told her that our daughter had a strange smell and clearly needed a bath. My wife told her that she was waiting to give our daughter her first bath and she ruined that for her and took this bonding experience away from her. I got involved and told my wife she was being ridiculous using this kind of langauge because this stuff didn't matter, all that mattered was our daughter's health and besides, she won't remember her first bath and who gave it to her but my wife obviously was thinking of her own feelings and exprience. She acted shocked and said she is the mother of course it matters, but I told her she overreacted and that it wasn't acceptable of her to treat mom like this after everything she's done for us. Mom left and my wife argued that I was picking sides but I don't think I was, just trying to point out how unreasonable reacting the way she did. She started crying saying mom always ruins things for her and that I never understand.  Really, I don't get why this is such a big deal, but my wife has been cold shouldering me eversince blaming me for what I said.

epgxsix7	So, I'd like to start with, I've told my father that my children can call him and he can call them.     TL;DR  The Backstory..........  We live in the same town, always have. My mother (53F) and my father (55M) are still together (Married around 30 years).    I (28M) was in a long term relationship {engaged} with a Woman who we will call Emily (28F). Together Emily and I have 2 children. We will call them Sophie (10F) & Jake (7M).   We separated a few years ago and I have recently got engaged again to another Woman who we will call Jessica (26F).   Jessica has 2 children from a previous relationship. We will call them Charlie (7M) & Hayley (4F).   Shortly after Jessica and I started dating, we found out that Jessica was pregnant (With my child). This baby has now been born and we will call them Luca (0M).    So yes we have 5 children between us. Each bringing 2 children from previous relationships to the house + our child we have together. To save confusion.      I have been going through the court process for over a year now with Emily to be able to re-engage with my children. There was a period for around 6 months after we separated that I was not able to contact my children in any way, even by phone. Because Emily was jealous that I moved on so quickly with Jessica.    This is a different story. And none of the separation details are relevant to this, so ill leave this here..   For those wondering, I was the one that called it quits and "walked out".  For over a year, Jessica and her children {Charlie & Hayley} (who I call my children also, but for the purpose of this I will call them her children) have been going to my parents house once a week on the same night each week for dinner.   My father has some serious anger issues and we have told him he needs help, which he refuses to seek. He yells over absolutely nothing at everyone, all the time.   This got to the point where it was starting to make Jessica feel uncomfortable. Even Jessica's children said they sometimes didn't like going to my parents house because my father yelled too much and is mean.     From around 6 months before Luca was born, we told my parents that we have a very hard boundary, and that boundary is for all of our children to be treated equally, by everyone.    Yes, some of them have different parents, however, they are all children, and should all be loved equally.   The actual Story.........   A few weeks ago (Before Christmas), Jessica told me she was not going to our usual dinner, because she didn't want to be around it. This was also shortly after having my children {Sophie & Jake} and Jessica's children + our baby at my parents house. During this visit with all of the children my mother and father showed very obvious favouritism towards my (first) 2 children to the point where, after we got home, Jessica's children asked us why this had happened.   Jessica wanted me to speak to my parents about what had happened, and asked for it to not continue. "Tackle the issue" before it became a "problem". Due to Jessica not liking being around confrontation, and my fathers temper she asked me to do this alone, to which I had no issue with doing.     During this "Solo Dinner" I explained the issue to my parents and even pointed out that we had been telling them of our Boundary for Over 6 months.   My mother agreed that it was wrong, however, my father straight up said "They are not your kids, they are not my grand-children, and I will not treat them the same". Stating that Jessica's children were rude and disrespectful, because the youngest cries all the time and the oldest is a handful (he has social disorders and anger issues) {These are being looked into by professionals}. These traits of Jessica's children are almost identical to the traits that my children have.      There was a big argument. I told my parents there would be no more weekly dinners, because I was not going to bring Jessica and her "rude and disrespectful" children to their house any longer.     Shortly after, was Christmas. We were supposed to attend a {family tradition} Christmas breakfast at their house with Jessica's children + our baby. We would not see my children until the afternoon.   Due to the arguments that had been had, Jessica told me that her and all 3 of her children would not be going, however, i was more than welcome to go. Which I did not (my choice).   I informed my parents that none of us would be attending. I also informed them that they were BOTH welcome to come to our house after lunch, when we would have all 5 children. My mother came, my father did not.     A few weeks later, was our oldest child's 10th Birthday. As there was a lot of activity going on for her birthday, and not much time for everything, I invited BOTH of my parents around to celebrate having the birthday cake with her (about 1.5-2 hours). My other showed, my father did not.   Later the next day, after dropping my children back to Emily, Emily messaged me to let me know that Sophie was 'distraught' that my father did not see her for her 10th birthday. This caused some major issues between me and my parents, as it was now effecting the children.     I messaged my mother to ask her to organise a time for BOTH of my parents to come and talk about the issues we were all having to we could "get over it, and move on with our lives", however the Boundary of ALL children being treated as equals was not something that Jessica and I were willing to budge on.   I expressed that if they did not come to see us, they were making their choice to not be (Physically) part of our children's lives any longer.      Last week, was the day this was supposed to happen. My mother showed up, and told us that my father was refusing to come, because he believes that he has done nothing wrong.     I explained to my mother that because she made the effort to come see and talk to us, and fully understand what we are asking that she will be invited to things, however, because my father refused he would not.   She said she understands, and she wants to be a part of the children's lives, with or without my father.     AITA for removing him (Physically) from the children's lives because he refuses to treat all 5 children as equals?	1642888574.0	sad785	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sad785/aita_for_telling_my_father_he_is_no_longer/	AITA for Telling my father he is no longer allowed to be physically around my children?
3p2wsxs8	My best friend “Rachel” is extremely attractive, and all of our male mutual friends have crushes on her. I do not care that they have crushes on her, it doesn’t bother me. However, I’ve noticed that our friends treat me differently.  After a break, “Brandon” at one point said that he was never upset when him and I stopped being friends, but he was depressed when him and Rachel stopped talking. He never teases her in front of other people, and gives her a lot of physical affection (the two cuddle every time we hangout). Whenever I suggest cuddling, he says that I’m “gross” and tells me to “go away.” Brandon goes out of his way to tell Romey things, or invite her personally to events. There was a point where his friend, “Faith,” asked him about Rachel, and he told her that inviting Rachel meant inviting me. It felt like I was a younger sibling that Rachel was forced to take with her to events, like I was a tag-along. “Mike” went from being affectionate with me, to not being able to make eye contact with me. I noticed that when we hung out alone, he would talk to me and be affectionate, but once Rachel began hanging out with us, Mike began completely ignoring me. There was a point when I had a bad experience with a friend’s marijuana, but Mike did not believe me until Rachel had the same experience.  When I realized that there were some differences in treatment, I decided to begin distancing myself. I was tired of feeling like Rachel’s inferior, and feeling like my friends did not care if I was around, so long as she was there.  Rachel told me that both Mike and Brandon mentioned speaking to me less, but neither of them asked me personally to talk about it or hangout.  I was hoping that someone would reach out to me instead of her, because I am able to speak for myself. I decided to remain reserved, because I don’t want to have to fight to convince someone to care about me. Last night, Rachel, Brandon, and some mutual friends hung out. I was not invited. Rachel asked “what are we doing today” in a group chat, and Brandon and I both responded with the events we had going on that day. No plans were made, so I was a little bit taken aback to see everyone hanging out.  Today, Rachel asked me why I was distant. I explained that it was not her fault, but that I was tired of being treated like her inferior. She told me that I should talk to Brandon and Mike. So I asked Brandon if we could talk. Brandon explained that I was not invited because Faith was already invited, and I dislike Faith. I have never said that I would refuse to go to an event if Faith was there. I asked why Rachel had been invited then, because Rachel doesn’t like Faith either. I asked why Rachel and I got treated differently. Brandon said he was not aware that Rachel disliked Faith, and then said I was “really overthinking” the situation.  Rachel said she agrees with Brandon  Am I overthinking this? Am I the asshole here?	1642889876.0	sadopp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sadopp/aita_for_distancing_myself/	AITA for distancing myself?
ix21hs7w	TW: AB*RTION Throwaway account as well. I’m on mobile so I apologize for any typos.   A couple of weeks ago my friend [F24] told me [F24] she was pregnant and not sure on what to do.  Then one night she texts me that she’s has an appointment to terminate the pregnancy the following morning and if she and her fiancé could borrow my car. She said it’s totally fine if she can’t, that she and her fiancé will find another way to get there.   I responded saying I have to be at work early morning and I need my to car to get the work. She responded saying it’s alright and that she understands. I assume her fiancé will borrow his siblings car, or call a taxi. We live in a busy city where everything is close by, and taxi / rentals are not expensive or hard to get.     The following morning I check on her and she doesn’t respond. I give her space, assuming it’s an emotional time.  2 weeks pass and I’ve called twice, messaged her asking if she needs anything, wants me to come over, and just asking to hear if she’s okay. No reply.    Finally about 3 weeks after the fact, she responds saying she’s very disappointed in me for not letting her borrow my car. She also said she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I apologized over and over again saying I needed it to get to work and she knows I would’ve let them borrow my car if it was any other time.  And she knows that because I have allowed them to take it out of state on multiple occasions. With no hesitation.   Anyway, she hasn’t accepted my apology and has just stopped responding. I’m assuming the friendship is probably over, after 15 years.

79894qxo	I 15 f is dating a 14 m , we are one grade apart. We mainly see one and other in school and online. Lately boyfriend has been wanting to see me out of school more and more. I agree that it would be nice. Last weekend I had went over to meet his parents for the first time and it went well, we werent allowed in his room which is fine, we sat in the living room and just talked and played with birds for 2 hours. My boyfriend has been wanting to come over to my house, we would be allowed in my room with the door open, since an event that happened with an ex of mine, I am no longer allowed to have the door close. It wasn't a good event and left me pretty traumatized. So I tend to never close my door. My boyfriend parents don't know of this event. Nor do I plan on telling them. But his father agreed to letting my boyfriend seeing me out of school if he got 70 + grades, which he has, and when he tries asking his dad his dad flips out saying NO. Because you guys could have (you can guess). Which isnt the case since I am not really interested in that stuff. My boyfriend has tried explaining many times to him that, it isnt the case since I have 2 brother, 32 animals, and etc, so how would that even work. His father still says no and is not gonna change his mind, but I am welcomed to come to their house and he has offered to take us bowling, or on little trips if we want. My boyfriend doesn't like any of this because the last time I was at his house it was boring in his eyes. And that he wishes his father would trust him. Than he goes on a rant about how awful his father is and etc. Personally I think my boyfriend is over reacting , and I kinda wanna tell him that since all he does is rant about his father. I personally understand where his dad is coming from, he just doesn't want him to do dumb things and get hurt, and our familys don't know one and other well so I understand why he can't come over. Yes I am also annoyed but I also understand, maybe with time we can hangout at my house but His dad doesn't know my mom or how she is at all. So WIBTA for telling him he is over reacting?	1642891607.0	saebh2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saebh2/wibta_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_is_over_reacting/	WIBTA for telling my boyfriend he is over reacting?
iwwnu9y1	Title sounds bad, but hear me out.   My (15F) friend (15M) and I are very close. We go round to each others house very often and our parents and families know each other.  Just for a little context, my guy friend is extremely insecure about his weight. He thinks he’s really fat (he is only slightly overweight and he isn’t even fat, he just has a little bellly.) He only really speaks about it to me. And he eats a lot sometimes and asked me to tell him to stop when I think he’s ate too much since he’s trying to loose weight.   A few days ago, I was invited to a Sunday dinner with his extended family.  His mom cooked a bunch of food and we all helped ourselves. My friend had a very large first portion, like twice as big as mine and mine was pretty big. Anyway, after that he went for a second which was the same size as the first. I was pretty gentle about it and said ‘oh don’t you think thats a lot?’ We weren’t near the family dinner table and obviously I wouldn’t said it there loudly since it would embarrass him. He just shrugged it off and ate it. After he finished, he wanted more and asked me to get him another portion otherwise his mom would tell him off. Again, I didn’t say it out loud in front of everyone but I just said to him ‘maybe you should slow down on how much you eat.’ Another reason I said this was because me and the rest of his family were still eating out first portion and there was barely any food left so if more people wanted seconds, they could have seconds. He got mad saying I’m being an asshole and that he wasn’t eating that much. Anyway, I didn’t get him a second portion and when I got home he was angry with me.   So AITA? I mean he did ask me to tell him and he’s trying to loose weight so I was only trying to help.	1642891604.0	saebfc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saebfc/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_stop_eating_so_much/	AITA for telling my friend to stop eating so much?
5w2qjksf	For context, my bf (26) and I (22) live in an apartment together. We are moving separately next week so we have been packing and moving things. We are not broken up, but i am getting a place by myself and he is moving back in with his mom to save money. Our dog was originally my dog but we have lived together for almost 2 years and agreed to raise her together as our dog. We also raised 2 cats together from birth (they are going with him to his moms). I am also back at college for the first time in 4 years and i am adjusting to the new time management.  2 days ago i woke up late for class and i noticed my dog made an accident. I saw it but didn’t have time to address it, i got home 2 hours later and cleaned it up. I am not mad about this, it was my mistake and i took care of it. But this is brought up in a later argument.  This morning i woke up and my bf was already up, our dog was whining and i asked if he could take her out, he said yes. So i laid back down. I got up an hour later and asked if he had taken her out, he said no so i asked if he could. He said “i want to lay down though”  This was the first thing that pissed me off since he said earlier he would.  So i took her out, and spotted a puddle inside the living room and diarrhea. So she is clearly not feeling well. I was already upset and said “can you clean this up? I have a quiz to take”. He didn’t say anything and went to do things around the apartment. And i sat down to do my quiz. I assumed it was cleaned because we talked more about other stuff after the quiz.  I went back into the living room and the mess was still there. I was livid. I confronted him about it and he just gave me a pissed off face. So i went to clean it up.   We didn’t talk for a few hours. I decided to break the silence and said “hey listen, i dont want us to be mad at each other, but that kinda pissed me off”. He said “is that all you have to say?” And made that same face. So i said “whatever dude” and went to go continue packing.  About another hour of silence and individual packing, and he is about to leave to drop off stuff at his moms. He stops in the kitchen and tells me he loves me, and i told him i loved him too but i wanted to talk.  I told him basically why i am upset. And he said “you woke up late for class yesterday, she is your dog, how are you supposed to take care of her on your own if you cant take her out?” Like yes that was my bad and i cleaned up the mess. I can take care of my dog but she has been our dog and i just asked for a favor. I said “you could have just said no instead if saying you would do something and then not do it.”   He said “fine, no.” And left.  AITA?  Tldr: my bf agreed to take the dog out but  didnt, she made a mess, i was mad that he wouldn’t clean it up.	1642891757.0	saedcy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saedcy/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_bf_for_not_taking_our/	AITA for getting mad at my BF for not taking our dog out?
4o1yg6i4	Basically the title. I (F21) have been dating M22 for about a year, and in that time, we’ve had a great relationship, he is super sweet and supportive, and we’ve gone on fun trips, met each other’s families and click really well. However, there is one small issue: I look forward to and enjoy celebrating holidays, and he doesn’t. This issue started about a year ago, on Valentine’s Day, when I made him a small handmade card and he didn’t do anything for me. I let him know that made me feel a little bit let down and sad (I also made it clear that this wasn’t about money, I would have been totally happy with a playlist or a note- it’s more about the thought for me than a gift) and he said okay, that he understood. Fast forward nine months though, and our one-year anniversary arrived. I told him beforehand that I really wanted this day to be special, and we planned to have dinner at the place where we had our first date. Fast forward to the day of, and he was really busy, and so I asked if he wanted to just celebrate the next week instead, because I didn’t want to put pressure on him at a bad time, but I really cared about making our anniversary a special day. He said he was still down to celebrate, but showed up an hour and 45 minutes late, with no gift, (again, I had made him a small note and printed out a couple pictures of highlights from our year) and a bottle of wine I recognized as taken from his mom’s wine cabinet. I didn’t say anything at the time, but the day after, I took the Christmas gift I got for him and gave it to my sister instead. Come Christmas, as anticipated, he did not have a gift, but I felt better about it because I didn’t either. I didn’t realize how much this was weighing on me until earlier this week, when I realized I had started feeling distant and resentful, and so I brought it up. We talked, and his rationale for not caring about special occasions was that it just wasn’t a priority for him, if we made the other 365 days of the year special, why did these special occasions matter? And while he does make the whole year special and is very caring in general, I still feel like I genuinely like to make an effort on holidays to make other people feel special and loved, and I told him that that was important to me, to which he asked why it had to be “my way or the highway”- which made me feel really bad about asking. Ultimately, he said if it was important to me, he would place more emphasis on it, but then he made a joke about how he was going to get me a card I wouldn’t like for Valentine’s Day. I feel like he missed the point- that it’s not about the gift, it’s about being excited to plan for and celebrate your significant other, and I think we might be incompatible if he doesn’t understand that. I’m going to talk to him about it later today, but is this too much to ask for?   TL:DR - bf doesn’t think holidays are a big deal, and I do.  AITA for not being ok with this?	1642893384.0	saeywx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saeywx/aita_for_wanting_holidays_xmas_bdays/	AITA for wanting holidays (Xmas, bdays, anniversaries, etc) to be special?
imhdt55v	Back in january of 2019 we were having a party for my brother's birthday at my moms house. My aunt was there. She got drunk. After me begging her she agreed to let me give her a ride. My moms dog started puking all over the place so I took him to the vet and told my aunt to stay put. I should have took her keys but I didn't.  I should have.   When I got back she had left. I ignored all her texts. A couple months ago I was riding around with my mom and she stopped at my aunts. My aunt walks out and they are taking for a little bit. She then looks at my and says "I love you nick". I said "love you too". That was the only interaction we had in 2 years.   Anyways, she just texted me saying that she knows I'm mad at her but she needs some work done around her house and that she would pay me. I am looking for work but I really dont want to be around her in case she does something like she did at the party. Idk, im really not that mad at her anymore but idk if I should let her off. WIBTA if i kept ignoring her texts?	1642893736.0	saf3i7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saf3i7/wibta_if_i_were_to_keep_ignoring_my_aunt_because/	WIBTA if I were to keep ignoring my aunt, because she drove drunk?
oocfp	I (24m) have been chilling with my sibling’s (31m) friend (30m) who’s also my friend now. They both recently traveled, and that friend recently called me asking me to send my sibling my netflix login info. I was confused why my sibling didn’t just ask me himself initially, but figured they were busy, and since I’m close with that friend too, they took it upon themselves to ask. No biggie, and I don’t mind even, we’re all like one family. Later that evening, I was texting my sibling, and I asked if the netflix login worked and such. He told me that he hasn’t been able to get it working for a couple days now (something about not inputting my password properly) and that he ended up making a new account and just paying again. (He’s also paying for my account) - I was wondering why my friend called and asked for my Netflix account if my sibling had his own set up which my friend could use. (they spend evenings together a lot abroad) - So I texted my friend my netflix information because I thought them calling meant they were indirectly asking me for the info… to which they said they don’t want it anymore because I clearly didn’t want to give it to them earlier. I said I don’t understand indirect language, and if they wanted my account, they should have just been straightforward about it, not tell me: “text the info to your brother, not me.” I wouldn’t have even realized it if I hadn’t spoken to my sibling after. My friend kept pressing, telling me I should have understood right away, not (and I quote) “circled around” the discussion first. I’m surprised at how mad he is about this. AITA for trying to circle around the topic instead of just giving him the info as well during the call? I need an outside perspective.

68zjq07k	So just a little bit of backstory, I live in a college apartment with two of my good friends from highschool.  One of my friends (roommate #2) has a boyfriend stays at our apartment quite often, and our other friend (roommate #3) and I don't necessarily like because of how he treats roommate #2.   He's cheated on her multiple times, I've witnessed him talking down to her, and in MY opinion, he's just a crappy person in general. He sleeps at the apartment often and is not actually enrolled at our school but works nearby. I try to stay out of their arguments for the most part, due to the fact that I know he's a narcissist and i've been in relationships with those types of people before, and i understand there isn't really anything I can say or do except support her when she is finally ready to dump him.   However, a few nights ago, roommate #2 and her boyfriend went on a double date with several of his friends.   Around midnight,  R#2 calls me crying and drunk because she got into a fight with said boyfriend during the date. Apparently after the fight, he rode home with one of his friends leaving her stranded, intoxicated, and unable to to drive. R#2  asked if either me or R#3 could come and pick her up. Now, I don't have a car, and neither does R#3, however we knew that R#2's boyfriend parks his beaten up sedan at our apartment, and then he used my friends car for the rest of the week, sometimes even leaving her unable to go places.   I asked R#2 one last time if she wanted us to come and get her (she was an hour and a half away) and she said yes. Tone fair, I did not tell her which car we would be using to come and get her, for fear of her saying not to come if we had to use his car. I was more concerned with the idea of my friend being stranded and drunk alone somewhere, than her boyfriends car breaking down en route.   Long story short, R#3 and I went into R#2's room and got her boyfriends car keys, and then drove the hour and a half to get her. The plan between me and R#3 was that we would park the boyfriends car at the gas station, one of us would drive R#2'd car back home, and boyfriend could come pick up his car whenever.   However, R#2 was very upset when she saw that we had used her boyfriends car to come get her, and made us to wait for him to come and get it, and make sure we hadn't damaged anything on the already messed up vehicle.   I admit, I lied/omitted the truth by not telling her how we planned to come get her, but I was more concerned for my friends safety than her boyfriends car.   So am I the asshole?

h5nukmkm	Hi, new poster on mobile. I (20f) started a group chat for my college Spanish class. I do this for most of my classes so that we have a place complain about grades and compare difficulty of assignments. We never cheat; just discuss what I’ve listed above.   I messaged yesterday asking about the difficulty of the quiz. No one responded, so I assumed that no one had taken it yet. Today, a girl (idk her age) responded that maybe people weren’t responding out of fear of being reported to the honor court. I asked simply if that was anyones intentions. Some people responded, but she didn’t. So, I tagged her and asked the question again.  She then told me to chill out and that I have no idea what a person is going through and to stop being rude. Since I’m the owner of the group, I simply removed her and was thinking about what to write in an email to her separately.   Then, her sister messaged me on social media calling me a b***h and threatening to report me to the university for abusing someone with a mental disability. I had no idea that she had autism and told her sister about my intentions to apologize. Her sister continued to attack my character and call me names.   I reported her sister for harassment and blocked her. I have emailed the girl apologizing profusely. I just want to know if I’m TA for asking her the question directly and removing her from the group chat afterwards?   (Note to add: I’m currently being tested for autism so please don’t attack me for being an ableist. I had no idea about her disability.)	1642894165.0	saf8zw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saf8zw/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_out_of_a_college_class/	AITA for kicking a girl out of a college class group chat?
6l9wfg0x	Im black and 17F and i work at a preschool/daycare.  My kids that i teach are 0-5yrs old. I usually have my natural hair out, but recently ive been wearing knotless braids, soft locs, or any kind of extension hair. My babies love playing with my hair. Whether is my real hair or my braids. It usually helps me with my job as well. for example if im changing diapers and the baby is crying over getting changed, i show them my hair and they start playing and giggling. I find it adorable. My hair is always pulled back though.  Recently i got extensions called soft locs. They go down to my lower back. When i came into work my babies were all like “your hair grew! Your hair is at your booty! Let me play with it” and they were all flabbergasted at how long my hair was until i told them its fake hair, they were disappointed but still wanted to play with it.   My boss took me out of the classroom and took me somewhere else to talk. She said that my hair is distracting and i need to get rid of it. I explained that i can’t do it immediately, and i asked her how it was distracting. she said “You had pink braids before and the kids always wanted to play with it, and now  you have long locs and the kids want to play with it. You need to have hair that isn’t dramatic” I told her that the kids only play with my hair when its appropriate. Never during snacktime or nap time. They play with it mostly during carpet time. i also said that her calling my hair dramatic was rude.   She got mad at me and told me to leave and forget about it. I asked the other bosses if my hair was distracting and they both said no and that they love seeing the kids play with it. I feel like im TA because i didn’t understand my other boss’s POV.	1642894735.0	safg6n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safg6n/aita_for_having_long_extensions_and_telling_my/	AITA for having long extensions and telling my boss she said something rude?
drxnq6dw	My boyfriend and I still argue about this but long story short, a couple months ago a short group of us went out drinking. I didn’t get drunk so I watched the whole group get wasted except for one called Daniel. I spent most of the time with my partner and Daniel and a few hours later the club shut down. There were a lot of things that went down that night and when the group finally found each other, we waited by the sidewalk. My boyfriends buddy (we’ll call him Crackhead Joe) was going to call an Uber for us all and so we waited. Daniel and I were in charge of watching crackhead Joe’s gf since she was way too drunk and tried running out into the street multiple times!! She calmed down and I look over to see where Joe is at. We were standing out in the cold for 20 minutes. Next thing I see, Joe (who is wasted) is talking to three black guys and my dumbass boyfriend was right there. To be blunt, Joe says some racist shit. It’s annoying af but I was worried he was going to make a bad joke. So my heart dropped and I quickly ran over. Joe makes a comment about how they (him and my bf) can take them on in a fight. My boyfriend proceeds to stand tall and push his shoulders back like he’s ready to fight and I got pissed. I nudged him and tried pushing him away, apologizing to the poor guys but one of them laughed, looked at Joe and said “You’re funny man. Look that’s pretty funny and you seem cool but you better go before you get hurt.” Joe laughed and said he could still beat them but walked away thankfully. When we safely left home, I told my boyfriend about the incident the next day. He laughed it off and claimed he was backing up his buddy. When I told him it was stupid he continued to explain how it was “being a good friend” I told him he’s a moron. He then asked, if he had gotten himself in that same situation wouldn’t I rather have Joe stand up and help him. I responded with, you dug that grave you lay in it. He still believes he’s in the right and I still think he’s stupid.

10zos9	So a couple of months ago me, my girlfreind, and a couple of buddys went to a nightclub . Truth be told we all had a little bit to drink. At the end of the night we were all out next to the street and i find myself and my girlfreind preventing my buddys girlfreind from running into the street. She just is drunk and completly forgets to look both ways. So we sit her down on the curb and i go to find my buddy and see him talking to 3 black guys. Well there both just saying shit back and forth like if we fought you would lose. And me not afraid looks at the biggest one out of the group and says fighting us wouldent be that easy. My girlfreind then comes out of nowhere and diffuses the situation and gets us out of there saying stuff like lets just go. Looking back on it I dont think there would have actully been a fight if she dident show up, but the next morning she was mad at me for backing my buddy up if there would have been a fight. I dont agree with how i went about the situation but i wouldent let my buddy be jumped by 3 people. So i guess am i the asshole for making the decision to back my buddys up in fights?	1642895206.0	safm3z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safm3z/aita_for_backing_my_buddy_up_in_a_fight/	AITA for backing my buddy up in a fight
6qif8i6i	before i start, this is not a big deal. don’t sensationalize this. my family and i are okay. we have a fine relationship. i just wanna know if i’m a dick here.   i (20m) live in a multi-generational household (as many people do. it’s normal in my culture. etc etc). we’re my grandma, my parents, and my sibling (16nb).  my dad and i both work full-time, and i’m a full-time student. my mom homeschools my sibling, and they also have co-op and basketball. my grandma is retired. overall i’m home the least out of everyone in my family.   we take turns cooking dinner. everyone has one day a week, and then there are two days of leftovers. on my cooking day i make a big effort to have warm food ready for everyone. it’s usually ready as soon as everyone gets home.   but when others cook i always have to reheat food for myself. i understand, because i get home at 9pm, and that’s way too late for dinner. but it sucks that i never get fresh meals. when my sibling gets home late i always make sure there’s hot food for them too. usually by making two simple dinners: one big one for the family and one small one for them.   i don’t expect my family to do this for me every night. but i asked them to try sometimes. my mom said it’s self centered to ask. that i choose my own schedule, and i cant expect the rest of my family to accommodate it. and that’s true.   we compromised, they just don’t put the food away until i get home so i only have to heat it up a little bit. but was it selfish to ask?	1642895366.0	safo2o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safo2o/aita_for_asking_my_family_to_have_food_ready_when/	AITA for asking my family to have food ready when i’m home?
bfd3l470	I’ve (F20) been friends with a girl (F20) for about 2.5 years, let’s call her Emma. For context, I have been her only friend in college the entire time we’ve been here (3 years). I have since made other friends. This is relevant because for the entirety of our friendship Emma made it a point to tell me that it was up to me to make friends so that I could just introduce her to the friend group. When my girlfriend (of 2 years at that point) came to visit my freshman year, Emma tried to make it a competition as to who was “better” friends with me. My girlfriend doesn’t like emma.  We’re now roommates. She became friends with our other roommate Polly, but Polly and I are better friends. Polly and Emma would sit in the living room for 12+ hours to watch movies, but if Polly and I bumped into each other in the parking lot, Emma would ask each of us separately what we had talked about and get upset that we spent any amount of time without her. She gets easily jealous if we spend any time with any other friends.  When my girlfriend (now for 4 years) came to visit, Polly and her immediately hit it off. Emma took Polly aside and told her that my girlfriend was abusive towards me and insulted her. Obviously Polly told me. I told Emma that I had overheard her say these things and that I wasn’t interested in being friends with her any longer. Without being prompted, Emma said that she had never said anything to Polly, which was obviously a lie. She then said that she had been having a “difficult day”.   We left for winter break and she came back with the expectation that I would be over it. Her expectation that I would forgive her for lying and insulting my girlfriend only makes me less inclined to do so.  My parents think I should forgive her and that I’m being mean by ignoring her in the apartment.	1642895849.0	safu02	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safu02/aita_for_not_forgiving_a_friend_for_making_up/	AITA for not forgiving a friend for making up lies about me and manipulating me

They parted ways 20 minutes after talking and he told me that he thought she was cute and that he wished he would've gotten her name and her phone number.   I told her that she was actually a former student of mine like 6-7 years ago and he was like, "Really? Do you remember her name or anything like that?" I do remember her name, but I told him I wouldn't give it out to respect her privacy.   My nephew got annoyed with me because "they are both adults." They being him and the girl. AITA?

3zf4s501	The TV and our ps5’s ( that I bought for us) are in our room. And almost every night, he will play with his friends or his siblings. While he’s playing, he talks REALLY loudly. He doesn’t realize how loud he’s being until I tell him to please be quieter, but he doesn’t listen. When I want to spend the night with him, watching movies or something, he’ll beg me to let him play with his friends. It hurts my feelings, cause he plays with them every night, and we barely get quality time cause we work 6-7 days a week. And after our shift, he gets on his ps5.   Anyways, onto the story. Yesterday we got off our shift after working for a week straight, and was complaining about how tired he was. We got home, and not even 2 hours passed, and he’s already on the ps5. He ignored me for hours and at 1pm, I fell asleep.   He woke me up at 4pm, because of how LOUD he was being. He was still playing and laughing. I told my parents about it this morning, and my parents told me that they had heard him all night too, all the way from their bedroom, upstairs. I tried sleeping, but I couldn’t. I was so upset, and started tearing up because he was being so inconsiderate to not even have the decency to be quiet and let me sleep. After a few mins, I took my phone and a pillow, and left the room. I went to go sleep by my dogs kennel. He texted me saying, “what’s happened with you?” I was very uncomfy sleeping on the floor so after about 10 mins, I went back to the room. When I opened the door, he was sitting there, giggling with his friends. I unloaded on him. I called him selfish and rude. How he didn’t even go check on me, when he saw me storm out of the room with tears in my eyes. I called him a POS. I told him how tired of this I am. He got upset at me, telling me I was being dramatic, and that I could’ve just told him to go to sleep, and he would’ve. But I have done that, and every time, he’ll say,” ok but two more matches and I’m done”. And a couple hours will pass, and he’s still on. I told him to get out and sleep on the couch, and that I don’t care if he can’t sleep, because he wasn’t letting me sleep either. Eventually, he went to go sit on the couch, but when I woke up in the morning, he was in bed with me.   All day, he’s been ignoring me. Refusing to eat. I made him food, he says he’s “not hungry”. Which I don’t believe.I’m seriously contemplating trashing our ps5’s that I spent thousands on all together. So he could quit with this shit. I don’t think he’s planning on apologizing, and he’s currently on his ps5 rn. He’s never acted this way towards me before, so it’s having me contemplate whether I’m the AH here or not.	1642898205.0	sagnqn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sagnqn/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_fiance_for_being_too/	AITA for getting upset at my fiance for being too loud?
aftibjky	Throwaway because my main has too many identifying details.  My job has been remote for a while now. I work in a team with one direct supervisor. Since we haven't seen each other in almost 2 years, our supervisor invited us over for dinner last night. I wasn't too excited, because I'm not close friends with anyone, but I figured coming out of my dark cave couldn't hurt.  I end up seated next to a coworker that I'm not super fond of. He's kind of an over-sharer. During dinner, the everyone-involved table conversation devolves into everyone having a mini conversation with the person to their right or left. I already know things are going south when my coworker says "let's not talk about work anymore....all we do is work". That's fair but I don't particularly like to share deets of my personal life with my non-friend coworkers (also, I've done absolutely nothing but gain weight in the last two years....whatevs). So, I basically let my coworker do all the talking.  He starts telling me about his new BF, who he's been dating less than two months. They've been spending a ton of time together and sleeping over each other's places yada yada yada. Then he randomly says "well I'm trying to figure out how much he makes right now". I kinda said "well, it's early on......". And he goes "yeah, it's early. but I like to travel and eat out, and I want to still do all those things without making him feel awkward". Fair enough. Then he starts explaining how much sleuthing he's already done on the issue. This dude already found out his BF's rent and thinks its "cheap" (why is that a bad thing?). And he looked up the average salary of people in the dude's field. He even looked up the average salary of graduates from this guy's school.  Then, because I was keeping the convo so one-sided, it kinda died down. We started looking at our phones awkwardly. So I just randomly blurt out to him "well if you know where he works or what he does, you can go on Indeed and try to find out how much he makes or you could try looking at openings in his company". The guy was like "yeah I guess" but starts reiterating that he doesn't really care how much his BF makes, it's really just about traveling and being able to split expenses.  So, I guess Coworker 1 told Coworker 2 what I said at the dinner. Because Coworker two messaged me on slack this morning to tell me that Coworker 1 said that I shouldn't be concerned about what Coworker 1's BF makes. I said that I didn't care and he brought it up first. Apparently, Coworker 1 would like an apology. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong and that Coworker 1 is just embarrassed about how materialistic he made himself look. My brother says that *maybe* this is one of those "I can say it, but you can't say it" scenarios. Like, I call myself fat all the time, but if someone else did it, I'd be pissed. Ya know?

er86wtzw	I’m home from university at the minute. My dad is very obsessive and awkward about some small things that no one seems to care about besides him. We have wondered if he has some form of mild autism but equally likely he’s just a bit awkward and unreasonable sometimes.   So I used his toothpaste this evening and midway through brushing my teeth my mum called me to help with something so I ran downstairs and spat in our downstairs bathroom instead because that was where she was. I rushed out and forgot to put the lid on the toothpaste. I would absolutely have put the lid on once I went to return toothbrush after speaking with my mum. In the meantime though my dad went to brush his teeth and found his toothpaste without the lid on. He was annoyed and came downstairs to say I should’ve have used it and definitely shouldn’t have left the lid off. Somehow it turned into an argument. I said I didn’t know it was his and I would’ve put the lid on when I went back up led to him getting annoyed and then going up to bed in a huff.  Me and my mum think he’s being ridiculous. I know this is a slightly bizarre AITA.   Anyway, disregarding the prob ably convincing notion that getting that annoyed about toothpaste is in itself ridiculous, these are the reasons I think he has no right to be annoyed and that I told to him once he’d gotten annoyed.   1. He didn’t tell me at any point it was his toothpaste until now. Much to my 12 years old selfs disappointment, I’m not telepathic. Moreover the concept of individual toothpastes in a family home is certainly not something I even knew was a thing in my family or as far as I can tell anything a normal person would think to expect. He hadn’t put it away anywhere or done anything that would make a normal person think his toothpaste wasn’t for general use. 2. It was normal toothpaste. It was the only not empty toothpaste out in the bathroom except my mums non fluoride one that tastes like fruity sweat. My brother had taken the toothpaste I had been using normally since I’d been back, mainly because it was the only whitening one that had been there, back to university when he left today. What was i su 3. I was going to put the lid back on if he’d waited for me to go upstairs. In any case a lid being off is not a big deal surely. Especially for so short a time.    His argument is this essentially. I shouldn’t have used his tooth paste and I definitely should have put the lid back on. His takes care of his things and wants a toothpaste to himself.	1642900046.0	sahad7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahad7/aita_for_using_my_dads_toothpaste_and_leaving_the/	AITA for using my dads toothpaste and leaving the lid off
ix8zoy4j	Okay so I (18F) got out of a relationship about 2 months ago with my ex (19M). We met during the summer while I was staying with a friend in the city which is a few hours away from my house. We were able to hang out quite a bit until I had to go home for school, and that's when things really took a turn. He was very demanding about me coming to see him and it became so stressful for me as I was driving across the state every weekend to go see him. This took a took a toll on my academic performance and friendships. If I chose not to go for a weekend to spend time with friends or family, he would get very upset. Because of this I became very emotionally distant with him which I can admit was my fault. It just became toxic on both ends so I decided to break it off. He immediately switched up and demanded I gave him his clothes back that he GAVE me (they didn't fit him.)  Mind you this is like 3 sweatshirts, a jersey, and sweatpants. He does not have a shortage of clothes. At first, I agreed, but I said I wanted my sweatshirt back that I left there (it was one of my favorite sweatshirts I had recently bought), along with my blanket I had left there. The blanket was given to me by my grandparents and had my last name printed on it. When I asked, he jokingly told me that he was so mad about the breakup that he threw the blanket away and then proceeded to "play tug a war" with his dog using my sweatshirt, resulting in it becoming ripped in half. I was livid, sent him a message saying he was an immature man-baby and I'm not giving him his clothes that he will never wear  back, then blocked his number. He then contacted my friend again asking for the clothes.  I'm trying really hard to be the bigger person, but I feel like I'm well within my right to keep the clothes. My friend said that I would be just as immature as him for not giving back his clothes though.

3bxjt84	Okay so me and my boyfriend have been living together for about 5 months, both of us are mentally ill and unable to work. I’m in university so I get student finance as well as benefits for my disability, he until recently was on a lower rate of benefits for people who are out of work. So I’ve been the one supporting us for the most part, I’ve spent almost all money I get on groceries, electric, internet etc etc and he contributed too until recently his benefits got cut to only 40p a month. So for the past few weeks I’ve solely been supporting us. I said to him that I don’t want to order fast food anymore because I really want to get my finances in order - ever since we’ve lived together I’ve been severely struggling with money, I’m constantly going over my overdraft and have had to take out loans and apply for bursaries from uni. So I told him that I’m going to order groceries and that I’ll no longer be buying McDonald’s or whatever, he basically only bought food for one or two days and then yesterday asked me to order fast food for him because there’s nothing for him to eat, which I end up doing. He also has adhd and so always forgetfully leaves all the lights on when we go to bed, which is frustrating because I have to pay for the electric. He also barely cleans the house, and leaves dishes everywhere that grow mold and he just never cleans them despite me constantly reminding him. He won’t clean without me getting so frustrated that I end up having a mental breakdown (I have autism and an unclean living environment is very overwhelming to me) and even then he’ll start doing the dishes or whatever then leave it half done indefinitely until I have another breakdown. I applied for disability benefits for him (because he was too overwhelmed to do it himself despite my frequent encouragement bc we need money) and he’s due to get back paid about £800. He owes me about £200 for things he said he’s pay me back for, and I’ve spent months in constant financial stress trying to support us, and he mentioned that when he receives this money he was thinking about buying himself a VR headset or whatever, which costs about £200. This was like a slap in the face for me considering I’ve supported us financially for months and couldn’t ever treat myself to something so unnecessary instead of using the money for the shared household. I told him I think it’s selfish that he could even consider this, and he’s upset.

gjucc9d6	I’m a single parent. My kids are several years apart. My youngest and I went to the store and 2 blocks from home I allowed her to drive home. This was her first time behind the wheel. She was so excited and truth be told I was as well. I said something about it to my oldest later and she yelled at me saying “why would you do that?! I wanted to be there” This upset me because she’s always saying she doesn’t like her little sister and doesn’t show much interest in her or what she does unless it’s something she’s screwed up at. The oldest is in her 20s. I got really angry because she made me feel like I did something wrong, did I? If it were my child’s other parent then I could understand but for a sibling to react this way? I’m so confused on how to feel. Do I apologize to the oldest for not going and getting her first?	1642903481.0	saiew9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saiew9/aita_for_letting_my_15_year_old_drive_for_the/	AITA for letting my 15 year old drive for the first time
bcaotn5p	I have a friend who we'll call B, I met B in 2012 back in highschool, B had his group of friends and I had mine. Anyways, B stopped spending time with his group of friends and slowly asked me to invite him to play League of Legends with my friends, long story short, he got himself in my group of friends but he'd only be there if I was there, he would not go to dinner or to reunions unless I was there...  Now, I joined a new group of friends back in 2018, and B wanted to join in, B is very hostile in his roasts so I didn't include him, I didn't tell him "NO", I just avoided getting them to meet. That group of friends broke and 1/3 of remained in contact, B of course came back and joined this new group also... He still calls me bad friend for avoiding letting him join the other group, he also calls me a bad friend when I'm hanging out by myself and he asks me to join Discord and I say that I'm watching a show, he'd go "we can watch it together!" and if we did, he would just complain about how 'bad the show was', so I started to tell him no and he called me a bad friend.  Today I was gaming with my high school group, he just sent me "thanks for inviting me..." I shrug it off and played, then after the gaming session I joined my other group of friends and B was there and he goes like "oh look who is here, the bad friend" and I blew up, I told him that he should let me play with my friends and he said "they are my friends too!" and I told him "I get that but you want me to invite you everywhere I go or to do whatever I'm doing, you call me bad friend because of any reason! It's not my job bringing you to wherever I am!". Another friend was there, let's call him C, C also gets the "you're a bad friend!" comments often, and he noticed I was pissed and jumped in to lessen the tension and says "dude, eh says that to me too, chill..." and B just goes "Okay..." but in a mad tone, not in a sad one, then proceeded to leave the call... AITA for blowing up and telling him that?

ix9c6fe6	I've been long distance friends with this person for about 5 years, and we've only become really close recently (about a year of talking now). For the longest time, we had this weird on and off flirting thing with each other but, I told them many times, that I am not ready for relationship and I did not want one with them. They understood.  Then they started giving me the silent treatment a lot. In person and online. Online, if I was playing video games with different friends other than them, absolute silence. If I was hanging out with my friends in real life, nothing.  In person when they visited me, if they saw I got a text from a friend, they would get standoffish and quiet, if I talked about something cool my friend was doing, silence. This got old pretty fast so I started giving up.  I didn't initiate conversations as much anymore, and I didn't play into their games of trying to drag out of them what was wrong. We had a few fights because of this, and I told them exactly what was on my mind, and that I didn't want to be treated like this for no reason. We made up, we fought, we made up, rinse and repeat.  The last time they visited me in my city was disastrous. Silent treatment during car rides, silent treatment whenever I would get a text notification, etc. I lost it. I had no idea what was wrong and they absolutely refused to tell me, and after HOURS of tears and BEGGING them, to please me what was wrong, they said they were in love with me.  Blamed everything on me. Said things like "how could I not see that they were in love with me" and "what were they supposed to do if I found someone else", even though this was the same person who treated me like garbage.  We talked everything out for HOURS. We agreed to not do the weird flirting anymore, and we promised to talk more openly about everything.  That didn't happen. Things were weird, they kept acting the same way and I wasn't going to be treated like this. I tried asking them what's wrong, I tried asking them how I could help, I tried doing everything I could to keep this friendship normal and keep things going, but it wasn't working out.  It still isn't! To this day, I am still being left on read for days, getting one word answers, everything that we said we would do is out the window and I'm done. And there's a concert we were planning on going to in February.  It's a band we both love dearly and it's the first time I've ever gotten VIP tickets to ANYTHING, and it should be incredible. Minus the fact that I have to go with this person. AITA for not wanting to go with them? I can't stand the fact that I'm going to have to spend a weekend in their house and quite possibly ruin the experience of this concert I have been looking forward to FOREVER.  Please do not post this on any other sites. If you have questions, please ask them. I need to know if I am a jerk for not wanting to go with them. I have tried so many times with them but I am reaching my breaking point.	1642906066.0	saj8gt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saj8gt/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_a_concert_with_vip/	AITA for not wanting to go to a concert with VIP tickets with my friend?
iw2cmvrq	My friend (30F), we will call her Amy, asked me (30F) to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I had my first baby 6 months before her wedding date. Her MOH planned a bachelorette weekend at an Air BnB with a limo, private activities, etc. It was COVID cautious, but Amy felt the plan was lame. When ahe came to visit new baby she talked about this & other wedding complaints nonstop. During the same visit, I was formula feeding baby and she asked me several times if this would negatively impact our bond. I emphatically said no, hoping she’d get the hint this was an insensitive question. A few weeks later, custom shirts are being ordered for the bridal party. Amy was paying for the shirts as a gift, but her sister was ordering them. The sister contacted the bridesmaids bc the shirts were more expensive than planned and suggested we split the extra cost. This sparked a nasty argument between the MOH and Amy’s sisters. I contacted the sister privately to pay the extra cost myself, and suggested we not involve Amy to spare her from silly drama. The sister told Amy anyway and Amy called to thank me. During this call she starting talking about her disappointment in the bachelorette again. For 2 hours she complained about every other bridesmaid. Then she mentioned one of the bridesmaids believes that women who don’t breast feed are “terrible mothers” and she feared she would bring it up at the bachelorette. I was hurt and confused that breast feeding kept coming up with her. Later, when the shirts arrived in the mail the sister brought them to the MOH. Amy felt since she bought the shirts they should have been brought to her. She sent me an angry text message about this, saying she was just going to cancel the bachelorette because no one was being considerate of her. I told Amy I thought she was being unnecessarily hard on her friends and was starting to be ungrateful. She exploded on me, and told me that I was also a terrible friend since I had  “gone behind her back” by paying the extra fee for the shirts. She said I was not prioritizing our friendship, and was upset that she texts first more often and calls more often lately. I got angry at her, and said I was adjusting to life with a newborn and doing my best.  I told her that I didnt see a reason to travel 6 hours away from my family for a bachelorette weekend she didn’t want. She told me I crossed a line, and I told her I was done and hung up. That week she mailed me an envelope with $200 to reimburse me for bachelorette expenses that I prepaid (I never asked for this). I told her this was petty. The day after getting this in the mail, my dad whom I was very close to, died unexpectedly. When she heard the news, she only sent a text that said “my condolences”. After this, I had no further contact and I did not attend the bridal shower or wedding.

ixc6qh3q	My friend bet me $50 that if I stood in front of the entrance to the staff parking lot at my high school and aggressively waved and said hello to everyone that entered, that at least one teacher would recognize me, even with a huge mask and glasses on (I didn't wear glasses in HS).   I don't agree because I look really different with glasses on and a mask hides most of my facial features. Moreover, I think it would end up bothering my former teachers and that I'd probably get reported to the police for causing a disturbance.

9t3audkh	I 30f left the room to go to the bathroom while my boyfriend 35m picked out a movie.   Me: What movie is this?   Him: *Silence*  Me: *says his name a little louder than I was speaking to see if he heard me*   Him: IRON MAN!   Me: Okay damn, use your words.   Him: Is some one condescending to you all day at work or something? You didn't always used to be like this.   Me: It's condescending to ask what we're  watching?   Him: That's not what happened and y I u know it. Just because I didn't instantly reply to you when you barked an order at me. You mumble and I didn't hear you.   Me: I didn't have to repeat the question so yes I know you heard me. If I mumbled how did I bark an order?  Him: Whatever I'm not participating in this conversation anymore.   And then we stopped talking. We were having a decent evening before this. We've been together 7 years for context of how much we can probably annoy each other with small habits. But this particular argument is more of a common occurance for us recently. I also slept on the couch the other night because a similar situation happened with me asking about a house fire in town right before bed and I just wanted space at that point. I don't feel like the asshole but idk my word choice could be condescending I guess.

gsf1afpu	For context, I (21F) have two children (4M) (5monthF). I was forced into having my son by my abusive bd who was 6+ yrs older than me. Then I was guilted into keeping my daughter. That being said, I love both my kids w all my heart but that’s not why we’re here.  Let me go back, when I found out the person I was seeing said to abort & blocked me. I planned for an adoption. I met with a mother, who’s a doctor with much better means of supporting a baby. Whereas I was barely making it & wanted to enjoy my life with my son since I didn’t get to as a teen. My bestfriend of 10yrs has fertility issues & begged me to let her adopt. I ended up letting the mother know & we parted ways. I always told bf I’d be her surrogate if she couldn’t conceive so I didn’t see an issue. So, her husband said no. Didn’t want the responsibility. I went to go back to my original plan & she again begged to keep her that she would take the responsibility & keep her whenever & that this was her baby just not legally. After going back & forth @ 8mo I decided to work this out with my bf so she can (informally) have her baby.  The past 5 months things have been fine, she keeps her while I work 12hr & every Tue/Thurs. Sometimes we switch off & I’ll keep her Thur if she watches her Fri/Sat night so I can go out. I usually end up falling asleep & never go, waking up every couple hours every night just to wake up at 5 & work a long day is exhausting. I asked her if she would keep her so I can go out. I just turned 21 & have yet to go out. She said no she had xyz to do, so I let it be. We were on FT & she mentions she’ll let me know when I can bring them today that she didn’t have as much to do. Around 12 I FT her telling her I was finishing up & would bring them over. She says “I can’t I have shirts to make” so I joke I was going to have my gma watch em  knowin I wasn’t bc they’re too old for a baby. She then went in saying i always pawn her off when I get her & how I need to spend time w her instead of just nights... I just wanted to be able to go enjoy myself instead of work, baby, cry, sleep, repeat. I tell her I’m not going to listen to her telling me how shitty I am for asking her to keep “our” daughter. She hangs up & I text her that I’ll look into daycare bc she mentioned not being able to do anything like make shirts to sell while watching her. She sends a long text about how I take it out on her & she can never get anything done & she’s tired too. So I say back about how this was her idea. I didn’t even want her. How she guilted me into this & what would she have done had she been able to adopt her. That I should be able to give my son the undivided attention I wanted to. That I should be able to go out when I want (gma loves my son on the wkends) but instead I’m taking care of a newborn she wanted not me. Now telling me I’m an AH & I kind of feel bad because I do love my daughter & I love my best friend but this is not what I wanted or what we agreed to.

a90vfit4	Okay, this is a story from a few years ago, but there’s still some drama circling around it and I don’t really know who’s responsible for it. When I was 15, I dated one of my best friends for about a week. I quickly realized though, as I was in 9th grade and he was in 8th (less than a year apart in age), that we would never see each other because a.) our parents didn’t know, b.) neither of us could drive, and c.) we didn’t go to the same school. So, I ended the relationship and said once he got to high school and we could see each other, then maybe we’d get back together.  He blocked me for a month, but after that we resumed being friends.  That summer, we saw each other at camp. We were both single, so I immediately started flirting with him since we were going to be in school together soon anyway. We got back together, but after the summer camp was over and I didn’t see him for a few weeks, I realized that instead of missing him I was actually busy missing another guy. I was going to stay with him until the school year started back up and I saw him more often to see how I felt about the whole situation in person, but my best friend advised me against it so I broke up with him then.  After that, he blocked me for a year and he still hasn’t said a word to me to my face. I know this sounds like a stupid middle school drama, but I am almost 18 now and there’s this intense hostility coming from his end. I tried everything: apologies, attempting to talk to him irl, and just leaving him be for months on end so he could work things out on his own.  Eventually, I gave up. It’s been so long that I don’t really care anymore and it’s clear that we are not ever going to interact again. It took my ages to get over the loss of one of my best friends, and it took him a while too, because even two years later he texted me out of the blue saying just the word “Ha.” and when I asked for context he just told me to shut tf up. I don’t know what his intentions even were with that text.  Well, the reason I’m thinking about this now is because a little over a week ago, I got broken up with by a guy who had initiated our relationship because he, like me in my previous relationship, was having some doubts. Even though we only dated for a few weeks, I was really devastated. I cried for four hours that day, and my friends thought he was a complete asshole for that. Now that I realize I put my ex through the exact same thing two and a half years ago, I feel really guilty.

h16kyo8f	One weekend a month (Friday afternoon/evening to Sunday afternoon/evening) I (30f) like to have my sister (33f) over to catch up and have her spend some time with my kids.. My sister has a dog (Itsy) that I allow her to bring over too. Sometimes my sister brings her, sometimes she doesn't. My issue is when she does bring Itsy over its like she never watches anything else but this dog. Like whenever Itsy is out of sight my sister will call for her to come even if she's just sniffing around in my kids rooms. When she takes Itsy out in the backyard she keeps her on leasd a lot or if she does let her off will stand guard like she's working security or something but my yard is fenced around and I really don't think itsy would try to escape it. When my kids interact with Itsy my sis is even more intense with the watching.   I got annoyed last time she was over and told her to stop being so controlling and give Itsy a break. She told me the only reason she does is for the dogs safety but I know for a fact she doesn't act like this at her own place. I got the feeling she was implying my home was incapable of being good enough for her dog and called her an AH for bot letting Itsy be a dog and that she's fine.

ixe1dv8n	Recently I (15) f got an official Snapchat. In the past I had one for some friends but I didn’t use my real name, just a basic username. I added an old friend of mine (15) f and she said hi. I added her on my old account too but she said she didn’t want to talk on there. We both have discord and we have kept in touch on there every 2-5 months. It usually starts with her saying hi and then asking me for help with homework. In middle school I was always the academic one and she was very sporty so I often helped her with work. She acted very surprised when I got snap. I reminded her about my old account though and we caught up. I asked if she wanted to hang out and she agreed. I was very happy because I’ve been pretty lonely lately, there has been some conflicts between my 2 friends and I don’t have any classes with them. They also have other friends that they hang out with more (they share classes and can hangout late on school nights). This morning she called and said she had a chiropractor appointment and I said no problem! She asked to postpone an hour and I agreed. Then right before I was heading out the second time she texted to admit she lied and wasn’t in the mood. I was upset because she lied and whenever we’ve planned things in the past she’s done similar things. I tend to be really chill with cancellations but the lying didn’t sit right with me and I said I didn’t want to push it back another week and I wouldn’t be hanging out with or talking to her soon. She says the reason she lied is because she’s bad at saying no but idk?

96pm21q4	I’m married with two kids, 11 and 14. I’m a SAHM and do probably 95% of parenting and running the household, including most of the cooking, and all of the shopping. I’m a hardcore sugar addict. I have dealt with disordered eating since I was a teenager, and although I have improved a ton and am a healthy weight, I eat a disgusting amount of sugar daily, to the point that I frequently feel sick. It’s gotten worse over the last couple of years, what with panini-related stress. Both my kids are healthy weights, very active, and happy, but they also eat a LOT of candy. My husband is overweight and talks a good game about wanting to eat better and get back into an exercise routine, but doesn’t follow through. And he ends every day (as do I) with a literal pile of chocolate. We have a cookie jar that is always filled with candy, and I have to restock it probably twice a week. So, I’ve recently been making a conscious choice to skip the candy aisle and let the cookie jar run on empty, and to only buy deserts in small quantities so it’s a once-per-day treat. It’s SO hard for me to do that, it feels like torture. And it’s even harder when everyone else in the house complains about it, keeps adding sugary stuff to the shopping list. My husband has started getting upset about it. Or he’ll see that I’m really struggling with not having candy in the house (like, straight up pacing like a caged animal), and he’ll make passive aggressive comments, like, “well, SOMEONE didn’t remember to buy everything on the list today.” Maybe it’s unfair for me to decide that everyone else has to change the way they eat just because I’m trying to deal with my problem?

He feeds himself and doesn’t clean up after himself, so I have to get him to clean up his messes.

Everyone thought that C would have a chance with A because they showed intimate affection to one another. One day, I was talking to C and she was so upset because she kept getting mixed signals from A, so her and I set up a plan to see if A likes her, turns out she didn’t. I didn’t want to tell C yet because I didn’t want her to be more hurt so I covered it up and said that A “avoided the topic”. However, I did tell I about what happened and told her specifically not to tell C.  Now C is finally over A so I thought it was the right time to bring it up to her, she surprised me by saying that she already knew because of I since she told her. I was so hurt by I since i clearly told her not to tell her. So i texted I and confronted her about it, I gets so mad at me and says “I literally don’t care if you’re not going to tell me anything again” and she continues on denying that she said it meanwhile she was the only person who knew. this morning l texted me saying how she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore because “we are too old for the problems I am making and that I cause problems” I have been really hurt by her and she is making me think I’m such a terrible person.

56oxq6u2	Background: I am autistic and have severe social anxiety. To have a face-to-face conversation just to talk makes me feel uncomfortable. I won't enjoy it. I will, in fact, feel like I have the flu after with aches and a headache and the shakes.  I made a great friend online, we live 2k miles apart, and she keeps begging me to do a video call with her. She explained it had to do with her therapist and needing to connect more with loved ones and I could really help her.  When I told her I can't and explained why, she got mad and said, "You do live videos for work but won't chat with me?"  I tried to explain how it's different, but she got sad and said it felt like I was rejecting her. (For work I have a script I can work off of, so it makes it easier. It's a persona I can put on.)  She said her therapist also told her to demand what she wants more in life. Well, I can't have her mental health journey break my boundaries, or MY mental health will falter. I've come too far for that.  So now she's upset, despite saying she understands and let's forget it. I can tell she's sad. I didn't mean to upset her. She's always been a wonderful friend until we disagreed on this point of communication. (And I hope she's not on reading this, IDK if she's on Reddit, but if she is, I hope she understands how awful I feel as a friend who wants to chat like that but just can't.)  And now she's turning it into, "Well, I am a client, too, and need to talk to you and \[business partner\]." Um, that's now what you said earlier! You said just me as friends because of your therapist. I'm confused right now, and really upset.  BTW, she did not call me an AH. I just am wondering if I am one.

ip14603n	 So for some information, my 26M sister 28F used to pick on me a lot, she called me ugly pretty much every day and I still struggle with body image issues to this day because of her, and I had to go into a mental health institution for BDD. In addition, I have autism, and she would purposefully try to trigger me into having meltdowns, my childhood was very stressful because of her, luckily my mum spent extra time training me in social skills and life skills and I was able to leave home at 18 and go to university and get a job. I live a pretty great life now, but I still deal with everything she put me through to this day, I still believe that I'm too ugly to even date a girl or believe that a girl would want to be with me.  Anyways I went to my email, and I saw an invitation to my sister's wedding, she's getting married to her girlfriend I deleted the email without thinking twice and went about the rest of my day, she did try to contact me a few times leading up but I blocked her so she would leave me alone. I was on a Zoom call with my mum, I'm currently working as a nurse, and living in Saudi Arabia, so that's one of the only ways we keep in touch, my brother and grandma were on the zoom call as well. We were talking about stuff and then the topic of my sister's wedding came up, my mother said that I haven't responded to the invitation yet, I informed her that I have no intention of going since she's a horrible person. My mother says that she knows she was horrible to me but she's nearly 30 and has changed a lot and I haven't properly interacted with her since I was 18.  I said that I do not want to see her period and that she's good at putting on a fake persona of being nice but deep down she's a piece of shit, my mother got angry at me and said I was being an immature asshole and I should grow up. I said that I deleted the email so I can't respond anyway, my mum got angry and left, anyway I was wondering am I wrong here?	1642917692.0	sampjf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sampjf/aita_for_not_attending_my_sisters_wedding/	AITA for not attending my sister's wedding?
13coik	A troublesome friend says extremely racist things, among other terrible things to make me uncomfortable/upset and hurt others, I threatened to tell his boss to make him uncomfortable/upset.    Now the rest of my friends are saying I'm fucked up and trying to "black mail" him. I never had any intention, or means of doing it. Before making the comment I made this clear to one of the friends involved.     In the past this friend when angered (or just casually) has said some disgusting things, to the point that the one minority friend so upset they cried, and (understandably) cut ties with us. The troublesome friend, claims no responsibility and says his words are not real and his racism "ironic".    A topic that's pretty close to me recently has brought up multiple times in conversation. I'm pretty outspoken in my support for more regulations on driving and curtailing private car ownership, more so now because I lost a colleague/friend who was hit by a car while biking in a bike lane. I am derided for these opinions, not necessarily because they disagree, but because they know it upsets me, and it's entertaining to push my buttons. For three nights in a row now the topic has been brought up, and I have gotten more and more upset. I am not blameless I do use personal insults against them, but they call me poor, landless, small dick...etc (we are very high-brow). I left right away on the third night, they continued to harass and send me messages for leaving, and I responded with screencap of one of things he has said. They explode at me for bringing it up, imply I am worse than the troublesome friend. I'm pretty indignant and say "holding people accountable is good", hoping to rile them up more. Which works, they claim I want to "ruin their lives".    Before it is asked "why do I have these people as friends", these arguments only happen maybe once a year, and usually only last a week. We have been friends for a very long time and our views have changed. I also believe I am probably closet friend to the troublesome one, and if I were to stop being involved, he would regress to be even more racist. I do not want that to happen.	1642917979.0	samsht	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/samsht/aita_for_jokingly_threaten_to_reveal_my_friends/	AITA for [jokingly threaten to reveal my friends racist behavior to his boss]?
98rb2srz	So it's nearly going to be my birthday and I have planned this with another friend of ours. My best friend wasn't apart of the chat, but I do want to to invite him since he is my best friend. The problem is he doesn't respond.  I ask him a question about my party and whether he is coming, but I am only left on seen. I know he has work on the farm his family has, so I try to ask him at around 4-6 to try and catch him while he isn't working. I've been asking him to make some time for me to tell him plans or whether he can come, but I am only left on seen. My party is three days from now, and I want them to stay the night before. I want him to know what the plan is so he doesn't come to my house if we're out and nobody is home.  Today I asked him to respond or at least say he can't at the moment or reply later, but he only saw it. I decided to be more stern and tell him that I want an answer and saying that I'm starting to take it as he is not going to come.  I do want him to come, but I don't want to sit around waiting for a response if he doesn't respond. I don't want to seem like an asshole about this, but I'm starting to get a bit mad that he is simply only seeing my texts and not responding with even a simple 'sorry, I have to talk later' sort of things. It hurts my feelings and I'm not sure what to do at this point.	1642918504.0	samxmm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/samxmm/aita_for_threatening_to_uninvite_a_friend_to_my/	AITA for threatening to uninvite a friend to my party for not responding to my texts
13wvsf	My S/O and I recently took some space apart to work on ourselves and figure out some stuff we've been arguing about.   Today was the first day we've met up in person to talk to each other about everything. The talk itself was fine.   After that, we were talking about some of our future plans for vacations etc. He then tells me he is going on vacation with some of his family in the summer. I ask the dates and he tells me he's gone for almost a week and I find out it's during my birthday. I immediately got upset and told him how I felt about that. I told him that it makes me feel like I'm not a priority, that he should've had a discussion with me about it beforehand and that I feel really resentful.   AITA?

55zvna9b	While messaging with a friend, they insist that I never use "ok" and always use "okay" because otherwise they'll think I'm mad at them or being rude or passive aggressive.   Note: I am NOT using just "k", I know that's rude; I'm using a very normal "ok".   I've explained multiple times that imo "ok" and "okay" either mean exactly the same thing, or "okay" is a more formal way and for more serious situations. I'd be more likely to use "okay" if I'm apologizing or if the mood is more sombre.  But every time I use "ok" they get really upset about it and tell me I'm not considering their feelings. Even though they *know* I don't mean anything by it.   (btw I mean "ok/okay" as in phrases like "ok sure", "ok gn", "yeah ok" etc..)	1642918519.0	samxs7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/samxs7/aita_for_using_ok_instead_of_okay/	AITA for using "ok" instead of "okay"
8u7182zr	For context, my boyfriend (24) and I (22F) are long distance. I only get to speak to him on the weekends because we have opposite work schedules. He spends most of his weekends snowboarding, watching football with his friends or just going out. I call him maybe for a total of 30 min on the weekend between his “plans”   Now this might sound petty, but we both planned to watch a movie together last weekend for today. I reminded him several times yesterday and he acknowledged it. Today, I reminded him because he has a tendency to forget about plans he made with me and to flake on them if his friends invite him to do something. His response to my reminder was “I’m watching football tonight.” Obviously, this pissed me off and out of anger told him that he wasn’t and that he was not going to flake on me. He said he would watch it with me at a specific time whether or not the football game was over. I agreed. He came down at said time while the football game was still running. I appreciated this, but he kept looking at his phone the entire time checking the football score. I asked him to put his phone away while we were watching the movie bc I kind of felt it was disrespectful to me because I wanted to watch the movie with him and enjoy each other company. After I asked him, he would just hide his phone and try to watch the phone screen so I wouldn’t see him doing it. I kind of felt like he wasn’t really into watching this movie with me and it made me upset. Anyways I called him out on it. And he was going nuts saying that I’m crazy and that I was just looking for reasons to be mad. He then hung up on me for no reason and started ignoring me. This made me very angry and that’s when I told him to go suck his buddies d*cks. He is now not talking to me and I understand, but now I feel like such a a—hole.

ixgykzlg	This one guy I met at my friend's book club asked me what my favorite type of food was and I casually answered that it was Mexican and/or Italian food.   At the next meeting, he asked me if I wanted to go with him to check out this new Italian place in town.   I said sure, and it's on the calendar for next week.   However, I don't really want to talk to him anymore because he keeps doing these random things for me, like getting me groceries and random food that I mention, and it makes me feel weird and uncomfortable.  I have no idea what his intentions are and I want to ask my friend to ban him from the book club.

akw2katr	Sigh. I really didn’t want to go about posting this on the internet, but it’s been bugging me for the past 2 days and I really need opinions.   So, I want to give you all some background first. My bf and I were best friends before we began dating. In the time we were friends, we grew really close. After about 5 months of strengthening our friendship, his birthday was coming up, and I was so excited to make him feel special. I had planned out all his gifts a few weeks in advance, and I was so incredibly excited to give them to him and spend the day with him. I ended up getting him 2 Supreme sweaters that he really wanted. He had told me that he particularly likes that brand because his dad would buy him Supreme sweaters, but now  his father grew apart from him. Knowing this, I knew my gift would be meaningful to him, and, I wrote him a meaningful card as well. When his birthday came, he was so touched and couldn’t thank me enough for the gifts. He was ecstatic and I couldn’t be happier!  Anyways, a month after his birthday we became bf and gf, but after 6 months we decided to end things on a very good note because I will be moving. After we broke up, we decided to remain best friends, and he reassures me that he has a lot of love for me and that he cares an awful lot about me… Sadly, I can’t say I feel that he does care…  Here’s why I feel that way… He asked me what I would like for my birthday, and I insisted he really didn’t have to get me anything, because I am moving, and I’m trying to declutter as much as I can before I do. He insisted that he wanted to get me something meaningful so I told him fine. I asked for a glass globe we saw a couple days ago while shopping. It had leaves inside and it reminded me of Beauty and the Beast. The best part is that it was only $8!! I told him it would be a meaningful gift that I can remember him by, since we always watched Disney movies together, and this globe reminded me of just that. He said ok, that he’d get that, and something more meaningful along with it.   My birthday comes, I go to dinner with him and a few of my other friends, and then we all head out. Before I went home, he motions for me to come to his car and open the trunk. I opened the trunk and saw 2 duffle bags he’s had in there for a while, and an additional one I’ve never seen before. He told me to open it up and inside was a… used t shirt from a thrift store. I was too stunned to speak and thought he was joking until he told me that I can keep the duffle bag too. He closed the trunk, gave me a big smile, and said “I really hope you like it! I got them from the thrift store!”   I was shocked, but managed to force a smile and later texted him to thank him for the gifts. Here is where I feel like I might be the AH… I couldn’t control my feelings and ended up crying when I got home, because I felt like he really hated me and wanted to make me feel bad on my birthday. I’m not a materialistic person by any means, but I did tell him that if he wanted to get me anything, I wanted it to be meaningful, something I can remember him by… I feel so hurt but at the same time I feel like an AH for crying about it. I didn’t tell him about how I feel because I don’t want to hurt his feelings.   PS: I’m so so sorry this post is so long. I tried my best to keep it short.	1642920839.0	sank8k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sank8k/aita_for_crying_over_a_bad_gift/	AITA for crying over a bad gift?
2o3ivs1m	AITA for wanting to sleep on my cousin’s bed? Me (27F)  and my cousins (22, 20 all F) were really close, I loved them like sisters, but they’re not so affectionate with me as I am with them, I’m always inviting myself to their house (we don’t live in the same city, so when I visit I love being around them) always giving them presents, etc. With 1 particular girl I  have a very passive aggressive but friendly relationship and I joked around that she preferred our other younger cousin so I was feeling left out. Anyways, on new years eve we were all getting along, having a nice time, etc. Until around 5 am I got super sleepy and wanted to sleep. I just got up and said “I’m going to sleep in (cousins) bed”, she then started talking very condescendingly to me almost yelling that I was sweaty and disgusting and she didn’t want me to slee in her bed (It was going to be 1 hour tops until my parents wanted to leave) she was being adamant and quite aggressive that I was sweaty and disgusting and didn’t want me to sleep in her bed, nor her parents or her sisters, she basucally told me to sleep on the chairs. I was very hurt because I thought I was a welcomed guest at their house but I left feeling very angry over the stupid argument, I just wanted to sleep and she told me off in a very rude manner. I just thought we were closer than that? AITA?	1642920679.0	sanilc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanilc/aita_for_wanting_to_sleep_on_my_cousins_bed/	AITA for wanting to sleep on my cousin’s bed?
92h36aot	So there is this guy (Owen) who I’ve known for a couple of years and he’s always been an asshole to me and my friends, ( making rumours about me and telling my friends rumours about me, he has basically ruined my reputation to my school and he has done worse) and he’s gotten me reported for sending a meme in a group that me and my friends had. And I wanted to do it to him too, so I reported him a couple times for some messed up things he said. I couldn’t let his friend (Josh) know about it because josh would get all of his friends to spam report me to get my account terminated. About two days later me and my friends are in a ps party with josh (josh has me blocked because of some drama that happened) and one of my friends bring it up (Brayden) and I got mad a him for bringing it up in the party, he acted like nothing happened. Then my other friend (Cody) brings it up too and I told him not to say it while pretty upset. But then Brayden tells me that Josh wasn’t there and then josh unmutes his mic and my friends ask him if he heard what they said. They told me he said no, ( I was afraid josh was lying)and I ask them if they can just tell him that they were joking anyway. They said to stop saying that because I was being a dick ( I said it a few times because I was scared) and then they started talking about it while josh was there and I got mad at them for saying it while josh was there and they started yelling at me and saying they don’t care because they don’t want to get involved with my problems and I’m being a dick. ( and I’m worried they are right) i just dont want my account to get terminated and lose everything I have, I’ve spent well over 1500 dollars on my account. Am I the asshole?	1642921619.0	sanroe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanroe/aita_for_not_wanting_my_account_terminated/	AITA for not wanting my account terminated

I was too stunned to speak and thought he was joking until he told me that I can keep the duffle bag too. He closed the trunk, gave me a big smile, and said “I really hope you like it!

ixis88rn	I met this guy at a volunteering organization we're both part of. We've known each other for about 3 years.  At first we just casually talked to each other and I never thought anything of it. However, he started doing random things out of the blue.   Like, once, I was going to walk home in the rain with no umbrella as I didn't bring one and he walked me home in the rain with his umbrella even though I lived 20 minutes away from him (neither of us brought our cars).   Then, there was this other time when I said I was craving freshly baked cookies but didn't have the time to make them because of my job, stress, and hassle, and he asked for my address and delivered some to me.   Then, today, he asked me what my favorite type of movie was, and when I responded with my favorite genre, he asked if I wanted to go over to his house to binge watch some shows together.   I said yes without really thinking about it, and now I'm regretting it. I'm kind of into him, but I don't know if he feels the same way.   My job is taxing enough (I am an educator and there's SO MUCH HASSLE THIS YEAR and I constantly fear for my health, plus kids aren't learning) and I don't need additional hassle from him.  I want to lie to him and tell him I'm moving out of state so that I don't have to see him again, but I'd feel bad and I'd have to stop volunteering there, and I have so many friends there.	1642924147.0	saoebw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saoebw/wibta_for_lying_to_someone/	WIBTA for lying to someone?

However, he started doing random things out of the blue.  Like, once, my friend group and I ended up hanging out late (he was there too) and I was kind of scared to walk home by myself.

Then, there was this other time when I said I needed groceries but didn't have the time to get them because I was sick, and he asked for my address and delivered them to me.   Then, today, he asked me if I liked coffee and I said I did and he asked me if I wanted to go to Starbucks with him at some point. I said sure, and I went today, and he told me he liked me and wanted to date me.   I said sure, but now I'm regretting it as my job as a teacher is stressing me out too much. I am teaching in a hybrid model while fearing for my health because I'm still coming to school every day and my coworkers and students are getting sick left and right. People are just not motivated to learn, and that makes things worse.   I want to tell him I'm too stressed to be in a relationship and I did hint at it and he said that he'd help me and support me as much as he could, but I honestly doubt he wants to.	1642926438.0	saoztb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saoztb/wibta_if_i_told_someone_that_my_job_was_tiring_me/	WIBTA if I told someone that my job was tiring me out too much?

However, my fiancée and I broke up and then I realized over time that I had a crush on this woman.  I’ve taken her to the movies, to eat, and several one on one hangouts as friends, and during one of them, I asked her what she thought of dating.

ixkgs7nh	For my job I am required to attend a 3 day conference once a month. At first, I lived about 1 hour away so I would commute. I became friends with a co-worker (Sam) who was also commuting so we decided to get an airbnb in the together and messaged our work group chat asking if anyone wanted to join us. A woman (Jess), who Sam and I have seen before at the conferences but never talked to, took us up on the offer. The 3 of us have been staying together for the past 4-5 months. At first we all got along great! As time went on, Jess stopped talking to Sam and I as frequently. Sam and I however, have gotten very close and talk every day.   In Dec, my partner got a job offer in the city the conferences are in so we decided to move! We found an apartment and are moving in next week! Since Sam and I are close, I offered to let her stay on the pull-out couch in the living room. Jess only lives about 40 mins away so I assumed she would be open to commuting again. However, when I called to let Jess know we were moving, I was not thinking clearly and offered to let Jess sleep on the floor in the kitchen. I did not think she would say yes, but she did. We had the airbnb pre-booked for Feb and Mar but canceled it. At first, I was open to making this work but the more I thought about it the more uncomfortable I became. I msged Jess last week expressing my concerns about space and asked if she would be ok with commuting. She said she yes, but said that she was looking forward to staying with us and really hoped we could make it work. I told her I would msg her again on once moving in to give her a definite yes or no. Since then, she has msged me suggesting ways she would be able to fit. I reminder her that the space is small, however, we are hopeful something would work out.  This situation has been causing me a great deal of stress and is beginning to put a strain on my relationship. My partner has not met Jess or Sam, and while he is willing to accommodate them, he is definitely not excited about it. I want to message Jess and let her know that despite my partner and I not moving in yet, we know the space is too small for her to stay. However, especially since we had an airbnb booked for Feb and Mar, I feel like it is my responsibility to find Jess another place to stay. I have offered to rebook the airbnb, however, since Sam and I will not be staying we will not be splitting the price and Jess is not interested in paying full price. I want to help Jess and let her stay, but I know my partner, Sam, and I would all be uncomfortable. Since I have lead her on for so long feel like I have to let her stay despite it making everyone miserable.   WIBTA if I messaged her tomorrow morning saying "Upon further consideration, my partner and I have realized our space will be too small for the four of us to fit comfortably. While we would love to be able to accommodate you, ultimately my priority is ensuring my partner and I feel comfortable in our own home."?	1642931783.0	saqa91	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqa91/aita_for_not_wanting_my_coworkerfriend_to_stay_at/	AITA for not wanting my co-worker/friend to stay at my new home?
ixme1lik	 I have a child I never managed to connect with. She’s very emotional and anxious and I feel like she and I just don’t get each other. I’ve never felt much affection for her as a result and just go through the motions.  On the other hand, her stepmom seems to love her to pieces. Whenever I drop her off, her stepmom’s face lights up. She always comes out to get her and squeezes her and says she missed her.  At a holiday celebration, I even saw my kid and her stepmom watching movies together and snuggling with each other for hours straight. Every so often, her stepmom would kiss her and tell her that she loved her and my kid would giggle and say that she loved her too.  Anyway, when my kid stays at my house, she’ll text her stepmom all the time and FaceTime her plenty and my kid doesn’t even seem present with me. I asked her to stop texting and calling her stepmom and she said she missed her mom, which pissed me off.  Her stepmom has even asked if she can have her full-time for a month so I can get a break, which made me angrier.	1642932502.0	saqgre	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqgre/aita_for_asking_my_child_to_stop_texting_and_to/	AITA for asking my child to stop texting and to be more present with me?
ixk2imy0	So I(17 NB) am the oldest of my mom's kids(there are six of us total including me).For my entire life my mom has been struggling with substance abuse my entire life and for most of it I've always ignored it and defended my mom from anyone who spoke negative about her since I love my mom.From what I know she's relapsed 3 times and each time it messed me up,the second time it happened I caught her doing it but she acted like I didn't catch her(I was 14) and later that year I guess she passed out from heat stroke and my siblings and I had to move in with her mom so she could get help.Now the third time was after she had 88% recovered from the time I stated above,but this time I have no clue what happened to her,she just went down hill after hurting her back and I guess she kinda just gave up(I was 15/16) it broke my heart since i wanted to believe she finally was going to get it together and we could all be a happy family but I knew in a small place in my heart I knew this would happen again and it hurts thinking about it.Fast forwards to now,I haven't seen my mom since August 2022 and I had recently seen her on January 13th I believe after she brought my grandma some apples.When she hugged me she noticed that I was now taller then she was and I could tell it hurt her feelings,I told her I loved her and she shortly left then after a few days I get a call from her mom that my mom checked into detox and was getting help.

dcrwp2j3	I live with two roommates who both brought home two kittens several months ago. Since then, they’ve grown up and I loved them so much and saw the bond they had with my roommates that I decided to get myself a kitten. He’s three months old and very playful.   Recently we’ve noticed he’ll chew wires and cords when we’re not looking, usually when we’re at work or in the middle of the night. I’ll discipline him and redirect his attention if I catch him in the act. And I thought it got better! I have many cords in my room and he never messes with them (no bite marks on my cords and everything works).   Well today at work, my roommate texted me furious that my kitten had chewed through another charger of hers. She briefly brought up the fact that it isn’t good for him but that it’s mainly annoying as fuck for her to deal with and that I need to control him. I told her, like I have many times, that he doesn’t chew cords around me. I don’t know if he just knows I won’t tolerate it, but if I don’t see him in the act or even near wires eyeing them up, I can’t discipline him. I apologized and offered to replace the charger and told her that if she sees him chewing wires or even near them she can discipline him or kick him out of her room/redirect his attention (he is a kitten and any of his toys will steal his attention). I agreed it was an issue and also suggested hiding any loose wires so he can’t gain access to them while I train him or at least until he’s a bit older since it’s possible he may grow out of the habit entirely. She said I wasn’t taking responsibility or offering solutions at all and that she shouldn’t have to hide her cords and, finally, that I pissed her off with my response and to leave her alone.   I will admit I got a bit angry and told her again that I agreed with her! And that I had offered solutions but that she didn’t like them or is just rightfully so annoyed that she’s just looking for a fight which I won’t be partaking in. I told her once she’s calmed down, we can talk solutions since I understand he’s my responsibility.   After this texting conversation transpired, I asked my coworker what her advice would be since she has lots of cats and many years of experience. She said that it sounds like my roommate is actually angry with my kitten but obviously can’t be since he’s just a baby so she’s taking out her aggression on me since I’m his owner. She also said that aside from catproofing the home (which would entail hiding cords, using wire protectors, etc) there’s nothing I can do. He is a kitten. And sometimes, according to my coworker, cats can never be trained out of a bad habit. Some cats no matter how hard you try will claw your furniture or knock things over or get on your counter tops. Catproofing the home will keep our things safe but most importantly, the cats.   I just don’t think my roommate is comprehending that while her kitten is pretty much grown up and almost an adult, my kitten is still just a kitten. Plus, it’s not like her cat never had any issues— but I never blamed her for them. I just trained her cat to leave my things alone or I hid/put things out of reach until she got old enough and lost interest. And I also don’t think I was passing the blame off of myself. I offered solutions, and she didn’t like them. I apologized and offered to replace her charger, but she just got mad. Obviously I don’t want my kitten chewing wires. It’s unsafe for him and he could get hurt. But it’s not like I’m watching him do it and allowing it—again, he just doesn’t do it around me for some reason. And it’s not like I’m instructing him to ruin her chargers before I leave the house.   So, AITA here??	1642935124.0	sar435	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar435/aita_for_apologizing_for_my_kitten_ruining_my/	AITA for apologizing for my kitten ruining my roommate’s things??
ixnr1hkz	I once told my stepmom that my math teacher would be a better mom to me because we both liked statistics and because she was kind, loving, and nurturing to me whereas my stepmom yelled at me all the time.  After that, my stepmom changed. She tried to talk things out with me calmly, told me she loved me more often, hugged me at least 3 times a day, and made sure to talk to me about my day every day. She also takes me out for 1:1 time on weekends.   Today, I saw her taking a free stats course online though she said she hated math. I asked her why and she said that “Ms. X told me you like stats” and I was so embarrassed she told Ms. X i saw her like a mom. I told her to never talk to her about me ever again.	1642935480.0	sar78o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar78o/aita_for_getting_upset_someone_embarrassed_me/	AITA for getting upset someone embarrassed me?
ixomr9o9	So I've got a boyfriend of 4 months.  As a background, he talks quite regularly to his ex who now lives overseas (think, a 27 hour flight away), I'm talking multiple times a week on calls and I'm pretty sure she's called him late at night at times when we're together (he declines). He indulges these calls, citing that she hasn't got family and friends over there. Obviously I've no problem with this as they're important figures in each other's lives having been together for so long, and I know it doesn't just change that easily. I should mention that he's also been really good with me and he hasn't given me any other reason to be suspicious about anything at all. He's fairly open about some of the things they talk about and when they talk. I haven't asked or probed more about anything between the two of them (how, why, and when they broke up etc) because I figured he'd tell me if he wants to. However, he did mention in passing that he's thinking of going to the same country at some point (but not to be with her or anything) which with the rest of this story now leads me to believe I'm just something to fill out his time until they're together again.  Anyway, they've got a dog together who lives overseas with the girl. Girlie now wants to defer her student visa over there but to do that, she'd need to be in her home country (here) and apply for the deferment visa here and go back in there once it's approved. Now the problem is who's going to look after this dog for the month or so (probably longer given how visas in COVID times work) that she's going to be here. The "most viable" solution they're looking at is my bf to fly over there during the entire 1+ month. A dog hotel is apparently too expensive and she doesn't feel comfy having a dog sitter in her flat because she has equipment she needs for work in it.  He says he doesn't want to but worst comes to worst he will. He agrees that it's overkill and that he'll try to talk to her about a dog sitter. Now I just wait to see if I'm not going to be able to see my boyfriend for a month+.  I feel a bit hurt still. I really don't have a problem with them being good friends but this - flying halfway across the world for her - feels too overkill to even consider. Too much of an imposition. It also feels unfair because he shouldn't be in her life in that way anymore, if that makes sense? It feels like the ex is using bf as a crutch because she doesn't have anyone over there.   Now I'm torn whether or not to say something or express this hurt to him, even though I acknowledge that ultimately it's his decision whether he flies or not. But I also am aware that my opinion probably doesn't matter in this scenario.

6jwm653z	I asked one of my best friends, who I thought was my friend, who I thought I knew, to be my best man.   I didn’t realize he was at the tail end of an entire personality change.   He started working out a lot - I mean A LOT, and then got an extreme trainer, then an extreme diet, and then started taking steroids. He said he couldn’t win a bodybuilder competition without them.   His entire live devolved into nothing but working out, putting everything else - even me - second to his workout goals. He started missing events to not miss workouts, and got angry at situations like I haven’t ever seen him get.   I expressed my concern for him. I told him I am seeing some significant changes in his personality and in my opinion I think he might be suffering from bigorexia. (It’s a real condition like anorexia but basically the opposite - google it if your not familiar). He told me his extreme body building is like my weed smoking. Others see it as wrong and bad for you, but you know better - right? Wrong. I disagreed with this opinion and at that moment he cut me off completely and stopped speaking to me.   AM I THE ASSHOLE FOR TELLING MY FRIEND I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE BIGOREXIA AND TAKING STEROIDS IS NOT AKIN TO SMOKING WEED???  IMO, smoking weed is not akin to taking steroids. No way, not even a little bit. I smoke weed to help me deal with my anxiety and depression. He has no reason to take steroids other than to win a bodybuilder competition and have a table of complete strangers say in their opinion he’s the best looking. How is that helping him?   Now I have lost my friend of 20years, the best man at my wedding, and I am genuinely worried for his well being.   Here I am telling my sad story, just to alleviate my burdened soul.   He won’t speak to me, I hope and pray he speaks to God and He softens his heart.	1642937476.0	sarq0h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sarq0h/aita_for_telling_my_friend_i_think_he_might_have/	AITA For Telling My Friend I Think He Might Have BIGOREXIA?
e5fv3mfe	We were sitting in my friends room and i said that i felt like tackling someone, she said "go on then" and stood up, i asked her if she was sure and wasnt joking and if she was ok with it. Everyone said it was going to hurt (there were 4 other people there) and she said it was fine. It was more of a bodyslam than a tackle, she fell over not sticking her hands in front of her to try and stop the fall or anything and slid a little hitting a door. I asked if she was ok, she made a scene. Her teeth were bleeding a little so i gave her a tissue and she made a scene saying that her nose was broken. It wasnt bleeding nor did it look swollen so everyone else said it wasnt and that it was going to hurt for a bit and that it was probably fine. Then she got mad at me for doing it and i was like well i did ask and i wouldnt have done it if you said no. Half an hour later One of my friends had to go and she looked like she was forcing herself to cry to try to make me feel bad- i did for hurting her but it went away when she used it as an opportunity to make a scene. I kept asking what was wrong and she kept saying that she has trust issues with me to which i said that she asked for it. My girlfriend came up by then and said that she got what she asked for to which she responded with "why are you defending her?" And burst out crying.

6dla7t0g	Yesterday, I(35M)worked a 12 hour shift(530a-6p). On Saturdays, my wife(31F) works 9a-1p. My parents watch my two kids at their house. On this day I decided to bring my laptop and work from their house(I work from home).My wife got home around 130 and relaxed until 530(when she came to pick us up). I asked “please make sure you turn on the porch light and close the curtains before you leave”.(for fear someone may try to break in)  I had a rather terrible day at work and I admit I was very grumpy. My wife showed up late(annoyed me). Then I tell her about my rough day. We pull up and of course, the porch light is off and the big window in kitchen and living room curtain is wide open with a perfect view of my empty brightly lit house. We pull in and verbatim I say “aw come on, I asked you to do one thing…unreal!”  She immediately goes into defense mode and makes no attempt to apologize and move on, but instead tries to say “i guess I didnt, WHO CARES?”…”its the principal, I dont ask for much, I dont want someone to be able to see inside our house that we aren’t home! Come on WIFE, get a clue!” I proceeded to go inside and close the blinds and turn on the porch light.  As I finish lugging in the baby stroller and seats I notice she opened all of the curtains and turned off the porch light. I say “why would you do that?” Her snarky response “To be petty”. I lose my temper, yell at her and ask “why would you F with me after you know I’ve had a terrible day??” She doesn’t like this and storms into the bedroom.   Last night I texted her before falling asleep “Hope your prepared to wake up with (daughter 1)at 6am”…My wife sleeps in until 8am everyday.   This morning, I heard my daughter yelling in her room and went into my bedroom and woke my wife up. “Get up! Time to see who can out petty who”  For context, shes the type to never apologize and hold grudges forever. Ive let her take the W on hundreds of things over the years. I never win, but I don’t like deliberately be f*cked with.  I went to work in my office and closed+locked door.   I know this is really long, If anyone takes the time to read it, I want to thank you in advance.  AITA for being petty in response to pettiness? Should I just give in?

hcgj2m86	For context, I(F26) , have an older brother (M29). We'll call him"John". John is an amazing brother, the absolute best. We are extremely close. John is extremely hard-working (has worked 2 jobs for 4 years) and so he doesn't mingle much, although women do try and get his attention. Unfortunately, John has been financially supporting our mother (53) for years, as she has made some bad decisions since we immigrated. Now, John sees his financial assistance as a deal breaker for any woman. IMO, it's a plus as it shows he cares about his family etc. He's a chef and works 7 days a week. He used to gym daily and now doesn't have the time so he's gained a bit of weight. Also, the last girl he was serious about, cheated and it broke him.  Onto the story. John has told me about "Jenny(F32)". He's casually seeing her and she is lovely. He says she would like to be serious but he is still working through his personal above issues. I'm worried that she won't wait any longer (it's been about 4 months) for him to put a label on it. I want to reach out to her (we've never met or spoken before) and send her a little message online asking her to be patient and that John would make a great partner in time. I would not reveal his personal issues to her, but just say that "he's going through some things". My father(M58) agrees that I should but my husband(M33) says that I shouldn't interfere. I also would hate to betray my brother's trust or have him angry at me for interfering.	1642938685.0	sas159	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sas159/wibta_if_i_messaged_the_girl_my_brothers_casually/	WIBTA if I messaged the girl my brother's "casually" seeing?

I said i didn't wanna message because I didn't wanna distract him from his game or from the friend he was with.

I said I wanted to play and said that I didn't need to message him because I didn't feel like it anymore.

fvxp7y6s	(english is my second language)   &#x200B;  Me and my (f) best friend(f) from middle school are in this groupchat with two other close friends (m) and we were just chatting and sending funny pictures of us and I came across this funny old picture of my bff that I took when we were at the gym. She was in this funny position and I captioned it ,,\[my bff\`'s name\] died" she saw it too (after I took it) and thought it was funny (that was back in 2021 spring)  now this wednesday when we were sending each other those random funny pictures of us and when I came across this picture I thought F it I'm gonna send this one too because they are close friends and I'm pretty sure we've seen her in weird positions a lot before, so it wouldn't matter, also this is a funny picture so why not? also I was hoping she would do the same to me, yknow just two friends bullying each other.  noone even noticed that picture except my bff, the other two were spamming with their pictures. she messaged me privately saying ,,I can't belive you've done that"  I read that like it was in that meme (we quote eachother memes a lot) so I assumed she was just fake angry and I continued with ,,I'm sorryyyyy, it was funnyy, come onnn xddd" and then she replied with ,, No Idc, Fk you! I hate you!" that's when it hit me she was being serious, so I went and deleted the picture asap. I tried to apologise but she has been giving me the silent treatment for 4 days now. I've been feeling pretty guilty soon after the incident. I talked with one of the guys from the gc and he said that he did't even notice that picture and she is being petty for acting like this. I always try to take it seriously when my bff is mad at me, even if it was something random, because you never know how it can affect someone, also sometimes I get mad at random stuff too, so I cant judge.. but part of me feels like it was a trivial thing to get this kind of reaction.. and it kinda upsets me...  I get it if we (me and bff) weren't that close with the other two, That's understandable. but she spends way more time with them than I do..  i've been having a pretty hard time lately (mentally) and this just makes things way more worse. I also kinda feel like she's tired of me and this is her way of getting rid of me, but maybe I'm just overthinking, maybe I'm subconsciously making myself the victim here, I don't know what to think anymore.

iwj7ohmt	title sounds bad, but hear me out.  also, sorry for the bad formatting, im on mobile.   i believed that we were best friends in name. i considered her to be one, but we just never did any of that bestie stuff and we just werent right for each other. Lets call the bestie Kiera. before the incident in the title, there were numerous instances of other smaller acts she did that pissed me off that led what i did in the end. let me name some more important ones.   firstly, i just didnt think we were right for each other. kiera and i had different ideals and different approaches to a lot of things. i met her in year 7, and this happened in year 11. we would argue all the time. she would get pissed at me for my opinions and then stop talking to me until she asked me to go to the cafeteria with her and buy her food. this happened literally everytime. she would turn silent, then ask me to go and eat with her to make conversation again. we were best friends in name only. i couldnt trust her as much as i wanted to, there was just a gut feeling that something was off about it.   she often blamed me. for literally everything, she manages to throw the blame on me. for example, there was one time in year 8 where we both had crushes on people (different people). we confided in each other about them, and we were gossiping (about the crushes) with this bunch of other girls that just happened to be in our camp cabin. we had no beef against them and they were not close to us either, and though i doubt they werent the ones that leaked my crush at the time, i will admit that its possible. so my crush got leaked. and so did hers. i did not tell anyone, but the first person kiera suspected about this was me. literally no hesitation, and not even asking. she just blamed me for it, like 'hey why did you tell people about them,, i told you not to?' i admit that after she got over the crush i joked around about it a lot, but she usually joked around with me. she would never tell me to stop joking about it, but she almost always used it as a grudge against me whenever she got pissed at me for god knows what reason.   i wont even mention the gift giving. sometimes her gifts were so bad and unthoughtful i would have genuinely rathered her to not give me anything at all.    and now for the big drama part. and just letting you guys know, i have no intention of being besties again with her, and i think my distancing from her is justified. you can feel free to let me know your thoughts, but i think i may be the asshole for HOW i distanced myself from her. im sorry that this is really long, but keep reading if you want to hear this.   let me set the scene. me and kiera and a bunch of other people hung out that day.   max: harrys friend. he knows about harrys crush on kiera.  harry: has a crush on kiera.  me: aquainted with harry because i found out he had a crush on kiera. it was super obvious.  kiera: knows harry has a crush on her. my ex bsf.   everyone in this party except harry, plus some other people, were hanging out one night. harry wanted to keep his crush on kiera a secret, despite it being already obvious, and max knew this perfectly well, but he, in the least subtle way possible, told kiera. he literally said this:  "hey, kiera, you do know that harry likes you right? dont tell him i said this lol" i may have been out of line for this, but since i was aquainted with harry and i believed in being truthful  i immediately told harry what max had done. yes it was not my business. maybe i shouldnt have butted in.   anyways. harry got super pissed at max, and cut off their friendship (i dont think they were on good terms anyway). kiera saw me tell harry, so she told max about me telling him. max got super pissed. kiera and max both attacked me in a groupchat, throwing insults everywhere saying "[i] ruined everything" "why did you snitch you mf" etc. look i understand max getting pissed at me, but why was kiera pissed like what,, its not like i broke up our friendship or anything?   anyways. i threw a few insults back at them, stayed mostly silent as they fired at me and then left the groupchat. the next morning i was talking to my friend sarah about this, and it led to me breaking down and crying. mind you, i havent cried in public since year 1. it was a huge hit to find out what my best friend of 4 years really thought about me, and i decided to not talk to kiera ever again unless she decided to apologise or at least admit that what she did wasnt the best case scenario. kiera was in a gc with me and a few other friends, and she tried getting me to talk again by saying something along the lines of "i decided that i will refriend [my name]" as if i did something wrong?   i slowly began to distance myself from her. lockdown made that super easy, and it wasnt like she tried to ever reach out to me anyways, but when lockdown ended, i wrote her and and a few close friends a christmas card.  and my parents told me this was super petty and now that i look back on it, it does seem like it,, but in kieras card, i wrote something along the lines of  "we did drift apart this year but i was really pissed at you at the time. though i hope we can get closer and still be good friends next year!" something like that.   in maths class, kiera asked me what i meant by pissed, and i told her what i thought about what happened. she rebutted saying "oh yeah, thats because you snitched" but maybe she genuinely didnt know what she did. i started distancing myself even more, but i keep thinking if its right to just leave without explaining anything,, what if she seriously doesnt understand? should i have explained to her clearly why i stopped talking? aita for the way i handled the situation?	1642942985.0	sat7ig	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sat7ig/aita_for_ignoring_and_distancing_myself_from_my/	AITA for ignoring and distancing myself from my bsf because she sided with someone else?
ixrkb5rt	 So, I (f28) have been seeing this guy "Frank" (m33) for 6+ months. I met his parents recently after they invited us to their house. Now here's a thing, Frank's parents are very conservative and are in association with one of the biggest churchrs in our town so they're big or "reputation". Before we went to their welcome dinner, Frank sat me down to ask me to lie to his parents about where and how we met.   I now am going to explain that I met Frank at the club. Not just that but we were bot drunk we didn't really get to know each other til we sobered up after he took home for the night. Frank said there was no way he was going to tell his parents this God awful storu because he's 100% sure his parents will disown him and he wasn't even kidding.  He came up with this story of how and where we met and it's about me coming to the church and attempting to have a conversation with him sevetal times. Being the gentlemen he is, he "paid me no attention" til 3 months later after I kept askibg for his help with becoming a more dedicated Christian. I laughed so hard and said this wouldn't work because I'm Athiest and never been to church. He said I had to do and I said no and we'll maybrme just say we met via mutual friends? But he said no   At dinner, the question of how we met came up and frank tried telling his own version of the story but I interrupted him and told his parents the truth. The room got silent and Frank gave me a "wtf" look. His parents kept side eyeing us both and stuff just got awkward.   Frank blew up at me in the car saying I did a pretty good job ensuring I drive a wedge between his parents and cause them to hate me and think of me as a s/ut and be disappinted in him and question his faith an dedicatio to his church as well as tainiting his parents reputation. Then said I shouldn't be surprised now to be pushed away and excluded from his family. I told him I don't lie and I don't hide or pretend to be someone else just to be approved of his parents. He said I could've listened to him and done what's best for our future but now I made it worse.   He refused to pick up the phone saying I created this mess because his parents are pretty upset and it is my responsibility to fixe this now.

8o53uws1	So , I work security for a company. We have a front door doorbell camera in one of our buildings that allows us to speak to visitors and unlock the door if necessary from the security office.   Over the last few weeks someone has been unplugging the unit in the office that allows us to control the camera, speak to visitors, and unlock the door. Every shift I plug it back in when I notice it's unplugged. At first I thought it was unplugged accidentally because the plug is near our feet under the desk in the office. However, you do need to use a bit of force to unplug it, and I doubt it would happen so often accidentally.   Today I came in and once again the unit is unplugged. I'm not sure who exactly is unplugging it because there are about eight guards that work in this office throughout the week. I texted my boss to ask him if the unit was supposed to be unplugged , because I have had to plug it back in at the start of my shift for a while now and I just wanted to double check. He said it should never be unplugged and I told him ive had to plug it in the last few weeks at the start of my shift. I also asked him to send an email to the guards asking them to please stop unplugging it. He never responded and I feel like I snitch for saying something.

faklgqpj	I’ll try to keep this as unbiased as possible. Last year, I was planning to buy a home as I was tired of renting and me and my bf were going to move in together when I did so. I found a home and ended up needing to purchase rather quickly due to the real estate market being insane. I ended up needing about 6k of the 15k that was for the down payment/closing costs. My bf was agreeable to helping and transferred the money to me and had to do a gift letter and all that. My name is the only one on the mortgage and the deed as I make a substantial amount more income and he has a new business that has only been in effect for a few months at that time. I did ask him if he felt comfortable with the arrangement or if he would like some sort of rental agreement so he could feel like his interests were protected. He said he felt fine about it. Monthly he paid $600 total in rent to me while I took care of the rest including all the utilities and what not, totaling around $1500 per month give or take a little.   Sooo, fast forward about 6 months or so and we have some struggles personally and decide to split up. Immediately he is asking me about the 6k from the down payment back. At that time financially not only do I not have it, I’m struggling to make ends meet with him moving out. I tell him it’s not possible any time soon.   My real question is, should I even feel obligated to pay that back to him? We never discussed it previously. The gift letter explicitly states that it is not a loan and not expected to be paid back. Idk. I hate the idea of owing anybody anything ever but I’m not sure how to feel about this.	1642945824.0	sau2j5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sau2j5/aita_for_not_paying_back_the_money_my_bf_gifted/	AITA for not paying back the money my bf gifted as a down payment for our house we lived in together when we broke up?
9redxoj0	My brother passed away suddenly in January 2021. He passed away suddenly in his sleep at the age of 35 after years of abusing alcohol which led to many mental health issues. In the years prior we did everything to get him help to no avail despite his intense verbal and emotional abuse of our entire family for years.   It's been well over a year now and his estate still hasn't been wrapped up. He owned no property, no cars, was unemployed and living in a vacation rental. Ideally, his estate should have been wrapped up in roughly 2-3 months tops.   It's been a year. My mother (diagnosed narcissist) still insists on dragging it out. The lawyers have sent her multiple letters telling her to collect his belongings, she's ignored them.   She's left his ashes in the lawyers office, as well as his Rolex watch which was his prized possession (and his last wish was that our eldest brother was given it in the event of his death). We are trying to ensure that his last wish is honored, and my mother refuses. We don't care about the monetary value - the sentimental value and honoring his last wish is all we care about.   We have given her time, support and any additional help she may need. She said she planned to pick up the watch this month. She's now said she's going in 2 months time. She's fully aware that his dying wish was that our eldest brother had that watch, and she is still delaying it for as long as she can.   We understand she is trying to hold onto my brother through extending out his estate, but enough is enough. I called her out for it and pointed out how utterly disrespectful this is to his memory. She still refuses and continues to feed money to the lawyer to drag it out for as long as possible despite it causing the entire family pain when we just want to move on and make peace.   If I'm honest, I'm disgusted by how this has been handled by her. It's gone from a mother grieving to her making this as painful as possible for everyone involved for herself.   Friends are saying I'm the asshole.

6q907h58	We have been dating for a year, lately fighting.    He has felt neglected and unable to express his feelings. I have felt tired, emotionally abused and misunderstood.    The big fight happened when he took me to a romantic getaway earlier this month. During the fight he raised his voice at me multiple times which was too much, as I have an anxiety disorder and he knows it is my trigger. I wished to break up. Many hurtful things were done and said on both sides but after time and more discussions he understood that he definitely crossed the line and did things harmful to my health. I was trying to avoid conflict but it seemed in vain.    Then he apologised and expressed deep understanding and remorse. We decided to try again, I practically begged him to show me he cares in any way because I wanted to trust him. He took me out on a date and it was nice, he gave me flowers, we overall just had a nice time and wanted to rebuild. The next day he woke up early to drive me somewhere so I wouldn't have to take the train, and he got me coffee and cigs. I assured him he didn't have to spend money on me like that, but he still did.    After this, I got sick and he was home. He suddenly started replying slowly to my texts, as in disappearing mid convo and replying later. I told him twice that it's ok with me that we aren't texting all the time but that when we are, if he'll just leave the convo to go and do something, that he should tell me as I do the same. I personally feel stupid just waiting for a reply and then finding out he's been cooking dinner. So he said he'd do it from now on. Then I let him know I was sick, he told me he's going to go spend quality time with his family, and didn't reply for about 5 hours. The next day he forgot I even told him I was sick. This made me really upset because I take care to call him or show him affection, especially when he is in a weakened state.    He only wanted to call me when I was upset that he already hadn't. He said he would have eventually called me. I told him that I don't wish to chase after his attention and didn't want to speak to him, I was already weak and ill and he was making me more upset. He was persistent and tried calling me, I refused. He wrote me a poem. I told him that 15 minutes in the two days he spent at home were 0,5% of the time he had and he still didn't think of checking up on me. He told me he didn't deserve me behaving this way and not wanting to talk to him.    Am I blowing this out of proportion? It pains me that he forgot that I wasn't OK and didn't even think of calling me, especially after everything that happened. We aren't speaking now, he replied slow to my texts the next day despite seeing them, I said I needed to heal without the added stress of his spitefulness. He said he did it because I was mean for saying I wouldn't go on a new vacation anytime soon when he proposed the idea.

wg9pv0b	On Tuesday morning I came down with a moderate case of a stomach virus. Fever around 102 most of the week, stomach pain, nasty smells and nasty bms etc.   On Monday night I tried out a new recipe for scallion pancakes from home. The flour I used was gifted to me from a neighbor albeit the bag was open as was we do a lot of sharing in our neighborhood.   To my assumption the scallion pancakes with the gifted flour caused my stomach flu seeing that when I could not eat my partner kept eating them. Each time they would heat them up it would make my gut wretch. The first night they heated them up I warned them that something was off with the pancakes to not eat them.   They brushed me off and said I was fine there’s not an issue. I pressed them and said that it may have only been a portion of the pancakes that caused the virus yet they still continued to brush me off.  This week has felt like hell. I took my first sick days from work since 2017, I could barely move, but am thankful for my dog cuddles, and a copious amount of streaming platforms.   Last night my partner and I were watching a show and I started to doze off and decided to head to head to bed  because I was still not feeling 100%. With out a doubt earlier in the night my partner went at those scallion pancakes again. With another warning from me “Would you like a week from hell, or would you rather just throw out those pancakes and eat something else” I said. I’m tooting my horn I can cook well but no food to me is worth agony.   I head off to bed and start to doze. My partner then comes in about an hour later and while half asleep tells me that she thinks she is sick from the pancakes. In the moment I let it go because all I want to do is sleep however I had been stewing over it all morning having that idea which caused me anxiety and the feeling of being unheard.   In the morning I wake up angry from My partner but happy that I am well enough to take my dog on a walk. When we return from the walk my partner brings up the scallion pancakes and I just unload on them for how I feel so unheard and valued in our relationship after warning them and having my sleep interrupted with such an unnerving idea.

63wqu	I'm in a very good friend's wedding this summer. Incredibly happy for them - I grew up with the bride, she's basically my sister. The couple was supposed to get married in May 2020 and it's been delayed 2 years, so I completely understand their frustration. They're also both type-A people and want everything to go \*exactly\* their way. To be fair, it is their wedding and I've tried to accommodate whenever possible.  This past week, I hit the straw that broke this camel's back. We were asked to buy new pants since some of the groomsmen had outgrown theirs (myself included) or hadn't bought a pair originally and the model was now out of stock - totally fine, I'm happy to purchase a new pair of pants. The wedding couple identified a new pair of pants and asked everyone to go online and immediately purchase a pair. While the pants were technically in my size, they were only available in a "skinny" fit. While I used to be very skinny (5+ years ago) that is no longer the case, especially since the pandemic hit. I purchased 4 pairs of stretch skinny pants in 2021, none of them fit. I'm 6'2" and 195lbs.  I immediately communicated that these pants would not fit and that I wasn't comfortable buying them, hoping we could find an alternative in the same color. I even did the research and found a pair that looked identical. The couple informed me that these were the only pants in the world that would work for their wedding and that I should purchase a pair immediately noting that the pants were "stretch" and they should fit fine. I pushed back again. The groom called and I continued to reiterate that I wasn't comfortable buying them and really didn't think that they'd fit. Eventually, I was bullied into it. The groom purchased several pairs for me to "try on" at his place.  Here we are a week later, and I'm still uncomfortable. Maybe even more uncomfortable. Regardless of if the pants end up fitting, I don't feel like I was listened to \*at all\* and it was more important for them to have these specific pants than for me to feel good in them. Again, I get it, not my wedding... but it is my body. I've been super comfortable with the recent changes to my body and feel great about it, but really don't like the way this interaction has gone. I'm now being asked to go to their place (an hour away), try on the pants in front of them and if they don't fit take them to a tailor even farther away to make them fit. This just feels over the top in terms of effort and don't see why we can't find a pair of pants with multiple fits/sizes that works for everyone. It seems like everything with this wedding needs to be \*a big thing\* and the world will end if every detail doesn't go exactly their way.

e27c9ewo	So to begin with im 13 and yeah I know I’m not suppose to say my age but it would make more sense for this. So my gf is friends with some girl and she’s been her friend for years but her friend has become a Asshole she is very jealous of our relationship. 1. Her friend told her that I was using her which isn’t true. 2. She never invited my gf to anything anymore then says my gf is ditching them. 3. My gf realizes her friend has been rude same with some other friends and they keep saying I’m stealing her from them because we hang out all the time. So now that you have backstory last night it was the last straw me and my gf were cuddling and her friend called her not knowing she was with me saying I’m a asshole and being a baby because she is always hanging out with me. So my gf told me not to say anything but I did I asked her friend wtf is your problem i with me and she started crying I don’t feel bad at all. Me and my gf are fine now and she’s considering on dropping that friend and a few others who have been doing the same thing.

21dvwb6j	So we recently had a heated discussion about this so I'm turning to Reddit. Last September my (27f) husband (31m) brought me a fairly expensive electric scooter for my bday. This was an amazing gift as I wanted one for a long time and I appreciated it very much. We live in a city so I used it quite often to get by places, and just generally loved it so much. We live in an apartment complex, and I decided to store the scooter in front of the door of our apartment in a closed corridor with us and 3 other tenants. My husband reportedly told me not to keep it outside as I might get stolen easily. Looking back now I was really naive as I never took him seriously, and never believed anyone would actually steal it.  As you might have guessed it by now 3 weeks ago it was actually stolen. Someone messed with the lock on the corridor and just simply entered and took it, it wasnt even locked. I was devastated to say the least, felt really stupid and naive. Partly because it was a high value and I loved it so much but partly also because it was a gift I didn't care for enough. I regret not locking it up ever since. I never expected my husband to replace it because it was very generous in the first place to get me one. However, my nameday is coming up (don't live in the US, we celebrate it here), and I overheard him and my mom talking. She suggested that they could get me a new scooter together, and my husband said that he doesn't want to buy me a new one so soon, because this is a lesson I need to learn. I told him later I heard them talking and asked about it, and he indeed confirmed he does not trust me that I can take care of my stuff anymore, as I wasn't doing so for months when I left it outside. Again, it's not at all about me expecting a new one from him, but the sheer thought, and I was taken aback by his lack of trust.  I deeply regretted not listening to him the second I realised it was gone, and when I'll ever buy a new one in the future I will do all efforts now to protect it, obviously. He says my word can only be proven by actions, and for a long time, I acted in a way that I didn't care.  I found his judgement hurtful and "parenting", I feel the unfortunate event was a lesson enough itself, he doesn't feel this way at all, and thinks I'm spoiled.

8ljy05m9	I know I'm the Ahole.   My mom is my whole world and I would be crushed if anything happened to her. My mom is almost 50 and has been trying to improve her appearance. When I learned how to use makeup, she wanted tips so I tried to help her. Her skin is wrinkled and she has freckles all over her face but also sunspots. Whenever she sends me pictures of her makeup, her eyebrows are BOMB but the rest makes me cringe. When she shows me she's desperate for my validation and it breaks my heart. She tries SO hard to improve her self esteem. I want to support her, truly. My mom is clinically depressed and has a lot of self esteem issues as it is and I don't want to add to that.

306agsmn	I am a 24F and two weeks ago, things got really bad at home with my parents. I was looking at hotels to stay in, but my best friend (25F) and her boyfriend offered to let me stay with them while I got back on my feet.  During that time, I focused on myself, my healing, my next steps. A lot of it was spent crying to my therapist, other friends, and my girlfriend. My best friend and her boyfriend were also there but I think they started resenting it.  I was nearly ready to go, with an apartment nearly lined up. Days before, my friend tells me sternly that I am rejecting friendship from her boyfriend and that I’m not respecting their space. I immediately try to be overly friendly and respectful.  But then a few days ago, my friend sits me down and almost intervention style, tells me that I’m self centered, selfish, disrespectful, and that I am hurting her and her boyfriend. (Note that the boyfriend never said any of these things, it was only her) She and her boyfriend felt like parents rather than friends. Yet when I tried to talk, she’d stick her finger up and tell me she isn’t finished.  I have trauma where my parents would corner me to yell at me so when my friend was doing this, I immediately had a panic attack. I tried to get away but she wouldn’t let me leave. I had to go back and listen to more, but eventually I couldn’t take it anymore and left, which she views as running away from the “important” conversation.   I was sobbing uncontrollably in my car and it took my therapist and a different friend to calm me down. After what happened, and knowing she was going to continue this “conversation”, I couldn’t stay anymore. Since that friend and her boyfriend were playing a game, I wrote notes saying thank you, packed my stuff, and left.  I moved back home to my parents. They welcomed me back and I am safe, but it’s a little awkward.  Well, the next day, my best friend writes a novel length message telling me that I hurt her by leaving and I’m not willing to listen to her yell at me. She also used things against me, saying that I am just like my mother in that I make things about myself. She also insinuated that I need psychiatric help.  I tried to once again apologize for anything that I might have done wrong and that we need a break from the friendship, but she once again told me I need help, I’m an awful friend, and that she hopes I work on myself.   The thing is, everything she said that I am, self-centered, selfish, etc. is how I would describe her. I have been friends with her for over 10 years and this is how she is. Also, my therapist and other friends agree that she is a major narcissist who gaslit me and because the attention wasn’t on her during the time I was staying with them, I became an inconvenience and I needed to “shape up”.   Still, when I think about it too much, I can’t help but feel like I still did something wrong. So here I am.

10yk4aa	So, I (31F) have a friend, let's call him John (46M) who recently and suddenly lost his dad. This is the most recent death my friend has experienced in a loooooong string of deaths over the past eight years, with the other most recent one in Nov. 2020 where he lost a best friend. I should also mention he's also in Canada and I'm in the States, and we've never met in person. I also have feelings for him which he's aware of, but it's a timing thing as to why he doesn't want a relationship (he just got out of a 5+ year relationship and has been dealing with grief from the pre-2020 death, but we both want to remain friends).  He's the kind of person to really isolate and shun the world when he's grieving. I think the deaths he has experienced have hardened him, and he's just so angry at the world. I've known him for almost two years now, and we talk literally every week for hours at a time on the phone and have been for at least six months now. We talk about everything: our deepest darkest secrets, our emotional traumas, mental health, politics, and our common interests. I consider him to be one of my closest friends.  He had been talking about taking a trip soon whereby he'd pass through my city. It'd be a pretty long trip maybe like a few weeks to a month, and my city is near the halfway point of the entire trip. Before he lost his dad, he was talking about taking a few days in my city to meet me and hang out which I was stoked about because I'm really eager to meet him in person after having been friends for almost two years. I called him recently to express my condolences on the loss of his father, and to just talk about how he's coping right now. My friend brings up his eventual trip to my city (which isn't set in stone yet, probably will happen within 1-2 years he said), and he says, "When I make my way down to your city, I'll just be passing through. I won't really be stopping. We can probably have a quick drink, but I'm going to have to keep moving. Actually, I'll probably hit up Ashley (\*bit of backstory\* she's a relative of a famous person we both adore and he's been able to have a few decent discussions with her - not romantically or anything as she's not his type at all) and see if she wants to meet up for drinks, and maybe she'll let you tag along too."     When he said that I jus felt numb and in shock. I felt like I was worthless to him. Two years of friendship, a ton of support though all of his healing, and giving my time to build this friendship we have, have meant nothing because apparently he just sees me as an acquaintance. Someone to just have a quick drink with as you might with someone who you talk to once in a blue moon. We talk literally every week for at least four hours on the phone. I recognize he's grieving and that can sometimes make people lash out at those they love or make them act strangely, but this really hurt me. It's making me think that the friendship is incredibly one-sided and I just have had my blinders on. Like he's just using me for the support I give and the attention because he knows I like him and I'm there willingly, but has no intention of reciprocating. WIBTA for calling him out on his comments and how hurt I was by them? Even going so far as to ending the friendship if he truly only wants to just grab a quick drink when we do eventually meet for the first time in person? I don't think that just because he's grieving he should get a free pass to treat me like that.	1642951612.0	saw10s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saw10s/wibta_for_calling_out_my_friend_for_being_an/	WIBTA for calling out my friend for being an asshole while he's grieving?
fh415bnf	I usually work really early around 5:30 or 6 and usually I wait for my bf to text me so I know he’s awake. A good amount of the time I will text him while he’s still asleep and just let him know about things going on, but this morning he got really mad at me. I’ve been at work and then I saw he posted on Snapchat like 20 minutes earlier so I responded just saying “Good morning baby! How did you sleep?” And he was acting really pissy. I asked him what was wrong and he said he hates that I “never text him first” and that I don’t respond to the 11:11 messages he sends me at night. It’s a really cute gesture and I love that he does that but I have to go to sleep early so I don’t see it until the morning and I don’t respond every time. I got really mad and told him it’s not my responsibility to keep track of when he wakes up to text him first especially when I’m at work. Now we aren’t talking and he’s really upset.

iv693jed	So most of my older family has this narrative about me because I choose to set boundaries. They’re very manipulative. Given I’m one of the only ones to set them, they have this odd belief that what they haven’t seen physical evidence of me doing is exactly what I haven’t done. I don’t brag much to them so they hop scotch their way to a conclusion of my life.   I was over at my Grandma’s house because it was her birthday. There’s about 7 of her friends and 10 of my relatives. I’m fashionably late Ig. Like 30 min. I was working. As I walk in they all turn around to look at me and one by one   My grandma asks, “Did you sleep in today?”  My aunt asks, “Have you got lost on your way?”  My grandmas friend: “You’re a waif.” My grandpa asks, “Were you in the bathroom doing your makeup or something?”   I looked in all directions at once and said, “It must be nice when all that’s left are the good times past!”  Eerie silence after that. I sat on the couch and took a nap.   AITA?	1642953446.0	sawo9b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sawo9b/aita_for_saying_this_in_front_of_everyone/	AITA for saying this in front of everyone?
bghx9xht	so me and my friend have grown really distant since she’s gotten into a relationship. we used to have sleepovers at least once a week but she has cancelled on me 4 times in a row now. she says it’s bc of her mental health and i understand that but then she will go out and make plans with her gf the next day. it really upsets me and i’ve brought this up to her 3 times. the first time she said she was sorry and that was that. the second time she lied to me about why she didn’t meet me and when i confronted her about it she asked if we could talk and then proceeded to apologise and say that she had a panic attack over what i said bc she was afraid i hated her. this isn’t unusual as she is incredibly sensitive and she has a lot of mental health issues.   i admit i did sound quite angry in the text and i feel bad about it now but at the time i felt like her feelings were her own and i shouldn’t have pretended like it was fine so that she wouldn’t feel bad. the third time i confronted her i just told her that i thought we needed a break bc she was going through a lot and so was i and i thought that our friendship wasn’t good for either of us. she apologised about cancelling and said we could hang out the next day so i agreed. she then cancelled the next day.   i completely understand that she’s not in the right headspace and i don’t want her to force herself to do anything she doesn’t want to but she always has time for her gf and never for me. i don’t know what to do. am i the asshole in this situation?	1642954043.0	sawwf0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sawwf0/aita_for_getting_mad_that_my_friend_keeps/	AITA for getting mad that my friend keeps cancelling plans?
100kd1	So I matched with this girl a week ago on tinder and we went out last Thursday around her neighborhood (I drove two busses in order to get to her) I am pretty timid and she is extremely loud. At the beginning I thought it was cute. She was extremely open about past trauma she experienced and was pretty graphic in her description of what she experienced. I was rather shocked and hugged her. The Date was an overall success. Two days later we are video chatting at night and she spirals and gets into a long monologoue on guys she dated after I asked her about a dark skinned guy she Dated in the past. She starts talking about the different dicks of guys she dates and I go silent and let her go on and on. At the end she jokingly asks if I am going to block her after this and I answer still pretty shocked, "I just might" she got upset and eventually I told her, that if she doesn't understand what is wrong with telling a guy you know for less than a week about the dick size of every guy she dated and what kind of orgasms it caused her, than maybe we really don't match. She then hung up on me.  AITA?	1642954259.0	sawzfn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sawzfn/aita_for_my_comment_on_her_sex_history/	AITA for my comment on her sex history?
ixwpm0fn	So, I (31F) have a friend, let's call him John (46M) who recently and suddenly lost his dad. This is the most recent death my friend has experienced in a long string of deaths over the past eight years, with the other most recent one in Nov. 2020 where he lost a best friend. I should also mention he's also in Canada and I'm in the States, and we've never met in person. I also have feelings for him which he's aware of, but it's a timing thing as to why he doesn't want a relationship (he just got out of a 5+ year relationship and has been dealing with grief from pre-2020 deaths, but we both want to remain friends).  I've known him for almost two years now, and we talk literally every week for hours at a time on the phone and have been for at least six months now. We talk about everything, and I consider him to be one of my closest friends.  He had been talking about taking a trip soon where he'd pass through my city. It'd be a pretty long trip maybe like a month, and my city is near the halfway point of the entire trip. Before he lost his dad, he was talking about taking a few days in my city to meet me and hang out and I was stoked. I'm really eager to meet him in person and get to know the real him not just on a screen. I called him recently to express my condolences on the loss of his father, and my friend brings up his eventual trip to my city (which will probably happen within 1-2 years), and he says, "When I make my way down to your city, I'll just be passing through. We can probably have a quick drink, but I'm going to keep moving.

i22r35oe	I (20f) briefly dated a boy in 2020 who I’ll call Tom (22m). Throughout our relationship I remember thinking “I really don’t like this kid” and we ended up breaking up a few months into our relationship.   Unfortunately the boy had a decent relationship with my roommate at the time and negotiated staying in our apartment until he could afford his own place. (The apartment was in my and my roommates name and in the sweet light of 2020 it made kicking people out of their homes pretty tricky.)   I hated being at home. Tom would constantly throw himself pity parties, threaten my now boyfriend, refuse to let my boyfriend inside. It eventually involved my other roommate who took Toms side and the whole living situation got really toxic. I was living with two large men who didn’t respect me or my boundaries and I started to fear being there.   Anyway, I moved out as soon as I could and haven’t looked back. I haven’t spoken to either since April 2021. Until Thursday.   I had Friday off so I had a girls night with a couple friends and woke up to some 4am texts from Tom along the lines of “Sneaky Link?” it was more graphic but I was livid. He doesn’t respect me, my boyfriend of over a year, my living situation, or my wish to be no contact.   I could’ve blocked him but I wanted insurance he would never reach out again so I responded “Not only do I never want to see your shrimp ass dick again but I would be happy if I never had to see your face either. Never text me again”   I blocked him and went on with my day. He made an account on instagram following my message and messaged me and to put it lightly called me a whore.   I sucked in my pride didn’t respond because I know he wanted a reaction. I felt justified in my words until my mom called later telling me how upset Tom was. Apparently Tom texted my mom extremely hurt about what I said.   My mom always worries about Tom due to him being an idiot and thinks I should have given him a break as his life is super hard and I shouldn’t make it harder by being mean. I think he should know better than to reach out to me at all and if he’s going to be gross he deserves a little rebuttal.

abfpsswa	I got into a small fight with my brother where  we argued and he hit me with a blow-up club (don’t ask why it was there) so I was trying to take it from him. We had guests over, and my mom was screaming at me and only me to stop and when I did she continued to yell at me and not my brother for starting the fight. She does this a lot, and I think it’s because I’m so much more like my dad and my brother is so much more like her. I left and sat in my room for a while and came down to eat. I didn’t talk to anyone, and my dad yelled at me for not talking at all. This morning I asked my mom about something I needed and she brought this fight up and said and I quote, “you were choking your brother and wouldn’t stop while we had guests over.” I was not choking him, I was grabbing at the club which he was holding in front of himself from behind him. I told her how sick I am of her lying and making stuff up and called her a bad parent. She then shouted how I have to take responsibility for my actions. Am I the one I the wrong here? I genuinely need help, because this happens so frequently that I’m beginning to think I’m the one causing all of the problems and I should leave and find somewhere else to stay.	1642953393.0	sawnlt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sawnlt/aita_for_fighting_with_my_brother_while_guests/	AITA for fighting with my brother while guests were over?
ijqto5i4	 Hello, hopefully I'm doing this right lol  But few weeks back I offered to cook my friend there favourite meal (as we had a huge falling out and I wanted to make it up to them) they agreed and when I told them I was making Indian they told me there favourite food is Italian but they won't hold it over me since I was making a home cooked meal for us( I'll admit I always have got Indian and Italian mixed up when thinking Indians there favourite,don't know why I just did) now I cooked and we ate and they said they enjoyed it and we made up, few days ago were were arguing again and they said how they hate curry but still ate it because I cooked it, which feels like they through it back in my face when they said they wouldn't , and I said the told me they weren't going to hold it over me and then they did , I can't remember what they responded with but it was something to justify why they suddenly held it over me.  This hurt more than the rest of our arguement , so what I really want to ask is WIBTA- if I sat them down and told them calmly how much it hurt that they basically held the fact I cooked the wrong meal over me when they said they wouldnt??   (I even cried when they reminded me it was the wrong meal but they said they won't hold it over me since I was putting in alot of effort)	1642955177.0	saxbzf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxbzf/wibta_if_i_told_my_friend_it_hurt_my_feelings/	WIBTA- if I told my friend it hurt my feelings that they told me in a arguement that they hated the meal I cooked specially for them because I forget what there favourite meal was?
1xpmpwlo	OK I've got a long one for you but wanted to include as much information in the post as possible. Let me also preface by saying I've never been a bridesmaid and it is not something that interests me for various reasons. Maybe a couple of years ago or if I was single but not anymore.   My (28F) brother (26M) is getting married to his Fiance (26F) in late 2023. I'm currently 39w pregnant and my daughter is going to be flower girl which was decided pretty much when they got engaged a few months ago. I was happy for them to have her as flower girl. I was really looking forward to the wedding and being able to enjoy it with my partner and daughter.   Yesterday myself, my mom, my sister (21F), my brother and my soon to be SIL were just sitting around talking when she said I need to ask you both a question. My mom turned off the TV (like she knew what was happening) and immediately my heart sank because I just knew what was coming. I started to panic and she asked us both to be bridesmaids and my sister immediately said yes. I was taken aback and honestly for a few seconds I did freeze. I didn't want to fake excitement and say yes only to have to try and let her down later. I've known her for 10 years and think of her like a sister so I decided to just be honest with her. I said I really appreciated her asking me it meant a lot but I wasn't sure if it was something I ever wanted to do. It got extremely awkward as everyone started asking me for reasons why. My sister said she knew I was going to say no as she knew it was something I've always said I didn't want to do. After a lot of questions and me trying to give reasons and everyone 'coming up with solutions to my reasons' I eventually felt backed into a corner and said okay.  Extra info:  SIL is only having 2 bridesmaids (me and my sister) and a maid of honour. She has loads of friends she could ask but asked us because my brother has asked HER brothers to be his groomsmen so felt it would be nice to have all siblings. Idk. She also said she felt she couldn't ask one of us and not the other.   Brother and SIL left not long afterwards. When my brother came to the house today he didn't speak to me and was in a mood. He basically told my mom that he was angry with me for 'embarrassing' SIL. He said I should have faked excitement and said yes then text her later to say no. It was only my sister and mom in the room so it wasn't like I had turned her down in front of a crowd. I wouldn't do that to her.  I've been crying all day over this (which is probably more to do with the pregnancy hormones) as I feel I was put in an awkward position by my brother not 'sussing' out if this was even something I would want to do before she asked. And I feel awful for SIL as I feel my brother was probably the one who encouraged her to ask.   So, AITA here since everyone seems to think I am?	1642955639.0	saxi8h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxi8h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_my_sils_bridesmaid/	AITA for not wanting to be my SIL's bridesmaid
dse29lhy	It's my 26F birthday soon. I wanted to spend the day alone, just chilling. My sister 29F doesn't want me to spend the day alone. She booked a hotel room (I've severe OCD and she can't stay at my place because of it). I've told her before, that I really want to be alone, won't have time, courses, therapy,  yada yada. Since she'll be visiting,  I've planned a get-together with friends at a restaurant. I just don't want to spend the whole time with my sis alone doing nothing (almost everything is closed to you know what). Regarding time and place, I completely honored my friends wishes. To this, my sister said "It's your birthday, it's your decision". I've told her, that cause she's coming, it's not my decision at all, that I've wanted to spend the day alone. She answered that we could still just spend the day together, watching Netflix or dunno. I've asked her, if she doesn't understand the meaning of "alone". This really hurt her/got her mad.  Later I told our mom, that my sis shouldn't be angry about this.  Our mom and my sister think I'm the AH for telling her this.  Our mom is also angry about me telling her that my friends have a similar dark humour as me. My family isn't a fan of my "dark" jokes. She now kinda expects my friend and me to behave differently.  My friends are on my side.  I understand that I shouldn't have been so mean as I've been. And maybe I shouldn't have told our mom, that my friends and I are going to be our usual selfs.	1642955782.0	saxk65	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxk65/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_if_i_would_have/	AITA for telling my sister that if I would have been in charge, we wouldn't celebrate my birthday together?
ixz24pzm	I chose to go to a faraway city to go to a grad/professional school over another equally good and equally expensive school closer to my home state in part because I had two very close friends in this city, and none on the closer-to-home city, still 2 hrs away from home. They'd been in this city for a year prior to my showing up. I also was really excited to try a different part of the country. Especially after 1.5 years pretty much quarantine with only my grandma and parents, I was ready to get out and explore the world.  A semester in, and I'm extremely homesick. I know I don't want to live here after I graduate, and in my field, job prospects are strongly affected by your school's location. I know that it's important for me to be near my family in the long run, and I got good enough grades in my first semester to allow me to transfer to the best school in my home state, which I wasn't even able to get into when I was initially applying. I think I am going to transfer. But I feel very guilty about how this will affect my friends, especially one who I would consider my best friend, whom I would be leaving behind.   She and I had a tough spell around a half year ago in which I had strong romantic feelings for her and she had to turn me down, but this finally feels irrelevant for both of us, really in the past. We are each other's closest friends, and I'm now considering leaving. It feels crazy to stay just for her sake, as she would never want me to do that if I asked her, but also feels very wrong to leave her, after she's  spent so much time with me while I've been here. She does have many other good friends in town, but I am sure she would have spent more time this past year cultivating friendships with people who will continue being here, had I not been here. She'll be here for 2 more years for her program.  I know I made an immature, emotionally-driven choice to come out here in the first place, and I have come to regret it. I would like to stop hurting people in this situation. Maybe I should be asking what the right thing to do is, not whether I'm an asshole, but feel free to say that too.	1642956421.0	saxszl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxszl/aita_for_considering_transferring/	AITA for considering transferring
aiudi1t6	I (24f) work from home, so I spend quite a lot of time at home. My housemate, "Mia" (25f) isn't employed at the moment as she's starting an online business. She hasn't many friends around here as she's from abroad (like me, but from another country) she only goes out to do groceries or for an occasional walk a few days a week. We've been living together for about 6 months.  My problem with Mia is that she spends every waking moment on the phone or making video calls, we have thin walls and she has a strong voice (even when trying to speak quietly, and she forgets in a minute anyway) so I can perfectly hear anything she says from the other side of our apartment. Since she wakes up in the morning till after 1 am when she goes to bed. The one or 2 hours she's not on the phone, she's watching TV. At first, I thought I could deal with it as I can't understand her language anyway so it's not like I am receiving any input, so to speak. Or I would just put on my headset with some music. But it's starting to really wear me out. It's freezing cold here and I still go out for hours so I can enjoy some silence.  Today I've had a terrible headache since I woke up and asked her to please leave the phone just for a day. She asked me what does my headache have to do with her talking with her family. To just take a pill. I told her I just need some silence. She got mad at me, went back to her room, and went back to being on the phone again as she received a call.  I understand I can't ask her not to pick up or make calls for me, and that she may feel lonely. But I wake up and fall asleep hearing her conversations and her ringtone every day. And I think the headaches are caused by me wearing my headset every day, I've been suffering from them during this whole month.

Like he’s sitting too far or something? I keep telling him to clean it and he never does. I don’t even want to go in there it’s gross.   I finally told him to clean it or hold it because it’s making everyone sick. He said I’m overreacting and that’s when I brought it up in front of more family.

1uzm93t1	Background: My husband (25M) and I (25F) just had our baby in December. She is about 6 weeks old now and a generally easy baby to care for. She eats, sleeps, and rarely fusses.   She sleeps in our room in her bassinet. The night shift is pretty easy. She’ll usually wake up around 2-3 am to eat and 5-6 am to eat.   My husband and I both work full time jobs. We decided to split the night shifts since she only really wakes up twice, my husband will take the first feeding since I wake up earlier than he does, about 5am. So I just take the second feeding, then put her back to sleep, and then get ready for work. I take her with me when I leave to drop her off with my mom so he gets to go back to sleep for at least another hour once we leave (if he even wakes up).   On the weekends, we do it a little differently. Friday nights, only one of us will wake up for both feedings so the other can get a full night of uninterrupted sleep. Then on Saturday night, the other one takes the feedings. You get the idea.   Well, this weekend I took the Friday night feedings, so Saturday night I expected him to take both. We had even discussed it to be sure. He ended up taking the first feeding but when she woke up about 4:30, I woke him and he went back to sleep.   I’m not going to let my baby cry so I made her a bottle and started feeding her. I really wasn’t upset at that point, I figured maybe he was super tired so I let him be. At this point he wakes up and I expected him to say “oh my gosh I’m so sorry I fell asleep, here let me get her and you go back to bed”. Instead, he says “do you need anything?”   He has an awful habit of asking “do you need anything” when what I need is usually very obvious and he should be able to figure out on his own. I could have said “yeah, you can take her because it’s your night” but I was already up and awake so I just didn’t say anything and he went back to sleep.   This morning I am kind of giving him the silent treatment because I am a little upset I had to wake up when I had let him get a full night and he didn’t return the favor for me. I know the silent treatment is probably childish but we never fight (I mean seriously. 7 years together and we have never had a fight. We are just very compatible).   AITA for being upset with him about this? I genuinely want to know and will take any feedback or criticism.	1642957062.0	say1sg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/say1sg/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_husband_for_not/	AITA for being upset with my husband for not keeping his word?
77qfp7wo	My sister(19) got vaccinated a few days ago, and she kept making noises trying to show that her body was aching, but I(17) ignored her.   You see, the night before her vaccination, something I was watching triggered a memory. Growing up, my sister would look after all the kids while the adults hung out together because she was the eldest in my family's friend group. She would receive a lot of pocket money, and everyone always complimented her, and talked highly of her. On the other hand, they always talked down on me because even though we were only 2 years apart, I didnt help look after them much cause I like being alone. I did look after them when I got older, but all the credit went to my sister so I just stopped cause I thought it was unfair.  Well, a few months ago, I brought this up. I apologized for not helping her out much when looking after the kids, and I told her how unfair it was that she had to look after them when she was a child too. Well, she started to get annoyed, and told me that she did it cause she enjoyed it, and that she didn't like how I described it as "lowkey child labor." She said that it was a win win situation for her cause she got money, and she liked children.   This just set me off inside cause growing up, everyone, including her, told me that I was a selfish spoiled brat, and guilt tripped me whenever they had the chance. I grew up feeling like sht because of them, and I felt so sorry for leaving everything to her. But then Im told that she enjoyed it.  Like good for her, but I dont understand why she made me feel like sht for it then. She knows that I don't do well with young kids, heck, I dont even do well with kids my age. She knows that.   This memory then brought up a whole lot of other memories. People blamed and guilt tripped me a lot growing up, and she always joined them and acted victim.   Example: My sister cooks, and I clean. But then one day, everyone we met(we share a friend group) suddenly tells me "You never help your sister at home." Or "You'd be dead without your sister." Then they tell me that I cant even eat without her. Well, I can. Im not as good as her but Im decent at cooking. I can cook simple meals like fried rice, and Im good at following recipes. But she chooses to cook cause "Im a nuisance in the kitchen" and she doesnt like doing the dishes. I thought this worked well for us, but apparently shes been talking bad about me behind my back for it.   These memories just caused a whole wave of negative emotions that night. Then the next day she just keeps making a scene as if shes asking for me to look after her, and I still feel like sht so I ignore her and minded my own business. Well, the next day, one of our friends tells me that it was very mean of me to ignore her like that when she was clearly in pain.  I did feel bad about it so I made her breakfast the next day, but I cant get it out of my mind.

bfdcqbjw	 I already know I’m going to get crucified for this, but here we go…  My (26F) brother (22M) has gotten in trouble in the past for hanging with the wrong crowd. He recently found a new friend group (who all seem nice, but they drink excessively)- and he started hanging out with this new girl “Alexa”.   I don’t know much about Alexa other than what I can see online. She’s always clubbing, she works at a… risqué restaurant, she is very into crystals / astrology and she has a bunch of semi-naked photos on IG.  I care about my brother, and I don’t want him to wind up getting her pregnant. So, I made a comment to him that this girl wasn’t wife material. He got pissed and blocked me on IG.  I want to be clear- I’m not trying to slut shame. Honestly, Alexa could be the nicest girl in the world. But, imo if you’re posting nearly naked photos online and going clubbing, you’re not ready to settle down. And that’s OK.   Maybe my brother really digs this girl and that’s why he’s so hurt by what I said. But also, I’m his big sister and I want to look out for him.

do4xwxed	It’s upsetting and I’m sad:( On mobile too, sorry for big block. He’s was a rescue so he liked going outside, never gone longer than a few hours. I chipped him but no collar bc I didn’t want him getting stuck somewhere. They moved in a few months ago and after they did he started being gone longer than a day. Last week they tried cat napping him, I knocked on their door after a couple days bc I was getting worried. Old man answered- me: hi, have you seen my cat? (I’m outside with kitty a lot)  Om: “yes” me: “where??” Om: “here.” Me: “he’s here rn???” Om: “oh idk he comes and goes” then my cat ran up to the door😭 I took him home and later the Om’s wife came over and brought me a bag of food and enough flea treatment for 6 months. She said she gave him one treatment but I had just gave him 1 before they cat napped him. Vet said he was born with something(can’t remember name was crying) and that the medicine topped him over. Too much damage that he would be in a lot of pain and only make it a fews years. He went from cuddly happy kitty to foaming out the mouth 80 degrees when they’re supposed to be 100 something type shit. We had to euthanize him. I also have a 10 month old who thankfully had no idea what was going on just was wondering why mama was crying. I wanna tell them because Its fucked up but I also feel like it’s my fault. I didn’t get him routine bloodwork because the first few times I took him to vets he would throw up and hyperventilate- while pissing and shitting himself. They said he was healthy so I figured he was fine, maybe I didn’t have proper bloodwork done in the beginning? If I didn’t let him outside they wouldn’t have got him. The lady said the Om has Alzheimer’s, she seemed like she really liked kitty and didn’t mean it(the cat napping) so I was trying to not be mad at them but I’m so sad:(	1642959452.0	sayz61	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sayz61/aita_if_i_tell_my_elderly_neighbor_they_killed_my/	AITA if I tell my elderly neighbor they killed my cat?
78smggq6	So we both use the same one for reasons I'm not saying here. She lost my card for my bank accidentally threw it away. And the old ones deactivated so everything has to be reset with it and stuff. Obviously I don't want this to happen again I didn't think much of it so I was like hey can you leave this card here? She got upset at me and was like accidents happen you're making my life more difficult. So I said okay maybe asking you to leave it here wasn't the right way to start off can you just please be more careful with it? That still upset her.

ikq3xed7	 My best friend wasn’t too serious about her boyfriend and we all hung out in a big group. It wasn’t actually open but they both seemed tolerant. He liked both of us apparently but never told me for reasons unknown.   Her guy one day decided to cheat with this girl and they ended up hanging out a lot. My friend was pretty shook up and I hated to watch so I introduced her to his older brother. She thought it was hilarious. He ended up loosing his shit over it and went and fucked one of her friends. He showed me a video of it? and to stir the pot I got his sister with this dude from a car meet he went to.   Meanwhile I’d been dating one his best friends and before I know it bestie’s ex starts throwing men at me. He accused me of talking to all of them for some reason. My man ended up making it awkward so I left the situation. Well he was mad enough to where he tried to get with my friend and my friend’s ex was trying to get me. Before that happened we all had a big oh shit moment and now this guy won’t forgive me for “ruining” what we had even though I’ve apologized.

iy0kktin	To provide a little background to why I am struggling, last year my wife (29f) and I (31m) found out we were going to have a baby. We were ecstatic and getting prepared as first time parents, but we found out that the baby was miscarried in august 2021. We were both devastated and we are still recovering now. If the baby was not miscarried, they would be born in February coming, so we are both quite sensitive about this at the moment.  Now, my niece, who is 19 this year has just messaged me to say she is pregnant with her second child (her first was born last year). She was scared to tell me as she was worried I’d tell her off because of her age and being on baby two. I didn’t tell her off and like the first time, I said I was happy for her.  Now, this has come at a very sensitive time for me. My wife has previously mentioned that if my niece had a second child, she would be upset because of our experience. She certainly would not be cruel to my niece, she is not that sort of person, but I know she will be hurt - especially because we have been trying for a baby again and we are really struggling to the point that we are talking about seeing a dr soon.  My problem is, this is playing on my mind and I am struggling to keep this news from my wife because I really don’t want to upset her, but at the same time, I don’t want her to feel betrayed of I don’t tell her my niece is pregnant.  Really what I want to know is, WIBTA or AITA for not telling my wife, or do I continue to wait a little longer to tell her? Particularly a short while after what would have been our baby’s due date.  I am on mobile so sorry if the format is weird.

eqk1odvi	A little background, my fiancée and I live in a townhouse in PA and the snow storms can get pretty bad.  We have a two year old golden retriever that we can’t off leash outside the building to do his business (that’s another story).  We also have a dog run (one we paid a lot of money for) tied around a tree in our yard that we leave the clip next to the front door.    Last snow, the landlord has maintenance out with snow shovels to clear off the sidewalks.  The last one to came around they brought a snow blower and they accidentally ran over the run as it was buried.  It slipped our mind that we should have moved it out of the way, but at the same time they’ve never brought a snow blower so we didn’t think it was in the picture.  It got caught up in the machine and they spent close to 15 minutes pulling it out and getting it back running.    AITA for leaving a dog run next to our door during the winter or are they for destroying it?

dbxv9n6r	  So I (14f) has had a lot of deaths recently, wells kids at school bring it up from time to time to mess with me.  Well on Friday (1-21-22) me and another boy were joking around. This boy has a step mom, so I joked about that and he joked about my stepdad.  Well he said something about my Grandma being bald so I said she was dead, we joked about that then I asked him to stop, the same thing happened with my uncle.  I don't know if I made him mad or what but he then told me that "That's why yo bald headed granny dead, and yo bald headed uncle too".  Long story short I spent then next two hours in the office crying, I'm an office aid so the office was borderline worried and let me stay up there. And it didn't help that the day before marked the four months since my grandpa died, and my uncle he joked about was five months.  Well when the Counselor came into his office he gave me the choice of either talking to him Friday or the upcoming Monday (1-24-22), I told him I didn't want to talk so we agreed in Monday.  The Counselor also told me that he knew who it was and he thinks that the boy didn't understand what he did wrong, and he did. He usually snaps me for streak and he didn't, he kept walking into my 8th period and he kept looking at me, he knows what he did wrong.  But I'm honest, if I talk with him I'll easily tell him that if he jokes about my dead family members again he'll end up with a broken nose.  But I understand the Counselor only wants to help, but it's not worth it.  But it's all open wounds, My Grandpa died two days after my birthday in September (He died 9-20-21), my uncle died (8-2-21), my grandma (3-28-20), my cousin (Summer of 2019), then a cousin when I was in 3rd (Roughly give years ago).  And I also have Office Aid first so I can't just leave, And u don't want to be known as a snitch with that subject.  So, WIBTA for telling my Counselor I won't make amends or talk to the boy?	1642963744.0	sb0p54	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0p54/wibta_for_telling_my_counselor_that_im_not_making/	WIBTA for telling my Counselor that I'm not making amends with a kid?
desb1b3s	This is kind of a [sequel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rbmhr2/aita_for_not_giving_my_mom_enough/) to a post I made before. One day last month when I (18M) was about to go somewhere to get something to eat when my mom was like "buy me something too". I then mentioned to her that I needed money too because I was promised to get paid back a long time ago for something that my parents wanted me to pay for one of my sisters to have. Although I didnt mean to say it in a pretty "douchey" way, I admit in my opinion, I was kinda the asshole for that because of the way I said it, and that pissed of my mom mildly and I did try to apologize for that. A while later, I overheard my mom telling my dad about what I said and he was like, "well he just doesn't know how to talk to people".  Even though he was right about that, this really saddened me because for a huge majority of my life, I always had a problem with making friends and being social in general. I would either push people away or I was just too scared to be social because of fear of pushing people away. When I got home from getting something to eat, I overhear my mom talking about me, saying to my dad in a angry manner "I hope he never talks to me again for the rest of the day" or something like that. This made me mad because i felt like what I said was a simple mistake and I was sorry about that.   Later that day, I was searching up therapists because I wanted to fix my social skills and better myself as inspired of what just happened. I asked my dad what insurance do we have and he is all confused on why I'm searching up therapists. He then comes back downstairs getting upset at only me and instead of trying to get me help, he gives me a long talk and says to me "you need to stop being so soft about everything". He then mentions about how he thinks I'm ridiculous for refusing to buy my mom something (even though I NEVER FUCKING SAID I WOULDN'T BUY HER ANYTHING), how he and my mom spend over thousands of dollars worth of items for me, proceeds to call me stingy and says I will be stingy to my "future wife and kids", says "are you gonna kill yourself if you go out there and someone calls you a racial slur???", and then talks about the bible.   During all that, I tried to tell him that what he was saying had nothing to do with anything and I do provide for the family, but he just shuts me up. Needless to say, he thought that this whole speech he made would help me while in reality it only made me feel even worse about myself and it only made me even more afraid talk to people.  P.S: Now even though I'm posting this on this subreddit, i dont think my parents are abusive or anything like that and they do most definitely love me. But I just believe that I am being very misunderstood and feel like I can't talk to them about anything.	1642963621.0	sb0nim	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0nim/aita_for_being_soft/	AITA for being "soft"
bgxj0pv4	It sounds bad but hear me out. I live on a campus where there’s around 30 washing machines for 4,000 students, so not many. So when I decided to do my washing today I knew there probably wouldn’t be one free.   When I got there, one had just finished up so I decided to wait until the person came to collect their clothes. After twenty five mins of waiting I just decided to place their clothes on the floor and leave.

hzlm9f5y	Context (read before replying as I may be TA!!): It’s my(23M) birthday in 2 weeks. I haven’t got a clear plan but I’ve mentioned a few times I’m thinking of doing a party and going drinking in the evening with mine and my partners friends on my birthday. I was hoping that in the daytime my partner would spend the day with me and assumed that was a given until now. (I may be TA for assuming my partner would spend the day with me on my birthday). My partner(22F) found out today that her sister (who’s birthday is a few days prior to mine) is hosting her party on my actual birthday.   Her and her family aren’t close anymore and they do not yet know about our relationship of 1.5 years since the family won’t approve of my ethnicity. She’s close with her sister though, and really doesn’t want to miss her birthday.   So, my partner wants to attend her sisters party in the daytime and be back in the evening to celebrate my birthday with me, so effectively I’ll be alone all day until the evening of my birthday, unless I spend the day at my parents(not something I hoped to do!!). I do appreciate she wants to come back in the evening to join my party but AITA for being slightly annoyed over her being gone the rest of the day?	1642965240.0	sb1aqd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1aqd/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_partner_is_going/	AITA for being annoyed that my partner is going to her sisters party on my birthday?
enfrv5s8	My dad owns his own business and as you might imagine, it has been affected by the pandemic, which has caused him to struggle a bit financially.  Now, I live on my own, but since I am WFH, I decided to stay with my parents for a little (like 2 or so months) just because being isolated was tearing me apart. So, I have been here since December and will be leaving mid Feb. This is important because I don't want anyone telling me to move out. I have already done that and live very far away from them.  Now, onto the story. Today we went to visit a relative who has been ill, they are extremely wealthy but humble people. The topic of office work came up, and my mom said that I work almost all the time and she see's it first hand, to which my dad responded by saying: "Yeah, that's not good. Some people work all these hours whereas with me, I get to work some days and while others are working, I get to relax and sleep all day". That pissed me off badly because every person that has ever helped him are people who work regular 8-5 jobs, this relative and myself included.  The reason why this pissed me off is because since I have been here, I have helped them financially, I helped buy xmas groceries, monthly groceries, I have helped pay for fuel, I have paid for outings. My parents have paid me back, but the point is, my 8-5 job and stable income is what helped me help them. I know where the next loaf of bread is coming from, but there have been times where they have not so his comment was pretty disgusting, IMO.  The relative has helped my parents with funds when my dad was in hospital sick with Covid because why? my dad had not a penny in savings.   I find my dads comment to be sickening, a kick in the face, and outright disrespectful.   My mother tried to cover up for him by saying that "he just talks without thinking" and "you're hearing this today, I have heard him pick on office works my whole life" which I get, but my mother makes everything about her and by this point, I was mad because not only are they both self centered, but my dad has been pretty pathetically behaved for the past few weeks.  AITA for actually just avoiding them altogether and being so pissed off with my dads comments that I won't speak to him other than, "hello"? I would leave earlier but that will cause me to spend funds on my CC.	1642965287.0	sb1bdn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1bdn/aita_for_being_short_with_my_dad_after_his/	AITA for being short with my dad after his pathetic comment about office workers?
flbuy50y	 Hi Reddit, I will try to make this as short as possible and include all the details necessary to the story. My boyfriend David (21/M) and I (21/F) live in a small one bedroom apartment. In June of 2021, my friend Cindy (19/F) moved in with us as she was in a tough spot after her and her partner broke up because she was not in speaking terms with her parents and used to live with her partner. She did not have the means to get a place of her own, so we allowed her and her cat to move into our den. David and I are both pretty introverted and like our alone time, so it was not ideal to have Cindy move in but we did want to help her out.  She is set to move back in with her parents in about a week as they have made up.   Fast forward to last night. It was about 10:30 pm and David and I were out to dinner with my other friend A and her parents.  When I go to the bathroom, I see that Cindy has texted me asking if I am home followed by “SOS”. Cindy had gone to a night club with her boyfriend, John and her friend Leslie.        Thinking she may be in danger I texted her back asking if she was okay. She then texted me back stating that Leslie thought she may have left a hair straightener on in our apartment and was laughing about it and not taking it seriously at all and Cindy was unsure what to do.       I told her that David and I wouldn’t be home for a while so to please go back and make sure the straighter was not left on especially because my puppy and her cat were in the apartment. Furthermore, Cindy’s name is not on the lease. We are not supposed to have 3 people living here, so David and I would take the fall for any repercussions from a potential fire starting due to the straightener being left on.       I began to panic and realized that the restaurant we were at was much closer to our home than the night club so I texted Cindy again and told her that David and I were going to go back and make sure it wasn’t on. My puppy is one of the most important things in my life and is my emotional support animal for my generalized anxiety disorder so the thought of something happening to him and Leslie laughing about it and not taking it seriously, made me see red. On top of this, there could’ve been a fire!        This is where I may be the asshole. In my rage, I told Cindy that Leslie was not welcome in our apartment any longer. My boyfriend, brother and my friend, A all agreed with this decision but I felt really guilty after this. David and I did have to leave our dinner early though which was annoying. Thankfully, the straightener was not left on and our pets and apartment were just fine.   I texted Cindy again and told her it was actually okay if Leslie stayed the night and that I was just very upset that something could’ve happened to our animals and property, and hearing that Leslie was laughing about it really ground my gears. I told her I had calmed down and rationalized and knew that Leslie kind of just acts this way. She never answered and her, her boyfriend and Leslie all got a hotel.

iy3f0l1s	   Am I (22M) the asshole for using my brother's (23M) debit card in the way I did? So the other night I bought an expensive bottle of Mead. The kind I bought was roughly 40 dollars tax included, it could probably only fill about four full glasses and I decided to treat myself to some. My brother wanted some and decided to try opening it after I failed to already. I told him before he opened it that if he wanted to share it that he would have to buy me a bottle the next day for us to share. He agreed and opened it and the cork fell right in, meaning no putting away the mead for later it would have to be drunk tonight. Now I'm not mad  at him for dropping the cork in but I did half-jokingly say that now he  definitely has to buy my mead, since we had to finish the bottle that night.  The next day I walk downstairs and ask him if I can have his debit card. He said no not right now. I  was beginning to explain to him that I was already going out for groceries and that I knew he had the money for it, but I was interrupted by him doing a childish mocking of my  explanation and voice. I honestly don't know what comes over him sometimes, it felt so out of nowhere. What really miffs me about it is that he doesn't do it to anyone else and it really feels like he only does his act when he just wants me to shut up. It wasn't funny and I wasn't in the mood since he owed me a bottle of mead anyway. Now if he had some kind of good explanation for why he didn't want me to take his card then I was willing to hear it but he kept going on with his act so I just said fine whatever I'll just buy it myself. As I was getting up to leave he told me I could take his card, so obviously he didn't have any reason to deny me the card in the first place other than to be a controlling and annoying ass.  As I drove to the liquor store I realized it was Sunday and decided to stop by Meier's. Grocery stores don't stock mead so I bought other alcohol: a bottle of Kahlua, a bottle of chocolate liquor (both on sale), that altogether totaled around 36 bucks. I then had to grab gas and decided that since I was under budget anyways to just grab myself a little cheeseburger at speedway for 2 bucks. When I got home he blew up on me for using his card for the cheeseburger. I can't make this up. I kept everything within budget but because I bought a cheeseburger he'll never trust me with his card again. I won't lie I definitely felt like using his card to just buy all the groceries and gas but I knew that this would be too far. I yelled back and told him that he insulted me and that I still got no apology for earlier. He seems to think that since he was just joking that I have no grounds asking for an apology. I admit I probably didn't help my case when I told him that he shouldn't trust his card with somebody he was just being an asshole to, and I told him thanks for the cheeseburger and closed his door on him. I'll accept being an asshole for that last part, but what about the rest?	1642966493.0	sb1s5n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1s5n/aita_for_using_my_brothers_credit_card_on/	AITA for using my brothers credit card on something we did not agree on?

ek238595	So my dads side of the family gave him a surprise birthday but my mom didn’t go. My dad told me to say that my mom was at work (lie). After drinks and going back to the house to celebrate more a family member put me aside and asked where my mom was, complaining that all the family travelled down but my mom wasn’t there to celebrate my dads birthday. I said my mom was at work and we spoke more and I said something along the lines of my mom and dad being different personalities etc so they don’t get on the best. I was a bit drunk but still fully conscious of what I was saying. I didn’t think it was a big deal until I told my mom today and she blew up in my face for like 20 mins and won’t stop talking about how I embarrassed her in front of the side of the family that she doesn’t want to be apart of (she’s made this clear numerous times with words and actions). I can see her view but I also think that it’s not my fault that my parents don’t like each other it’s just a situation that I’m forced to deal with as I did then.

So, I continued messaging them, then they started messaging Frankie. I'll talk about that later, but they had said to me after the whole thing went down "Frankie is stupid anyways, and I should've known it was a bad choice to be friends with you and shouldn't have" and then blocked me.

imhdt55v	My brother and I bought a house 4 years ago with our trust fund. I sold my half to him so he's supposed to pay me $400 a month for 15 years. Im unemployed and 4 months ago he said that he won't pay me unless I have a job. I mostly agree with that.  I have a 2004 dodge Dakota thats been giving my trouble for a long time, and I just keep pouring money into it. The check engine light started flashing a couple weeks ago and I took it to auto zone to have it scanned and it turns out the engine is misfiring. They said it is one thing out of 2 things. The ignition coil or the spark plugs. Im fairly certain they arent the spark plugs because they were just changed. My mom suggested I should trade my truck into the dealership. She said she would lend me some money to pay for a newer vehicle that wouldn't have as many problems.   She also said she was gonna ask my brother for the 4 payments of $400 dollars that could help me pay for a new car so I could go back to work. My dad and my brother know a bit about cars. My dad thinks I should keep driving it even with the check engine light on and I know my brother will think the same. I did some research online and every article I've read says its very dangerous to drive with a flashing  check engine light, so im not gonna drive it.

iullnbfr	Throwaway account.   I am in highschool with little to no idea what I want to do with my life. My parents are VERY adamant about going to college as they both went and had amazing experiences. My older brother chose a different option that they are proud of(after they eventually gave up on him going to college)   But it's gotten to the point where I can't stand to talk about college or even want to go.   I get pretty good grades, more A's and B's but this isn't enough to my mom.   "Not good enough if you want to go to college, do better. I did better." Always something along those lines. They are always pushing for me to take classes that will look good. I do love school and think college could be a possible option but it's too soon to tell.   And I don't want to pay thousands of dollars for a mid job and be stuck in debt for the rest of my life like my cousin is. I don't know what I want to do with my life and I'm still young.   But that's all they talk about. I can't stand it at this point. I'm tired of all of it. I want to be able to decide my own path.   Now I may be the AH here.   After my mom said I had to go I snapped back saying "You can't force me to go unless you pay for all of it" and that pissed her and made her livid. I feel bad but she's stubborn and always makes sure to bring up every little mistake I've made.

5786deh2	My (28f) friend “Marissa” (29f) thoughtfully bought me a ticket to a concert as a birthday gift. The thing is that I already had a ticket for this concert, as im a huge fan of the act and acted quickly as soon as I saw tickets were on sale. I was excited at the thoughtfulness of the gift and was reluctant to tell her I had a ticket to that show already. I claimed the extra ticket in my Ticketmaster account and pondered what to do with it. Having an extra ticket to a now sold-out show, I sold the extra ticket to another friend of mine “Sophie” who could no longer get one due to it being sold out online. She was grateful for the ticket and paid me the face value cost of it, and now Sophie can attend the show with Marissa and I. I also needed the money at the time. So, Everyone wins, right?   About a month later the concert got cancelled. Since I did not buy the ticket, the refund is going back to Marissa’s card, since she was the original purchaser. She hasn’t said anything about keeping the refund for my gift, but I have a feeling she may. I am in a bind now, because my friend Sophie would like the money back for the ticket since the concert is cancelled, and rightfully so, I’m happy to give it back to her. However, I’m concerned Marissa is keeping the refund for the ticket, essentially taking back my gift. WIBTA if I asked Marissa for the money back, so I could refund Sophie?	1642972056.0	sb3ww6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb3ww6/wibta_if_i_asked_for_the_refunded_money_back/	WIBTA if I asked for the refunded money back?

55ltj36l	I’ll be 26 weeks pregnant tomorrow and  this my husband and I’s first child. Since finding out I was pregnant we decided to not find out the baby’s sex. We wanted to be surprised. Unfortunately, I needed an unexpected ultrasound in DR back in December (everything ended up fine) and the doctor blurted out the sex of the baby before I could say “don’t tell me.” Thankfully my husband couldn’t be in the room per COVID restrictions so he didn’t hear her. We decided that I’d keep the sex a secret so he can be surprised and my surprise will be seeing his reaction, so it still feels special for me too. As of now, the only people who know are my doctors, myself, and my therapist.    Eventually, word got around in my family that I know but am not telling anyone. My paternal grandparents are not happy with my decision and have made multiple comments, to my parents and to me, that they’re baffled by it. My brother also wants to know and won’t let it go. He’s very conservative (yet also gay?) and strongly believes in gender binaries.   Today, he said that he doesn’t understand why I won’t tell everyone and said that I’m “keeping it” from them. I got fed up and asked, “what will change if you know what’s between my child’s legs right now? Will you love them any less or more?” He went on about how he just wants to be able to envision the future and know if we’re gonna have a little baseball player or a little ballerina. Even though he was never a sporty or active boy and our sister was never a girly girl? He and I got into a long conversation (surprisingly it didn’t get too heated) about sex vs gender and society’s expectations. Basically, he feels that nature shapes males’ and females’ interests/personalities and I feel that that society puts us into boxes and imposes interests/certain personality traits onto us. In the end, I know that I did stump him a few times but it hurt my feelings a little when he said I was keeping people from getting excited and getting to know the baby.

6p8ew	36m and she's 36f.  We have been friends for nearly 20 years and are strictly platonic.  I have a key to her house and permission to just walk into her room because she's terrible at getting up in the morning and she expects me to be her alarm.  About a week ago I walked into her room like normal only she is passed out with her sleeve rolled up and there was fentanyl on the bed.  She'd been clean for 2 years (unless you count methadone, people give her shit for that).  I told her I wasn't mad and I wasn't going to give her shit for it (I know relapsing is part of recovery) but I also wasn't going to let her just keep it.  So I took the bags and flushed them.  She's telling me I over reacted and it's ok and that she needed it until she could talk to her counselor about raising her dose.  I asked her how long she was using and she told me a week  (She's been acting strange for about 2 months now, so I don't really believe this).  And now she's trying to guilt trip me by saying it's my fault she's going to be sick and have to call out of work.  I'm sure I could've handled it better but I really don't know what else I could've done.  AITA	1642974909.0	sb51bs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb51bs/aita_for_flushing_drugs/	AITA for flushing drugs?
iy8p1pmq	I (36F) am moving halfway across the country to live with the man I love. My bro (34M) and I always got along pretty well, but have become less close ever since he got married to my SIL (29F). I used to think she's just quiet and gave her the benefit of the doubt, but in the past few months she became actively rude: isolating herself at family gatherings, ignoring me and even rolling her eyes when I talk, and being disagreeable and moody at family events. She has a pattern of saying she feels left out when my mom and older sister hang out without them, but then she acts the way I described above when we include her. Lately my bro has become less social and more rude, too. My family has a group chat where we share pictures and updates in our lives, but bro and SIL rarely participate in it.  I have been planning my move across the country for some time now, and I regularly post updates about my new house/job search in the group chat (which again, bro and SIL basically just ignore). Last week, I decided it was time to finally take the plunge and plan my move. I updated my family in the group chat, telling them I am officially moving at the end of the month. On Tuesday, I texted again in the group chat that I want to see my family this weekend. In my text, I also acknowledged that I understand my bro and SIL might not be able to make it, since they live 5ish hours away. As per usual, everyone responded except the two of them.  My family (minus bro and SIL) all got together this weekend. It was really fun, we celebrated my move, and my mom had the idea to include bro and SIL by having a video chat with them. During the video call, they both acted surprised that I'm pushing my move earlier, and asked me questions about the move - things everyone else already knew from participating in the group chat. After just 30 minutes  they said they had to go bc they "needed to cook dinner" (at 4pm).   That night, SIL texted me (in a chat with just me and my bro) saying that she's glad my celebration went well and wishing me luck on my move. THEN she texted again saying she "didn't realize" the gathering this weekend was my sendoff party, and that they would have "tried to come" if they had known. I explained that I hadn't planned for it to be a party, and that the whole thing kind of just came together at the last minute. My bro responded by saying that regardless of how it came together, it's weird that I didn't want the whole family to be there for our last get together. I told them I'm sorry that they feel bad about their decision not to come, but that it was pretty clear from the group chat that this would be the last time they saw me before my move. It has been 8 hours since I texted them that and they haven't responded.

ijvm0vcm	My (20f) boyfriend (20m) and I broke up last week but kept in contact as friends. We're in some weird limbo and still like each other so I will refer to him as my bf for simplicity. Sorry for the long post ahead, I'm really unsure.  Before and after we broke up, we have been arguing about me playing a game without him and interacting with guys in the game. He could have joined in, and the guys were our mutual friends, but because him and I had an argument with someone within that group, my bf no longer wants to interact with them. The guy we argued with who I'll call 'Bob' threatened violence against me (but we're all online friends so he had no way of actually doing it) and cut off our other mutual friends for petty reasons. He hasn't apologized to either of us but I like our other friends. The mutual friends Bob cut off have also became friends with him again and I don't want to lose them just because of Bob. I am still very wary of Bob and have my own boundaries against him. He has been friendly and I am unwilling to start drama again. Bob invited me to join a group chat with the other mutual friends and I accepted. This caused an argument with my bf.  I didn't tell him I joined the group chat because he had been upset when I hung out with guys online before (we're long distance). The game I play is filled with mostly dudes, I don't actively go and find only guys to play with.  Well my bf found out and started warning me on how Bob was a bad person, before saying "don't say I didn't warn you when this goes wrong". He then proceeded to ask WHY I joined Bob's chat. I didn't really have a reason. I did it just cause. The few reasons I could think of was I wanted to hang out with my friends again (bf used to get upset when I joined calls that weren't with him), and I wanted to do things with them in game that I wasn't strong enough to do myself.  My bf got upset at all these reasons and started saying I was lying because I didn't make an effort to ask my friends to help me. But I did ask, they said no politely and I got stronger and now I can mostly do things myself. I told my bf that and he got pissed and said I was contradicting myself because if I'm strong enough, why did I join in the first place. This went on and every reason I gave, my bf found a way to 'debunk'. I was upset and felt like I was being interrogated. I can keep myself safe and I haven't been interacting with Bob much anyways. I asked my bf to stop as he was upsetting me but he didn't.  After this argument, he told me that he didn't feel safe sharing his feelings with me anymore.  AITA? I could be the AH for interacting with someone who was rude to both of us and for not telling my bf when I joined his group chat.	1642975400.0	sb58jn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb58jn/aita_for_making_my_boyfriend_feel_unsafe_when/	AITA for making my boyfriend feel unsafe when sharing his feelings with me?
gzbylhbz	When we moved in, my roommate asked if they (22) could bring a chair into our apartment, which is fully furnished. Of course I said yes, and the other roommates also agreed (19m)+(19m). Once seeing the chair, it was very clear it was dirty, full of holes, and overall looked like something goodwill wouldn't even sell. It was also a 6ft long chair, which we barely had room for.  That one roommate also brought couches and a lot of other things that crowd the front room. They refused to put it in their room, claiming there isn't room. We all said fine about it being in the front room and just moved on. They never sat on the chair or even attempted to clean it or make it look acceptable, They promised they would.   After 8 months of no one ever using the chair, and after them not working out other options for the chair with us, I decided to break the chair a bit more. I weakened the middle support beam to break if anyone sits on it. My other roommates helped break it and give suggestions, on how we could fix the situation.  My fourth roommate, the one that got the chair out of the trash, doesn't know about it yet. To avoid problems, I plan on sitting on it when they're around and hoping it breaks. I don't want them to get injured, but we all hate the chair. Not to mention, we have a really nice chair that everyone likes that is currently in storage bc the broken one.  AITA for breaking the chair further?

171wo3	Hi guys! This is something I've been mulling over for about a month now, I want a bit of outside perspective since I keep going back and forth on whether I was in the wrong or not.  So Jay is my partner, Rex is the roommate and Claire is Rex's girlfriend. With that in mind, Claire joined us in our apartment a few weeks after we moved in, and has since become what I would call a "permanent guest". She lives here, but she's not on the lease and doesn't pay for anything in the apartment for the group except tide pods for laundry. However, she does clean around the house which has been very welcome and only with a few hiccups that got ironed out.  Our biggest issue came up in December, when Jay and I wanted to get two month old kittens-- we wanted a kitten, but for their health we decided it was better for their social development to get a bonded pair. Rex has allergies but we made sure to clear everything up with him, we would keep an eye on their shedding and keep them in the master bedroom for the most part. Claire, however, was very against the idea of more than one cat. She asked us to get only one cat to start with, give it a few weeks, and then she would decide if she was okay with a second cat. She said this was because she thought that two cats would be much more of a mess than one, and she was anxious about that. But she also refused our solution of keeping the kittens in the master because she "didn't want to do that to them."   This didn't sit right with me and Jay. With the gradual cat solution, she could decide at any point that we couldn't get a cat and we were just SOL. That meant that we would have only one kitten in March when the lease is up, about six or seven months old, which would make it much more difficult to have them socialized with another cat.  So after informing them that we would still be getting two kittens and keeping them in our room, the argument continued in full force, and only ended after a few hours when I brought up the fact that the lease was ending in a few months anyway and this wouldn't be a long term issue.  We have the two kittens now, Claire refuses to go into the common room or even look at me (reminder that they live in our room and do not have access to common). There's no doubt that this could have been handled better. Every human in the house is neurodivergent and it makes open communication pretty difficult (Jay and I went ahead with the cats because Paige had dismissed the argument at some point and we thought we got through to her that we would not let them interfere with her life and were doing our best to make sure that she wasn't affected by them, so a miscommunication there), but right now I do stand by my decision, I just wanna make sure if that makes me an asshole or not.

We were planning to go out with his friends to celebrate his  birthday however due to the timings it falls during a period of important exams. Because of this, I am not allowed to attend the plans he had made as they are deemed “not as important” as my exams. Which to be honest, I agree with to a certain extent. The problem however, is that my boyfriend hasn’t tried to rearrange said plans, but instead created new ones for us on a separate day.

9rulihf6	My boyfriend and I got a dog in November. We both have allergies to pet dander and searched high and low for a low-shedding dog to adopt. My allergies are far, far worse than his - I’ve avoided spending the night at my parents’ house because they have 2 dogs and a cat and every time I’ve slept there, even with brand new clean sheets, I’ve stayed up the majority of the night sniffling, scratching, and nursing bad sinus migraines. Allergy medications help, but only for a couple of hours.  Our dog barely sheds, but he’s still not allowed on the couch or bed, and whenever my boyfriend and I play with him/hug him/carry him for longer than a couple of minutes we have to change/remove our clothes before getting in the bed. We’ve been consistent about this and my allergies are manageable. Recently, though, we noticed that our dog is shedding more than usual - not a scary amount, but about the amount you’d expect from other dogs. We think it’s because we moved recently and he could be a little stressed trying to adjust to the change.  Earlier today my boyfriend was holding our dog in his lap because we were clipping his nails, and when we finished his clothes (and mine) were covered in dog fur. I told him I was going to throw our clothes in the wash. He replied that he wasn’t getting in bed so he wasn’t gonna change and he was gonna do some work in his office. I was kind of worried that he’d forget but he reassured me that he wouldn’t. A couple of hours later I saw him in bed with his dog fur-covered clothes still on. I told him that I had to wash the sheets. He replied, “are you fucking serious???” and got out of bed super pissed. I told him that he could just use the duvet without a cover and he could still be comfortable but he refused and stormed to his office.  I kinda think he’s pouting but I do feel bad because he was comfortable in bed and I had to wash the sheets because of my high-maintenance allergy.

ggu3y8d8	I had a friend I’ve known for about 5 years that I felt like was always jealous of me (I’ll call her “R”). She would text me saying that boys I’ve hooked up with in the past were now texting her in a sarcastic tone (it has happened more than once and with different people).  A while back, I went out with her and we ran into a guy (I'll call him Jim) that I had been seeing for a while and had feelings for. He and I had a good time, and right after we went home, she followed him on Instagram. I told her it bothered me and asked her not to do it again.  A couple of weeks later me and R and at the end of the night I asked her if she had talked to Jim, and she said they’ve only talked about word - keep in mind that I told her I liked him, and asked her to keep some respectful distance. She was never going to tell me about it if I haven’t asked.  I ended up telling her that I felt that she was always competing for men with me, and when they (eventually) hit on her, she would thought it was funny and text me about it to tease me.  She responded by saying that she didn't think it was important to tell me about the conversation with Jim, and that all my friends who agreed with me were as childish as I was and blocked me on all social networks.  I don't like to get into conflicts, but considering that this situation had been bothering me for a long time and repeated itself often, I decided to speak up.  So, Reddit.

This affection is something I am not comfortable with. I will be honest and say that I never liked being touched by anyone but my friends. It's my personal mentality that I only let people who I have chose as people in life a.k.a. my friends, as people who can hug me or kiss me etc.  On the other thank, my dad(M58) is really touchy. He likes to tickle me(sometimes accidentally groping my breasts), hit my butt, etc. He does this to everyone in our house, my brother and my mother, but I, personally, hate it and try to stay away from him just because of this.

4dpcn00q	Ok, this isn't a real big issue but it does cause a minor argument everytime it happens so I wanted opinions.  My wife NEVER locks the bathroom door and then yells at me when I walk in without knocking.  My children both lock the door when they shower or use the can (as do the majority of people I spend any personal time around).  I wouldn't care but she actually gets angry with me about it and stays a little grumpy for an hour or so afterwards each time it happens.  If I mention it when it happens it starts a "knock vs lock" argument that will lead to her getting mad again.  We keep the bathroom door closed as the default state or our cat will get in and shred the TP.  And just so readers know,  It doesn't happen very often.  I know it's a silly thing to argue about.

iyd6jnbr	I (16F) live with my dad (50M) and siblings. My dad constantly whines when I ask him to drive me somewhere or pick me up from somewhere. I've gotten tired of putting up with it and have started to snap back at him and get upset when he does so.   Almost a year ago, the frame support beams to my bed broke, so I basically sleep on a mattress on the floor that happens to have a frame around it. There is a bed waiting to be built (which I am OK with building by myself) but in order to build it I need to clean out my room and closet, which requires storage bins. For the past 4 or 5 days I've been asking if we could go to the store to get storage bins for my clutter as well as a mattress for my bed. Every morning I ask he agrees and sets a time, and when the time rolls around, he either pushes it back and it ends up being too late, or he says "I'm tired/I don't want to go rn, tomorrow". Today he said he wanted to watch a soccer game, so I snapped back at him, arguing that I cleaned the whole fridge and kitchen today, that I never ask him for a lot, and that I am sick of him being lazy.  He also complains about picking me up from school. My house is only a 20 min walk, but it is somewhere between 20-10F everyday and very windy. It only takes 5 mins to drive from the house to my school, but he is always about 20 mins late without fail. When he gets there he apologizes and says that he was "watching the game".  Keep in mind, I cannot drive yet, and none of my siblings can drive me. I am not asking to go on a shopping spree for clothes, I am asking for essentials. I do most of the chores in the house- I keep things clean and cook most dinners, so it's upsetting that I don't get respect back in return. I've brought this up to him calmly many times- but he always either comes up with excuses, turns it on me, or makes empty promises.   The reason I feel bad being harsh on him is because he has major depression and I know it's hard for him to complete things. Often I will give him a day or a couple hours to push things back if he is really not feeling up to it because I know how it feels. I know he struggles, but it hurts me because it feels like my needs are a burden for him.

iyfsavyz	  I (M15) lost my dad 3 years ago in a car accident, mom remarried to my now stepdad and I had to move in with my 4 stepsiblings. I don't get along with any of them. I don't have friends at school either, except for my best friend "Jordon". He is like my bro because he helped me out so much in the past by giving me his clothes and schoold supplies after my stepsiblings damaged mine.   His birthday was a week ago, my stepdad said I couldn't go and didn't say why, I explained to him how important this was for me and my friendship with Jordon and even begged mom to say something but stepdad said no meant no and forbade me from attending.   I resorted to sneaking and made it just in time for the party, but obviously one of my stepsiblings snitched on me because my stepdad suddenly showed up at Jordon's house. When I saw him I froze in my spot then I took off runnining from the back door, he was upset but didn't chase after me or anything. I went home and stayed in my room til he returned. He scolded me and talked about how I disobied his rules and inatructions and when I asked him to specify why he didn't want me to attend, he said no specific reason. In fact no reason at all. He went on about how wrong it was for me to run and embarrass him infront of the other parents but I did it because I was afraid of him. And I know that he found out via my stepsiblings who told on me. Literally no one the house loves me except for my cat.  Needless to say I got grounded for both attending then running out and mom sided with stepdad saying this is what I got myself into and I need to deal with it.

iye89ju6	I (20F) was hanging out with my friend (20F) when we heard her brother (24M) crying. We went to investigate, and realized he was crying over a girl he was attracted to. He is neurodiverse and hasn’t had much luck with women. The girl rebuffed him months ago, and just now, he saw a picture on her Instagram kissing her new girlfriend. So he was crying bc he feels it seems like more women are  into other women nowadays so he’s worried he won’t find a straight woman for himself. He’s a very respectful guy and he wouldn’t harass a woman, but I feel bad for him. So my friend made some insensitive comments to her brother like “Men are honestly worthless” and “You may have to accept being alone forever.” I was appalled that she didn’t want to comfort him so I told her “You’re a horrible sister. Apologize to him now!” She got defensive and said her brother deserves honesty. I said “Your brother needed kinder words and you had an opportunity to build him up and you blew it!” She said “What, you want me to lie to him?” I rolled my eyes at her and comforted her brother saying “You’re a great guy! You WILL find a girl and she will be lucky to be with you!” I offered him a hug to cheer him up and asked if I could go buy him candy or ice cream. After I left my friend’s house, I thought hard about whether I still want to be this girl’s friend after observing how she treated her brother.   Was I the asshole for chastising my friend for insulting her brother when he was already very upset?	1642984967.0	sb8rcw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8rcw/aita_for_scolding_my_friend_for_being_rude_to_her/	AITA for scolding my friend for being rude to her brother?
6lqcd137	Yesterday, I took my son (8M) to Starbucks for breakfast. He wanted a cake pop, but I said “No, that isn’t a breakfast food. You can get the oatmeal, breakfast sandwich, or something healthier.” He argued and said he wanted a special breakfast. He ended up agreeing to the oatmeal and we paid and sat down. While we were eating and talking at the table, my husband called and I stepped out to answer (yes my son was alone at the table during that time). Apparently while I was away, a young woman (looking to be in her late 20s/early 30s) bought one for him, walked to our table, and handed him a cake pop. So when I came back to him eating the cake pop, I was startled and said “Where did you get that from?” He pointed to the woman a few table away, and I walked over to her, she appeared a little scared. She said “I wanted to be nice. Sorry for your disappointment.” I said “I’m trying to teach my son healthy habits.” I then gently lifted her chin up so she could look me in the eye and said “You should NEVER be taking over a stranger’s parenting duties.” She said “You’re ruining my breakfast. I want to eat in peace.” I shook my head and walked back to our table.”   AITA for telling the woman she shouldn’t have slipped my son a cake pop?	1642986600.0	sb9bue	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9bue/aita_for_berating_a_stranger_for_sneaking_my_son/	AITA for berating a stranger for sneaking my son sweets for breakfast?
5940jxqi	I (F21) work for a small company as an accounting assistant, and primarily report to S (F46), the main accountant. Usually when I am absent, like twice before (once due to my school and once due to a family medical emergency), I would firstly email the HR, cc S, then a separate email to S.  My mistake was emailing the HR, and i completely forgetting to cc and email S separately. Prior to this I had the task of scanning/renaming/attaching the invoices of the previous and current fiscal year (about 5 months worth of invoices).   I go to work the following Monday to find out how she basically used the whole weekend to scan/rename/attach and file back the invoices. I felt bad as that was quite the lot, and I had already done half of it. She never informed me about anything of urgency, not on Monday or the previous Thursday. When I asked her why,she lashed out on me saying that I "never" inform her when I'm absent, and that she got super upset so she went ahead and did everything. Then she refused to delegate any tasks here. I can't help but feel guilty, I felt so overwhelmed too as I was looking to have a relatively pleasant day as the following day is  my birthday. Be honest to me, AITA?  Some background info that may change your views regardless of whether or not I'm the AH:  - I entered the field with 0 experience. In S' words, I learned to use 2 accounting softwares in 3 months, which took her a year to get used to.  - I used to make a lot of mistakes, and most of them were careless. Like getting the date wrong. There are no excuses to this but I personally blame it on the lack of sleep (I sometimes do 200+ invoices, I work a 9hr job and have lectures for 3 hrs, then I proceed to study for 2-3 hrs)  - She was never really nice to me. On earlier days S would give no tasks, so I would decide to use my phone. Id be 2 min into using my phone and she'd stand behind me, fuming. She still wouldn't give me any tasks.  - She specifically greets everyone in the morning but me. I used to greet her until she did something disrespectful, and I briefly stopped it too.  - The aforesaid being that her deep dislike towards me really showed once, during christmas. I bought gifts for everyone and she did not even turn towards me when I called to hand her present. I left it at her table and she left without taking it. Next working day, she's earlier than usual, arrives before me to work. The present is not on her table. She does not carry a bag big enough to  carry the present. I get it if she dislikes me, but I would've much rather preferred she passing the gift back to me, instead of trashing it.  - She and a few other colleagues speak a different language. I am unfamiliar but I know a few terms. The others are nice enough not to reciprocate, but she refers to me in terms that basically meant fat/ugly/idiot, etc.	1642988298.0	sb9wd5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9wd5/aita_for_making_my_reporting_personnel_do_the/	AITA for "making" my reporting personnel do the filing?
gnhrkzml	I'm autistic. I struggle to understand how my actions make other people feel. That does not mean I don't care how my actions make people feel. I quite often need it explained to me when I've said/done something wrong but that doesn't mean I'm not genuinely sorry once I understand how I fucked up.  Today, like most days, I fucked up. I said something stupid and upset my husband. I go semi non verbal when I upset someone because I get upset and angry with myself.   My husband and I are really close with another couple. She's one of my best friends, she's also probably my husband's best friend too. She's been on the receiving end of my tactlessness and she's close with my husband so when I've upset my husband he quite often vents to her, sometimes to both of them. He tells them what I've done and how I've made things worse. I hate it when he does this but I get it, I can be a lot to deal with and he has a right to talk to his friends about things that upset him. Particularly when I'm too socially incompetent to actually give an appropriate response.  Im sitting there, semi verbal consumed with self loathing because I've fucked up yet again and I notice my husband is smirking. He shows me his phone and it's a picture of a monkey with an exaggerated frown and downturned mouth. He explains he was telling our friend I was "sulking" and pulling the same face as the monkey.  I just burst into tears. Firstly, I feel like sulking is when you're angry at someone else, not when you're angry with yourself, so I wasn't sulking. Secondly, no one wants to be compared to a monkey. Thirdly, venting about me to his friends is one thing but mocking me is something else entirely.  He says he wasn't mocking me and that he showed me the picture to make me laugh and I'm overreacting.   So AITA for getting upset over the picture?	1642989221.0	sba7uj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sba7uj/aita_for_not_seeing_the_funny_side/	AITA for not seeing the funny side?
6216vw2z	I have a great relationship with my parents. They are my best friends and I love them to death. Having said that - they are very very bad with their finances. They've been having financial issues ever since I can remember. And then my father decided to become an entrepreneur with my mom working for him. It got so much worse, to the point that they went bankrupt quite a few times. I've always been there for them as much as I could. I've taken out loans to try to save them from eviction(unsuccessfully), kept contact with their debt collectors to try to get to a resolution(also unsuccessfully).  At the same time, I'm trying to build my own life, without feeling too much guilt over the fact that my parents aren't able to really get their own life together.  Now here comes the part I feel really guilty about: Me and my husband had planned our wedding and honeymoon, made the downpayment and sent the invites. About a month before the wedding we learned that my parents would be evicted for a second time in 2 years for not paying rent, on the day we were supposed to take our flight to an exotic destination for our honeymoon and a day after our wedding.   AITA for continuing the wedding and honeymoon? (Speaking only for myself, as I have unfortunately just discovered that my husband is narcissistic, so the decision was actually only made by 1 compassionate person)	1642989197.0	sba7kw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sba7kw/aita_for_organizing_a_wedding_and_going_on_a/	AITA for organizing a wedding and going on a honeymoon while my parents are evicted from their house
iyepua5e	I met this guy through friends and a club. We've known each other for about 3 years. Recently, he tried to walk me home, made desserts for me, and agreed to be my +1 at an event. He also asked me to watch movies with him this week.  Anyway, this was confusing me because I didn't know what his intentions were. I called him and asked him if he liked me. He sounded extremely relieved and said that he had liked me for 2 years but didn't have the courage to say so earlier.  He asked me to get dinner with him tomorrow to talk things over and I plan to open it up with telling him that he needs to be more forward with me, using the 2 year thing as an example.

4nehv39t	This is my (23f) first relationship while it is my boyfriends (25m) third or fourth. Last year, since it was my first Valentine’s, not only with him, but ever (because i was overweight and a bit ugly when I was younger) I was excited and looking forward to flowers or chocolates or something. However, I did not get a call from him all day until 4pm with him asking me what I wanted to do since it was Valentine’s Day. I was very angry with him because not only did he call super late to discuss this with me but he did not treat it like a special, romantic day. We ended up choosing the mall, which I didn’t want to go to since everything closed at 6pm due to it being Sunday. Everywhere else that was considered romantic (museums, botanical gardens, cafes) were closed. I dressed up very nicely and he showed up in sweats which angered me even more. Once we got in the car, I asked him why he wasn’t excited for Valentine’s Day to which he responded “well I’ve had like 8 Valentine’s Day and after a while they tend be the same” to which I replied “Well, this is my first Valentine’s Day ever…” and sobbed. He was very regretful and consoled me, bought me a smoothie, and apologized. There next day, he made a card out listing out 23 reasons (since my 23rd birthday was in the same month) why he loved me and bought me a bracelet. Ever since, he’s been the perfect boyfriend but the memory still stings enough to bring tears to my eyes even as I’m typing this. Since I felt like my first Valentine’s Day was robbed, I gave him a list of exactly what I wanted; flowers, a stuffed animal, chocolate, something personal, and a date that he plans out. I also told him that I didn’t want anything that says “Happy Valentine’s Day” since they were usually cheap store bought items and impersonal.  Now my question is, am I the asshole for the not doing anything for him since he wasn’t for it last year? Am I the asshole for listing out things I expect rather than cherishing whatever he gives me?	1642991558.0	sbb086	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbb086/aita_for_not_doing_anything_for_boyfriend_for/	AITA for not doing anything for boyfriend for Valentine’s Day but expecting a lot from him
4boy34xn	I had a hard time choosing a title for this but here’s some background info.  My (26F) husband (26M) has a close friend (25M) who has a history of pushing boundaries. Before he moved away he and my husband would hang out a lot and at times he behaved a little inappropriately toward me at least in my opinion, he was very physically affectionate and would comment on my looks a lot and I would feel uncomfortable. My husband called him out for it and put a stop to it, and he eventually ended up moving to another town with family.  They still hang out on discord and game together a lot, and lately he’s been wanting to debate politics on a regular basis. My husband has tried to express that he isn’t interested but the friend constantly brings these topics up, and belittles him when he disagrees with whatever his opinions are.  Recently the friend messaged me and said he wanted to send us a book that he thought we’d find interesting.  It came in the mail today, and it was actually a package containing two books, one for me and one for my husband. The book for my husband was about self improvement and solving creative problems. The book for me was about how women need to free themselves from oppression and the patriarchy.  I felt disgusted that any man should send me a book like that and expect me to feel grateful for it, while sending my partner a book on self improvement. It feels implicitly sexist under the guise of wokeness and now he’s asking if I’ve read it.  WIBTA if I just ignore this “gift”? I honestly don’t even want to acknowledge it but I don’t know how to address this.	1642991677.0	sbb1kb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbb1kb/wibta_if_i_ignore_a_friends_gift/	WIBTA if I ignore a friend’s “gift”?
ixkx3mjc	I live in an apartment with 5 flatmates. One is my roommate, who isn't living here right now, 2 are best friends and the other 2 are a couple. The best friends and the couple have been friends for a while, I'm a new addition to this apartment. Not that new, I've been here for almost a year now. But they've always been closer to each other than to me. I tried to be as friendly as possible, we're all students at the same university, we're in the same clubs. But I always felt this unsaid hostility from all of them.    Lately I noticed that they were excluding me out of things they were doing together. If everyone in the apartment was going out to play some sport, they wouldn't tell me and they'd just leave. They went to a beach together and told me they're just going out to eat. They would talk loudly and crack jokes but get quiet and stare at the ground when I'm around. They wanted me to hang out with them when they were ordering food or spending money, and I noticed it's so that they'd have to pay less since there's another person to split the bill with. But otherwise they'd never invite me to anything. I've heard them say my name a few times and when I ask they don't say anything. Today, they planned a vacation in front of me, involving all of them, but excluded me again.      I used my old phone to record their conversation after the nth time I found them silently staring at he ground when I walked into the room they were all together in. I left my phone behind the pillows of the couch and left the house. They talked about how glad they were that I'd left and how awkward I always am to them, how they wished they had a different flatmate and just need me to do the dishes and split bills. They called me weird and a few words that really hurt but then started planning how they'd ask me to help out with cooking dinner the next day.     When I got home and listened to it, I confronted them with it, and they said I was invading their privacy and being a shitty friend. I said they're the shitty ones for bitching about me and using me. They hounded me to delete the recording but I've kept it and I feel like I've gone overboard. But at least I know what they think of me. But I did invade their privacy, right?

i93lgpl	Hi y’all, this literally happened today.  I went to visit my sister at her home half an hour away. Before I left, my dad was freaking out saying the brakes don’t work. I was like dad, fuck it I’ll be fine, all good in the hood, I’ve done this for how long now, it’s my car, I’ll do what I want.  Went there with no issues. I’m used to my car. Got brake fluid with my sister with no issues. Paid for it, all good.  We went for a walk later. It was fucking freezing -11 and we ended up getting borderline lost. My sister started tripping balls and called her husband to come pick us up. She offered my car up to him without my asking me because their cars was filled with tons of shit (they’re moving).   You can probably see where this is going. He crashes it into a rock and the tire gets flat. No other damage on the car as far as I know.   So he tries to take responsibility and change the tire, my sister and I head home. She feels really guilty about telling him to come in my car. She started almost hyperventilating because she’s so cold from the weather. But that’s another story.   All that aside, later on she got kind of pissed at me. Saying it was irresponsible, she could have lost me and her husband, it’s coming from a place of care. I tell her I honestly had no idea my brakes were that bad. I also had no idea anyone else was going to drive it.  So am I the asshole?	1642992584.0	sbbblz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbblz/aita_for_having_bad_brakes/	AITA for having bad brakes?
8c2du33o	I very recently found out I was pregnant. I also just started a new position at a company's I have been with for awhile.   When I went for the job I specifically wanted the high pressure and stress because I find it to be satisfying. However, I know that kind of stress is not good for a growing baby. I'm also likely high risk due to health factors. My husband and I have tried to get pregnant for many years.   I am thinking about asking to going back to my old position. I feel like an asshole because my prior supervisor really promoted me and said I was great for the job to the hiring managers. I am worried to make him look like an idiot and to make myself look like an idiot for wasting time and resources.   I also learned that no one helps out if you're out of the office. Which is fine, but if I start getting sick and missing any kind of time I will be severely behind. I don't feel like I can give my all to this position, but I don't want to hurt someone who helped me.   It seems like the better option to go back to what I was doing prior to this for the sake of stress and the baby.	1642993965.0	sbbsdn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbsdn/wibta_if_i_try_to_step_down_from_new_job_position/	WIBTA If I try to step down from new job position?
3spn3lg2	Okay so my Ex Friend (23f) has a son (12 weeks at the time). For context my spouse and I both work in child care and have researched out the wazoo on the subject since we also want to have a child of our own. My spouse themself has 6+ years experience and is trained in the latest safety standards. We're also mandated reporters.   Since we were able to meet her son, who was born in COVID times, we've noticed a very obvious disregard to safety. For example, Ex Friend would put her son in environments that could lead to his suffocation. She has also handled him in ways that are concerning.   The son in question is a little more developed compared to kids his age, however, he's still a literal baby and safety and health guidelines are there for a reason.   Along with this, her son's dad is living with them (they're not married and, at the time, were broken up). He was accused of abusing the kid by Ex Friend (which I, personally, don't think is true but idk for sure). She also put a restraining order on him but it was lifted and she happily allowed him back in. He was also said to smoke pot around the baby.   We were already concerned about these issues, but to make matters worse she admitted to us that she was cheating the government. Basically, she was getting all kinds of benefits for being a single mom with low income. The truth is, however, that she wasn't a single mom nor was her income accurate. The dad was living there and helping with the son and money was being funneled to help her from him as well as her family. She also made more at her job than she said she did. The fraud could get her in a ton of trouble and she could lose her son.   My spouse and I decided to bring up our concerns to her because we were genuinely worried. As soon as I said the word 'concerns' she blew up at me and said we were abusing her kid (we've only seen him a handful of times though and it was with supervision besides two times when we babysitted him).   Also for context, Ex Friend has been diagnosed as a sociopath and has admitted to feeling nothing towards her son at times.   Ex Friend refused to listen to us and got defensive. Not knowing what else to do, we contacted the son's Grandma on the dad's side. She is a social worker and told us we should report it to CPS. We're also mandated reporters so we could get in a lot of trouble if we didn't report it. We figured that CPS would be the ones to decide if there was actually the case of neglect.  There was.  Ex Friend recieved a letter saying CPS was investigating her and immediately went off on us. She threatened to make sure we never worked in childcare again and would take legal action. We have screenshots of everything that she said that was concerning/her admitting if she did decide to take legal action. She now has us blocked on all social media accounts (which we expected).  So Reddit, AITA for having concerns about my ex friend's son's safety and calling CPS after not getting through to her?	1642994371.0	sbbx1r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbx1r/aita_for_calling_cps_on_ex_friend/	AITA for calling CPS on Ex Friend?
iyl7y2iq	I (50M) have a dog who’s nearly 15. He’s a husky and he’s been suffering but he’s gotten very bad within the past week. My wife (49F) absolutely loves our dog and would never want to put him down. She says that he can die naturally and it’s too expensive (300 for euthanization and 300 for cremation). My son doesn’t really have an opinion on this, and my daughter also doesn’t want the dog to get euthanized. Within the past week, he’s started whimpering at all times, can’t get up, poops blood, and pees his bed. Today, I took him to the vet while my wife was at work and euthanized him, and didn’t tell my wife till she got back from work. She says I’m selfish and inconsiderate for not telling her, but she always says no when I ask and suggest euthanization.

ixl9x43m	Hey, first time on reddit. I had a crush on a guy for the longest time & his name is Kyle. I don’t drive so my friend dropped me off at his house once as a favor. So Kyle met Lisa. Lisa used to be “ugly” growing up and suddenly glowed up in college and now battles through self esteem issues. Same here. Whenever I post Lisa on my story, guys slide up and call her cute. I screenshot and send to her to boost her confidence. Whenever I’m at a restaurant and guys are there glancing at our direction, I tell her “hey Lisa, they keep glancing at you” as opposed to “us”. I wanted to boost Lisa’s confidence because it’s what I do. Kyle finding other girls attractive is not a problem. I’m not insecure & in fact i am bisexual so I am usually turned on. Tee hee. I screenshotted a message Kyle sent and it was “She’s kinda cute” and sent it to her. Everytime we talk about him and my weird obsession with him, she brings up in an exaggerated manner “oH MY GOD, I remember when I dropped her off at his house, he literally called me cute and pretty, LIKE RIGHT INFRONT OF HER!!!” like what the fuck. After the 5th time, I took her home and told her “Literally, humble yourself and stop lying to people saying he was hitting on you.

9r0p9	I am a dog lover.  Had a dog for just shy of 20yrs.  He died 2yrs ago.  Since then I decided not to get another dog for the time being though I truly love dogs. I just don't want the responsibility right now and it would be unfair to a critter because of the hours I work.  My neighbor, who lives in the same house though we are separated by a long hallway which allows me to have my own apt, decided to get a dog.  She's never had one before and has no idea what she's doing.  So she had relied on me to coach her on how to do certain things.    At any rate her dog is a Chiwawa.  He's a cute little bugger and comes to see me every morning and evening for a treat.  Which I love and though he doesn't like anyone else he loves me.  On days she works he comes over and hangs out.  Then she started working some nights and he would come over and spend the night.  Here is where the trouble started.  When she comes home from working the night shift she would not come get him.  The first time she did it I was a little pissed.  I don't mind taking care of him while she's away but when she comes home I expect her to retrieve him, as it where, so that I don't have the responsibility of him.    I was very clear with her on this point.  Though I love him I don't have a dog right now for several reasons.  The main one being I don't want or need the responsibility.  It came to a head when he stayed the night 2 nights ago.  He woke me up in the middle of the night to see if she was home.  She wasn't so he came back scratching and barking at my door.  I let him in and he wanted to go outside.  Which was fine.  Then I couldn't go back to sleep all night.  When I got up in the morning I was exhausted from not getting a good night sleep.    She was half an hour late getting home and hadn't picked him up, called or texted.  I reached out by text and calling to no response.  Then I realized she'd been home for some time.  To be clear if I send him home and she's not there he just comes back and barks at my door.  I feel like I'm kind of stuck with him.  Long story short I let her know via text that he was no longer allowed to come inside my apartment.  I would be happy to give him treats at the door.  But I can't take care of him while she's at work.  I explained what had happened the night before and that I really needed to set some healthy boundaries.  She lied to me and said her boss didn't get into work until 7:30am and that was why she was late.  Yet I saw her car in our parking lot at 7:26am.  Which meant she was lying to me and she just went right to bed.    At any rate she did a full freak out via text making it seem like I was being a huge aye-hole and overacting to the situation.  Am I being the asshole here?	1642994441.0	sbby2g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbby2g/aita_for_setting_healthy_boundaries_with_my/	AITA~ For setting healthy boundaries with my roommate and her dog.
ikh1riqh	This is a whole lot of unnecessary drama soo let’s go!   Mary and I have been friends since 4th grade and her birthday is on valentine’s day. Every year she throws a party to celebrate. The group is always the same and we are all now between 20-25yo. In the last couple of months a lot has happened which changed the group dynamic. Two girls going that I no longer associate with. To the point where I don’t even acknowledge their family members.   To start of, all three of us got engaged and married at the same time. G#1 started a lot of drama during my wedding by commenting I “stole” her cousins wedding date. She then told people I was pregnant based on an assumption (I was 10 weeks at the time). Recently she made up stories stating my friend Nancy was spreading rumors about my husband and I which caused issues. Nancy was also G#1 best friend for 15 years until she found out how much she talked about her in the past. I did not attend G#1 wedding and as a result she said I wasn’t invited to begin with (she dropped off the invite the day before LOL). This also caused issues with my in law as myself as she told them they weren’t invited because of me.   G#2 and her mom have always been weirdly jealous. Our milestones were months apart, even the births of my daughter and her son. G#1 made up stories with G#2 and her mom then called my mom and sister demanding I stop befriending Nancy because “some lady told them”. My mom yelled at Nancy about the situation and Nancy confronted G#2. I was unaware of this until a week later when a Nancy told me the story.   Fast forward to yesterday. Mary had a get together with the group + moms. G#1 didn’t come bc her mother was the “some lady” spreading gossip to other people and knew I knew about it. G#2 acted like everything was normal and I didn’t pay much attention or care. At the end of the night, I thought everything was normal because I see myself as a victim in this situation. I was told by Mary that G#2 was forced to come because she didn’t want to see me as I caused for Nancy to yell at them.   As a result, Mary told everyone her party was cancelled because there was already too many conflicts. G#1 and G#2 are blaming me for ruining tradition and demanding I don’t attend instead. I was going to offer not to come but I decided it’s not fair for me to miss out on an event just because of petty issues. I feel like I am always keeping the peace for the sake of the group but it’s gotten too far.   P.S. G#2 and Mary are cousins.	1642995697.0	sbcdlf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcdlf/aita_for_being_the_reason_my_friend_cancelled_her/	AITA for being the reason my friend cancelled her party?
3viq9xfr	This morning I(21f) was going out with my dog for our daily morning walks and my mother shouted at me to take the garbage out..saying that "I TOLD YOU TO TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT!" I was already a bit irritated because I woke up late and had loads of things to do after walking my dog. I should mention I dont have a good relationship with my parents. Last night I had fight with my dad and they both always gang up on me and make the asshole because I dont  live my life how they want me to, so I was annoyed because of that too. Plus I really hate taking out the garbage... The smell is too much for me. Its disgusting and I hate touching the garbage packet because its leaky sometimes and yuck I wouldn't even be able to wash my hands while going out with my dog. So I just refused that I wont be taking it out. Its not like I haven't ever taken the trash out but i hate touching the garbage packet. So after I flat out refused she started hurling abuses at me called me horrible things..so then I said now that you behaved horribly with me  I wouldn't be taking it out at all. Her reply was I behaved horribly because you didn't listen to me. Then she splashed me with water that she was holding in a glass. I felt so humiliated. I just want to run away from my house. So AITA for not taking out the trash? Did I deserve getting splashed and verbally abused because of it?	1642997289.0	sbcwck	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcwck/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_the_garbage_out/	AITA for not wanting to take the garbage out?
fwsipb1o	I (21F) come from a family full of disabilities, but my main concern is my sister L, (18F). L is autistic, and this has been used as somewhat of a blanket excuse her entire life, only it backfired around 4 years ago when the youngest, H (15F) was also diagnosed autistic.  L has always had an aversion to water as a sensory issue, but this has evolved into straight up neglect. L won’t wash, brush her hair, clean her teeth, she won’t even use deodorant. We’ve had phone calls from the school of complaints due to the smell, and we’ve bent over backwards trying to find something that she’ll use, thinking it was sensory. No. “I won’t use it if you ask, that just makes me want to use it less.”  The smell is bad, when we’ve moved in the past, we’ve had to air out her room for 2 weeks, and use heavy scented cleaners. H also has sensory processing disorder,as well as asthma, and has complained of the smell upsetting her, and affecting her breathing.  L won’t listen to my dad for whatever reason, only my mum. L has no respect for anyone else in the house as she feels we’re all intellectually beneath her, and expects to be waited on hand and foot. My mum and the school encourage this. My mum won’t allow anyone to ask L to wear deodorant, and when H asked her to one day, L threatened H with “getting what she deserves if she asks again”, to which my mum told H “you know what she’s like”. Since this, L scratches H’s door at night, and goes in her room/just stands in the doorway and watches H from the mirror. L has a history of violence when things don’t go her way, and my mum has been of the opinion to just “let her be”. We’re currently at the point where H doesn’t feel safe sleeping at home because of L. L stays up all night on discord, talking loudly to international friends, ignoring us when we ask her to keep it down. L eats food clearly labelled as bought for one specific person, and cries when confronted. Recently, she’s taken to crying when we use the kitchen. L is completely ignorant of other people’s issues and struggles, triggering dissociative/psychotic episodes in myself multiple times because “people in the walls is funny”.  She’s taken to staring at me when I eat, which is close to triggering an ED relapse.  She cries when my dad attempts to talk to her, ignores myself and H, and my mum refuses to ask L to change anything about how she currently behaves.  Living here is hell as it is, and L’s habits make it unbearable.

iylrh9f1	My lovely fiancee and I had an engagement party over the weekend. Honestly, me not being one for like formal events or for being in the spotlight ever, I wasn't sure I'd actually enjoy this party. I figured I'd look back on it as just something that was nice or kinda cool. But, I really was relaxed, was having a great time, and I guess, the longer I was around my friends, the more we drank, the better I felt and then it happened. I had like a " Screw it" moment and the shirt came off. Needless to say it drew attention.  &#x200B;  My fiancee was a bit amused by it at first, said it was absurd I'd done it, but, advised me to get the shirt back on. I said it was fine because it was mostly a party of people our age, there weren't any like little elderly church ladies around. She didn't care for my reasoning, demanded the shirt go back on. I tried joking with her that, since I used to be a fat kid, this is my realizing my lifelong dream of feeling fine being publicly shirtless. I recognized the pissed off look on her face and tone of voice, I obliged, shirt went back on..    She says I nearly ruined the party, I think she's overreacting.  &#x200B;  AITA?	1643000289.0	sbdtbb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbdtbb/aita_for_taking_my_shirt_off_at_my_engagement/	AITA for taking my shirt off at my engagement party
9fuq3gdy	So for context, I’m 15F and the guy in this story (let’s name him John) is 15M and half white half Pakistani. I have a decently big friend group.  Fast forward to 2 days ago. We’re talking in a group chat and start joking about our own races/genders. One girl says that she hates Greek people (she’s not Greek) and he goes wild calling her racist.  Obviously, that’s not racist. I explain how it’s not racism and he starts trolling me, just making fun of my actions and what I’m saying.  John then adds his friends and he and them start saying some wild shit. I’m from Palestine so John took that opportunity to tell me to go get bombed by the IDF. And proceeds to call me a sand monkey etc.  I usually wouldn’t be that bothered with racist remarks, but I have had close family die from war in Palestine, and John knew that.  At this point though, I just left the group chat to calm myself down. They then add me back, and start making fun of my appearance, just the usual shit about my weight and my face (I’m recovering from anorexia).  At this point I’m furious and extremely upset so I insult him about his family problems. It’s the only thing I knew would hurt. And so he becomes extremely mad and everyone says I took it too far.  I obviously don’t agree and so when all my closest friends talked to him like nothing happened, i was pissed. I told my friend (let’s name her Lana) to take John off the group chat but Lana refused because apparently “she doesn’t wanna take a side” (but imo what he said was way worse).  When John asked me why i was so mad, i reminded him about my dead relatives. His friend takes the opportunity to make fun of my dead relatives. I lost it.  I start insulting John in the group chat even after Lana tells me to stop multiple times. If he can say wild shit and it’s justified then why can’t I? (To clarify, I said nothing racist).  Lana then removes me. I dm her, obviously pissed, because even though I was mean, he was straight up racist and cruel. But it’s been a few hours and I’m beginning to think that maybe Im in the wrong for being pissed at her. She just didn’t want drama. So what do you think, AITA?  TL;DR, I insulted my friends family problems after he was racist towards me. Should I be mad at my close friend for staying neutral?	1643000519.0	sbdwc5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbdwc5/aita_for_snapping_at_my_friend_for_not_taking_my/	AITA for snapping at my friend for not taking my side?
a9qz3a5s	Me and husband (both 30) purchased our first home last summer. I have spent the last 1& months or so buying furniture etc. for the house. Husband doesn’t take much of an interest in it.  I admittedly have expensive taste. For the last month or so I have been hooked on the idea of getting a custom built in unit which will total probably around $15-20k.  Husband lost it when I proposed the idea. Here is the thing - I make over $300k/year, husband makes around $120k. So I feel a sense of financial freedom in making the decision. I’m happy for his input but I don’t think it’s ok for him to tell me I can’t do it. And he’s not saying no because he thinks it’s ugly or doesn’t like it, he just doesn’t want to spend the money.

iymtjf58	I had the biggest crush on this guy for 5 years. I've been a part of this club for 15 years and he joined 5 years ago. I had a crush on him since the day I met him and when he first joined, but I was too nervous to take it further since it seemed like all the other single women that were his age, like me, liked him too.  I eventually quit my membership there because he stressed me out so much.  In fact, I was rude and sarcastic whenever he tried to talk to me. Today, I went on a date that my brother set up for me at this high-end restaurant and I was surprised that it turned out to be the guy from the organization. The same one I had a crush on for 5 years and counting.  I asked my brother why he set me up with this dude and he was like "a mutual friend of this guy and mine told me that he liked you so I was like why not?"  I then got annoyed at my date for not telling me he liked me, which would have saved me stress.

It’s been about three months and I finally got to meet her friend of 6 year (19 year old female) and I have to say she was very nice for the time being but one day while we were out I needed to go home early and her friend offered me a ride durning this ride she told me how much she didn’t like her friend decisions In life and how she thought her friend was insane for getting married early and how all her friend does is cheat on the men she get into relationships with and just being completely disrespectful to her friend. At first I was taken aback thinking this new friend of mine could do no wrong but one day she did something odd and I did tell her bf under the assumption that she was cheating and he said he’d talk to her . When she confronted me about it she told me the whole story about how in high school her ex started a really bad rumor abut her saying that she was a cheater which just wasn’t tru . I felt so bad and confessed everything about what her friend of six years said and she was so upset she told the friend what she heard not bring me up once and her friend lied saying she’d never say such things when indeed she did.

Students are inattentive or sick all the time and my colleagues are out and I'm often covering for them and doing extra work.  I told him I was feeling fine but a bit stressed and he probed further and made me open up.   He then drove over to my place and brought me desserts he had baked and tried to hug/soothe me.   I was touched, but I told him I'd rather keep everything private as I've had little success dating before and I'd rather keep my emotions private for now.

63bpqh4c	So I went to the same highschool my cousin currently goes to (I graduated 3 or 4 years ago)and I spent a lot of my time in the library and have read a lot of the books there.   I recently remebered a mythology book I read a few times and I want my own copy of it, the problem is that I don't remember the title or author name, I have 2 possible partial call numbers and a creature unique to that book  I tried to find it using the schools library site (I used my younger brothers account to view it) but a lot of the books that popped up from my search didn't have pictures of the covers  The thing is that my cousin is pretty busy (and usually too nice to tell me to fuck off) and I don't want to inconvienece them and my brothers are either graduated like me or too young to go to high school  The school also won't let me in due to covid, the fact I've already graduated, and the fact it would be weird if I went to the office and said "hey you guys probably don't remember me I was class of 2018 and I remembered a book you guys have in the library, could I go up and look for it?"

9dc8evhf	I (21f) have a friend, Emma. For a little bit of background, we both suffer from depression. Not only that but I have introverted tendencies and more often than not become exhausted by social interactions. On my worse days, I feel very drained and have this need to be left alone so I can recharge. Emma only has a few friends, me being one of the closest.  tonight, I was having one of of my “worse" days. Emma texted me multiple times within the span of a few minutes over Snapchat. Then she called me a few times, only to send me a text when I didn't answer asking if we could drive around for a while because she needed someone to talk to.  I told her that I was sorry, I don't have the energy tonight, and that I was feeling like crap but she could text me about whatever was going on. She proceeded to ask again, telling me she's had a shitty day and really needs to hang out. Again, I tell her “I'm sorry but I can text you." She responds, “I really need to talk to someone. I don't want to text." and asks to come over.  Once again, I apologize and tell her that texting all I can do right now. She asks to come over and talk again, basically begging by this point. I start to put my foot down, responding “I'm not trying to be mean, but I already said multiple times that I'm in a shitty mental state rn. I'm not in the mood to hang out with anyone, texting is literally all I can do right now."  She says “I need someone that understands what I'm going through, I can't talk to anyone else." I reiterate the fact that she can message me if she needs to vent. She gets upset, telling me “it's whatever, just nevermind then” and sorry that she bothered me.  At first, I didn't think I was wrong but now I'm starting to feel like a bad friend and that I should've just sucked it up and gone with her.

c2gqk2mz	My daughter (9) and best friend (also 9) are in competitive sports together, have been in school together and have had many play dates at both my home and best friends home.  Generally they get along well.  I recently found out best friend’s mother lied to me about staying over night in a hotel after a school field trip.  The mom mentioned to me months ago that we should stay in a hotel together after an out of town class field trip and continue to tour the city the following day.  I didn’t agree to go at the time, but also didn’t decline the offer.  To be honest, I probably wouldn’t have gone anyways.  Fast forward to the week of the field trip and mom had been acting distant towards me for a few weeks but I’m not super close with her so i just brushed it off.  I felt like I should at least ask mom If she would like to make the 3 hour drive to field trip destination together.  Mom said that she wasn’t sure since she had to drop best friend off at her dads house after the field trip.  The morning of the field trip, when we were dropping our children off at the school, I overheard Mom ask another friend if she needed to get anything from her car before they left and drove to the field trip.  It was obvious that best friend’s mom lied to me and was riding with another mom.  At this point, I realized this mom was likely an undercover mean girl - or she is extremely codependent and didn’t want to hurt my feelings by telling me she already made plans with another mom. Both of these things are equally annoying because, well, we are adults.  Meanwhile, my 9 year old keeps asking why her friend couldn’t ride home from the field trip with us or why her friend couldn’t meet us for dinner after the field trip.  I just went with the original story that the mom told me since I’m not about to pull my daughter into petty drama that could affect her friendship. The following week, my daughter comes home and tells me that her best friend was bragging to her about staying in a hotel with another friend after the field trip. Later that day, I see mom at sports practice.  I had planned to say nothing but mom brings it up.  She asks me if we stayed over night.  I told her no.  She then said she didn’t either, blah, blah, blah.  I told her what my daughter had told me and she got all weird and said she didn’t want my daughter thinking that since it’s not true.  Apparently it was only then that she realized that this was actually more hurtful to my daughter than anyone.  Luckily my daughter wasn’t super upset about this or I would have probably ripped mom a new one. But now, my daughter has been asking to have best friend over but I don’t want to interact with mom and now question how mom’s lack of integrity may trickle down to her daughter - which will directly impact my daughter.  So… AITA for not letting my child play with her best friend after her mom lied to me?	1643005411.0	sbfd2a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfd2a/aita_for_not_wanting_my_daughter_to_play_with_her/	AITA for not wanting my daughter to play with her best friend after her mom lied to me?

17i2vv	AITA for asking my flat mate to let me know when he has friends over  My flat mate messaged last night at 6pm that he was coming back to the flat with his girlfriend and friends to carry on having drinks on our roof.  The problem is our place isn’t big and you can still hear people on the roof. Also I have to wake up at 5:30 for work so I need to sleep early.  My flat mate apologized for bringing people over as he said it wasn’t his idea without me even saying anything at this point. So I asked him why bring them over and told him that I would appreciate if he asked rather than telling me he’s bringing people round especially since I have work early and he knows that.  Things got heated as he was drunk and said I had the chance to say no, but I told him he didn’t ask and told me they were coming round and sent a video of them in a taxi on the way over so I thought it was awkward to say no if they were already on the way. I told him that there are 3 people on the lease so it would be nice to ask me and my flat mate, but he said he lives here and can do what he wants.   I also brought up that this isn’t the first time this has happened since him and his girlfriend once woke me up at 1am on a week day while they were drinking and talking really loud in the living room. I let them go on for an hour until they heard me get out of bed and was about to come out and ask them to keep it down. His response to this was that he was drunk and it was their anniversary, but I said it was lack of respect for my boundaries and it was 1am and I wouldn’t do this to him. His response was that let’s find out when I do it to him because it should be fine but I said I would never do that to him.  I also don’t get on with his girlfriend as she was telling me and my housemate to go upstairs and chill with them whilst preventing us from watching TV.  I probably would’ve not as minded if it was a Friday or Saturday night but would prefer if he did ask, however I was annoyed it was a Sunday night and he knows I have work but also his response to everything.	1643006826.0	sbfrjc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfrjc/aita_for_asking_my_flat_mate_to_let_me_know_when/	AITA for asking my flat mate to let me know when he has friends over
6822m1gb	I (17f) met my aunts (27f) fiance (31m) a couple of weeks ago. For background, I was staying with my aunt for a couple of weeks for vacation because I don’t live where she does. I didn’t mind meeting him but, the day she chose wasn’t a good day since I was having a breakdown from all the stress I’ve been through with college applications. I still went because I didn’t want to be difficult. My aunts fiance was picking us up from her house and I started to have a breakdown on the way down to his car. I was panicking because I didn’t finish some supplemental questions and it was due that day. I got into his car and just sat there with my hood over my head and started crying. My aunt had a feeling I was crying and just told him to give me a while to get myself together. This is where it started going downhill. I know some people have a hard time picking up on social cues and I understand, but he knew not to talk to me since my aunt told him not to. He continued on and started asking me really personal questions. Things I’m not comfortable with answering. He asked me what was wrong and I didn’t mind answering that question but I was having a hard time speaking from crying. Then he proceeded to ask some unnecessary small talk questions. But then he asked me if I was depressed. I didn’t answer since it’s none of his business. I stopped talking after that. He then called me mental after I told explained how I have a certain standard with school because of my parents. He said I needed years of therapy to stop obsessing over my grades and stop having unnecessary breakdowns. I literally just met him and he’s claiming I’m mental from a few questions. He asked this one question that just set me off and made me ignore him for the rest of the meeting. He asked if I cu+ myself. For background, I have a history of sh, but I’m one year clean. Him asking that just triggered old memories and made me upset. I ended up leaving early and going home myself because my aunt didn’t stop him from asking those questions or stop him from calling me mental. A few hours after I got home my aunt came home. She asked me if I liked him and I was honest. I said I didn’t like him and she got upset. I have my reasons for not liking him, but she was upset that I wasn’t giving him a chance. Fast forward to this week. My aunt is having her formal family dinner between the families. Usually everyone is invited including cousins, nieces, nephews, etc. She invited my mom and all my cousins. She even offered to fly my mom out so she could come. I’m upset because she did’t invite me. If all my cousins were being invited why wasn’t I being invited? Her excuse was that there was no space for me to attend. I feel like it’s not fair but I don’t want to argue with her so I started ignoring her messages. Now she’s mad that I’m ignoring her but I’m just hurt that she didn’t invite me. Idk anymore.

91kaesab	My (18F) friend (18M) has been with his girlfriend (19F) for a little over a year now. I have been friends with my friend since kindergarten. They moved in together at the beginning of last fall. I expressed concern about this as my friend was giving up going to community college (paid for by his family) to move in with someone who he had been seeing for only a couple months. His girlfriend was also unemployed at the time. He got upset so I backed off. We made up eventually and set the argument aside.   However, they are never apart from each other. When he visits me at college, she always comes with him. When I FaceTime him, she is always on the call as well. I will admit that this has made me sort of start to resent their relationship.  Members of both their families have gotten upset about this relationship (some of which saying horrible things, which were totally uncalled for). However, they have continued the relationship, even expressing a desire to get married in the near future (next year). I secretly think they are way too young for this but haven’t said anything.   Recently, my friend called and told me they decided to open their relationship. This involves them becoming a “throuple” with a man who is 24. He asked me what I thought and I expressed concern about this as well, mainly because of the age gap. I don’t see why a 24 year old should be dating someone who was in high school 7 months ago. My friend got really upset and said that because they (him and the 24 y/o) “both pay bills” it means they have “similar goals” and were basically equally mature. He also said that he had more sexual experience than me, which means that he’s “grown up” and has more life experience than me and that we were at completely different maturity levels, with me being a child and him an adult. He also said that my parents control my life still, and I’m stuck in high school. This got me upset because it isn’t even true and made no sense to me. My parents don’t control my life, this relationship is just weird. He also implied that because I don’t pay bills, I’m not an adult (I’m paying for my college tuition out of my pocket, and I literally worked overtime this past summer to do this).   I responded “maturity would be making your life better for yourself and not running off with your girlfriend when you were 18”.   Did I go too far?	1643008113.0	sbg45h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbg45h/aita_for_not_supporting_my_friends_relationship/	AITA for not supporting my friend’s relationship?
iys954vi	A guy asked me to hang out some time ago, but I was leaving the area because of school closures and he was an hour away from where I was as his mom was dying of cancer. He said that he wouldn't be able to make it, but to remind him again in the far far future when school started again in the fall. School was not in-person that fall.  My friends told me he was interested in me, but I disagree. He never asked me to hang out again and he hardly ever texted me first. I later found out that he got a girlfriend 1.5 years later.  I told my friends that I disagree and they said that I wasn't picking up on social cues and guys' indications that they liked me and I told them I know my own life best.	1643008430.0	sbg7au	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbg7au/aita_for_telling_my_friends_that_a_guy_asking_to/	AITA for telling my friends that a guy asking to hang out with me is not an indication of interest?
iyrwmvej	My BF hails from a very wealthy and privileged business family. He is who you can call as a golden child. Life was and always will be easy for him.   He got the best education from top tier education institutes just because his parents could afford the tuition. He never had to work a part-time job during study like most students. He basically never had to lift a finger because everything was handed to him on a silver platter.   His parents knew the chairman of the college we both went to, so they turned blind eye to whatever wrong he did. There was one incident where a pregnant professor picked on him once, and he got her fired the next day. Nobody would say anything to him because they feared it will get them into trouble. He got away with a lot of things in college.   After college, he joined his dad's company and worked there for 3 years. Well, I wouldn't say work, but more like sit in his office and pass time.   Because of his top notch education background and work experience, he got into a top tier business school. Did his thing there, returned back and became CEO at his dad's company.   It was privilege all the way.   I didn't have any of these things. Neither would most of them.   I scraped my ass and worked very hard, but life is not easy for everybody. I got average education because me and my family couldn't afford the tuition. I had to work 2 part-time jobs to pay for my college/uni, food, rent and utilities.   I then bagged a decent job at an okay company for an average pay. I worked there for a while until covid-19 pandemic got me unemployed.   I have been trying to get a job, but the market is currently screwed, and he won't understand that. He is calling me lazy because I can't find a job.   I tried explaining to him how it is not easy to get a job on a whim, but he just laughs at me.   After numerous arguments, I reminded him of his privilege and that really pissed him off.	1643008530.0	sbg87o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbg87o/aita_for_reminding_my_bf_of_his_privilege_after/	AITA for reminding my BF of his privilege after he called me lazy because I couldn't find a job?
iye5zi77	My roommate and I share a 3 bed/2 bath currently. We are moving to a new place with the same - 3bed/2bath.  My roommate works from home, I do not. Most of the time, I’m at work or out of the house when they’re working. When I’m home, I’m usually chilling in the living room. The 3rd bedroom is a shared space. We both store things in there.  Toilet paper, vacuum, just extra things. And there’s a bed. We want to have an extra room for when we have visitors. It’s not super often, but there for when we do. My roommate has been working out of the 3rd bedroom. It’s still a space we share. It’s not taken over with their stuff/equipment. Just a small desk with their computer. They mainly work in there every day, but sometimes they work in their room or the living room (but not when I’m home). I don’t feel like I can’t use the extra room ever, but I don’t have as much of a need for the room on a day to day basis. WIBTA if I told them I’m not paying extra for the master in our new place since they use the bedroom more than me? I think it’s fair that if they’re in the room more than me, it would even out for me to have the master and we both split rent 50/50.	1643008538.0	sbg8a2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbg8a2/wibta_if_i_didnt_pay_more_for_the_master_bedroom/	WIBTA if I didn’t pay more for the master bedroom?
iyt76f7f	I told my stepmom after a fight we had that my math teacher, Ms. X, would be a better mom to me than her because she was kind, nurturing, and caring.   After I told her that, my stepmom changed. She tried to talk things out with me instead of getting angry with me and made sure to hug me at least 3 times a day. She also made sure to ask me how my day was after she got home and takes me out for one-on-one time every weekend.  Today, I saw her studying stats despite her saying she hates math and is bad at it. I asked her why, and she said, "Ms. X told me you like stats," and I flipped out and told her that she embarrassed me or must have because she probably told Ms. X I saw her like a mom.	1643010477.0	sbgqdm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbgqdm/aita_for_telling_someone_they_made_me_feel/	AITA for telling someone they made me feel embarrassed?
iyquyby2	My older brother "Philip" (M33) and I (M31) have been close since we were kids. He's always been the type to "not get involved" in peoples' problems, but recently I've noticed that he tends to put his own wants before the needs of others.   A few months ago, I was trying to get in touch with my younger brother "Tommy" (M21) but he wasn't returning my messages. I reached out to Philip to ask if he would just check up on Tommy, since I live 600 miles away and he lives in the same house. He didn't want to, saying he didn't want to get involved, but didn't elaborate. I was worried that Tommy might be going through a depressive episode, so I did a really stupid thing and spilled his deepest secret in hopes of getting Philip to understand my concern. He still refused, saying he doesn't know enough about \[topic of Tommy's secret\] to get involved. Even when I told him he didn't need to know, he just needed to be there for him, he still refused. Since that conversation happened, I've been kind of mad at Philip and hadn't spoken to him.   I found out recently that Tommy was kicked out of the house for causing ongoing problems and I haven't heard from him since. Today was my Philip's birthday so I decided to give him a call. He talked about how badly he wanted to move out of our mom's house and live in the wilderness near this hiking trail that he likes a lot, and how he wanted to get away because he can't stand being around people anymore, calling it self-care. I know he's been really down the last few months since he got home from a 6-month hike, but all I could think of was how he refused to check on Tommy when something was wrong. Depression runs in our family, but he's no longer taking meds or seeing a therapist, for reasons I'm unclear on. Yes, self care is important, but I feel like self care is all he does, to the point where he doesn't think about anyone else and refuses to help anyone when they need it.   I snapped and said he was an asshole to want to just up and leave, and that he tends to abandon people even when they need him. He hung up on me, so I texted mom to vent a bit. She took Philip's side, which is ironic since Philip can't get through a single conversation without complaining about mom. Now she's accusing me of lying (something my mom has NEVER done to me) and saying I shouldn't talk about things that I don't know about (I'm assuming she means the situation that resulted in Tommy being kicked out, but she didn't exactly specify), and now both of them are blowing up my phone. I tried to explain my side but I'm not sure mom is reading my messages. One of my big concerns about him leaving is that mom will be alone and probably become depressed too, but I didn't tell them that. I think I should have just kept my mouth shut instead of calling out my brother. I may have damaged our relationship irreparably.

hwj7p79d	I (21F) belong to a single-parent household; it has always just been my mother and me. My mom always did her very best in raising me and providing for me during my childhood. She was a very good mother, very loving, affectionate, supportive, etc…   However, my mom was also very strict, especially in high school. I was never allowed to date in high school. But I never rebelled and I respected her wishes, thinking that in university, as an adult, I would be able to do whatever. Once the time came to go off to university, my mom did not change. She continued to be very strict.      I met my current bf during the first week of university, we’ve been together since (it's been close to 4 years now). My mom suspected it and told me just how much she was against it. So I hid my relationship from her until my 3rd of university. My mom and I would get into a fight like every weekend about my bf. Sometimes she would stop speaking to me for 2 weeks or even a month because of our arguments. To be clear, he’s an amazing guy, with no red flags whatsoever. However, my mom told me she did not want me dating until I was 21 so it would not affect my college GPA. Also dating in Indian culture is pretty taboo which is also why she did not want me to date. So it has been over a year now since I told my mother and our relationship has never recovered. My mom tells me I have backstabbed her and how she cannot trust me. She also feels that she should have been included in my decision to start dating. However, my grandparents and my aunts support my decision. My grandma (my mother’s mom) even told me that if she was in my position she would do the same thing since my mother is very strict. To be clear, it hurt me tremendously to not be able to tell my mom that I met someone in my life that I truly wanted to spend the rest of my life with. But my mom cannot look past the fact that I did not tell her about my relationship from the beginning. In her eyes, I backstabbed her and chucked her out of my life. She also continuously expresses that since she and I are the only two people in our nuclear family, hiding this truth from her hurts her even more. I completely empathize with my mother's sentiments and feelings. I know I hurt her. I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT IT. But I’ve been apologizing to her for over a year now and I mean it. The bottom line is my mother did not want me to date which is not her decision so I hid it from her. And I hid it from her because I did not have the courage to see what she would do if she would find out. While my mother is happy for me that I have found a companion, she hates my boyfriend and how I betrayed her.     My mother and I have had a conversation as adults about this. She tells me she will never change how she feels about this. She says since I hid this from her for 3 years, she does not want anything to do with it. She tells me to "move on and to leave her behind".

3auexqjk	Okay this is the dumbest thing ever but my friend made a giant fiasco out of it so I don’t know if I am an asshole.  So I was playing Valorant (an online FPS game) with my friend who is also my room mate. I’m better than her at the game, not by a lot but decently. Also, she is easily angered. If she loses in any game (board game/party game/video game) she rages or quits and says how stupid the game is. Very sore loser. I don’t like playing games with her too much because of this but she gets upset if I don’t want to play with her.  So we were playing today and it was towards the end of the game and I was doing pretty good and her not so much. This is a teamwork game so it’s not like we were competing against each other. She got upset and said “I don’t know what I’m doing wrong ugh” and jokingly I said “just get good” and then immediately followed it up with “you just have to develop better game sense”. She then said “It’s not like my game sense is any worse than yours” (which mine is obviously better since I am a higher rank in the game) to which I just said  “i don’t know i haven’t watched you play”. She then got upset  said “ thanks for making me feel bad” and left our call. I texted her “hey what the heck lol”.   She messaged me saying “why would you say that when i’m obviously upset” and i just said i was joking and obviously didn’t mean it maliciously. it’s a meaningless game it’s not worth getting upset over.  I was playing a new game at this point by myself and then she comes into my room and starts talking to me in a loud (not yelling) voice. I can’t pause the game obviously and I was saying I don’t want to talk about this right now. She keeps talking and I repeat myself “I didn’t mean it maliciously and it was just a joke. You asked what you were doing wrong and I told you”. she then got mad at me for not apologizing for hurting her feelings but i told her i’m not going to be forced to apologize. she kept pestering me when i said i didn’t want to talk and then finally i said I don’t care. She then proceeded to scream at the top of her lungs fuck you and slam my door and then slam her door.   I was planning on talking to her tomorrow morning and not immediately at 4am and was going to say sorry for hurting her feelings but being forced to apologize immediately makes me not care.

iyv5fbte	Throwaway for obvious reasons.   I (21M) am a part of a pretty tight knit group of 5 people. We've been friends for years, and everyone gets along with everyone extremely well. We all almost text all the time, as that's the only way to keep contact in this time.   Now coming to the problem, one of my friends, "Jenny" (20F) has reduced contact with almost everyone. She responds once every 3-4 days, and we talk for barely 15-20 minutes over text. I tell her all about my day and whatever is going on in my life and but she never really reciprocates. Its been like this for a few months. Whenever I ask her whats up with this behaviour, she brushes it off saying college is stressful or social interaction can be overwhelming. But like, she is online, like posts on sm and stuff.   When I talked to this other friend about this, she said that they talk on call, but similarly, maybe once or twice a week. And apparently this friend can never discuss her problems with Jenny no matter how hard she tries. I get that Jenny has had offline classes (not US) and offline exams, but so has this friend, albeit online.    This really pissed me off, I confronted her about this. Well I asked her if shes been talking to this other friend, she said she has. I asked her whether she has kept up with whatever is going on in her life, Jenny said she has, that they had talked day before yesterday. I went off on her saying that she should be there for us more, that's what friends do, friends make out time for each other. And now she is annoyed with the two of us.

iyv15ddp	* throwaway account *  For some background context:   due to my dads job, i have this completely free access to a beach resort area. Ive been taking my friends there every year for the past 4 years, we do like a 3-4 day trip. I have taken them for a total of 5 TIMES, charging them zero cash (only 2 times out of 5 i took gas money from them). All the living, eating, recreational activities free of charge.  Now this year, i refused by saying that im not in the mood, and that my university exams are approaching in 2 weeks, since im super lazy i need my time to study.  Following is the way they reacted: 1. I got called an asshole 2. That im very uncompromising 3. That i should get kicked out of the group chat 4. That i deserve a "punishment" fot cancelling the trip  Now remind you we are students so we're broke, thanks to me we are able to make this trip every year and made so many special memories, but when for the 6th time i refuse , they get real mad at me.

So my 14-year-old daughter has been smoking for the last two years, she recently reached out and asked for help quitting.   I did what my father did to me at that age, and promised to burn her with the butt of every cigarette smoked. After 8 cigs she got the message.   Now ex-wife is saying I’m Biggest AH ever but she hasn’t smoked since last 5 days am I really AH if she has quit??? She’s now healthier and will not smoke again like me because of what she learned!

g23b3p7v	Apologies in advance for my English level. I'm living in the middle of Europe in the country with Slavonic language (Poland), so my grammar may be off. Also this may be a little chaotic since it's my first time posting and I don't know which facts may be relevant for you to understand our situation.  I'm (23f) living with my husband A (26m) and last night my brother J (16m) "run from home". My dad (50m) called me, and said that thay argued badly - despite my questioning,  dad didn't want to tell me what happened,  just said they needed break from each other. J had already packed his bag and planned to go alone by train (I live 500 km away from them), but they didn't approve of that so they are willing to drive him all the way here if I agree to shelter him for a while (he has winter break, so no schooling issues rn). It wasn't news to me as I portray our parents as toxic and dangerous to our mental health, because of things they did to us, so I didn't hesitate for a moment. J then texted me saying "I'm comming to your city, please don't call as I am not in environment in which I can safely speak", and when I asked him what the hell happened there, he told me, that two days ago when my mom picked him up from a friend, she smelled something of him that reminded her of cannabis (she smoked it couple times before as adult when it wasn't legal yet). When they went home, they argued, grounded him and left conversation. The thing is, J said he never smoked anything (not weed, not cigarettes, not even vapes), his friend had vape liquids smelling like musk when J was at his place, and despite all explanations they didn't believe. Some of you may wonder why I believe J over our parents in this,  when I might be wrong. The thing is, my bro came to me over year ago when he first started drinking alcohol. He confessed, I listened, voiced my concerns about his age and never scolded him about it. The reason he got himself a drink then was because of our parents, and how our mother (47f) said J is a piece of 💩, no one cares about her and how cruel everyone is to her at her work. You get the picture. That's one reason why I believe J would talk to me if he did smoke, another - I'm the only person in our family who never tried any substances and Idon'tjudge if anyone does. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, hell I have never drank a sip of alcohol willingly - I only once got a sip at 12 at the party when my mothers and mine glasses were switched, but even then I ran to the bathroom and spilled it out with disgust. This happens everytime, even with chocolates with little alcohol, and everyone knows it well. In addition me and my husband have agreement in whitch when he wants to get himself a drink we kiss beforehand so I dont get the taste of it, and I don't "demand a kiss later", he can drink all he wants and even then I get to have some additional affection so both of us are satisfied. Anyway, back to the topic. The next day (yesterday) when J thought they had given up scolding him about it, they went off the rail. They demanded confession for over 3 hours of argument to the point that J considered consequences of making false confession just to get them to stop. Then he told them just to test him if they wanna see for themselves. They agreed and dad drove to pharmacy to get fast spit test. But behold - then they said " he didn't want to take test, because he peed just before dad got it home". This argument is inconsistent since they went to get him (I repeat) a saliva test for this exact reason! That was the last straw for my little brother, he felt abandoned, betrayed and abused, so decided to come to me, and all of that I learned from him through texts. Lile I said earlier, my parents decided to drive him to me for 5 hours, but when they all got here at 10 pm, my parents decided to come back home immediately without any explenation of the situation to me or my husband, and just threw some money on the counter for essentials for J. I decided to play dumb and asked them what had happened and just to stay for 10 minutes to explain and deescalate situation. All they said is that my dad has work the next day at 8 am and he needs to go back (they would be at home at 3am so he would crush a nap before work) his work is not strict, he could easily start it at 10 am as he had done already multiple times, but they used it as excuse to get back anyway. They also told us not not to be such AH since they are emotional now and we don't understand how it affects their feelings, and we can't demand explanation on the spot since it's not our business. The thing is, we went back home 2 days ago, we were at my FIL funeral since he suddenly died last monday. It crushed me and my husband badly, and they know it since all 3 of them attended funeral on friday. Even considering this they still consider me an AH since J preferred to run to me rather than stay with them. They cursed me out, got dressed and left spending less than 5 minutes at our place, but then called me demanding apologies for literally keeping them here. I remind you that they are full grown adults and noone was holding them here, so they freely could leave anytime and that's what they ultimately did. I am crushed for what my brother had to go through, for my grieving husband who didn't have time nor to rest nor to properly adress his feelings about his deceased father, and lastly I'm crushed for myself since I feel helpless about ever having normal relations in my family.	1643017136.0	sbiex2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbiex2/aita_for_sheltering_my_younger_brother_because_of/	AITA for sheltering my younger brother because of his argument with our parents?
9zm5lkn7	I was at the bar the other night with a friend (male) and 2 other people(females) I used to be good friends with but not as much anymore. Anyway, I was down a decent amount of drinks and we were all talking when a guy approached one of the girls I was with. I had seen this guy come up and talk to her multiple times that night and never thought anything of it, But that time the girl I was with looked at me like she was uncomfortable multiple times through the conversation. After a little bit of that, I went up to the guy and started talking to him. It was then when one of the girls told me the guy said my hair looked weird. That’s when I started getting aggressive. I never got physical, I only talked to him. I said things like “you need to leave” “get the fuck out of here” “let’s take this outside” things like that. For the most part I wasn’t light with my words and I came at him pretty strong. I only realize now that he was being very submissive, he didn’t really talk back or try to fight me, and I feel bad. I was also informed that he was a friend of one of the girls I was with half way through the confrontation after things got heated (I don’t remember being told that as I was pretty drunk). So now I look like the bad guy (and might be the bad guy). But I’m split because I had good intent, in the fact that I didn’t want some “random” guy to make a girl feel uncomfortable but I also believe I overreacted and apparently made the guy feel uncomfortable. Long story short the girls I was with now are mad at me and are struggling to hear me out.

Recently we decided to build a barn and keep our animals there, and go and spend the winter there in the weekends. We needed someone to take care of the barn, so we came up with an idea. Instead of hiring someone stranger to guard our barn, we offered our friend to care of the barn since he still doesn't have a job and we'd give him a monthly stipend until he gets a suitable job.   He got mad at us for offering this kind of work to him, and that he wouldn't accept anything less than us. We tried to convince him into accepting this offer until he finds a job because doing something is always better than sitting in home and complaining all the time. he refused and called us a toxic group and cut us off. We keep calling him and he won't answer us.

5eosq89t	Hallo together, I would really appreciate your evaluation - because I am hypersensitive it is sometimes hard for me to untangle my feelings and actions correctly. I apologize if my post might seem a bit confusing because of that. I am also no native English speaker.  I and my bf are together for 2 years, knowing each other for three. We were first ld, but after one year I moved to his town in a small apartment for students because I started my master here. He made it clear from the beginning that he does not want to move in too early, because it would feel "final" and "irreversible". We both loved with our exes together and moved in pretty fast, so I understand where he is coming from. He is also - and there he is pretty open - pretty anxious in relationships, which could stem from his parents separating when he was a teenager and his dad (who is his best friend) not taking it very well since. His anxiety is a reaccuring topic in our relationship, but it got less.  My student apartment is about 20 minutes from his home, but I am nearly never there. He tells me he likes it, if I sleep at his flat and welcome him, when he is home. Because Uni is online and I work remotely I am nearly everyday here. He made me space, so I put all the things I need (like clothes, books and care products) in all the rooms. I feel like home here and I have no connection to my small student apartment. I just go there to check my mail, I even took all my plants from there in his place, because I am all the time here. Our friends are teasing us for our living situation (not in a mean way).  Last month his landlord (a very sweet old lady) approached him about me being all the time there and if he would want that I move in. She also mentioned that the extra costs are higher because I am all the time there. He cried as we talked about the topic, saying that he "can not take it" if I would move with him now, but he does not want that I am not here. He does not want that anything changes, but now something must be done. I told him - although I would be willing to, because I feel like home here - that I do not want to move in with him, if he feels so bad about it (which is true). That I could take part of the risen extra costs, which he refused because I pay for a student apartment which I am currently not using. He talked with his landlord and pays now some more extra costs, but I can stay all the time,wuthout anyone asking if I want to live here.  Well, I will finish my masters at the end of 2022 (wish me luck) and I will need another flat, because I can not live in the student apartments without studying. By coincidence, two flats below him are free and currently renovated right now. I talked with him about moving in, in one of them. Because I would be near, could look after my mail every day and still we would not living together directly. We could even use the two flats for us like we want it. First he seemed excited about that idea, but yesterday (the day where I might be the asshole) he told me, that he does not know how I would feel if we would break up and we would still see each other from time to time and that he is not comfortable with that idea anymore. I asked him why and that this is such a great compromise and that I could move out easily if I am hurt because we broke up - and that I do not like if he always speaks about "breaking up" like this is going to happen. He became slightly mad and told me that I should not behave like these flats are the only ones in the world for me to move in. That nothing will change for us, no matter wherever I will move. There I become very frustrated and I told him, that I really try to be understanding but that is hard and I feel that I always need to accommodate his needs and feelings but he never accommodates mine. I told him, that I really want to move in one of the flats, because I feel like home and it would make so much things easier for me, if I stay all the time at his flat - and we can use the space together. Then he got mad again and told me, that maybe I should stop to be understanding all together and do what I want. I really felt bad there, because I know no one is responsible for their feelings. I even suggested that he should talk to a psychiatrist, because his anxiety is very bad sometimes and even affects other aspects of his life - but he does not want that I "pathologize" his feelings. I really do not try to frame him as "Psycho" or something, but therapy helped me through so much struggle in my life and maybe it could help him, too. But I don't know, maybe I went to far here. AITA for wanting to move below him? I do really not want to move here after yesterday, but maybe I should apologize, I don't know. Tldr.: I moved in a student apartment in the town my then ld bf is living. I need to move out this year because I will end my masters and want to move in a free flat below him. He is not comfortable with the idea, but I told him he should accommodate like I do always for him.

My f14 best friend b was having a party at her house for one of iur friends birthday because they just moved and were still setting up their house anyway me and my friend a went to bs room and started joking about asking her mum of we can stay because her mum said we’re the adopted daughter i jokingly started texting bs mum i said “B told me to ask you if me and a can stay idk why because shes staying at her grandparents”  Its part of an on going hoke where i fake text her mum but delete is straight after. When i turned my phone around to show a I accidentally pressed the send button and started freaking out well b came through in a rage shouting at me for texting her mum saying “i cant do that and it makes it seem like shes lying to her parents” i tried to explain what had happened but everyone was shouting at me so i went home. Tgeyre all mad at me and i explained to one of our friends what had happened and she said “im not mad at you i just dont get how you can be mad at b when u were the one that messaged her mum” (this was before i explained) i told her what happened but that i know i ahpuldnt message her mum and ive tried apologising she said “ok thats good you understand just give them all a few days and theyll forget” i said ok but today i stayed off school because i think they all hate me so aita	1643020845.0	sbjcoj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbjcoj/aita_for_texting_my_friends_mum_asking_if_i_can/	AITA for texting my friends mum asking if i can stay
h8wivhck	My husband is absolutely certain that the only thing that will make him feel happy, not lonely, and give him something to do is a cat.  I’m really struggling with everything at the moment, have been for a while, and the last thing I want is any animal, but especially a cat.  He told me a couple of days ago he was “getting a cat whether I liked it or not” and that was that.  He’s been unhappy at my responses to “cat news” (because I’m not excited, I guess?).  This morning I asked the simple question “what happens if I can’t cope when you get your cat?”, (admittedly not the best question, probably should have asked “how will you feel if it takes me a while to warm up to your cat?”?) to which he replied he’d get rid of it, then said that he wouldn’t get a cat at all.  We were in bed, and the next thing he did was turn totally away from me, and he’s barely said a full sentence to me all day, and when he does reply to me, it’s very affectedly sad in tone & appearance.  He’s now “decided” he doesn’t want a cat at all; and has also said he can’t trust me not to “accidentally” let it out and loose it (it would be a house cat)  So, Reddit - AITA for not wanting a cat?	1643021254.0	sbjgcv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbjgcv/aita_for_not_wanting_a_cat_and_being_worried_when/	AITA for not wanting a cat and being worried when husband says he’s getting one regardless?
8cqhvg3t	so i am a 15yo with a crippling nicotine addiction and my friend happened to have vapes. now i know i shouldn't be vaping and have since stopped after visiting my GP to help me stop, anyways he messaged me saying he had 2 vapes left and he said they were 2000 puffs wich was pretty good for $50 so i went to his house and picked them up but didnt pay him because i forgot my cash but he still gave me them cause hes a good person. so i just them and they taste pretty good but im not using them 24/7 because i dont feel the need to but they had no nicotine when the package stated they had 6% salt nic, so when i did use them i was taking maybe 5 puffs at a time to actually feel a effect, so i used them for about 2 days and then they just completely stopped and there wasnt even a flashing light on the back to indicate they were dead so i basicly got 2 days out of two 2000 puff vapes and i dont want to pay him because he ripped me off big time after telling me how good they were and hyping them up big time...

exz69x9x	First of all, trigger warning for eating disorders and body image issues. I apologize if the grammar in this post doesn’t make complete sense, English is not my first language and I have trouble with writing.   I have had body image issues since I was very young. They appeared for a variety of reasons, but one of the main ones was very persistent and negative comments from a parental figure. This completely messed up the perception I have of my own body, and has led to some pretty severe body image issues, including an ED I developed around this time last year. I won’t go too much into detail, but I’m skinnier then I used to be. It’s not as severe right now, I go to therapy and I’m on my way to heal, but it’s still an issue in my life.   My grandmother and I have a very close relationship, she doesn’t live far away from me and visits up to multiple times in a week. Because of this, it didn’t take long until she caught on to what was going on with me. I know it’s because she’s genuinely concerned for me, and I’m grateful that she cares for about me, but I feel like she’s crossed a line.   It started with small comments about how she didn’t like that I was skinny and that she wanted me to stop losing weight. They didn’t faze me at that point, but with time they became more critical and persistent. This made me feel confused and sad, and it affected my mental health and how I felt about myself. A few weeks ago we had her over for dinner, which started out nice. We were casually chatting, and that’s when she decided to tell me that I looked like a walking corpse, that I was too skinny and too pale. This caused me to snap, and I told her how hurtful and insecure her comments made me feel and that it only made my relationship with food worse. She was taken aback by this, and kept quiet for a while.  I know she’s just concerned, but I feel like this crossed the line of acceptable and that she could’ve approached the situation in a better way. I’ve later apologized for making her feel bad and for causing a scene, we’re on good terms and all is well. However, I still think about what she said to me daily. I feel like I blamed her and that my words came out wrong, and I feel like I was being immature.

9bmtaete	I (28f) was living with my mom taking care of her.  My roommate(27f) was homeless with her bf so we offered them our spare room until they could get on their feet. It was only supposed to be a few months.  Fast forward 2.5 years.. my roommate broke up with her bf and my mom had passed away. So it was just us 2. I have 4 cats and she has 4 cats which she kept in her room(she has the master bedroom). After my mom passed she wanted to try letting her cats out into the rest of the house, so we gave it a shot. A couple months later I went in to the living room to watch TV. A few minutes later she comes in with a load of laundry to fold and asks me for the remote. Confused I said "why can't I watch tv?" She said "you had the tv yesterday". Which I did but before that she'd been in there hogging the tv for like a week and a half because she recently quit her job and had nothing to do. Plus, not to be THAT person but it is after all my TV. I was upset so I said whatever and gave her the remote then left to watch TV in my bedroom. Now I'm the type of person that needs space when I'm upset and she's the type of person who pushes people to talk about things immediately instead of giving them the space they need. She asked me why I was upset and I answered "I've been feeling like you and your cats are taking over my house". Let me explain... since she let the cats out into the rest of the house they had been bullying my cats to the point where mine would hide in my bedroom all day or stay outside to avoid her bully cats. We also agreed to keep a bigger litter box for all of them in the spare room. I paid for the box and a big cat tree to put in there. We agreed we'd take turns cleaning up. She never cleaned that box even once. It got to the point where her cats were the only ones using it because they were bullying my cats out of the room, yet I was the only one cleaning it. On top of that she never did her share of chores around the house. She kept her own room clean,  that was it. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom and the livingroom that she basically kicked me out of. After telling her these things were bothering me, she threw a huge tantrum and I mean like screaming and slamming doors like a freaking child and we haven't spoken since.

af6dlee6	My husband and I have recently had a court case resolved where we took a travel company to arbitration and won. This was a process which took 6 months and one which I spent many hours writing letters, chasing and gathering evidence. My husband did nothing to help with the process but I was ok with this as I just wanted things sorted, the only thing he needed to do was provide the company with bank details so they could pay our award. It's been a while and we still haven't had payment, last week I asked my husband to check he'd sent the email and to check the bank details which he assured me he did. Today, he's realised he actually put the wrong bank details, he got a number wrong in the account number.  I'm absolutely furious with him, he only had one job to do and messed it up. I asked him to check over a week ago which he assured me he did and said he knows his account number so didn't see the mistake. I totally get that mistakes happen but this is a huge one and could have been very easily avoided, the outcome could be that our award has been paid to the wrong person and means if they don't agree to pay it back, we'd have to take them to court. This afternoon I tried to express my feelings to my husband, that I'm really annoyed he made such a silly mistake and it could have serious and stressful consequences, he should have double checked! He thinks I'm an absolute AH for even telling him I'm annoyed and it's caused a huge argument between us!

ty64r	I make edibles because smoking hurts me; tooting my own horn but they’re delicious. With my most recent batch, my roommate says he can pay me for an edible. I tell him, specifically, “you don’t need to pay me, help yourself”. He takes an edible and all is good.  The weekend continues and his friends come over to watch football. I’m away doing my own thing. When everything is over, I’m looking for fridge when I notice that my roommate gave my edibles to his friends. I don’t know exactly how many, but I had 2.5 brownies left.   I was furious and gave him a mouthful. He says because of what I said, that he didn’t think it would be an issue to give them out. I didn’t care for that at all, and told him he has to pay for my edibles or I’m going to start eating his food.   This morning I enjoyed a rotisserie chicken he had in the fridge.

dbho33zi	Relevant info up front  1. My wife suffers from extreme anxiety, and possible ADHD (per her therapist), and her most common reaction is anger or total shut down. Everything triggers her - friends, family, our kids, minor hiccups, work, etc.   2. She sees said therapist once a month, the therapist has suggested trying medication several times apparently.  Her parents and I both urge her to take treatment more seriously but she dismisses us.  3. We both make great incomes (each in 6 figures) and have lived accordingly to that income.  4. Before we were married when she was single she totally walked away from another career that she had multiple degrees in because of the stress and it did nothing to relieve the stress.   5. I myself am seeing a therapist for self care management to make sure I can properly handle what’s thrown at me weekly  Work as mentioned is a big trigger because she hates doing anything she does not want to do (and who wants to work?).  She regularly threatens to quit on the spot when a day is busy.     I was absolutely drained when the last bout of I’m quitting started and she quipped at me “but I can never quit because you’d resent me for it”.   Now the truth is, I would, but not because of the money like she thinks -I hide that tho. Today I decided I needed to stop biting my tongue because it was doing no one any good.  So calmly I explained that yes I would be resentful if you quit tomorrow without having ever taken therapy seriously or listening to the professional suggestions for medication, or on the financial side - even being willing to sit down and talk with me about a financial plan to make sure we stay fiscally stable.   Because everything is and always has been a trigger to her, life is going to continue to be full of stresses even if this one is gone and she needs to learn how to cope with them.    I then emphasized though that if she took the steps that should come first seriously and felt like she still needed to quit - even if it didn’t work at all to relieve the anxiety I’d absolutely harbor no resentment at all - because she tried everything she could.  My issue is not with losing income - it’s with the idea of running away from a problem at the expense of your family.    She lost it, told me that was horrible and selfish.  And that she’s not one of our children to be lectured and clearly I don’t care about her mental health.    I was being honest and in a tone that was as considerate of her mental state as it could be.  And honestly I feel like what I said needed to be said - she can’t run away from her problems, she has a family that needs her.   Her family agrees with me.  But she’s making me feel like I’m an inconsiderate asshole and frankly she knows how to do that so well that even my usually confident self always doubts my every move.

289petkb	A little context, I (21F) am the youngest of 4 and the sister I'm talking about is the oldest. She has always been my parents favourite no matter what. They always side with her in every situation which is something I and my other siblings all believe and agree with. There was a period of time where I reached out to my mother and expressed I was struggling a lot with my mental health and asked them to help me instead of disregarding my problems for my oldest sister and her child (a baby at the time). To this, they basically refused to help and said that I was being ridiculous and overthinking. Shortly after this was one of the first times I attempted to take my own life which is something I still can't tell them about as they would say I was blaming my sister which apparently isn't fair on her.  I have a creative writing degree with a specialisation in comics and poetry. My grandfather passed away recently and the funeral is fast approaching. My older sister (30F) decided that she would write a poem for them to read aloud on the day. Anyone who has been to a funeral knows that there is a finite amount of time given to speak about the person who has passed. Well my sister wrote this poem years ago for my Grandma's funeral and has tweaked it slightly for my Grandad. There is some really nice sentiments in there but it's incredibly poorly written and needs massive edits. I know if I offer to help her edit it she will be furious. I feel really hurt that my family didn't ask me, someone whose whole adult life has been spent at university studying something I love and am very passionate about, to write something. I never got the chance to have anything read at my Grandma's funeral because my sisters poem took up too much of the time. What really frustrates me is that my sister and other siblings are constantly talking crap about my degree and how useless it is, but all of a sudden she loves poetry? I understand that everyone has their way of coping but this is just another time where my family have thought nothing of me while being head over heels for my sister.  I feel frustrated that even though poetry is the one thing I have that's mine, she decided to do it anyway and not even ask me.   TLDR; My sister wrote a crappy poem for my grandads funeral even though I have a degree in poetry, would I be the asshole if I told her it sucks?	1643033788.0	sbn6pc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbn6pc/wibta_if_i_told_my_sister_that_the_poem_she_wrote/	WIBTA If I told my sister that the poem she wrote for my Grandads funeral sucks?
42ojan7n	Trying to keep this as brief as possible. I (23F) and my husband (24M) have been together for 6 years. We’ve had a good relationship, until recently when it’s been horrible. My husband, D, has a coworker S. After several years of them working together I’ve gotten super close to S and would consider her my best friend. D is also super close to S and has said how she is his best friend as well. No issues, she’s never hit on him (she’s married etc) and I like that we all have the same friend group. Recently though, shits hit the fan. D has begun antidepressant/anti anxiety and since then things have been different.   There’s been a lot the last months but essentially D has been acting secretive and overall just “off”. It started with a work Christmas party that he lied to me about not being able to go to. He then covered up S kissing another friend after the party. I later found out that is why he didn’t want me to go to the party since everyone knew I wasn’t okay with it. I have since found out S lied to me about her husband being okay with the kiss and that she told him.  I feel I’ve lost a lot of trust both with my husband and with S since they kept secrets from me. I’ve talked to D about this and he has told me there is nothing to worry about. But continues to act overly concerned about S, defending her actions and saying it’s not cheating bc there was no sex. Every time I am with them he pays more attention to her and what she wants etc.  For example, we went on a skiing trip. Prior to going I told D he needs to put me first. The first night there S leaves and D follows. They’re gone for hours and I blew up on D, said some shit I shouldn’t have. I decided to leave and calm down. I’m gone for about an hour. When I get back I realize I don’t have a key and the night security guard ended up having to let me into the room, where everyone is asleep. He will also text her while all of us have been at dinner together. Both times I saw it was him asking her to not mention small things he either lied or “forgot” to tell me about.  We keep doing this cycle of major fights, we make up and then he begins acting weird again. He claims I’m looking for issues, has no desire to be with S or anyone else and that by me getting mad/bringing things up it makes things worse and is continuing our fights.   I've gotten incredibly mad at him to the point I’ve threatened to leave him and looked to move in with my sister. I have asked him many times if he wants to divorce, if he would be happier with someone else (someone like S). He always says no, he’s not trying to hurt me etc. He said how my words and ability to not trust him hurts him. To me, his actions continue to show me he will choose S over me. I have also looked into therapy but he refuses to go.   I guess I am asking if I am TA for how I have handled this; getting upset and reacting poorly (threatening to leave) when he is going thru a hard transition with new medications.	1643034170.0	sbnbof	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbnbof/aita_for_being_mad_after_my_husbands_weird/	AITA for being mad after my husbands weird behavior after starting antidepressants
9ph2ri8v	Hello all,   Living in the UK.  For a bit of background for my in-laws (65 fil and mil 60) have a combined worth of 1.25 million due to my fil having a great pension and my mil’s father being a millionaire.   They aren’t very flashy about their wealth but live in a nice house and go on expensive holidays which I have no issue with. What I (26 F) do have an issue is that they are so cheap with a lot of things. They are constantly trying to get money off meals and finding the smallest fault in hotel rooms so they can even the smallest amount of money off and this gets a little old as they are at the point where they are only living off the interest their wealth generates. When I went around for a brew the other day my fil was telling me all about his latest meeting with their financial advisor and was bragging that he did not need to touch his third pension and how they needed to spend more money than they already do. I know that they are lovely people and have the right to have their money but my fil is also claiming all the benefits he can from the government! He is claiming £60 a week in PIP when he has such a massive net worth to start with because he had a polio as  child.   Meanwhile my dad (65) has had to give up work due to the amount of medical issues he has from 40 years in manual labour is being told they may not be able to give him the same PIP payment.

4a93208p	Dear reddit,  I am F(22) from a middle class family. All my uncles and aunts are middle class, my family work in a family business so none of use are much wealthier than each other. So heres the story: growing up my aunts and uncles would give me birthday presents that are never particularly good, im always appreciative even if i dont like it i'll lie and say i do. They'll give me things like towels, cups and plates, shirts and etc. Well, my mom would give them things like a brandnew PSP and a gold anklet and a expensive backpack. That always annoys me so much that my mom gives out stuff like that and I receive things like these in return when i know none of them are poor or cant afford to give better gifts. On my 17th birthday none of them gave me anything special either! I received a boquet of flowers from one and a Bluetooth speaker from another. Then my cousins 17th came, and my female cousin got a diamond ring from my mom that she gave away without telling me and my male cousin got a gold bracelet!! Even the male cousins got jewelery. None of my aunts and uncles ever EVER gave me anything thats even a tenth of that price. The Bluetooth was frankly the nicest thing i got from them. When my mom gave away the ring, she didnt even tell me it was from her. She told me its from my grandma which i of course wasnt upset by. Its my grandmas right to give my cousins whatever jewelery she has as we're all her grandkids. What i find really upsetting is finding out that my mom was the one who gave the ring. She told me after she gave it, i was upset and my grandma heard and scolded me. Saying my cousins are all my moms blood so its reasonable for her to give out things like that. I answered something like but never in my life my aunts and uncles gave me something that nice and we're blood. My grandma got angrier and said that i dont have a good character and is an awful person which upsets me even more. Of course i never said any of this to my aunts and uncles, i only expressed it to my mom and never took it out on my cousins. Reddit, please help. Cant i even be allowed to feel upset. Background: im an only child from divorced parents and i havent had much contact with my dad. Maybe the occasional birthday and xmas call. Can anyone exp why im feeling this way? Im just so upset i want to cry. Like i dont feel any repricocity from them towards me. My mom treated my cousins very well but they never treated me as well. She'd pay when we eat in restaurants and even when we split bills shed pay equally even though they have like 2-3 kids and their spouses. And its like my mom doesnt mind that she gives a lot to their children when they dont treat me the same? Im so angry im crying. I want my mom to be equal to them. Am i selfish?? I dont know how to change my mentality. Im so upset. I didnt even yell when i told her im upset then my grandma reacts badly and the conversation ends. Now im resentful to my mom and grandma even when i pretend im over it.	1643035539.0	sbnsoe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbnsoe/aita_for_feeling_upset_over_a_small_thing/	AITA FOR FEELING UPSET OVER A 'SMALL' THING?
iz0pjtxd	My BFF (30F) & I (30F) were friends since college and 12 years down the road, still inseparable (or so i thought).  We were constantly texting with each other, talk about everything, relationships, problems, travels and random stuff. One thing about her, she likes to ask about my opinions whenever she has problems about anything, including her issues with her husband.   Little back story, her husband just opened his own private firm. So my bff, being a concern wife, always likes to nitpick on her husband’s style of managing his firm - brought up issues such as staff relations & professionalism.   And one day she had a major fight with her husband and she turns to me & ask about my opinion on her “crisis”. So i replied her texts by being a neutral that i am, stating the facts of both (husband & her) perspectives & comforting her at the same time. She really wanted to win the argument so she screenshot our private conversation (my replies) and sent to her husband.   This is where the problem begins. Her husband suddenly texting me and attacking me, saying hurtful stuff that i interfere with their problems, his business & blaming me for the fight that happened between him & his wife. At that time, i was shocked and very angry but mostly just shocked because i just cant believe this thing just happened to me.   Fast forward, she just gave me a half-ass apology; she literally texted me “im sorry friend, lets move on to better days (with some emojis)”, her husband didnt even apologise to me & since i value our friendship, i felt the need to brush it off and just move on even though they hurt my feelings. And her birthday came, i wish her as usual. Days go by, im still hurting by their actions, she acted like nothing happened, she & her husband mend things of course. So i distant myself, hoping for a sincere apology from her (knowing that we’ve been friends for more than 10years i assumed she knows me well). But as days passed, nothing. She didn’t even ask about how im feeling. But she asks one of our mutual friends - if im okay, cause I’ve been ghosting her.   So one day, i confronted her and told her that im still angry and sometimes it triggers me. She replied me by saying “i already said sorry & you wished me on my birthday so i thought you moved on, because we all moved on from it. But since it triggers you so much, i suggest we stop contacting each other”. So i sent her a long text telling her about what I’m feeling that i received a half-ass apology from her and i thought she value our friendship and maybe come up with some efforts in apologising instead of suggesting to cut ties. And after that, she started to play victim. And she called one of our mutual friends, to trash-talk about me and she sided with her husband, implying that i over reacting and her husband did nothing wrong to me. And now, we’re not friends anymore.   The question is; am i wrong for having feelings?	1643035866.0	sbnwy3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbnwy3/aita_for_being_angry_at_my_bff_for_involving_me/	AITA for being angry at my BFF for involving me in her fights with her husband?
hrqquzdu	I am a single dad with 2 kids, Ellie (13) and cameron(15). My kids have very low attendance to the point if they have a few more days of I may get fined. Reasons for this is asthma attacks, sickness or anxiety attacks (both have asthma and anxiety)  Well, my son came down this morning complaining about hiw he felt sick. I gave him sympathy however told him that we will get fined if we have any more time of. He was sulking and doing everything slowly  but I couldn't let him have any more time off.  We were about to leave when my daughter quietly told me how she has the worst diarrhea. I didnt know what to do as we didn't have any meds for it so I told her to go get dressed as she can't come to school.   We got in the car and cam asked where ellie is, I told him she's not going to school today as she's ill. He was pissed at me as I refused to let him have time off. I didnt want to tell him his sister had diarrhea because I remember when I had it, my brother used to call me poopy butt.   I rang the school and said she had food poisoning but she will most likely be in the next day. They reminded me of her attendance. Anyways Cameron got back home about 20 minutes ago and he's refusing to talk to me. Now I feel like a prick    so AITA?	1643039154.0	sbp2sp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbp2sp/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_stay_off_but_not_my/	AITA for letting my daughter stay off, but not my son?
c3tu7ks6	I (15F) decided to cut my (31F) Mom off Officially a few months ago and my brothers keep making me feel bad about it. For context when I was 11 my parents split up and they decided that 50/50 for me and my 5 brothers was the best option.   My mom and I used to be really close but after my parents split she became a different person. She would bring men to the house, drink every day, call me names, talk bad about my dad, manipulate me, disappear on multiple accusations(like my bday) and make me watch my brothers so she could party. This led up to me getting picked up by my dad on multiple accusations. I would cry all the time due to the fact that I didn’t feel safe around my mom anymore.   I didn’t truly distance myself until one day my dad dropped me off at my moms house and when I went inside she had moved her boyfriend in. I was upset but I didn’t say anything. I was mainly upset that she never talked to me before hand to ask me if I was comfortable or not. How could she not consider how I felt? When I brought up the fact that I felt uncomfortable she said”you don’t want me to be happy?”   I then found out my mom was doing drugs!   I eventually moved to Texas with my dad and my siblings. before I moved she tried to kidnap my siblings and pretty much told me that she only needed me to to get at my dad. She went to rehab but if anything she got crazier😕  She would constantly text and call me apologizing and saying that she was better so I believed her because she was my mom, but it turned into her randomly sending me 20 dollars here and there. Which she would later try and gaslight me into texting her by saying “ I sent you 20 dollars last month so you have to message me”  My parents have been going to court and my dad is fighting for full custody of me and my siblings. My mom has been causing a mess, but I think my dad will get full custody due to the fact that my dad has a lot of messages of my mom saying horrible things and picures of my using drugs. My brothers have monitored calls when they talk to my mom.  But about 2 weeks ago I heard my mom on the phone with my dad saying  that she will give away her rights to me and my siblings if my dad gives her $250 a month. I’m alittle upset that she thinks we’re worth so little:(  I don’t really see my mom being in my future anymore! There is SO much more to story but I don’t feel that Comfortable writing that on here. I do apologize if my story doesn’t make that much sense. But I’m genuinely curious am I the asshole?  FYI: my dad has always been my caretaker, he’s the one who buys me food, clothes, anything that I want. My dad truly is the best person and the only one who listens to me, I’m very thankful. I’m also thankful for my mom for loving me for years but I cannot handle her being toxic anymore.   Thank you:)	1643039354.0	sbp5hh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbp5hh/aita_for_cutting_my_mom_off/	AITA for cutting my mom off?
f5ol7aki	My sister (18) has always been the kind of odd one out with our siblings in the sense that she never really makes an effort to talk to sit with everyone else at home as she’s always in her room upstairs. So recently she’s been constantly arguing and fighting with my mum over things my mum hasn’t even done. She keeps blaming my mum for everything that goes wrong with her and for the sake of keeping the peace I didn’t step in and try to defend my mum because I knew it would only get my sister to kick off all over again. So a couple of nights ago my sister fought my mum and now she has bruises. (And I am a Muslim btw, the reason I mention this is because all Muslims know about how important a mother is in the eyes of God, so my disbelief and shock that she did that was astronomical.) My sister left the house for a couple of nights and I swore I wouldn’t talk to her for doing that to our mum and that if she ever came back I would be no sister of hers. So today she came back to talk to my mum and my mum is happily forgiving her as if nothing happened. And she (mum) is saying that if I’m not the one who got into it with my sister so I’m not the one who has a say over whether I forgive her or not. So AITA for not wanting to forgive my sister for doing something I wouldn’t even forgive a stranger for?   I might be the asshole because I am now the reason there is some tension left at home and she didn’t actually do anything to me (Btw I am 22F).	1643040622.0	sbpmvq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpmvq/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_sister/	AITA for not forgiving my sister?
40whm8e3	My son plays in a baseball league that has two practices and two games a week. We go to the gym the remaining weekday evenings. It’s really the only quality time I spend with him and he enjoys it. There’s a second baseball league registering players and the coach asked if he could play. That would load up his week with often conflicting baseball schedules. It would also eliminate our gym time. I told my wife I didn’t want him doing that, but she ignored that and asked him if he wanted to join the second league. When I complained, she said I was selfish and it was up to him.

1icc6qge	I (25F) had recently graduated from college.  I landed a job out of state but due to covid the position was eliminated before I had a chance to start. I needed a job so I accepted a 3 month internship doing Marketing & Communications for our cities Parks and Rec department. This way I could have money coming in while I look for a new job.   I won’t lie, I didn’t love the job  I felt I was overqualified and under paid. However, I figured it would fun experience and a good opportunity to network. Things were going well at first, however due to covid restrictions our Rec centers were shut down which left us with some unexpected free time. Our director thought it would be a good time for everyone to pitch in and help clean and re-organize the centers.  The marketing team happily agreed and cleaned out our center. We were then asked to come to one of the other centers to help. We agreed.  The next day we reported to the other Rec center. Keep mind the Rec centers were closed to the public, our dress code was casual and we were suppose to spend the day cleaning and organizing a filthy hot basement that hasn’t been cleaned in a decade. I showed up wearing a tshirt, long jacket and some old shorts that went to my knees.   I was waiting in the office when a coworker that I had never met before approached me. We will call her Karen. Karen was a 50+ African American female who has worked for the department for 12 years. She is NOT my supervisor. She said that I was dressed very inappropriately and that if I wanted men in a office environment to respect me I should change. I was instantly pissed. I told her that I disagreed. I felt that I was dressed appropriately and that if the men in this office don’t respect women based on clothes that was their problem not mine. She got angry and stormed off.  I told my supervisor what had happened she was pissed. I would have dropped it but Karen wouldn’t stop. A couple hours later she came down and told my supervisor  that I was rude for snapping at her, I was dressed inappropriately and a “distraction to the men in this office”. My supervisor who was also wearing shorts (shorter than mine) told her that she was out of line and to stop. By that point I was angry and humiliated as she had done this in front of other coworkers. I started crying and ended up reporting her to HR. Now things have been tense at work. AITA for reporting her?	1643041400.0	sbpxky	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpxky/aita_for_snapping_at_my_coworker/	AITA for snapping at my coworker.
cvgziqsi	First of all sorry for any typos and formatting problems. Also if you see this story and have TikTok pls don’t make a video with it. My family doesn’t have reddit but they have TikTok.   My dad has cheated on my mom twice and she forgave him both times. Since then he claims he is changing and we all have believed him. However he loves to explode here and there. He will yell for no reason at all. For instance if you disagree with him with anything at all he will raise his tone. He can’t say anything without swearing and is just rude all around. Anyway, today he went to the supermarket and already started yelling at me for not helping him take the stuff out of the car right away. I didn’t help right away because it’s snowing outside i was barefoot. Anyway fast forward to me putting the stuff into the fridge he goes say hi to my mom in the other room there was a box that fell (we were packing cause we are moving) he instead of picking up the box walks all over it with dirty shoes. She just asked him to pick it up instead of walking on it. To which he responds “i didn’t drop it” and she says but you could pick it up and then out of no where he screams “You dropped it you can pick it up”. I then got visibly upset and he came be “nice” to me and was like “shh everything is fine” and I said I don’t like when you yell at my mom don’t talk to her like that. He got super angry and started yelling how I could go learn live without a dad. I didn’t say anything but my mom got mad at me saying I shouldn’t say anything to him. I’m really upset and crying right now. I wish he didn’t live here.

i93lgpl	My sister and I drove to a bridal shop (her trip) using my car for a specific reason, that mine has more space and we were taking multiple people.   On the way there, a rock hit my windshield and because it’s a Jeep, needed to be entirely replaced. She offered to pay for it, I told her don’t worry about it, I’ll leave it for now.  Yesterday, she asked her husband to come pick us up in my vehicle (hers was filled with crap). My brakes / tires were a lot more fucked than I realized, and he hit a rock, and busted my tire, but no other damage.   I had to pay almost $300 for a tow, now at least $2000 to get all the tires changed and the brakes fixed. Now I’m thinking of asking her for money for the windshield.  WITBA? Should she be responsible for literally any of these costs?

evnha21a	For starters I want to make it known I apologized to my friend because I know deep rooted issues are uncontrollable sometimes and i deal with the same things. My friend has talked to numerous guys over the internet and dating apps and she gets attached super quickly then is stuck on them for months-years at a time. She finally got over one boy whom she never met and moved on to the next one who didn’t want a relationship with her and now she’s down and upset again. I told her to stop using dating apps and try to focus on herself for awhile because jumping from person to person and getting attached isn’t a good look. She got upset and claimed I do the same thing and talk about my ex, whom I dated for 3 years and he just broke up with. I won’t deny that when updates happen i tell her, but the constant talk of my ex is not really there. I try to be supportive and make her feel good about herself, but the fact she cannot talk about anything else except boys and wanting a boyfriend is starting to get on my nerves. Maybe it’s because I’m beginning to move on from my ex and she’s still stuck? I’m not sure. But i told her that I’m just tired of hearing about the same people for months whom she either never met or met once or twice. It’s upsetting and i always want to support her, but she took it the wrong way and was upset. I apologized and said I did not want to be mean and that I will always be there to support her decisions, which is true. I just want to know if my opinion or feelings are valid as well.

7q1hvgbr	 My (23f) boyfriend (26m) and I have been dating for a couple years, mostly log distance due to Covid and different places of work. We have a greta relationship overall, although it’s been rocky many times - I usually blame the distance for this. We started very casually dating, and my not then boyfriend would go out of his way to put me down. He would constantly compare me with other women, criticize my looks, and rate me on a scale of 1-10. I didn’t really care at the time, because I didn’t see it progressing seriously although I really liked him, and saw it as an obvious outlet for his insecurities. I believe my facade of not being interested in him really bothered him (since we got along really well other than that) and he wanted to let me know he had options. This continued for a couple months and I moved away after graduating college. I’d say he started liking me before I liked him, but now we are in a committed relationship and both really enjoy each others company and compatible personalities. The distance will be ending soon, and I’m excited and nervous to see how we function in the same city.   Since then, he’s be so kind and caring and has explained multiple times he said those mean things out of insecurities of his own because he thought I was “out of his league” - I don’t think I am. Anyways, I’m still really bothered be these comments that are now multiple years old, and can’t help it at all. In the past two years I haven’t been a saint, and definitely took it out on him to put him down when I felt insecure by comments he made - not a good quality at all and something I have since worked on. Now, our relationship is steady (aside from a few times when I went through his phone and saw that he got the number of a girl from the bar, or said yes to be set up with another girl). He never pursued and I have unfortunately done some shady things too, although I’d never cheat on him.   Anyways, my post is quite trivial compared to others on this thread. But, sometimes I still find myself resenting him so much for the things he said to me years ago, even if he says nothing now. I can’t help it and I don’t know how to move on. Am I the asshole for holding these things over his head? Even if I don’t vocalize this to him.	1643044015.0	sbqxgv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqxgv/aita_for_resenting_my_boyfriend/	AITA for resenting my boyfriend?
iz7zmkxt	I am very torn and having difficulty, because I feel like I may be a horrible person and want some outside perspective.  My husband (31M) and I (29F) have been together for 10 years and married for 4. We have a very happy marriage and are usually very much on the same page, including with children. Our plan from pretty early on in our relationship was to have 2 kids and to start trying for a baby when I am approximately 30. I have a handful of nieces and nephews and several of my friends have had kids and I just adore any time I get to spend with them. I babysit whenever I can and I feel an ache in my heart for my own child. I still very much want to have kids, and the timing and everything we have discussed, but as I get older I also am developing a strong aversion to actually being pregnant.   My husband is adopted since his father was unable to have biological children. Maybe 5 years ago he asked me how I felt about adoption and I said that if we found ourselves unable to have children, I would definitely be open to it, but figured we would try first. Now I am starting to feel that I would prefer to adopt. I am afraid my reasoning is what makes me the AH though.  In loose order of importance to me:  1. I love sports and athletics. Athletic competition and weight lifting are a huge part of who I am. Over the past 2 years I have spent isolation time and gotten into better shape than before. I finally have a 6 pack. For the first time in my life I love myself and my body and I do not want to give up on that or my ability to be athletic.  2. With population and sustainability I always figured that leaving this earth on a net zero in the population was a good thing (husband and I being replaced by our 2 kids). With current inaction on the climate and laws being passed which are harmful to women and have the potential to create "unwanted" babies, I now am starting to feel that deciding to create new life myself is a little irresponsible when there is so much bad going on.  3. Pregnancy and childbirth scares the living shit out of me. I want no part in pushing a bowling ball out of my vagina while shitting myself.  So AITA and would I be an unfit mother for the reasons that I want to adopt instead of having a biological child?	1643044777.0	sbr87s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbr87s/aita_for_the_reasons_i_want_to_adopt/	AITA for the reasons I want to adopt?
i055nrqa	 My aunt, her husband (they’re separated), & 2 kids stay with us. My aunt always goes on about why it won’t work between her & her husband. She’s left him before but he eventually went back to her. She left him bc he doesn’t do much for her. All the years they’ve been together, not once has he given her flowers, taken her out for her birthday, celebrated her for Mother’s Day, tells her she’s beautiful, etc. Just something once in awhile to show his appreciation for her. I guess over the years it put a toll on her that he just didn’t do the little things where she became unhappy. She left him, went off with another woman for a couple of years before her husband showed up on her doorstep once she left that woman. She said she promised herself she’d never cheat on her husband again like that. Fast forward to present day and the husband learned nothing from the first time as he continued to do the same thing. It was almost like he was just content to be with her bc it was all he knew all these years. At this point, my aunt can’t do it anymore. There’s no returning, so they’ve discussed that they cannot be together. They’ve separated, but he still lives with us which makes it extremely uncomfortable for our family and my aunt just goes on about her business. She stated she wouldn’t allow anything to happen with anyone else until she’s divorced or at least until she knows that her & her husband can just get to a place of being strictly friends where he doesn’t get hurt or jealous like he does now every time she speaks to her male friends. Now, she speaks to her “best friend” everyday. She said if she didn’t end up with her husband, she probably would’ve ended up with her best friend bc they just click. She hadn’t heard from her best friend until recently last year when he finally split with his long term gf/mother of his kids. She goes to see him up north & has taken that trip at least 6/7 times within the last 8 months. She swears nothing happens but she speaks highly of him with how he greets her with a hug bc he knows she doesn’t even get that from her husband & he constantly tells her she’s beautiful & all of the things she wanted from her husband. I told her that’s still cheating bc although nothing physical is happening between the two of them, the intentions are there. I told her that she’s cheating emotionally on her husband & that she was being a hypocrite with her words. I also think the best friend is out of line. It’s no wonder the husband gets jealous bc although they’re separated, my aunt never gave him the time to accept their situation to move on bc she’s practically throwing it in his face whenever she speaks to her best friend. Her husband has even claimed himself as a third wheel to them. I told her while I support her finding happiness, I think she’s going about it the wrong way & being a total hypocrite. She didn’t like that..   AITA?	1643045089.0	sbrcju	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrcju/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_shes_a_hypocrite/	AITA for telling my aunt she’s a hypocrite..
h4px9aks	I’ve had a core group of friends since HS, and we’ve all stayed close after that. While in school one of my friends had befriended a new guy (let’s call him nick) who didn’t have a lot of friends, and he was ok, but we often had issues with his constant negativity. He would complain a lot about being depressed, how girls didn’t like him, he had no friends (we all tried), etc. When I had jobs outside school he would go there and hang around trying to talk to me, which was a little uncomfortable for me as well as my boyfriends (this has been common behavior with all my previous relationships).   Our senior year of HS I found out from a mutual friend that he used to / maybe still had a crush on me, but I didn’t really care because I was dating someone, I had no interest in nick, and I also tried keeping my distance so as not to make things more uncomfortable. Also was leaving for college so probably wouldn’t see much of him. I also just struggled having a friendship with him because he was so up and down, would talk about wanting to hurt himself online (we’d report it, talk to him, tried getting school to wellness check him, etc.), it was just a lot. Basically some of my friend group brought him into our larger circle, and I just went with it. I’d dodge most all attempts to have a an individual friendship because I didn’t want one.  Fast forward to today, and all my friends and I are in serious relationships, married, or have kids. Nick still hasn’t really had a long term relationship, but he’s definitely gotten a little better being his own person. I think that’s great for him. However we recently saw nick at an engagement party and I honestly hadn’t seen or talked to him in probably 3-4 years. When we were catching up I mentioned I got married recently, and while he did say congrats, he didn’t acknowledge my husband (despite my husband trying to for the sake of being polite to shake his hand), and just ignored him and talks to me?  So nick messages me online later that night and wants to get drinks and catch up. I didn’t even know how to respond. Like… even if he didn’t think about me romantically, asking a married woman to drinks and someone you haven’t talked to in years is weird. I’m honestly not really interested in a friendship with him apart seeing him at group gatherings and having small talk. I have guy friends that my husband and I hang out with (honestly my husband tends to adore all my friends, men or women), but nick is an exception.

7munex23	So I (21 NB) was feeling really left out and ignored when hanging with a friend (19 NB). I felt like I was interrupted and when I did text them to let them know how I feel they got mad at me. They told me they were having a bad day and bringing up this issue rn just wasn't it. They later explained but didn't say sorry and I said "okay I believe you" then the next day they went off on me saying how I feel was all in my head and they asked three of their friends if they do what I claimed they do. The friends claimed that they go out of their way to make me feel heard. I was told things are bigger in my head than they are irl. I was also told that I wasn't entitled to their time and how everyone feels entitled to their time and they are tired of it. They said they wanted to take a week break from online after going off and I texted them back explaining how I felt about what they said. They said I crossed their boundaries by messaging them after they said they wanted a break. In my eyes they could have just not replied or read or whatever. And I said that and they said that was antagonizing and that I was gaslighting their feelings and manipulating the situation. Idk maybe me saying then don't reply was an ass move but I felt so hurt by everything that was going on I didn't know what to do.	1643045696.0	sbrl30	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrl30/aita_for_expressing_how_i_feel/	AITA for expressing how I feel?
3va1mt2k	I (25f) am currently planning to get married later this year. My fiancé and I have been together 10 years and my family is extremely excited to welcome him to the family. After he proposed, I asked my three cousins to be my bridesmaids with beautiful boxes and personalized gifts along with a transparency letter. This letter gave them info on what tasks I would need help with (recommendations for makeup artists, photographers, etc.) and what they would have to pay for and what they wouldn’t, which included financial assistance for the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. They agreed.  When I asked for assistance regarding the already disclosed tasks, I was met with backlash and was told “this isn’t our responsibility”. Reluctant to stand up for myself, I agreed and have been doing everything almost completely on my own. After many other altercations and issues, I decided it was just best to only include them when needed.  We are currently a month away from my bridal shower and my MOH, my mother and myself have paid for almost everything, but have asked each bridesmaid to pitch in $50 for food, drinks and snacks. They quickly refused and asked why it was there responsibly to fund a party I was planning and asked if it was expected for them to pitch in for every event including the wedding. I understand that their financial situation is none of my business, but all three of them are very much the type of people to brag about their income, drive nice cars and spend crazy amounts of money in restaurants and personal items. I feel as though I am not good enough for help and fed up with begging for the help they already agreed to give. I decided that if they were able to go back on their word, then so was I. We will no longer be paying for the things we said we would, such as hair and makeup and will no longer be giving gifts . My family thinks I am being unfair and unreasonable as it is my wedding and should be the one to appreciate them standing beside me and shouldn’t expect financial assistance. They said if I can’t afford it then I shouldn’t do it. However, my mom is in my corner saying this is a job for a bridesmaid and if they didn’t want to help, they should have said no.  So am I the asshole?	1643045966.0	sbrov8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrov8/aita_for_asking_my_bridesmaids_to_help_pay_for_my/	AITA for asking my bridesmaids to help pay for my bridal shower?

My friend told me that when he was a student applied to jobs he would lie that his availability was open and would get more interviews, but some employers would get quite frustrated during interviews.

8fmxqfsn	Hello everyone :)  Me and my best friend play an online game where you can also play with other people all around the world and fight bosses and so on.  Normally, I don’t really engage in these multi-player games because I always get incredibly nervous when playing with random people that I don’t know. My friend on the other hand often plays with different people and encouraged me to try it out.   In order to help me get over my fear, she invited me to play with her and some of her online friends. Safe to say, I had a great time and enjoyed it a lot! Since then, I‘ve been trying to play more multi-player to get rid of my nervousness and I‘m having a lot of fun!  Now, maybe a week later, I asked my best friend to play again. She happily agreed and I asked whether we should invite the people from last time. Again, she agreed and I asked if she would talk to them.  After 10 minutes of waiting and no answer, I decided to ask one of the girls myself and she was ecstatic to hear from me again and immediately said she‘d love to join us.  I thought my best friend would be happy to hear that, but when I told her that I asked the girl myself, she got silent and later accused me of ,,stealing her friend“ and ,,always putting myself in the center of attention.“  I never intended to ,,steal“ her friends or beg for attention. But it‘s true that she played months with them while I only know them for about a week, so I can see where she is coming from. Besides that, my best friend is not an outgoing person and mostly relies on me and her online friends, so maybe I was really overstepping boundaries here.  AITA? Should I have just waited for her to text them?	1643046234.0	sbrslj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrslj/aita_for_stealing_the_friends_of_my_best_friend/	AITA for ,,stealing“ the friends of my best friend?
fpred	Okay, I would love to give more details when I'm more coherent but I'm half asleep and just feeling frustrated so I decided to seek for outsiders' stances on this matter.   My partner and I rent a common room in a singaporean public housing apartment where right outside our door is the connected living room and dining room (like about 1-2 metres from our door is the dining table where the landlord's gatherings take place). The walls are thin and as such noise has always been a point of contention. To be very fair the landlord loves watching movies (living room) till late (past midnight) but turns it down ever since we brought it up to him. I can still hear it but I try to wear earbuds to drown out most of it as possible.    For context, my partner is an overworked F&B staff, talk about 13 hour all-day standing work days, and only 4 off-days in a month. She has to get up extremely early due to travel time (about 6-7am) and comes home late about (9-10pm) for the same reason too. I also have to get up early a few days of the week due to work, but I definitely have more chances to rest. As such, it is really important to us, especially her, to have enough rest as possible. In the past, we manage to set an expectation that if he were to have guests outside, which no matter how quietly they talk we can definitely hear it from our room + to all their drinking/cutlery/eating, they would leave by around midnight. But due to the upcoming chinese new year festivities, he has dropped us a message that on one day, his friends will be over till about 1-2am, and as previously said, they're not quiet enough or far enough for us to not be right in the area of hearing every single bit. Now, THANKFULLY, it is my partner's off-day that day, so we are okay with sleeping at 2am... but the more I thought about it, if it wasn't her off-day or mine .... we'd just have to be forced to sleep for only 4 hours that day?  Honestly, for some many other occassions and reasons also associated with the landlord, I have developed sleep anxiety being in our current space and we are of course, looking to move soon when our lease it up because our schedule clearly isn't compatible with his. But WIBTA for feeling that even if he gives us a headsup, this is not a very reasonable expectation? This was the statement:  "4th Feb Fri, my friends will be coming over for Chinese New Year celebration so expect late night till 1-2am."  By the way, if our room was more inside and not right next to where all the festivities are... I'd be more chill. Please feel free to ask for more INFO or what not.	1643047407.0	sbs9bp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbs9bp/wibta_my_landlord_gave_a_headsup_that_hell_be/	WIBTA: My landlord gave a headsup that he'll be having a gathering up till 2am (and the living room is right outside my door)
izc4ib9n	My boyfriend recently broke up with me. It had been a one sided relationship since the middle of the summer, so I’ve been emotionally checked out for nearly six months. I’m ready to move on to something new, but I can’t help feeling like an asshole for moving on so quickly after our two year relationship ended. Obviously I’m not looking for a new long term relationship right now, just testing out the waters. Should I take more time after being officially single, or is it okay that I’m ready now after not feeling supported or loved for six months?	1643048611.0	sbsq67	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbsq67/aita_for_moving_on_so_quickly/	AITA for moving on so quickly?
573n3i7h	So a few years ago, my brother visited Africa (mostly as a resume builder) to do some work. At the time, someone had gifted him a popular Ethiopian book and signed the front cover with a JD Salinger quote. All rather touching I think. Anyway, he has since moved across the country and did not take the book with him. It has been sitting on a bookshelf for 5 years when I found it. For context, my older brother has always been a known raging asshole to me.  We recently went on a family vacation. While on the plane, I told him I had found the book and read it over the summer. I told him it had made an impression and was probably one of my favorite books now. I also told him how beautiful I thought the quote in the beginning was as JD Salinger is also a favorite of mine. He had absolutely no clue what book I was talking about. The quote in the intro did not ring a bell, and neither did the friend who had signed it. After a couple minutes of trying to jog his memory, I googled the book cover and showed him and he finally remembered the book, but admitted he had never read it.  Very quickly, he demanded that I return the book to him as soon as possible since it was his. At the time, I told him I couldn’t find the book, because I selfishly wanted to keep this book that I fell in love with and that he didn’t even have an impression of. Now, two months later, he is still insisting that I ship him this book.  I am definitely under the impression that he had no interest in the book until he realized how much it meant to me (again, my brother has consistently found a way to be a unsolicited prick to me) and only wants it now so I can’t have it. I understand it was originally his, but after all these years, am I the asshole for wanting to keep it?	1643048747.0	sbss19	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbss19/aita_22f_for_keeping_my_brothers_27m_forgotten/	AITA (22F) for keeping my brother’s (27M) forgotten book?
ehgh2k45	I 18M still live at home with my parents. My neighbor 18F still lives at home with her parents. Over the weekend she had a friend, who we will call Josie, come to her house to spend the night and we hit it off. My neighbor who we will call Sara noticed this and practically set us up together. She was the one who got us off on our own and making out. Later that night Sara helped Josie sneak out of her house and over to mine. We had sex. Everything was fine we both consented and used protection. The problem was with Sara. Sara is furious with both of us and has not spoken to either of us since. She has not even opened our messages since then. I thought at first it was because Sara might have liked me and was mad at her friend for taking me. I ruled this out though because of the countless times me and Sara have been alone together in a house or in a bedroom. She could’ve made her move but didn’t.

ix3tyxgl	I Had A Girlfriend (5-6 Months) , I broke Up with her for multiple reasons that are my own . I wasn’t mentally healthy . As a Young Man I wasn’t sure of my direction in life , It was getting harder and harder for my family to pay the same bills they’ve always had .Basically I just needed to focus on myself and my situation. I broke up with her through text , honestly not trying to be heartless .   (Made Sure To Explain Myself Because I valued Her Opinion )  After that I didn’t see her for 3 Weeks , The next Time I saw Her she was at my friends house with her new boyfriend  , honestly it seemed like she was rather flaunting her newfound relationship rather than actually being in it . . . If that makes sense .   (My Friend Was Not Her New Boyfriend)  So , During This Time At My Friends House She Had Sex in The Room Next To Me , It seems like she wanted me to hear it ??? . Which I find very strange . Respectfully I don’t care to hear that .   (My Friend Lives In A House That’s Considered A Manor so , She Had Other Places to Choose From . This is a Gigantic House)  So I left , Didn’t Say Bye To Anyone , It honestly felt like a setup .

5qb5ic1e	2 years ago I moved in with my bf and his roommate (A). My bf and I share the master bedroom while our roommate (A) has his own room.  My bf and our roommate (A) have separate refrigerators and have never shared food. We never go into his stuff, however for the past year we’ve noticed that our oat milk is going really quickly all the time. We started hiding it in various spots in our fridge but every time he would find it and move it which is how we confirmed he has been stealing our oat milk (he also casually confessed to it a year ago).  It’s gotten progressively more annoying and my bf finally sent our roommate a text about it because I’ve been begging him to say something to him. I also bought a cheap refrigerator lock for us but that was too far and my bf is mad at me for doing that. He said it’s childish and stupid to use a fridge lock.

9fx1bboi	Long story short, me and this guy were together for 10 years. We finally broke up because I found out he cheated on me AGAIN. So you can imagine my pain and heart break when he, not only started dating someone new, but moved her in with him within 2 months of us breaking up. I only found out about all this (I deleted him from everything) because his sister posted a picture of them at her wedding. A wedding HIM AND I were supposed to go to together.   I wanted revenge. Knowing he's a cheater I knew he would start sending pictures/videos. And then eventually we'd fuck. Yes that is exactly what happened.   After a week of him staying with me I felt bad. I told his now girlfriend. She said she was happy I told her, but everyone I've asked about this says I shouldn't have told her. My main reasoning was when I found out (the first time) he cheated on me, apparently everyone BUT ME knew. It was so humiliating.   I've cried about this, prayed about this, even talked to my Uber driver about it haha.	1643050451.0	sbtfb1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtfb1/aita_for_telling_my_exes_new_girlfriend_that_were/	AITA for telling my exes new girlfriend that we're still hooking up?!
zija8	My husband and I have been searching for a dog for months through various websites and shelters. We found one that was listed by a private party on a public adoption website that is also used by rescues. We filled out the adoption application in December and heard back immediately. We talked back and forth for two weeks before the adopter informed me that the transition would be too difficult on their family and decided to cancel the adoption process. I told them I understood this was a difficult process but if anything changes to let me know.  A few days ago, they contacted me to let me know they made the "final decision" about moving forward with the adoption process as they're moving next week and don't want to take the dog. We were thrilled as well as anxious and nervous for the sudden addition to our family, but we were still looking for a dog and were excited that things ended up working out. We set up a date and location to meet. This is when things went downhill. They rescheduled on us 5 times. I told them that this is super concerning for us and if they wouldn't make it just let us know. They did end up showing up with all of the dogs things, bed, crate, blankets, toys, treats, previous paperwork, everything. But then told us that they didn't know how to finish the adoption process online and would do it from home. They also brought their daughter who was crying in the backseat to say goodbye. They said goodbye and left. We talked every day since then so that we could sign the adoption paperwork from the website. Each time, they said they didn't know how to do it and they'd try again.   I got word today that now they want the dog back because their daughter is not transitioning well with the dog gone. I told them that was none of my responsibility and to send the adoption contract so we could finalize it. I reached out to the website I applied for the dog on to let them know what's going on because according to the websites terms, we're supposed to agree upon the adoption and then  finalize the adoption contract. We never discussed us using this as a trial period or giving the dog back if things didn't work out. I explicitly said multiple times that we would adopt him. I don't know in what world dropping off a dog and all of its things is not coming to a decision on rehoming it.

ig9mftxj	So this is nothing to do with trust or fear of cheating. Basically my hen do is in the uk, close to home and fairly cheap so everyone can be included and not feel left out or feel bad for declining. I’m also having a pretty tame hen do because MiL and SiL have asked for certain things to not be included (penis, rude jokes/questions, not too silly/drunk).   We do have money but we’ve been saving like crazy for wedding and we want to buy a house and we want a baby so everything is going towards that. Included me not going wild with a hen do.   His brother was dead set on abroad and I have a few issues with it.  1. Covid  2. Cost  3. My brothers can’t go because they are in uni/school. And 4. I’m super jealous as we’ve not had a holiday yet due to being broke when we first got together and then when we finally started earning money covid hit. I even booked a reasonably priced honeymoon in the uk to avoid all my reason above.  Brother says abroad is cheaper than going out in the uk/ where we live and that the “stags” pay for the groom anyway.   Am I wrong for being upset/jealous. Fiancé originally wanted to go gokarting and for a meal. I do want him to enjoy himself and have fun I just feel like his brother is being a bit unreasonable for not budging on the abroad thing.   I know the jealousy thing is a ‘me’ issue and I could just get over it, but I guess I want a non jealous view to see if I’m unreasonable for the other reasons.

hogu6kr8	In my town, I'm renowned for being someone who goes walks a lot, ergo I run in to people I know very often. As a result, when I see people I know quite often, I will typically quip something along the lines of "stop following me" or "why are you following me?" It's meant in a friendly, joking manner. The typical course of events is that I make the joke, it gets a laugh or a chuckle, and then a conversation will begin or we will both continue along with our day. Until today.  Enter stage left, a girl whose real name I will not use so let's just call her Eve. Eve is walking past me with a girl (who I am assuming is her friend/girlfriend/idk?). Meanwhile, I am walking home from a lovely, health-conscious lunch of grilled cheese and French fries that I got at a place nearby. The following is a transcript of our interaction:  &#x200B;  Eve: "Why do I keep running into you?"  Me: "I dunno. Maybe you're following me?"  Eve" *\*turns around and gives me a look that makes me feel like the smallest thing in the world.\**  Eve: "That is an exceedingly uncomfortable suggestion. Why would you think/say that?"  Me: *visibly taken aback*: "I dunno..."  Eve: *\*departs\**  &#x200B;  The interaction made me feel bad and I (sort of) want to apologize to her because I think she misunderstood my joke (or did understood and didn't think it was funny), but I also think it's fairly obvious that it was not meant seriously.

izd55uaw	This is my first post. AITA for thinking my sister and her two kids (boys 10 and 14) coming for a weekend should contribute something towards groceries? I live in a very expensive resort town where everything costs more, especially food. My sister and her two sons were visiting us (me and my partner, and we don’t have kids) and in preparation I made a huge pot of chili, bought snacks and cheese, and had eggs etc ready for the morning.  I have food allergies so I didn’t get what I was allergic to but bought a variety of food. All good the first night and morning. My partner and I took them to a local ski area and got them over $100 in discounts for passes and rentals making it very cheap for my sister and the boys to spend a day in the mountains. Later when dinner came up I was surprised I was supposed to supply it again. I eat very different that this family (vegan and gf) and the boys don’t like that kind of food. Again I had provided lunch and snacks after skiing. My sister and I paid for pizza for everyone and my partner went to the store for more drinks and snacks. My sister went to a bakery twice and bought things for her and the boys but nothing for us (partner not gluten free). She also took home the bread she had bought. AITA for being mad she contributed nothing? For context she makes way more money than me and I just got absolutely walloped with vet bills a week earlier (think almost $10,000) and I am way in debt.

xpxjf	So my partner has been offered a new job! Closer to home, company car, more $ and one WFH day a week, options for progression seem good. Slightly less job security as new company is a bit smaller but for all intensive purposes seems like a good gig.   She hates her current job. Has been flat out told nowhere to go in terms of growth. It’s CS based and the phone calls can be older people who can’t work an app or want to complain about a vehicle. I’ve heard multiple calls as she is currently full time WFH and it’s fucking inane. Likes half the people she works with other half not so much. Pretty good job security however a fairly covid proof workplace.   She is worried about Covid with the new job as not WFH. Small worry with job security but not a huge issue as I can pay mortgage and everything thing else if needed on my salary. Son is at daycare but she’s worried if covid kicks off here she can pull him out as WFH currently but won’t be able to at new job.   I’m over covid we are both triple jabbed I think life needs to go on at this point.   Now the asshole stuff, I told her it’s up to her I really don’t mind either way.  However I do not want to listen to her complain about her current job anymore. I was pretty blunt about it. I’ve supported her through new job applications listened to hours of complaints about the work, other staff and her boss. It’s the bane of my existence for half an hour after I get home. Yes I’ve discussed this with her multiple times and it’s slightly better than what it used to be but I’m over it big time.   Before you ask yes I understand we all need to vent. It’s dragging me down at times.

Every single day, my roommate turns the thermostat to “Off.” I have confronted him twice about this, arguing that the heat should never be off when it is this cold and that it is expensive to keep turning it off and on (every time I see it off I turn it back on). Despite my complaints, he has continued to turn if off every day. We received a HUGE energy bill for last month and I am refusing to pay half of it due to my roommates ridiculous habit. AITA for not giving him the money?	1643052123.0	sbu2jd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbu2jd/aita_for_overcharging_my_roommate_for_our_energy/	AITA for over-charging my roommate for our energy bill?
dc3zla39	I (19F) live at home with my parents and when the pandemic began in early 2020 my mum had the idea of opening a family business because she was getting bored of being locked indoors. She wasn't expecting much success but it has grown a fair bit and she has to do a ton of work in order to retain that level of money coming in. My dad helps out and I play my part sometimes too, but nowhere near to the level that my parents suddenly expect from me. But as of recently, they're expecting me to outright become an unofficial employee for them, and have offered to pay me HALF of minimum wage in return.  Fair enough I think, but this is all done at home, and our house is pretty small which makes the 'work space' quite claustrophobic and hectic, and I have really bad trouble focusing on things for a period of time due to ADHD. To show how much my ADHD affects my focus, I was home tutored for a period of time between 16 and 17 and my tutor was heavily concerned about my lack of focus and awareness whilst working at home, I was struggling to do more than 45 minutes a session because of all the distractions around the house and it became really overwhelming for me. So I would be driven to a local library about 15 minutes away with my tutor and he commented how much immediately better my focus became at school work and I started succeeding.  The business itself has also caused problems with general family. The constant arguments are seriously ruining my mental health and makes me think I am nothing but a money making tool to my parents, and not actually their daughter. I will literally wake up and not even 10 minutes of being awake, my dad will tell me "There's some work downstairs that we would like you to help out on" and it just immediately puts me in a really sour mood. I'm not even allowed to wake up and think about my day.  I have been searching for a part time job for a few months now and have a decent amount of interviews secured as of right now, but feel demotivated to even take those opportunities anymore because it'll upset my parents if see me working for others and not for them. Again, despite them knowing I cannot focus easily at home because my ADHD makes it impossible for me not to get distracted by my surroundings.  I no longer share what I do in my own time with my parents or tell my parents how I feel in general, because every time they somehow bring the family business into it and make me feel bad for not putting their business into the picture. It seriously demotivates from the business even more outside of the reasons I already put.  Am I in the wrong here? Or am I in the right for wanting to stand my ground and go my own path instead of my parents expecting me to take theirs and follow their expectations.	1643052931.0	sbudy4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbudy4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_workhelp_out_for_my/	AITA for not wanting to work/help out for my family's run-at-home business?
fpxix4j4	My (20F) sister and i (19F) dont have a good relationship since we were kids, the last years we bonded a little bit but since 2020 that she hasnt been a good person at all. At first she had some eating dissorders and refused to talk about it, my parents and i offered her a therapist and even taking her somewhere were she could get help but she refused, she even got in horrible fights with my parents over food, and her not having any social or outside life. ON 2021 she started eating healthy again because she met this guy she's dating now (20M). Him and i got along, we are friends and i usually helped my sister go on dates.  On september 2021 we were home alone and she asked me if i could cover her if my parents called while she was out with him. I agreed with the condition she send me some texts telling me where she was (for safety it was late) around 9pm my parents called asking me why wasnt my sister answering the phone and itold them she was asleep and that i would "wake her up". After that call i started texting her to answer the phone and she didnt answer, i called her a millon times, million texts and even texted her bf on instagram... it was 11pm and she wasnt answeting so i told my parents she went out with that boy and they told me they were gonna get in contact with her while they come home. At 12 my sister opens the door and asks "what happened? I talked to mom and dad" after all those hours of being worried she didnt even apologize. So i stoped talking to her. On january 2022, before my b-day my parents ask me if i could talk to her again, i didnt forgive her but we talked again.   Now im 3 weeks before a big final and my grandma is in hospital. Yesterday my sister offered to stay at the hospital with her to spend the night, it was 7pm and i went to check in her room if she was getting ready to go and she was ASLEEP, didnt even hesitated and went to spend the night so my grandma wasnt alone on the condition that at 8am (today) she comes to the hospital so i can go home to study. I woke up at 7am to help some doctors check on my grandma. At 8am i texted my sister "are you coming?" And she said she was getting ready. 8:30 i started to get mad cause she didnt appear and i couldnt waste any minute of study (my books are too heavy to carry around) finally at 9:15 she enters my grandma's room all dressed up and with make up on while i didnt even had breakfast.

4dp66sox	AITA  Me [M34] and MIL [F40] don't see eye to eye. After repeated attempts of me trying to salvage a relationship for my partners sake. Over our 6 year relationship I have done free screen repairs on MIL and her BF phones when broken, gave free wallpaper paste when they redecorated and looked after their dogs when on holiday. Last Xmas to my face in front of my partner and her brother said to me that I wasn't good enough for my partner/her daughter.  Even though 3 of us heard she claims she never said it or remembers it. Recently her bf came to do one wall of decorating at our house and used some wallpaper paste which afterwards she asked me for money to replace. I have flat out refused to give any money back and now won't do anything in return. Am i the arsehole for refusing to pay for the wallpaper paste?	1643053957.0	sbustj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbustj/aita_back_and_forth_with_mil/	AITA - Back and Forth with MIL
4va5f1ru	So I (34M) have a son (13M) and recently I got him a game called undertale for his birthday. I did some research on the game after I bought it and then I found a boss that said “Kids Like you should be burning in hell” (My side of the family is very religious so this wasn’t gonna happen at all) so I deleted the game from his ps4 and told him he was no longer allowed to play the game and that’s final. Well it appears he really liked playing it and now he won’t talk to me. And since he decided not to talk to me I’ve kept punishing him as I won’t except that type of disrespect.  My wife and my son think I’m the A-hole, but I feel as if I’m in the right and trying to protect my son from viewing himself in that way. So, am I the A-hole?	1643054210.0	sbuwaq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbuwaq/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_play_a_game/	AITA for not letting my son play a game
6nijw1to	So I'm a college student living with my roommate who plays poker online as a side hustle. My roommate has never played poker for real money before, but he watches poker youtube videos so he knows the fundamentals of the game. He was standing behind me watching me play online when I needed to go to the bathroom. It was going to be a really short bathroom break and I timed it so that it was right after the blinds passed by me (meaning I wouldn't be forced to lose any money until I came back).  When I left, I had around 140 dollars in the game, which is not a ton of money but not a negligible amount by any means. When I came back, I found that I was up to 300 dollars so naturally, I asked my roommate what happened. He was really excited and said he went all-in because he saw I had a good hand.   The hand was Ace-King offsuit, which for people unfamiliar with poker is quite a good hand but not necessarily something you all-in with all the time. I didn't really care about that though because I wouldn't have wanted him to do anything even if I had Ace-Ace. I just don't want people touching my computer or gambling my money when I'm not around.  I was kinda pissed and I basically told him to never touch my computer or any of my things again. My roommate got angry as well and has not spoken to me since. I feel kinda conflicted because it was a good hand and he did win me money but I'm really mad that he thought it would be okay to gamble my money and use my computer without my permission.	1643054501.0	sbv0lp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbv0lp/aita_for_being_pissed_at_my_roommate_even_though/	AITA for being pissed at my roommate even though he won me money in online poker?
7ev0ul83	I joined a company about 5 years ago and instantly became good friends with one of my managers, Jack. We formed a small friend group at work that frequently hung out together, including SOs (movies, drinking, dinners, shows, you name it). I planned the first dinner and was voluntold to be the permanent organizer for our outings after.  One of these “friends” was June. I never liked June - she is known for treating anyone she considers a subordinate horribly (eg screaming at people for not bringing her coffee), and was horrible to me until she found out I was Jack’s protege. But she and Jack had been friends before I showed up, so I included her in the group events.  About 3 years ago, things got weird. June was having marital issues and developed a pretty ridiculous crush/obsession with Jack. Constantly wanted to talk about him, made weird comments about people mistaking them for a couple when out at work events, always in his office. She even had a complete meltdown bawling in my office when I was trying to work late one night because Jack had won some award and hadn’t told her, and she felt that she should have been the first person he told as one of the most important people in his life (she wasn’t). That was just it for me, and I told him all the weird stuff she had been doing out of his earshot.  Jack was angry. His wife was angry. He tried to create some distance, but was willing to be civil to avoid awkwardness at group events.  Instead, I just stopped inviting her to things. I cared a lot more about the comfort of Jack and his wife than her and never wanted her around anyway. So I stopped sending her invites and even straight up lied about regular outings we had because I didn’t want her showing up. I told everyone she had done some uncomfortable stuff and that I wasn’t going to invite her for a bit. I never talked with June about it.  She found out about one such outing somehow (we changed the time and location from the usual spot), showed up at the restaurant, and sat at a nearby table staring at us throughout dinner. After that, most people decided to cut her off entirely, and not communicate with her except as required for work. One mutual friend contacted me privately though to say that June was devastated and angry at me, and that what I’d done was cruel. That while her behavior was bizarre, I knew June was going through a rough divorce and intentionally got her cut off from the only support group she had. June changed jobs shortly after. It’s been a while, but I saw her recently while out walking, and it made me think about it again.

31ssbfki	My husband (M30) and I (F30) signed papers in April 2021, so we're legally married, but will be having our wedding ceremony in March 2022 due to covid. I sent out invitations this month and my dad texted me. On the invitation, it says, "Mr. & Mrs. O along with Mr. & Mrs. L invite you to the wedding of their children \_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_". My dad asked why he and my mom were addressed as "Mr. & Mrs", instead of "Dr. & Dr". I said I decided to have it as Mr. & Mrs. since my mother-in-law is an extremely sensitive woman who makes mountains out of molehills. I was just trying to avoid drama/play it safe so I kept it as "Mr. & Mrs." since I didn't want my mother-in-law thinking they were showing off. My dad responds, "On formal invitations, you should write the appropriate titles. Mom and I worked hard for that. I'm just bummed that you didn't consult with us beforehand." I realized that in my attempt to keep peace with my in-laws, I disregarded my parents' feelings.  My parents have raised me all of my life, drilling the importance of considering other's feelings and staying humble. I honestly thought they'd see the invitation, question it, but be understanding if I explained my reasoning of trying to avoid drama or negativity from my in-law's unreasonableness. When I had the invitations made, I did what I thought was the right thing, because my dad and mom will always love and forgive me, but I won't get that same kind of understanding with the in-laws. I apologized and joked that although I hope this is my first and last marriage, that if I ever get married again, I'd put the proper titles next time. Dad laughed and we were good.   Later that night, I talked to my mom. I apologize and let her know that I had no malicious intentions. I was just trying to be a sensitive daughter-in-law, but didn't consider my own parents' feelings. Since invitations were already mailed out, I said it was too late to get them redone, but that I'm made sure it would be written on the wedding programs. She goes, "We planned to have the invitation framed, but it just hurts that you would not respect the title that we worked hard for to cater to your in-law." I proposed solutions like having wedding programs with the correct titles, making sure the MC at the wedding announces them as Dr. & Dr., etc. She was still upset and complains saying my actions were disrespectful. "IS YOUR EGO THAT DAMN IMPORTANT? I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE A CONSIDERATE PERSON! MY WHOLE LIFE YOU'VE TOLD ME TO DOWNPLAY MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS BECAUSE I NEEDED TO BE 'HUMBLE' AND I THOUGHT I WAS DOING JUST THAT AND NOW YOU'RE GIVING ME SH\*T FOR IT." I hung up.  I know I don't need to be a considerate daughter-in-law, but honestly I do this for the sake of my HUSBAND, because I love him. I'm already dealing with a lot of stress from this whole wedding ceremony planning, and I just wish my mom would've extended me the grace I needed. I admit I messed up with the invitations, but am I an asshole for being mad at the end?	1643058064.0	sbwdfn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwdfn/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_about_an_argument_over/	AITA for yelling at my mom about an argument over wedding invitations?
emt7bfql	I know even the title sounds kinda petty, but my bf (24M) and I (22F) fought recently because his friend (let's call her Jenny) recently started trying to add me on Instagram but I ignored her. Multiple times. He told me he was "irritated" at me for doing that and accused me of essentially "raging/lashing out" at her, putting him in an uncomfortable spot between Jenny and me in the chance that she brings it up to him about it.   To give some backstory, when my boyfriend and I first started dating more than three years ago, on our second date I met a friend of his for the first time, which- spoiler alert- did not go well. To put it briefly, Jenny didn't really acknowledge my presence for the first few minutes, only talking to my boyfriend until I stepped in to introduce myself. There were a few other things, but in general it just felt like she didn’t care, which was funny for someone who demanded she had to meet me when she found out my boyfriend was dating. I knew she wasn’t interested in my boyfriend in *that* way because there was an ex she still had feelings for, but ultimately I found her fake and did not like her. I met her another time and still didn’t like her, so I still continue to dislike her to this day, because there has been nothing to change my mind otherwise.  Which is why I thought it was fine to ignore her suddenly recent slew of ‘add’ requests and comments on my boyfriend’s posts about me, but my boyfriend doesn’t see it that way. He thinks that even though she’s seemingly putting in effort to be friends with me now, I’m making it a problem by not letting my feelings go + not giving her more chances. According to him, I’m also causing a problem because then he’ll have to deal with the tension and tell her that I don’t like her.  I was very angry, especially when he never expressed this much annoyance at Jenny for what she did back then. He kept telling me that I’m caring too much about Jenny when she doesn’t even care about me the same, that it doesn’t matter because I’m more important to him, and that if he had to, he’d choose me over her. So when he told me I’m making him confused because as I continue to express my dislike for her while I tell him it’s ok to be friends with her, I told him flat out to stop being friends with her then.   After our argument, I did follow Jenny back because I felt bad and wanted to make amends, but to be honest I really don’t want to. I also told him that what I said was out of anger and I don’t actually think I should get a say in who he’s friends with or not. I fully believe this, but at the same time I really don’t think I can stand Jenny and wish my boyfriend would distance himself from her (a bit selfish?).  WIBTA if I told him I wish he would stop being friends with Jenny? Would I also BTA like my bf says if I just unfollow her on Instagram regardless of whether or not he still continues to be friends with her?	1643058271.0	sbwg9g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwg9g/wibta_for_telling_my_boyfriend_not_to_be_friends/	WIBTA for telling my boyfriend not to be friends with someone (+ unfollow her on IG)?
eqajblxi	 I'm new to living with partners and as I am disabled and can't work right now i am home the most often. I was also hospitalized recently for mental health issues and before my hospitalization I hadn't been doing well, more so in the weeks before but also over the past couple of years, and that is the state my partner knows me in (depressed unable to do many chores constantly tired ect.) During that time we moved in together and I never had the energy or motivation to build a routine, I am autistic so that basically means I got nothing done ever. Also during that time they were asking me to pitch in more and clean more because they work and I tried but wasn't very successful.  Now that I am out and on medication that works I am finally able to get a routine and settle in to our place that we have lived in for a year. Here's the issue, my partner has laid claim over dishes as a chore but rarely does them but I didn't want to fuck with their system of just putting stuff in the sink and doing it when they can, but now that I'm able to do household tasks i have taken over most of them  as when I'm not depressed I am a clean freak and like things a certain way that way usually being what is easiest for me to maintain while things being as clean as possible and as I'm home 24/7 I do all of the cleaning stuff throughout the day. Today is her first day off since I got back she started moving all the dishes that I was going to do today in the sink breaking my system and making it a sensory nightmare for me to fix as well as messing up my routine for the day. I asked if she was going to do dishes today and she said no I'm just tiding. I then explained to her the routine I have and that I am more than happy to do the dishes and keep the kitchen clean as well as cook and just asked that dishes don't get put in the sink but in the dishwasher and put next to the sink if they need to be handwashed so that I can do them one by one without filling the sink with wet food. She got weird and quiet after our discussion and now is angrily doing the dishes after telling me to get out of the kitchen. I have no idea what I did wrong when we talked I was on the verge of a melt down so I was probably harsher than necessary but I thought taking over the chores would make her happy as it removed tasks she needed to do on her days off but she has been mad at me for most of the day. Am I the asshole here?   (Sorry for formatting I'm on mobile)	1643058320.0	sbwgxh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwgxh/aita_for_taking_over_household_tasks/	AITA for taking over household tasks
igco67n5	So we were having sex, he does this thing where he’ll stop and whisper “do you like it” in my ear. In the moment I told him that it would turn me on if he insisted that I like it while continuing to fuck me. We got back at, after a minute he stops and whispers “do you like it” in my ear. What?   A moment ago we were laying in bed and I thought about it so I decided to bring it up. I think I came off the wrong way but I meant to just joke around and I was curious as to why he wouldn’t listen when I told him what I liked.   No response. I stop and then continue again. No response. I wait for a few minutes and ask why he’s not responding. “I don’t know what to say”.   Here’s the thing, I specifically tell him that when he doesn’t respond I feel like he’s not listening and I will gradually get more frustrated. No response. So then I get pissed and say “I just told you I like it when you respond and then you didn’t respond” (btw this is like minutes of no response not 5 seconds)   The longer this goes on the more I talk and the more “mad” I sound.  He got up and left the bedroom. Honestly I started laughing. I almost couldn’t believe that he had once again not responded and then decided to walk away.   He told me that I’m being condescending and that I always tell him he’s doing something wrong. He’s currently sitting on the couch in a bad mood not talking to me.   I think me being annoyed or confused is valid but sometimes I wish that I could just shut up.   I feel like the asshole here.	1643059666.0	sbwzdm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwzdm/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_boyfriend_when_he/	AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend when he doesn’t respond to me
9blsbkha	Hi I am 17m in my last year of highschool and a part time worker at a local Fish and chip shop I work 3 times a week they are shirt staffed. At my house currently there are 6 dogs, 3 cats and 5 birds I usually take care of the animals and get help feeding then sometimes despite not owning any of them. Out of the 6 dogs my brother owns 4 of them and my mum owns the other 2 my mum is a full time age care worker and taking on more shifts due to most of the nurses being out of work for having covid my mum does 12hr shifts most days. My brother on the other hand works maybe twice a week starts a 4am leaves at 6pm and in  the time that he has owned the dogs he has fed them a total of 3 times.   Now on to the cats my sister moved into a apartment that doesn't allow pets so the cats have been moved to my house the cats are indoor and outdoor cats they do not have litter box thank God. My sister comes over as much as possible to care for her cats which is great although she expects me to buy the cat food she brings it over when she comes to vist sometimes but most of the time she sends money or just expects me to buy cat food. The birds are a different story my sister broke up with her boyfriend last week so has started living with us. she bought her pets birds my sister is a truck driver she is out most of the day she does clean her bird cages and feed them when ever she can which is great.  Over the last couple of weeks I have been focused on my school work and trying to do my best and a couple of times I forgot to feed the animals I thought someone would fed them seeing that I hadn't but no one had the animals didn't eat for 2 DAYS. I was studying on my school work while my brother sat in his room on his computer I felt horrible that's the animals weren't fed and when I asked my brother why he didn't fed the animals he said "I DIDNT DO IT CAUSE ITS YOUR JOB" it's my job I work more hours than this fucker and it's my job to feed his animals I said loud and proud to everyone that I will not feed the animals anymore   Now here where I think I'm the asshole my sisters and my mum have had nothing to do with this I get the occasional $5 from them for feeding the animals an I am thanked by them. I don't want to ruin their schedules by having them feed there animals before or straight after work they both start at odd hours and and have physically demanding jobs.  The main issue I have is my brother his is a prick I don't want to have to feed his animals but I know he won't feed them any suggestions.	1643059742.0	sbx0ex	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbx0ex/aita_for_not_feeding_the_animals/	AITA For Not Feeding The Animals
elhc36ih	My MIL has our son one night a week for a sleepover. We dont see her very often so she enjoys the time with him. However my son has been saying lately that he sleeps in her bed, is given Coke to drink, she leaves him in the car when going into a store for ‘5 minutes’ and constantly feeds him junk food. I brought this up with her and kindly asked her to stop feeding him so much junk, not to leave him in the car and not to let him sleep in her bed. She rolled her eyes and said okay.   Once again my son came home this week and told me what MIL has given him and things shes done. She left him in the car on a hot day ‘with the windows down’ for 5 minutes. A lot can still happen in that time! And again gave him nonstop lollies and fizzy drinks, so hes left on a sugar high and cant sleep, so she lets him in her bed for the night. I confronted her again and she just rolled her eyes at me saying I need to lighten up as its only one day a week, he can eat or drink whatever. I’m not happy with this answer so I told her that our son wont be sleeping over anymore if she cant follow our simple rules.    She exploded on me saying i have no right to keep her grandson away from her. I said we will visit, but he wont be staying unsupervised. She keeps blowing up mine and my partners phone and posting about me on Facebook. Her friends are calling me evil but I think I gave her a fair enough warning.

4li1dsr3	I bought her a 12.9inch iPad and discovered occasionally she uses it as a footwarmer once she's done watching videos/chatting to friends on facetime.  She is there hours at a time with both feet resting/standing on it while watching TV/doing chores. I've taken a look at it and it's covered in grime from her sweaty feet, and smells horrible. I'm sure this will damage the screen as she doesn't even use a case!  I have bought her a heating pad and slippers but she won't use them. Earlier today I flipped and called her irresponsible and stupid.   Her reply was it's her gift and she can do what she wants with it...

hvdpcsjc	So Boom, I (28F) and engaged to L(28M). We both have kids from previous relationships, I have a Daughter and he has 2 Daughters. We have been together for about 3 years . His kids live several states away in Nevada. At the beginning of our relationship. He would always FaceTime his kids and he would send money to their mom every month (not court ordered) so whatever amt they had previously agreed on. When she found out the he was in a new relationship all hell literally broke loose. She would call him and pick fights with him, block him from being able to call his girls on their iPads and make facebook posts about how he is a deadbeat father, shes even reached out to me, to which i spoke to her, mother to mother, and told her that even though Her and L cant seem to communicate well, im down to mediate between them or maybe they need to get a neutral mediator if shes not comfortable with me, she declined calling me “temporary”. I then told her if she believes me to be temporary then she needs to figure another way to contact “L” and fix their issues instead of reaching out to me (How she got my number in the first place is beyond me). Anyway They spoke again maybe about 6 months later when whatever conflict was finally put aside and she allowed him to speak to the kids on their iPads. Before christmas we had shipped out a big box of clothes shoes and winter clothes to the girls.  A few weeks after that she asked him for some money for a daycare that she would be sending The youngest daughter to. He asked her for the contact information of the school so he could pay them directly and she flipped out on him saying he doesn’t need to know that information, which caused another conflict between them. A couple of days after that, I found out through mutual friends that she put in a child support case against him. He is livid about this, he has not been served formally because she does not know where he lives BUT L is doing very little to address the situation Or even find out more info through the courts. Im sure it is time sensitive for him to be able to respond or file any motions but he is not making any effort to even research what could happen or how he can make the situation better. I have since reached out to L’s Mother for advice or to maybe speak to him and get him to file a motion to show the courts that he has been sending her money and items for the girls on contrary to what his baby mama is saying. He’s mad at me for having convos with his mom about this even tho we are both just very concerned about how it will turn out if he just keeps ignoring it.	1643060352.0	sbxago	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxago/aita_for_reaching_out_to_my_fiancés_mom_about_his/	AITA for reaching out to my fiancé’s mom about his child support case?
geoufdu7	There’s so much more context to this story but I’m going to try to summarize it.  I 18 F and my friends 18 F, 18M and 18F have been really close friends through high school. When we turned 17 we celebrated my friends by going on boat rides, buying expensive gifts, dinners, treasure hunts ect. However, when it was my turn to turn 17 they didn’t do anything and I didn’t even receive a gift. I really don’t care about money but I wanted to spend some time together as they were my only friends at the time. This year my friends decided to put a lot of money into an online learning program for 18M. I didn’t really feel like spending so much money but as they already planned for me to agree I did.   I did however have to show up to the dinner in gym clothes as I was training to become a fitness instructor, something I’ve always wanted to do. But I figured that it was better coming sweaty than not at all. As I later went home that night I found out they had a sleepover afterwards without even asking me.   After this I didn’t really feel like inviting them to the dinner I was planning on having for my own birthday but did anyways. I received a gift card on 20$. I really don’t care about the money but because they didn’t celebrate me at all I thought they would try to put in some effort. Like we could have had a movie night or dinner.   I haven’t felt so included in our relationship and stopped spending as much time with them. I also needed some time finding myself.  After months of not really talking I receive a message for M. He says I never paid for his birthday gift and asks me if I could send over the money. (I honestly had just forgotten about it as no one reminded me). I told him that I thought it was kinda weird that he asked since we haven’t been talking at all. He gets mad at me saying that I was disrespectful showing up to his dinner “all sweaty and stinky” and that it is not weird for him to ask since I gave it to him and he gave me a gift for my birthday. I actually got pretty upset and tried to explain that they didn’t even celebrate me and went home without me the same day we celebrated him. He eventually told me that he didn’t really see it from my perspective but said that I should see it from his too. I said that I would pay him because I wanted him to know it wasn’t about the money but after Christmas as I didn’t really have enough money at the time.  Today I found out that the gift card was from 2018 as I bought a new book. I guess it was an old gift my friend had received and just passed on to me. Now I’m supposed to pay for my friends gift, as I promised, but don’t really feel like it since he still doesn’t talk to me. I promised him and was the person to stop hanging out with them. Would I be the asshole if I didn’t pay?	1643060971.0	sbxjcd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxjcd/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_birthday_gift/	AITA for not paying for my friends birthday gift?
98obsug1	So me (f21) and my boyfriend (m21) are in a long distance relationship and started dating 2 and a half years ago. He has a female friend (f21) who has been just friend for about 3 years. He said when he first met her (before we were dating) he was high and wanted to have sex with her and tried to make a move but she didn't cooperate so nothing happened and they went on to develop a close friendship. I went out with him and his friends and he was drunk and started going on about how amazing she is and what a goddess she is. I was really taken aback as I didn't realise he felt so strongly about her and asked him about it and he said he didn't mean what he said and was just drunk. After that I noticed he would skip through her instagram stories really quickly whenever I was next to him on his phone and then resume looking at other stories at a normal speed. There were also times when he would be telling a story, mention her name and completely change the topic. He also in the past had met up with her and not mentioned it to me which I found out later on. I asked him why he was being so secretive about her and he said it was to prevent me from worrying about her which I found strange as I had only mentioned how I felt about when he called her a goddess. He said they would meet up together and smoke weed together in his flat and he lives alone. I have also been around them both in person and I felt like she was definitely into him but couldn't really tell why. After all of this building up, I asked him to see her messages and he showed me and he kept calling her babe, gorgeous etc to which he just said it was in a friendly jokey way. Anyway, after we had a discussion about all of this he then reduced his contact with her (which I never asked him to do) and he said it was because he was worrying that he actually did like her. About 6 months later (present day) he's started talking to her again and they are both going clubbing in a few days together. I'm genuinely just so confused whether or not I'm being an asshole for being suspicions about his friendship or whether or not this is a normal thing??	1643062050.0	sbxygd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxygd/aita_for_being_suspicious_about_my_boyfriends/	AITA for being suspicious about my boyfriend's friendship with a girl?
g8roxqp0	So a little back story on this which I think makes a difference for the big picture. I know this guy through my twin brother. He is one of my brothers best friends and will be his best man at his wedding in March. I knew him a little bit at school but never hung out with him there. Fast forward to a year ago- I started talking with this friend over the phone with him/my brother casually while playing video games.   This July was the only time I hung out with him in person. He tried to sleep with me. I admit I liked him so he didn’t do anything without consent. When he found out I was a virgin (I never went all the way with my ex boyfriend) he backed off and said nevermind. I was a bit confused as to why he would go out of his way to have sex with his best friends sister- even though he said after it all happened that he didn’t like me? My brother wasn’t mad at me as he knows I wasn’t the one that initiated anything. He does not know the details of what happened - doesn’t know he tried to have sex with me nor about my sexual status. He just knows that something  happened between the two of us. We grew up in a strict Christian home so it’s hard to talk about these things openly for me.   Because the wedding is coming up- I decided to just stay nice to his friend until it was over. I also didnt think this friend means wrong but it was purely a misunderstanding. Fast forward to now. I usually try to keep my distance from him when my brother is on the phone. This friend calls him basically daily. So sometimes I still speak to him. He also sometimes calls me to check in and he is usually nice.  So back to the point. The past couple of times I’ve been on the phone with him he has said somethings that to me cross the lines of joking around. A handful of times now. A couple nights ago- he straight up said I was ugly and thought it was funny. As I grew up pretty self conscious this was super triggering to me and got me quite upset. To be fair- we joke around a lot and I’ve poked fun at him before too. So the day after I called him and told him how I felt about it. He did apologize straight away. At the end of the call- he said he hopes we can still be friends and I’ll talk to you later. After I spoke with him- I was so upset I just ended up unfriending him on Snapchat and Instagram because I just didn’t want to see or talk to him. I’m concerned as the wedding is just two months away and I don’t want to cause any trouble. Am I in the wrong for not wanting anything to do with him? I feel horrible and I know this has caused a strain on my brothers friendship with him and my relationship with my brother. I feel horrible.	1643061869.0	sbxvyq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxvyq/aita_for_unfriending_a_friend_on_social_media/	AITA for un-friending a friend on social media after he jokingly called me ugly when he was high/drunk?

izjz3gko	When I f33 was 22 I was dating a man who was 47 and he had a 10-year-old daughter. She would be with us every other weekend because with the custody arrangements she was kind of forced to see her mother since she wasn't a danger to her. I never felt like Ava's mother because she was already so independent when I met her so I felt like she was a younger sister. I know that's weird to say since I was with her father but it was true. I knew I was too young to even be a good parent figure to Ava but I knew I was a hell of a good older sister. Ava's father wasn't really around since he would rather throw himself in work or hang out with friends. The only times he would really come home was to sleep with me or yell at me and Ava. Days, when Ava went back to the mother's house, were good days because parenting her was pushed all on me when I was still a college student myself. A big surprise that really made my mental health go down the well was when Ava and her mother showed up at the door. She informed me that Ava would be staying with us full time since her new boyfriend didn't want another man's kid in the house. All-day was spent making sure Ava was okay and this really made my grades drop. Her father wasn't helping and only yelled at me when I didn't do anything right. I was completely broken but my last straw was when I caught him sleeping with someone else. I was so upset I just left only taking my phone and my wallet.    Fast-forward to now I look back at that as a bad memory and im happily married to my husband who is 45 and we have 3 kids together. I'm not active on Facebook but I still get notifications from it so when I saw that Ava texted me it made me remember all the abuse I had endured. When I got out of that situation and before I had kids with my husband our first goal was to go to a therapist so we can be the best parents for our kids and we are also doing gentle parenting which is rather hard when you grew up in a house getting whooped for things you didn't know we're wrong. Anyway, Ava texted me, introduced herself again, said she missed me and that she wanted to meet up since I was the only real parent she had. I want to meet up with her as a friend but if she wants me to be that parent figure for her I will sadly decline.	1643063357.0	sbygjr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbygjr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_a_parent_figure_to_my/	AITA for not wanting to be a parent figure to my stepdaughter?
izgixkmy	I have a sister, Monica, on the autism spectrum. I have made it clear many times how much I prefer my privacy, but she refuses to listen and claims I never told her, because apparently I need to spell literally everything out for her.  I run a motel, and hired my sister for overnights after she left her psycho ex and needed a job. She needed a computer assembled last week so I sent my motel's technician, Jill, over. The next day, I asked Jill how the job went. Apparently, they hit it off great with each other, which I was thrilled about since Monica just stays in bed all day if not working. Monica apparently told Jill my age and the city (15k people) I live in. (Just enough info for somebody to potentially track me down and even steal my identity. Do your research if this sounds paranoid.)  So I told Monica that effective immediately, her employment is terminated for invasion of privacy. She said Jill made it seem like we were long time friends, and that I supposedly never told her to not reveal info about me to other people. The usual excuses from her. I sent her several articles about identity theft (not that she would care) to prove I was not being paranoid. She texted back, "Okay I get it now! I messed up. It's still not healthy for you to escalate situations like that." I told her I can legally fire my employees for any reason I want, and she then had the nerve to ask if I can be a reference. I told her no and to not even put me on her resumé, and she said, "You do realize you're going to make my job search impossible, right?" I told her she brought everything on herself, so she better hit the pavement unless she wants to end up homeless and have her dogs put in a shelter. She said, "Lol I can't believe you turned into those people who destroy all their relationships and get revenge over the slightest mistakes." I told her that I refuse to have any sort of relationship with her until she can explain, to my satisfaction, what she did wrong, and actually apologize. She said, "I'm kind of busy trying not to have a mental breakdown. I don't even want to talk to you right now."  AITA? I think she lied about what happened to the rest of our family, because they are not very happy with me. Reminder: I can fire whoever I want without prior warning for any legal reason.	1643064145.0	sbyrcg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbyrcg/aita_for_firing_my_sister/	AITA for firing my sister?
e29h7isg	I (38f) am a walking accident... clumsy on two feet type. Well, a couple of weeks ago I went over on my ankle just walking out the car. Thinking it was a standard sprain, proceeded to walk about on my ankle for a week at work.   I'm a teacher in a rather large secondary school so you can imagine all the walking I did. Whilst the ankle/foot hurt, I was convinced it was only a sprain. Well, after a week of teaching (I teach a very practical subject) by the Friday the swelling was getting worse and was hurting even when I wasn't walking. At the encouragement of my mum I took myself off to A&E.  The doc at the fracture clinic agreed with my assessment but ordered an X-ray to be on the safe side. Turns out the ankle was fractured and I was given a boot to wear and told to rest my ankle for 2 weeks and he would organise a follow-up appointment.   Now, the thing to keep in mind is that my department are really short staffed at the moment due to staff having to isolate due to covid so the following Monday I took myself off to work...  Needless to say, I was in a huge amount of pain by the time I got home from work so decided to follow my docs recommendation of signing myself off for 2 weeks to rest the ankle.  Well, today my dept head seemed very annoyed with me for taking the second week off and was under the impression I would return after having the rest of last week off.  Of course I have apologised for causing more inconvenience for her but she's made me feel like a real a-hole for looking after myself for a change.

9ku2rqy7	Now before you say anything I have 2 sisters, one 19F the other 21F. I haven't said shit to my 19F sister. Because, it'll be pretty rude to say to her face "Hey I don't really like your attitude", even after she made the effort to come to our house for Christmas break. Please note I'm only gonna be putting one moment here because it'll be way too much even for this shit.  Here's the People OP=Me 19=19F Sis 21=21F Sis and finally BB= Big Bro  Now we're at the Theaters (Doesn't matter what we watch cause it's not relevant) **now we have a choice to either go to Wagamama's,Nandos,McDonald's you get the point.** (Keep in mind this bit is important) We decided to go to McDonald's first for a snack then we go to the movies, but 19 really wants to go to Wagamama's before we can go to the movies but 21 persuades her that we can go "after". So we immediately grab our tickets other snacks then we go to watch the movie. Fast forward to after the movie finished. We go out to get some food but Wagamama's is closed (we could've gone in but that's a complete dick move on our part and we don't wanna Hassle the fast food employees.) So we go to McDonald's whilst walking to there 19 moans at 21 saying we should've gone before so we can have food. I OP and BB didn't really care we had an blast and savoured the movie whilst we can. 19 is still pissed we couldn't get food and whilst at McDonald's she kinda bemoans the fact that we could've had food and shit and tried to persuade us but I said "just leave it 19 we had a blast I wanna enjoy the night while we can"   Now that was when I realized her attitude to thing we're a bit depressing. Now I get it university work is super fucking annoying but you get to spend time with your siblings and have fun, so isn't having fun really the point of this in the first place. Don't forget what I said about this being one moment. I don't wanna dull you lot so if your in the fence about this just say you want more TLDR:19F Sis wanted to go to Wagamama's but because my 21F Sis wanted to go to movies early and enjoy it. OP and Big bro just had fun and enjoy the night.	1643064534.0	sbywlj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbywlj/aita_for_not_liking_my_sister_after_she_arrived/	AITA for not liking my sister after she arrived at our house for the break?
izk8yc1k	Sorry for how long this is! And forgive me if you find any grammatical errors on this too. I'm a native English speaker but I suck at conjugating my thoughts properly at times lol.  Okay so, basically I’m F(19) as of right now but this fight occurred a while back when I was still 18. (Lik seven or eight months ago to be exact.) I used to have a best friend…let’s call her “A” and me… “S” for the purpose of this story. Before “A” got a boyfriend we were rlly close. We confided in one another a lot, she opened up to me about being bi… which I fully accepted! She told me about being depressed, I told her I have ASD which I don’t usually share with others unless I trust them a lot.  And I did with her. And vice-versa. We talked about practically anything, and had so much in common so we hung out online and in person pretty much 24/7.  We were always there for one another, and she often needed me to come to her aid when her parents were treating her badly....and my own mom had to give her advice on how to handle their mood-swings too.  She knew my mom pretty well and I started to consider my bestie like the long lost sister I never had. And she did too because she admitted this to me, right after I did so with her. I thought we were gonna be one another's ride/die's for life. She was the only friend I had that captured my heart so much and I treasured our bond. I really thought I found my perfect best friend but unfortunately our relationship didn't stay as healthy as it once was. Everything changed when "M" came around. Now my old bestie knew how MUCH I’ve always wanted a boyfriend. I cried to her in fact about wanting one. I supported her when she got a boyfriend but ever since “M” came into her life she purposely rubbed their relationship in my face.   She would decline our hangout dates, rant to me about how awesome this guy was, wouldn’t let me rant about wanting my own one anymore cuz it annoyed her… stuff like that. Eventually their relationship got so serious that ours didn’t become serious at all. I tried to give her space and be the friend that I thought she wanted me to be but she stopped giving me the time of day.  …So I made up a fake boyfriend myself. I told her that i found a guy who liked me and this instantly sparked our friendship back into action. For several weeks everything was okay, but our main convo topics just seemed to be focused about relationships now. I started to miss our other convos and eventually… I told her the truth. I made up having a boyfriend just so she would like me more, and she blew up on me and called me emotionally manipulative.  Then she blocked me on everything. We haven’t talked since April. I don’t think we’re going to rekindle. I rlly miss “A” I think I screwed up by time.  Am I the asshole?   I think I’m “TA” because I tricked my ex-friend into thinking I had someone when I don’t at all. I lied to her.	1643065194.0	sbz5hd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbz5hd/aita_for_lying_to_my_exfriend_about_having_so/	AITA for lying to my ex-friend about having SO when I never did?
79894qxo	I 15 f have a younger brother 14 M, my brother has a friend who is 17 M, he turns 18 tomorrow. I had dated his friend for a month and stuff went super wrong, the friend (my now ex) had forced me to do stuff in my room,  I won't go into detail since Ik its trigger into some but you can guess, it wasn't full on stuff but I never agreeded to any of it and than he blamed it on me for making him want it. But he always had treated me awful and is all around an awful person, he jumped a 14 year old over drugs. He also got my younger brother into vaping and etc. I broke up with him right away when I could, he would threatened to end himself if I left. I left a week later. Because god, I may be dumb but not that dumb. Anyways I told my brother about everything and he still hangout with him and says they are best friends. My brother was hanging out with him today and Ik damn well they are smoking or drinking. My brother texted me wondering if I could do his chores for him and ask mom when he needed to be home by. I told him no and that if he wants to act like an adult. Than he  need to do his own responsibilities. I normally would do them for him but since he refuses to drop his friend and understand what he did to me was awful, I won't do anything for him.

4s4dngmg	My boyfriend (25M) and I (34F) have been together for 3 years and both of us work from home everyday at the moment. Its not hard to notice our age gap but we get along very well. We are not ready to have kids very soon so I decided to join the egg freezing program. He is well awared of the plan but I did all the researches and blood tests on my own. There will be 10-14 days of stimulation progress where I need to inject myself and visit the clinic daily. I am getting more nervous as time goes by and would like someone to help me with the injection. I have asked him for help but he said no because he is afraid of needles. I wasnt very happy but he said he would help on preparing the medication and the uber trip to the clinic.   According to my period calendar, I may start the process in the next couple of days but he would like to visit his parents this weekend and maybe his birthday mid Feb. My bf usually sees his parents almost every  month and im usually very supportive but it means he may miss the start and the extraction date. I mentioned that to my sister yesterday that she offered to come to my place everyday after dropping off my nephew. She lives about one and half hour away. Since I will need to stay within 30mins from the clinic during time, I can't go to her place instead.  I really appreciate the help but I told her she just needs to help me a few days at the start because I may need to do it on my own eventually. I told my bf today about the plan and said she would come everyday. His reaction shocked me as he said I didnt plan well in advance and he needs to work and doesn't want to get disturbed and said I shouldn't be doing the program if I am not ready to inject myself. I told him to stay at his parents' place for longer if he wants. I know him and my sister dont always see each other eye to eye and I usually can be more understanding but not this time.	1643066084.0	sbzh7x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbzh7x/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend25m_to_stay_at_his/	AITA for asking my boyfriend(25M) to stay at his parents when my sister comes over to help me on egg freezing program
cr9nhbhe	So I(F19) was getting back from school early because I wasn't feeling well. I called my bf to get me with the car, like I said I wasn't feeling well and didn't want to walk.   So to get to the nearest bus stop I have to get 2 busses. The place where I change them isn't far so I asked him to get me there.  I called before taking the bus and asked if he was willing (he knows that if he doesn't want I can get by walk easily so he wasn't pressured)   So basically I get there, he's not here but it's normal, usually he gets there 5 minutes later. I call and he doesn't answer, I guessed he was driving and couldn't answer. Another 5 minutes and the bus i should take comes by and he's not here, I'm thinking of getting it but I wait, I don't even know why at that point.  I call another 2 times and he's not answering so I get mad and call mom saying I'll wait for the next bus there(about 40 minutes)   I must say the place was a isolated one and only trucks and few people get there,. I was getting anxious. I also look a lot younger and people think I'm 14/15  Bf is staying with us at home for a little while and so i remember my brother was at home and I call him, asking if bf was still there. He was. He says he's coming. Basically he fell asleep.  He gets here and he realized I am mad and annoyed. He gets mad too and says he just fell asleep and it was a little mistake. I say I could have been kidnapped if I didn't call my brother, I say that if he was tired he could have said so and I could have gotten home walking. I wasn't screaming but it was sure high voice.  He says "then from now on you can walk if you call me"  I said "yeah whatever"  So now I am at home, still mad thinking if maybe I'm in the wrong.	1643114286.0	sccrjb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sccrjb/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_bf/	AITA for getting mad at my bf
j07p4oi5	Just to give context: my boyfriend likes to game a lot and he has a group of friends that he met through gaming and have been friends with for years. He also plays a particular famous game and is part of a guild group, he isn't friends with anyone there, just casual conversation, and I always joke about how much time and energy the members invest on it because it really is a LOT. He never cared and even also makes jokes about it.  Now, the situation is: he called by last Sunday, we were talking and he was about to mention something about the job of one of the guys from his 'game group' when I joked 'wow, didn't know they had jobs' thinking he was talking about his guild group. He responded with 'yeah, and they all get paid more than you' which I was really taken a back with because as I said, I joked about that guild group/particular game in a similar way many times before and he never cared and even sometimes made jokes about it too, so I asked why he gave me such an asshole response and he told me he was talking about his friend group. Now, that never crossed my mind before making that joke, I really thought he was talking about the guild and would never joke about his actual friends. We had an argument about it and he even mentioned another friend of his who isn't a part of any of the two groups and is unemployed at the time as a reason to why my joke as distasteful, which makes no sense to me.  If I had joked about his friends I agree I would be TA but in my eyes, I only joked about a thing we had joked many times before and he jumped on his feet to be intentionally mean to me to defend someone I hadn't even attacked. I was really hurt about his response and even after he apologized for being rude, the fact he still thinks I'm in the wrong makes me uneasy. I think there's a big difference between confusing who we were talking about and making a joke thinking he was talking about different people and intentionally saying something cruel to your gf to hurt her but maybe I am the one who is in the wrong here.  AITA? Or am I being too sensitive? Having another perspective would be really helpful.	1643114879.0	sccy0o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sccy0o/aita_for_confusing_who_my_boyfriend_was_talking/	AITA for confusing who my boyfriend was talking about and making a joke about the wrong group of people?
eidufmtv	TLDR: Friend of mine never pays me back after I buy him stuff so I smoked all of his bud during a session. (Before you put your therapist hats on: We have a comical relationship and the money isn’t an issue for me and he probably got more bud 3 seconds after I left).   I am friends with a couple, whom I visit maybe once a week to hang out, usually watch tv and smoke together. This couple does not have a vehicle, so whenever I come over I ask them if they need me to stop by the store for anything since I usually have to stop for myself anyway. The bf always texts me back saying, “Yeah we need ‘x, y, z’ and I will have the money for you when you get here.”   The first time, they needed cigarettes and didn’t have the money when I got there. The gf ended up having to get a ride from someone to go get it. Cool, no problem. Then the second time I came over, he needed more cigarettes and said he had the money. When I got to his place, he never even mentioned anything about it yet took the cigs. Now I’m the type of person who isn’t gonna remind a grown ass adult that they need to pay someone because let’s be real… people know exactly what they do. So I didn’t say anything that time either. Then we ended up going to a takeout restaurant another day and after they ordered and the cashier told them the total, I realize he has no money. Or at least I thought so because he stood there and stared at the cashier literally for about 20 seconds then his gf walks over as he’s patting his pockets. To save them the embarrassment in front of the 5 other people standing in line, I just paid for the food because I’ve been in that position. He says thank you, but no “I’ll pay you back later” or anything.   Fast forward to a couple nights ago, I was headed there and asked him if he needed anything. He said they needed water, so I bought two cases of water. I already knew how it would go down so I got prepared. I showed up and once again, he said nothing. So I said, just give me a j instead of money for the water. He says he doesn’t have enough to do that. Ok, cool. So we sat down and I started rolling up (mine usually look better so everyone likes for me to roll), the tv is on and he’s telling me a story about something that happened to him. There’s so many distractions that he isn’t paying attention to what I’m doing. Usually when we smoke, we match 1 nug each per blunt. He had already told me that he only had a couple grams left, so he was probably expecting to get half of what was on the tray, back since it was a huge one. As I’m rolling up, he’s going on about his story and doesn’t realize I only ground up his (which was plenty) and put mine back in my bag. We got halfway through the blunt and I see him looking around the table but trying to be subtle about it… yep, it’s already inside the Backwood big fella.   AITA?   Edit:  For everyone going Dr. Phil on me, we have more of a comical relationship, kind of how me and my brothers do. We may do things to each other but we can laugh about it after the fact. I probably could have mentioned to him why I did what I did and he would’ve been like “Oh damn you’re right but still f you.” And he would’ve laughed. But I just wanted to observe his reaction.  Also, I’m not losing sleep over the money, it’s about the principle. So no, I do not need to go searching for new friends. At the most, I’ll just stop asking him or make jokes about how he never pays me and he’ll get the point. I promise it’s not as serious as some of you are making it to be. He probably went and got more before I even left the neighborhood lol	1643117282.0	scdqnt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scdqnt/aita_for_smoking_the_rest_of_my_friends_bud/	AITA for smoking the rest of my friend’s bud?
a0d720nn	This is difficult to talk about because we’ve been together for going on 6 years and i love her dearly, I don’t want to accept that she may simply not care about my personal boundaries but maybe I’m just too persistent or pushy with it.  We’ve lived in several different homes and apartments together. Things haven’t been easy for us, we’ve always struggled but we’ve always made it work.   I lived in my parents home until I was 17. My childhood was abusive and traumatic but we always had a clean living environment which somewhat helped me keep my cluttered mind at bay. My girlfriend doesn’t take cleanliness very seriously at all. When she opens a package, she just throws the trash and packaging on the ground or on a dresser and it will sit there until I clean it up. Her clothes are constantly everywhere, on the floor, on MY dresser, etc. I don’t have much surface room to place my belongings on so any clean space is highly appreciated. Sometimes when she cleans her ears she leaves the dirty qtips on the ground or on the chair, in the bed, or wherever she cleaned her ears.  I’ve brought these things to her attention so many times. Probably once a month. I get tired of bringing it up and she takes it offensively every time, so I’ll go several months without bringing it up sometimes. It has effected how I act, how I think, how I live day to day. I’ve started not caring as much. I don’t clean up after her nearly as much. So we live in filth quite often. Empty chip bags, used plates and cups, packages, dirty clothes, everything really.  I just don’t know if it’s an asshole move to bring it up to her because she gets so offended. I try so hard to bring it up politely, word it in a non offensive way, or just not bring it up most times. I’ve contorted my own boundaries to accommodate her but I don’t know how much longer I can live like this.   It used to be much worse. Piles of stuff would sit idle for months. She’s gotten on antidepressants lately which has helped her motivation a ton but most days are still rather idle. I just don’t know how to word it anymore or if I’m being an asshole for not just giving in and fully accepting her lifestyle choices.	1643122489.0	scfjcv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scfjcv/aita_for_repeatedly_telling_my_girlfriend_my/	AITA for repeatedly telling my girlfriend my boundaries and what makes me comfortable?
ixvezff9	My gf is perfect. We knew each other as kids and came together a bit later. She also has a close friend who is currently with my close friend. Seems like a perfect friend circle.   Before it was apparent me and my gf were going to be together and serious, we would talk about everything and anything. She used to talk on how my friend took her friend for granted. (I grew up with her friend, was close to puppy love young, I’m talking ages 5-10.  but am not super close anymore). I spoke on it and said yeah, I Expressed how good she is as a girlfriend and so on, any guy would be lucky to have her.   Months after that me and my gf are together and she can’t seem to let go of the things I’ve said about this girl in the past. I’ve assured her that now she’s my gf, I see all of those same qualities in her, even better, and I’m never leaving the relationship. I’ve tried to reassure her so many times.   My gf gets really insecure whenever we are around this girl, despite the fact that it’s her best friend and there’s no feelings there. It was admitted when we were younger she had a crush on me, we never saw it through. This girl has made comments about us sometimes, but she’s in a relationship, so am I and there’s no feelings there. But most times we are together, my gf ends up in a mood if I literally have a joke or laugh with this girl. It’s really draining.   My girlfriend doesn’t mention it every time, and we’ve had some good times, holidays and outings together. Up until yesterday I hadn’t heard of it in a while. We were on insta and my girl saw I clicked this girls story. She then asked me to go on her profile and see if I’d liked her pics (which I had, she’s a friend to both of us). Then she sort of broke down and said she can’t deal with these feelings. She said I’m an asshole for liking this girls pictures despite knowing how she feels. But she keeps telling me, she trusts me and her friend and obviously nothing beyond friendship is going on.   I’m at a loss here guys. She doesn’t want to cut this girl off, cut me off or have me cut her off, so what am I meant to do. Am I the asshole for what I said in the past? And for the picture liking?	1643122515.0	scfjoh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scfjoh/aita_for_things_i_said_about_gf_friend_before_we/	AITA for things I said about gf friend before we were together.
yyb4yq9	I am staying at my boyfriends apartment. He’s back at work now after a lay off and was trying to go to bed early. I stayed up because I don’t start work for another week. I was being super quiet watching tv in his living room. Well I have anxiety comorbid to my ASD and it gets 50 times worse when “Aunt Flo” is showing up. Not sure why but it’s always been this way..   Stupid me decided to have a little puff off of a joint we had rolled earlier. I thought it would curb the anxiety. (We both smoke weed often together and it RARELY causes anxiety) Well that made my anxiety skyrocket and I started having as I like to call it a “silent anxiety attack”  Basically I’m heavily breathing, my heart is pounding and my hands and feet are sweating, I’m dizzy my head gets hot; only I don’t show it and hide it.  I was trying to do breathing exercises to relax and it just wasn’t working, so I decided I would crawl into bed with my boyfriend and ask him to cuddle me because I’m scared and can’t kick the anxiety.   He gets so mad at me and starts swearing at me about how he had just fallen asleep and has to actually work tomorrow. He wouldn’t cuddle me and then got mad at me again because I got up to get some water. This made my anxiety worse and I started to spiral. I just laid there trying not to cry because I’m starting to convince myself the very worst is going to happen to me. I just played some games on my phone until the feeling eventually passed. But it still took a few hours before I could self soothe enough to relax some and then eventually fall asleep.  Whenever he has gotten anxious, I will always do my best to comfort him. I don’t care what time it is, or how he got anxious I’m always going to comfort him. I just thought he would do the same for me.   TLRD; I’m overly anxious, smoked a little weed hoping it would stop anxiety, it got worse, went to bed with bf and he got angry with me for waking him and refused to help me calm down.  EDIT; everyone keeps coming for me about the weed and that’s not even the main issue. I regularly smoke (everyday) and never have problems, so when I started to become more anxious it was a big surprise.  My boyfriend also smokes everyday and he gets more anxious when he smokes so I’m normally the one calming him down.  I usually have my anxiety in check with coping mechanisms but sometimes they just don’t cut it and I need some support!  EDIT2; I HAVE BEEN TO A DOCTOR FOR MY ANXIETY and I am in therapy. And I’ve been doing 1000% better than I was a year ago. Once in a while I will get anxious and not be able to help myself. I have learnt many ways to cope and I can usually talk my self out of an attack. This night I just wasn’t able to. Just to help any confusion: boyfriend isn’t starting a new job, it’s the same job he’s had for years only he gets laid off every year for a month during the winter. He just had to go back now.	1643124373.0	scg7eo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scg7eo/aita_for_waking_my_boyfriend_while_i_was_having/	AITA for waking my boyfriend while I was having an anxiety attack?

j0ez23lq	I'm from Switzerland. My mom (33F) and South Korean bio dad fell in love while they were both students at the same boarding school here. My mom ended up getting pregnant when she was 16. Her parents were pissed at first but they accepted it in the end as she absolutely didn't want to get an abortion. His parents on the other hand, were having none of it. My bio dad was on their side and my mom got super angry over this. She considered it an absolute betrayal. They broke up. My bio dad was sent to a different boarding school and my mom decided to raise me on her own with the help of her family (which was fortunately wealthy enough to afford this). She vehemently refused to accept any sort of child support from her ex or his family.   Ever since I can remember I wondered about my bio dad. I look around 60% Korean and 40% Swiss. When I was around 9 years old I became fascinated with Korean culture / K-Pop / K-dramas, etc., the whole package. I tried learning Korean on my own but I gave up pretty fast. My mom hates all of this. Anything Korean related reminds her of him. I asked her if we could take a trip to South Korea to visit and she immediately said NO even though we have the money for that.   Recently, I let her know that I want to meet my bio dad. She freaked out. Started telling me about how he wants nothing to do with me, that he's a traitor, just a boy that was not even able to stand up to his parents, that I don't love her enough, that this is really hurting her, that I'm ungrateful for the amazing life she offered me and for how much she had to work and struggle to be able to raise me right, etc. She told me that this is going to destroy my stepdad if he finds out.   I love both my mom and my stepdad so much but I also want to know why I look the way I do, if my bio dad's personality is similar to mine, etc. I personally think that my mom's just blinded by anger. My bio dad was just a high school kid who was living on his own in a foreign country with very strict, rich and conservative parents, what was he supposed to do? I'm sure he was hurt by those events as well. I want to know the truth. I want to get to know him. Am I such a bad daughter for this?	1643126422.0	scgyrz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scgyrz/aita_for_wanting_to_meet_my_16f_bio_dad/	AITA for wanting to meet my (16F) bio dad?
efmu5but	I have a semi- irrational phobia of any type of sliced, lunch meat. No real origin story to it, I’ve always been this way, my entire life.  I don’t wanna walk near it in the grocery, won’t eat things that have touched it & definitely will not allow it in my house..  As a rule, before I date people I make them aware of this& they always say they understand, but low & behold everyone always PUSHES this hard boundary.   Current bf and I have been together 2 years , spent the entire pandemic together without having an issue with my lunch meat phobia.  I cook all of our meals& have packed lunches countless times.  Now after 2 years He refuses my home cooked meals & I am  getting  these kinds of messages:  “ i dont and wont eat lunches that require a microwave and utensils.

So we are doing the tests and some classmates did not know the word satnav or something, and she said she dosent want to answer, so i just said it means GPS thinking none of it, and she screams out loud who said that, i stood up she said that i should bring her my test and so i did. After 10 minutes after she took my test she asked me on a joke tone why i was mad, and i said that i didn't think this is fair and she asked me why i didn't think that, again on that tone, and i said because she is incapable of answering a single question. (I said that because last semester she almost failed me because she didn't like me, I'm saying that because when i received a test back from her it was an big ol' F and i looked over the subjects with my parents and almost all of them were right tho. This happend two times, you can tell i was holding it back) and then she proceeded to yell at me that i wasn't educated and i was a jerk. I didn't care. That's the end of my story.

7rfm95vh	Forewarning, folks, this is gonna be a long one.     At the start of COVID, my sister's boyfriend (whom I am very fond of) moved in with her and her kids on the other side of the city to help with the kids and support my sister (she has four kids from a previous marriage for which the divorce proceedings were finishing at the time). The following January, my sister's partner (let's call him Mike) asked me if I wanted to move in to his house in place of him. He had a long term tenant there for the last 8 years but he was back home in Poland at the time. He offered me a rent approximately half of the market rate and I agreed as I was about to turn 31 and wanted to get back out from under my parents feet again.     So I moved out to the north of the city and, aside from feeling lonely to begin with, everything went well. For context, my year prior had been horrendous due to a frankly vicious breakup which cost me a lot of friends (my ex opted to spread some fairly horrendous lies) so I wasn't mentally in a good spot. My sister and Mike knew this, so that's why they offered me the space. Effectively, I'd be an unofficial tenant and helping him cover the mortgage. Grand.     In March, my housemate returned from Poland. He is fundamentally a very good guy and has a big heart, but he is on the autistic spectrum and flips out if things aren't absolutely perfect. This includes silence in the house after 9pm, as that's when he goes to bed (for context, he was furloughed until November this year but wanted to keep his sleep pattern for his job as a kitchen porter). Our living room is directly below his bedroom. As such, since then I have had the TV on Volume 3 and subtitles on, daring only to whisper, or else get a shirty text message from said housemate. For context, he doesn't use the living room, only the kitchen, bathroom and his bedroom. I use the living room as my own space and as a working space due to COVID. I made it clear from Day 1 of us living together that we shared the space and if he ever wanted to use it, I would happily clear off to my room. To date, he has never done this.      The following month I had an opportunity to adopt a dog. I asked him, and Mike, if doing this was ok and both were very excited about it, saying it was no problem. I adopted a 2 year old ex-racing greyhound who at the time wasn't house-trained and wasn't used to being by herself. I told my housemate (who I'll refer to from this point on as Dave) that it might be a tricky period while she settles and apologised in advance. He had no worries about this and for the first couple of months he would happily and voluntarily take her for walks and feed her. This stopped several months ago, around the same time he stopped leaving the house for anything other than work.     I have lived with others before, usually being the clean one, but Dave would lose patience with me quite easily. I will say that in each instance, he had a point, but his response to me was disproportionate. In effect, he has shouted at me and walked me through everything he dislikes in the process before storming off about six times. However he is prone to exaggeration. One of these was over the bathroom sink being covered in beard hairs from shaving. I counted four before cleaning them. The most recent occasion was about the cooking hob being covered in grease (about 2cm squared of a stain) and the counter being ruined by stains (again, about 2cm that was a little sticky). Both took me about 10 seconds each to clean. This also then extended to my dog whining in the morning. This was at about 9:30am, after I'd been brought downstairs leaving the bathroom in a dressing gown. Considering he gets up at 5am and my dog has learned to be quiet until I come down around 8:30am during the week and 9:30am on weekends, this seemed a little ranty. This rant included saying that I don't give a shit, that I'm a selfish prick, and that I never do anything around the house (this is not true, everything is split and we alternate cleaning the house every week). While I understand his point, greyhounds such as mine have very bad separation anxiety and I was in fact on my way downstairs to bring her up to stop any whining that I hadn't yet heard. It seemed a disproportionate reaction, but I will acknowledge that I should have completely cleaned up the night before, as I usually do. To note, all dishes were done and nothing else was hanging around.   &#x200B;  He then upped the ante a little bit and slammed several doors (more context, he's 40), before calling Mike to complain. My partner was staying over at the time (she is not of the belief that what he demands is particularly fair on me, to say the least) insisted we leave with the dog for the weekend. So we did. I have a tendency to feel very mixed up, down and upset whenever I get shouted at. As noted, I see his point, and he's not entirely wrong, but when you live with someone you do have to compromise. Like I do when he stomps around the house with the grace of a baby elephant at 5am every morning. But I don't feel I'm awarded the same considerations at all.   &#x200B;  I came back on Sunday evening after he'd gone to bed. In the meantime, Mike had shown up and had been given another earful. This lead to my sister calling me to complain about being messy, citing when I looked after her 4 kids by myself for two weeks while working remotely towards the end of the summer after she asked the kids if I was untidy. However unfair I thought that was, others were beyond pissed at such a statement. Effectively she told me to suck it up or go pay higher rent elsewhere.     Now, for context, I am very close with my sister (10 years my senior) and I'm as you can probably figure out a very happy hands-on uncle whenever its called for. I don't take any payment when I look after her kids, usually expenses are paid while I'm doing it but not every time. An important detail is the aforementioned divorce. It was an abusive relationship in which my sister was the victim. However, because of the unique way the Irish justice system works, the final agreement was that her ex-husband would get whatever the raised equity in the house beyond the mortgage value back when the youngest boy turns 14 (he's 8 now). This works out to about 200k. So my sister has to find that while paying the mortgage, looking after 4 kids, and getting about 700 a month from her ex-husband to pay for the kids. Because of this she rents out several rooms in her house and acts as a child-minder for four other kids during term time. She is doing everything she can to raise money. The agreement on me moving in to my current residence was that it would allow Mike to give her more money towards running the household and paying for the kids. Except that hasn't happened for the last three months.   Mike has two kids of his own and is helping towards putting them through school and college respectively. He has a good job and theoretically has his mortgage covered by his two tenants. However, he is constantly short of money. His plan for his house is to fix up a couple of things that need attention and rent out the whole unit for the market value to a family. However, he doesn't have the 5k or so it requires to do that. In addition, my housemate has been here for 8 years and requires a lengthy 8 months notice about such works taking place. To note, he is on the same rental rate as I am, and both of us have rolling one-month leases.  On the other side of things, my partner's mother very generously offered part of her garden for myself and my partner to build a mini-house while we save for a mortgage. We'd both pay half then, after I moved out with her daughter, she would pay me back through the rental income. After that, she'd have an additional income source for several years. We are in the very early stages of this build but, given the circumstances with my housemate, she offered for me to move in rent free (I eventually got her to agree to splitting the house bills in half at least) until the unit in the garden is complete in an estimated six months. This was phenomenally generous of her and I'm very thankful for it.  However, my sister has since asked me for a favour: that I don't move out. This is because Mike doesn't have the money to fix the place up to rent it out properly (and greatly increase his income as a result), she won't give it to him from her existing fund for her ex-husband (entirely fair), and because they know they won't be able to find another housemate for Dave that would be as patient as I would be. Me leaving would also put a timeline on the house being fixed up and, hence, a financial commitment which, given his poor credit history, Mike wouldn't be able to do without help.     So I'm a little stuck. Am I the asshole for feeling a little forced into this situation when I have a viable alternative that allows me to save more money towards the new build and afterwards a mortgage, and am I the asshole for leaving my sister financially disadvantaged because of what I personally want to do?     TLDR: I live in my sister's partners house for cheap rent. Housemate is a bit of an asshole. I have the option to move in with my partner and her Mum while we build a mini-house in the garden, but my sister has asked me to stay because if I don't, they won't be able to / aren't willing to find a replacement for me to cover my housemate's long notice period if they decide to do the place up (but for which there is no available money at the moment) and her income will suffer when it's already extremely stretched.	1643132367.0	scj87x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scj87x/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_of_my_sisters/	AITA for wanting to move out of my sister's partners house because of an opportunity to live with my partner and get away from my housemate?
hha96iud	I (20F) have been friends with this guy, Kevin (fake name) for 4 years now. We met in high school, and he got assimilated into my already existing group.   All throughout high school, Kevin cracked a lot of jokes at my expense. I had put on a lot of weight back then, due to stress and other factors, and this resulted in constant fat jokes. I can't really put the jokes on here, because they were in my mother tongue so they won't really properly translate to English. But they were pretty offensive, and what made it worse is that all my other friends laughed at his jokes. I kind of put up with these jokes, because I was kind of lonely during high school  and I didn't want to lose my friends. This only encouraged him, and at this point, I feel like I'm less a friend, and more of a long running joke in my group.   Yesterday when he was over, he started with the fat jokes. And he knows I'm very insecure about my body. I told him that I wasn't okay with such jokes, and that it hurt me. He claimed I was being oversensitive, and I should take things lightly. I still told him to stop with the jokes, to which he agreed. However, he still cracked another one later (which he attributed to being an "old habit"). This severely pissed me off.   Later that day, a friend put up pics of us in our group chat. Kevin was wearing shorts, an attire he isn't too fond of taking pictures in. I was feeling rather petty that day, and wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine. So I called him a "shorty" (that's supposed to be a pun because he is short and was wearing shorts). He has told me before that he has always been insecure of height, so I did that deliberately, I admit. He completely went OFF on me after that joke. He kept spamming "Fatty" "Indecisive drama queen" and such words on the group, so I left it, saying that I needed time to cool down. Then he messaged me privately, saying I'm an insecure fat person. I blocked him immediately to stop myself from engaging. Then he messages me on Instagram that I bullied him my calling him short even after he apologized for his jokes. I told him that he had constantly been cracking jokes at my expense for 3 years. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror at one point in my life. To that he told me that I'm a hypocrite because I put up with shit that a partner had put me through, but I couldn't forgive him for merely joking. He kept rehashing this point over and over again, though it was completely unrelated to the issue at hand. It also made me think that he was implying that if I dealt with bad treatment from one person, I should take it from all. It made me feel super upset, and I blocked him everywhere else, thus ending the friendship. One of my friends from this group is telling me I overreacted and should apologize to Kevin AITA for ending the friendship over this?  EDIT: I know I shouldn't have commented on his height, especially knowing how he feels about it. I just didn't know how else to make him understand how I felt.	1643133198.0	scjjpz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjjpz/aita_for_overreacting_to_my_friend_cracking_fat/	AITA for overreacting to my friend cracking fat jokes?
9g2fo62r	Am I in the wrong for telling my wife to check the settings on the toaster oven before she uses it. If I forget to change it back to her favorite setting she won't check it and then her food might get ruined. Our toaster oven has a lots of settings I use most of them. My wife only ever uses one setting which is fine but she never checks to make sure that it's on that setting. She just assumes I will always put it back to her favorite one. Most of the time I remember to change it back but now and again I forget. And then she'll freak out about it. I keep telling her that because it's a machine with multiple different settings she should just check herself. I don't just throw my food in the toaster oven assuming that whatever setting it's on will work.

4491gxp8	Ok, so a few months ago my sister 39f came to me 29f and told me she had been an active drug user for the last two years. She also told me her bf was abusive and she was scared. I immediately told her to move in with me and my family and we would help her stay clean, become more responsible, and eventually get her into a place where she could be successful in the long term.   So, after she moved in we gave her the rules of the house.   1. You can come in or out as much as you want between 7 AM and Midnight. Later and earlier are OK sometimes but just be respectful because our dogs bark and we don't want to wake up in the middle of the night. Also, we specified this did not include work. She can't help if she gets off late or has to go in early.  2. Let us know if you'll be around for supper if you plan to eat with us.  3. Let us know if you're staying somewhere else for the night. 4. Limit nights out to one or two a week to limit exposure to that thing that's going around that we can't discuss.  Side note here: my family has been extremely cautious and isolated within our bubble. We would prefer no one go out at night and hang out with people but know we can't nor would we want to force her to stay at home constantly.  So with those rules we started her time here. It was OK for a bit but the house definitely got a little more packed when her 19 year old ended up moving in bc she got in a fight with her dad and had no where to go. My sisters severely disabled son also stays with us two nights a week.  So during these last few months every week or so we'd have to talk to them about the rules because they would be gone for days at a time to their respective boyfriends houses or come in at 3-5 am. On top of that my niece and sister are ALWAYS sick. Since they've been here they've given us a sinus infection, Flu A, and a stomach bug.   Finally, about a week ago I found out when my sister was gone for three days with barely any contact with us she was with her bf who had been away at a conference for a week.  I talked to my sister and said I am so sorry but you're going to have to not go out so much until you get your own place. Your bf just traveled through multiple states and never took any tests and you went to stay with him the day he got back and then came back here. I'm not comfortable with that at all.   Since then she has stayed 4 of the last 7 days with him. Only coming here to get ready for work or when she has her son for the night. She even missed her night with her son the other night and said she was working but for years she said she was working when she was actually cheating on her husband and partying. So I don't really believe her.   So my husband and I decided she had until April 1st to get her own place. She hasn't been here for me to tell her yet but I already feel bad because I'm afraid she'll relapse if she hasn't already. I just feel like she completely disrespects me and my house and I legit can't stand living with her anymore.

8hahk8yb	So to start the story off, I (F20) am saving for a house with my partner of 2 years (M30) and everybody at my workplace knows this. The past couple of month we have had some changes in the workplace which haven’t pleased everybody & I feel as though I am being targeted as soon as another girl (F25) was hired. She’s related to the owner.  Ever since she was hired by the owner, she has had special treatment and I have been told every afternoon to “make sure you do this and this and this so she doesn’t have to in the morning.” This has been going on for months now. She has taken my hours as well, because she needs them. So she gets an extra 5 hours a week on top of her 43 hour week, “because she needs them more than me.” I only do a 40 hour week and house prices have skyrocketed. I sometimes feel as if i’m being dramatic but I need these hours. Why does somebody else deserve my hours when they already have more than me?  I’m thinking of leaving because of this. it’s the final straw & I can’t cope with coming home complaining all the time to my partner.   AITA. For looking into leaving when we are already understaffed because of another coworker getting special treatment.	1643136652.0	sckvnx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sckvnx/aita_my_hours_have_been_cut_down_35_hours_a_week/	AITA: My hours have been cut down 35 hours a week and I am planning on leaving even though we are understaffed.
4ruhujfj	my old roommate, T (21NB) and I (25NB) signed a lease for a house in Feb of 2021, and moved in late March 21. around the same time, T started dating D. when we moved, we were like ~1 hr away from D, so T often spent 2-3 days over D’s place and would come back for work (WFH call center).     some context; T & I lived together since late 2019, and were inseparable. quarantine brought us much closer together, as we are both high-risk and bonded over anger towards ppl traveling, etc.     fast forward to us moving to the house, and T starts talking about how D has issues with his roommate, and so would I feel comfortable if he came over. i said sure. but while he was over, i learned that his roommate parties & has a BF that she sees often.     T & I had been good about boundaries, but this was new information for me and i started to feel uncomfortable with not knowing how many ppl were being added to our “pod”. The same week, T tells me they are going to Texas to visit D’s family with him for 2 weeks. i took this opportunity to say i didn’t feel comfortable with what was going on in terms of our boundaries, so T agreed to stay at their dad’s leading up to the trip and to quarantine there when they came back.     before they left for the trip (late May 2021), T told me we needed to have a serious talk and that they thought it was best if they moved out, given the situation. i was honestly shocked, but understood. we agreed that they would pay rent until we found someone, and that we would aim to get someone to replace them by end of July.     after making a listing in several facebook groups, etc., there wasn’t a lot of interest in the house. T did suggest one person as an option, but it was their friend who is very unstable and who i don’t feel comfy with. Since it was the end of June, i told this to T and they said they couldn’t pay beyond July because they were living with D now and they couldn’t afford to pay 2 sets of rent. i was angry, so in the moment i said then we would probably have to break the lease and they agreed.     after looking at our lease, i realized we would be on the hook for the rest of the rent through March 2022. so i told T that it would be easier if i moved out too and that we sublet the whole place. i said I’d be out by September 1st, but that they needed to contribute something to August’s rent because i couldn’t afford it on my own. they blew up at me calling me classist since i make more money than they do, and that i should sell things or ask my parents. they know that i make more money than my parents, so i called THEM classist since their dad is a financial executive and makes more than my whole family combined, so they should ask him for the assistance.     this effectively ended our friendship since they said i was exerting financial control over them and they couldn’t be friends with someone like that. they did still contribute to August rent, but we don’t talk anymore.  was i the asshole for asking them to contribute to August rent?	1643137871.0	sclcid	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sclcid/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_contribute_to/	AITA for asking my roommate to contribute to August’s rent?
850ubj0g	TLDR: sister in law is blaming me for lack of communication revolving around personal covid choices. It’s possible she is lying about it all to punish and hurt me because she felt rejected.  I apologize for the length and any grammatical errors in advance.  During the months of June and July 2021 my husband and I plus our kids had spent a lot of time at his parents. His sister and husband also live there with their kids.   Early August my husband and I are debating on laying low as Delta variant is rising and he have high risk family members. We find out that an Aunt has been traveling thru the southern states had been to his parents house recently. We also found out only SIL is vaccinated out of four adults in that household. Their choice but we have to take that into consideration with our health concerns. We weren’t comfortable with that on top of considering laying low in general.   SIL texts me asking to hang out with the kids while my husband was at work and I panicked. I told my husband we can’t just keep dodging them we should be upfront. She’s very harsh at times and I asked my husband to call her and tell her our plan. I vaguely remember he told her we were going to stay away for 10 days because of our Aunt and I said no please call her back and explain we are going to lay low after that too until we see how this variant unfolds. I believe he did. At that point we hadn’t thought what we were comfortable with so he wouldn’t have mentioned meeting at a park or outdoors.  My husband also called his mom and let her know we wouldn’t be coming over like we usually did. That we would have to meet up at a park to visit as we are trying to get our youngest to keep his mask on and we have had the best luck with that there. She said she was disappointed but understood.   A day or two goes by and now SIL’s husband is texting my husband aggressively, attacking our choice. Telling us that if we wear masks we don’t trust him. Giving us questionable data saying not many kids die, doctors get paid for claiming covid deaths, it’s just a cold and it’s trash we cancelled our traveling plans (had a road trip planned we postponed). This went on a few times over the course of a few days until my husband told him enough and drop it. We were so offended by his lack of understanding especially with our health issues. He apparently knows better than our doctors and ourselves what’s best for our family. We were furious with him for his ridiculous and  disrespectful push back.  A few more days go by and my husband younger brother texts him “so I’m not allowed to see the kids either?”. My husband puts out that fire and explained nobody said that and explained what we were comfortable with-outdoor meetups and WE are gonna wear masks. Well “he doesn’t agree with it” but ok.   Who is telling him what? Because we explained very clearly now that anyone can see the kids outdoors at a park. We told SIL’s husband, MIL and husband brother now at this point. We did forget to tell SIL specifically that we can meet up at a park. She was talked to by my husband at the beginning of this whole thing and we just told her we were going to lay low for awhile. It slipped our mind in defending our choice to everyone but I guess I assumed since we told two other adults in that household she knew. Especially since they were clearly all talking about our choices.  Late August now and we are all at a kid cousins outdoor birthday party. We are wearing masks and we are sure getting glances for it. It’s an open yard near a busy road so I am very closely watching my young children. My husband and I are both busy keeping a close eye on our kids which takes us away from the adults. Not intentional. Was it awkward? YES, but we are not avoiding anyone on purpose. I am in close proximity to my SIL at one point and ask her if she found out who would be her kids teacher for the approaching school year. She quickly answered me, turned her back and quickly walked away. Trying not to be self conscious but wondering if she is mad at me I decided to think she is just busy like me chasing after her kids.  My husband’s other more understanding brother took us up on our offer not too long after this to hang out outside and invited us over to let the kids play and help chop/stack wood. So my husband took our older two down and they did that. I stayed home with youngest as it was nap time. That would come back to bite us in the butt.  Soon after that my husband swung by his parents house where they all live to grab something and his mom asked him if there is a reason we are not coming over. He’s thinking I thought I explained this and reiterated our youngest is learning to keep his mask on and we can meet up at a park anytime. Our youngest will not want to keep his mask on or stay outside of the house at grandmas. She asks why are we willing to go to understanding brothers house but not theirs. So he explained nobody is allowed inside his house anyways and he has a huge yard. He also took us up on our offer of kicking it outside. He said we aren’t mad (which I guess wasn’t entirely true because we were upset with SIL’s husband) and his mom said well nobody here is mad. So we think ok whatever. At this point we are in a new routine of school and that’s our priority for our kids. Not going out of our way to hang out with family that is critical of our choices and don’t make us feel welcome.  September comes and our school age kids are in school. SIL youngest is turning two and she decides to have a party. This party starts at 4 pm on a weekday. I think we can probably go and stay outside and try it out with our youngest in a mask there. So I have my husband drop off a gift the day before. I then text her that husband dropped off a gift and I wasn’t sure if we could make the party. I explained that we don’t get the kids off the bus until 4:30 if it’s on time and we have to eat before we come (or kids will be beyond cranky). Also if they have homework I have to take that into consideration because doing it the morning before school is out of the question (nightmare, tried it before). That I would play it by ear. No response. Next day it doesn’t work out. We end up not going but we call later that evening several times to both her and her husband’s phone by FaceTime. No answer or call back. Maybe they are busy. So then we take a video of our kids saying happy birthday to her phone- read. No response ever.   That was hurtful for me because I feel like she as a mom should have more understanding that things can be hard/unpredictable and not hold it against me for not coming. It’s not a diss but it clearly was to her and now to I feel punish me she also ignores my children?   Again I’m wondering if she is mad at me or I am reading into it too much. Maybe she forgot to respond?  An older cousin who is our age asks to hang out on our terms so kids can play and it’s great. But then she asks my husband “what’s going on with you guys and MIL”. I feel rage come over me because is this still going on? Why can’t they just talk to us? I thought everything was fine and we have just all been busy?  Cousin tells us they aren’t “mad” they are “hurt”. We explain the BIL verbal attack and our health issues that out some of our family members at high risk for Covid. She didn’t know that and says what we are doing makes sense but we should still go talk to them. Why do we have to fix this? I feel we have communicated pretty clearly this entire time.   At this point nobody in that household had took us up on our offer to meet up outdoors. Not even a FaceTime call to our kids. We just keep hearing whispers we are keeping the kids from them and that we are acting like their house is ground zero for Covid.   If only one adult if four that are eligible to be vaccinated are and you guys are not as safe as we would be then yes, we are not stepping foot inside your house. Simple as that.   One day MIL and FIL came over to grab something and we all came out masked to briefly visit. My early elementary age child said something to my MIL along the lines of “we can’t come over because you aren’t vaccinated”. I do remember this and totally cringed. It wasn’t necessarily true but it wasn’t wrong either. I should have spoke up in that moment but I didn’t. It was an awkward silence and given all the recent events I totally froze and didn’t say anything or correct my kid. This is important later but reflecting on it I honestly not sure where he got that. We don’t talk about this stuff in front of the kids. The only thing I can think of is that I may have explained to him why we weren’t going to grandmas for awhile. I may have said that until we ourselves can all get vaccinated we have to do things differently. That they were not vaccinated so before we can go over, we have to be. He’s not stupid but he’s also a child and can make his own conclusions. He’s also told my dad he’s fat once and that he won’t be old enough to get a ride in his hot rod one day when he’s older because by then “you’ll be dead grandpa”.  We didn’t feed that to him either or talk like that for him to have repeated it. Give me a break.  A few times in between these events I bumped into SIL and her husband and the grocery store and it’s all fake smiles and tortuous small talk. Very awkward but I figure ok the must be ok because they acted fine at the store?  We did initiate FaceTime calls so the kids could talk and we invited them to the park a few times and they were busy, fine. We tried.  But we can’t be the only ones trying so we didn’t do it regularly. Later on they invited us to a indoor trampoline place once and my husband took our older two. Again I stayed home with youngest as it would interfere with nap/ didn’t want to worry about him keeping mask on indoors. They acted normal no mention of any hurt feelings. I guess we weren’t as angry about SIL’s husband rude attack and let it slide for the sake of peace.  One day in November my husband gets a call from his brother (same one that lashed out at us) and toward the end of the convo he says that we need to go talk to his parents household because “the family is falling apart”. I am so upset at this I’m so tired of feeling in limbo and guessing what’s going on. I say let’s settle this, we get our vaccinated cousin to watch our children (safest option we have)  and we go over to MIL house masked to squash this and talk.   It’s me, my husband, MIL, SIL and her husband. FIL comes later but he’s not really involved.   I start out by speaking up about what BIL said and how deeply it hurt and offended me. I also wanted to put him on blast as I was not sure if anyone else realized he had done and said these things. He was apologetic although it was not worded like a true apology. It was “I’m sorry, I know it seemed like I was attacking I’m just ___”.   SIL is in and out of the room putting children to bed and tending to them but when she does sit down she is silent. I asked her if she knew what her husband had said to us and she said she didn’t. I told her that I felt she was putting us in a hard position by making the birthday party at that time and day. And mother to mother I should not have to explain all I did as to why it would be difficult for us to come. Also that I knew she would be mad at us for not coming which I felt she was because she never responded to my messages or kids video wishing a happy birthday. She broke out in tears and left, never came back.   Her husband says she just text him and said “she can’t even”. Further explains she is so hurt she started going to therapy recently and she misses being able to hang out with me while our kids play. Him and MIL further explain that she’s not ready to talk and we may have ambushed her. That she “feels everyone’s feelings” and has a huge text ready to send to me that she is afraid to send because she doesn’t want to push me away. Well gosh I feel bad now right? I accidentally hurt her very badly which I was honestly taken aback because I never felt that we were that close. But I have sympathy for her.  The four of us continue to talk and we find out that MIL and SIL husband are mad at us because they felt pressure to go get vaccinated because of what our child said. They assumed he was repeating what we said and went and got vaccinated resentfully to “smooth things over with us”. We never asked that and they could have talked to us about what our kid said before they went and did that.   The conversation we had with MIL went best, she seemed genuinely sorry and understanding of our position once it was all laid out and explained. We could have both communicated better between her and us.   SIL husband claimed they have been safe this whole time, don’t hang out with anyone etc. Also he’s totally for masks now, sometime in those three months his views totally flipped but didn’t bother to approach us, apologize or take us up on our terms to hang out. Whatever not worth pushing further with him.  The end of this talk turned into me being told my SIL needs me and don’t give up on her. Give her time. I am confused and feel bad. MIL also told me it may not seem fair but I would probably need to come around for her to warm up to us.  I get home and text her that I didn’t realize I hurt her so badly and I was sorry. I’m not going anywhere and I’m here to talk when she is ready.  Since she said that she didn’t know what her husband said to us I text him the following morning asking if he could explain to her that part because it might help her understand where we were coming from. She had missed me explaining that during our sit down as she left the room.  Now he responds he feels targeted and he feels so badly “he doesn’t know when he’ll be himself again” and he is so depressed.  Well her response did not match how MIL and her husband explained she felt toward me. She ripped me a new one via text saying I didn’t understand the reality of the last few months. That I had isolated my family apart from everyone. That I withheld my children from them that they “love like their own”. That the rest of them felt pressured to get vaccinated (like I forced them to go against their own deep beliefs). That it was entirely all my fault and it could have been avoided if I had just said “we were going to lay low but will come over as normal” (not what we decided why would we say that). And that they were DEEPLY  hurt and this will take a long time to move on from this. Oh and also that I had been ignoring her at the bday party in August. And the best part- don’t you dare blame my husband for this mess you created. That she stands by what he said because he was “coming from a place of hurt”.   So I regretfully respond a long detailed essay basically breaking down every step of this and what happened from our side. I told her that she intimidates me and I didn’t feel comfortable being honest with her that initial time I had my husband call (her brother). I apologized for not specifically telling her that we wouldn’t be coming to the house and only meeting up at the park (which I’m not fully sure is true I feel like he did tell her this initially but we don’t remember clearly). I did stand up for myself and tell her that this was not all my fault. That I would not take responsibility for others assumptions and choices. Called her out on claiming I ignored her etc. Tried to keep it matter of fact without too much emotion although it was long. Also said I was not attacking her husband by explaining by how his words affected us.   She responds now in a completely different tone :  “I have digested everything you have written. My last comment before working through this situation, most likely with my therapist lol, is that both you and (my husband) never contacted ME about your plan of action. Not once. I would have completely understood and would have met at playgrounds. I didn't get that text or call though. I feel like the first time I heard from you was the week before (Her child’s) party. And that's 6ish weeks where I heard nothing and even then it was not your plan moving forward. That's what I'm most upset about.”  I responded:  “We dropped the ball on not telling you specifically and I am sorry we didn't.”  Since then she has been giving me the silent treatment on another issue. The period of time she was suspiciously overly friendly to me was brief after this “make up”.   She literally did not acknowledge one thing I said in my long response. No empathy, no understanding, no apology for any part in this she may feel responsible. Couldn’t she have communicated or reached out? Not even a mention of the way she spoke to me?   I started to feel she felt slighted because I declined to hang out and had my husband tell her. Although it was not personal I feel she took it very personal and spent the next few months convincing any family that would listen that my husband and I were terrible with partial and twisted truths.  Come to find out when she left the room during our talk she was around the corner listening to the entire conversation. I feel now she was watching and enjoying all the drama she created and wanted to be in the know. I think her tears she shed before walking away we’re only for herself and how wronged she felt. She can’t face me face to face but she can attack me verbally via text? I doubt she would have said what she said in front over everyone directly to me.   Lately I’ve been doubting myself. Maybe we did completely forget to tell her. Maybe I am not remembering correctly? Maybe she thought it was 10 days and then we didn’t reach out because her husband was an asshole and she was left wondering what she did wrong and felt hurt? Wouldn’t a normal reasonable person or friend just reach out and say “hey what’s up has it been enough time y’all wanna hang out”? She didn’t which leads me to believe she was well aware but playing dumb. By saying nobody told her directly and not knowing what her husband said- makes her able to be the victim and can easily put all the blame on my husband and I for just making her feel singled out and excluded out of the blue. Especially since our choices seemed to be the hot topic of gossip from that household, how long did she not know? At what point did she realize and decided to just be hurt about it the rest of the time? That’s great she is going to therapy but the way it was mentioned felt like it was to make me feel like I really fucked up. Look how badly you hurt her, she’s in therapy now.  Since when do my husband and I need to makes announcements to every family member of our personal decisions on a regular basis?

xknxc	A year ago this month, my little brother died. This led to my sister, J (27F), becoming a member of my close-knit friend circle. We were both debilitated by grief to the point where we couldn’t leave each other’s side for anything, even sleeping, showering, etc. This temporary codependency saved our lives.   My friends would visit to support me, which is how they met J. It was challenging to have my little sister embedded in my social group, but also humbling and rewarding, and I knew J needed the support as her own friends fell short of meeting her emotional needs. J met my closest friend, M (28M).  At the time and until recently, M was in a relationship with a woman he planned to marry. This is nothing new as M is very intense and says this about most of the women he dates within 1-2 months. M makes a point of forbidding his girlfriends from having relationships with “his” friends independent of him. In fact, M tends to gatekeep access to anybody he perceives of as being “his” friend. He considers himself the “leader” of our friend circle.  I’m ashamed to say that until now I’ve written this off, because “we all know how M is.” Even though I took issue with the way he treated his partners, I reasoned that it was not my place to meddle in his relationships. I realize that I’ve enabled M in this way.  Two months ago, M and J started dating covertly. They only admitted to it after I brought it up, which resulted in a huge loss of intimacy between me and M. We barely speak at all now because I hate the way he treats J! Two hours go by without a response to his text and he’s pissed at her. She’s not “affectionate enough” in front of our friends. She’s not standing close enough to him at the bar. She wasn’t supportive enough of a hypothetical haircut he wants. He reams her out for the most asinine shit on the planet and it drives me fucking nuts.  I want to be supportive, but this sucks. I am very lonely and my friend circle no longer feels like a safe place where I can just relax. Sometimes a person wants to hang out without their little sister, but now that’s an impossibility for me because M will always bring J along. The cherry on top of this shitcream sundae is that me and M used to hook up, so there’s an added flavor of incest.  We just moved to a new city where our only support network is each other and our circle, but I find myself dreading the hangouts and parties that I once looked forward to. I know it’s causing both M and J a lot of anguish that I feel this way and J says it puts a strain on their relationship. But I mourn the relationship I used to have with M and the rest of our friends. I feel like I don’t just want but NEED space.  So, reddit: AITA?  TL;DR: Best friend and sister started secretly dating before we moved to a new city together; I am taking space from them and our mutual friends because I don’t enjoy hanging out with them like I did before they started dating, but they say this is putting a strain on their relationship.	1643138879.0	sclq0q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sclq0q/aita_for_distancing_from_my_best_friend_and_my/	AITA for distancing from my best friend and my sister now that they are dating?
j0nlx4jo	 Throwaway for obvious reasons.     I [f24] have been with my boyfriend "Justin" [m27] for nearly a year, his birthday was several days ago and since this is his first birthday while we're together and also since I'm into literacy I decided to write him a poem and...give it to him as birthday gift.   The party was at the local restaurant, and his friends came which bothered me because they've been a bit nasty and judgemental towards me in the past and literally pick anything about me to laugh at. So I tried to be firm and respectful.   When I gave Justin his gift he looked so happy with it (though he kept laughing idk why) and then after he looked at it, he handed it back to me and ask me to read it for him out loud. I was caught off guard and felt so uncomfortable with his request because I have a stutter and didn't want to be put on the spot. I tried to politely decline but he insisted saying it's part of my gift for me and that it'd be more beautiful in my voice. I tried but obviously my nerves and stutter got the best of me. What's worse is that he and his friends started laughing loudly (like ahahahah type of laugh) as I was struggling to get it done. One of his friends tried imitating me but Justin told him to sthu while laughing himself. I stopped immediately. I felt so horrible I just got up from the table and went to the toilet. I cried my eyes out then excused myself to go home. Justin acted confused as to why I left all of a sudden.   We had a pretty big argument when he got home (drunk) he said I overreacted when I told him how I felt. But I stated that it hurt me so bad that he and his friends made fun of me. I told him for that I will no longer be writing him any poems nomatter the ocassion, period. He was like come on and that he loves my poems and think I'm creative BUT a bit oversensitive and should just have let it go and be a little more "solid" and less emotional about every little thing. He even said this is just my insecurity talking -.  Idk, he's so upset I told him that I will no longer right him poems since he usually enjoys them and cherishes them.

6dyr5dak	    Some background information - I (21F) have not really loved full-time with my mom since 16 (after around 16 I would visit her every other weekend). I lived with my grandmother until I left for college at 18. However, even before moving out of my mom's house, we were never in the house together at the same time.     During my first year in college, I met my now boyfriend and we have been living together for about 2 years now. We love closer to my college which is about 3 hours away from my hometown. As the distance is manageable but not enjoyable to drive all the time - my visits are usually sporadic and are usually not back to back.      Since September I have been studying abroad in the UK and came back in December just to be around the family for the holidays before I eventually will have to leave again for the UK now in January. I visited the family around Christmas time and saw everyone; mom, dad, siblings, cousins, the whole work. That was supposed to be the last time I visited but then I experienced car troubles and decided to drive back home just to drop my car off to get it worked on.      I only planned on spending a night or two there at my grandmother's place during that time. When I make small visits like this I usually dont let everyone know that I'll be back in town as then it makes me look rude when I saw I can't visit everyone or I just don't want to. If I visit everyone I would be running around the entire time I was there and driving multiple hours a day.      While talking to my mom, my grandma let it slip that I was there. My mom got super mad apparently (I was out of the house at the time). My grandma tried to be a voice of reason, saying it was just to bring my car up for a few days that I didn't really plan this trip out, etc. However, my mother went on a whole rant about how she sees "where she ranks on my list of priorities", and that I only ever talk to my mom to ask for money (which I have never asked my mom for money - other than to help out with a parent plus loan once in college. She doesn't pay for anything of mine otherwise). My grandma told her to call me and talk about it and she said that she instead was going to send me a "nasty message". Which was just to say thanks for keeping me informed on your plans, I see how I rank with you.        Now I may be TA when I asked her what she meant because honestly, I didn't feel the need to inform her on them and she just answered with another similar text.      I haven't texted her back or spoke to her at all. My bf thinks that I don't have to tell her and sympathizes but basically says I should just tell her anyways. My sister agrees with me that I shouldn't have to tell her every decision I make when she isn't a priority in my life anymore  *Also Important - my mother has never shared information about her life. She has been hospitalized, moved out of her, and gotten engaged before without telling me and I found out through other people.	1643141257.0	scmm74	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmm74/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_i_was_back_home/	AITA for not telling my mom I was back home?
izqu1slh	My cousin (24M) is convinced he has the most difficult job in the world. He believes working in fast food is the hardest and most stressing and taxing job there is, and he frequently tells me (21F) I couldn’t imagine how hard it is in a self-congratulatory way. How I could never do his job. He works 40 hours a week.  I informed him that I did work at a food place once. It was simple and low-pressure, and I really can’t picture a way it could’ve been easier. All I did was put food into bowls.  This next summer and last summer, I had a paid internship at a consulting firm. I had to compete with hundreds of students go even get the chance. All of us work about 90 hours a week and are on-call 24/7. We grind all day every day, and we compete with each other to work the most and network the most to win a permanent spot at the firm after graduation. When we go home at night, we read up on the market and try to find the firm potential clients. There is no off-time.  I suggested my cousin and I trade places, and let’s see who breaks down and quits first. I know from experience that I would have a pretty stress-free life if all my position entailed was prepping food for 40 hours a week and going home afterward. Because I’ve done his job in the past with ease. He could never handle a day at my job.  He did not like that one bit. He said he could do my internship and it can’t be that hard. I was like “okay, then why don’t you try to get a consulting firm internship?” He wouldn’t be able to because you have to fight hundreds of people to get one, and then you have to actually be able to work 90 hours, and he could never.	1643141416.0	scmof2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmof2/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_i_could_do_his_job/	AITA for telling my cousin I could do his job with ease?
7r64du0s	22F, my 21 M bf has a new job which means we don’t get enough time together. He gets 1 day off spends it sleeping which is good he deserves it, every other day he comes home at 7 has dinner texts me for like 5 mins and sleeps. I am not used to this, however I was understanding and welcoming of the change in his life and very supportive.   I had a nephrectomy recently and not only do I not have any one nearby for care, my family is also abusive. So in these few dreadful days I wanted to possibly FT again so I can maybe feel better and have some1 to actually share my feelings to and also learn more about how he’s doing with his new job.   Between his coming home time and his sleep time there’s 4 hours. I just wanted 1 hour or less. Asked him and he said sure. But he ditched FT for 2 days straight. I didn’t say anything.   Today I asked him and he said yes again. However he ended up having a 2 hour dinner with his family at home ( this happens every night it’s anywhere from 45-120 mins) since he stays with his mum and dad. I don’t have an issue with him having dinner with them daily that’s great, not once have i complained about this habit over the course of our entire relationship. but acting like it’s the end of the world if it doesn’t happen one or two nights?   After dinner , he came and tried making a very obviously half hearted text conversation so I told him in a faint way to just not pretend, and sleep and that it’s fine. To which he sarcastically said “thank you” as if he’d just been dying to go away. we had a small back and forth and he said he doesn’t have time and is thinking about how to make more time for me.   I told him if he thinks he has no time then why not pick up his food and eat while we FT that way he saves time? And that it’s not important to have a nice family dinner every single night. I understand bonding with family is important but he’s not in a cult. It’s not enough that they all share a bed ? If I’m looking forward to time with him shouldn’t he make that time for me especially if he COULD actually have better managed his time?, especially if he has made a commitment to be there ?   He defended it by highlighting it’s important and that all families have dinner together but he would stop if I am bothered. Which isn’t a healthy compromise, rather makes me look and sound bad.   AITA for asking him to give up family dinner for a few nights?    TLDR: bf claims he doesn’t have time for me bcz of new job but willfully spends 1-2 hrs on a nightly family dinner ritual with his parents.	1643142154.0	scmyg2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmyg2/aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_stop_having_dinner/	AITA for asking my partner to stop having dinner with his parents ?
7u2ztoox	I (28F) am getting married in august. Woke up yesterday to my mom calling me to tell me that my aunt, (68F) Posted my wedding dress to her Instagram story (my whole family saw the dress and I had multiple people text me to tell me they saw it - vail and all) and couldn’t get it down for seven hours, because she deleted the app and then could not remember how to login. She did not apologize. Only DM’d me after the whole debacle “🥰🥰🥰🥰”  Understanding that she’s older and doesn’t know how to work technology, I am not upset with her that it happened. However, I feel like she inadvertently took away a very special thing from me and I still would like an apology. Am I the asshole for still expecting an apology?	1643142757.0	scn6jw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scn6jw/aita_aunt_posted_my_wedding_dress_wo_permission/	AITA: Aunt posted my wedding dress w/o permission on Instagram before wedding date and didn’t apologize
j0ohca0g	A friend of mine is in her 20s and unable to work because of physical problems. For about 2 years she's been in financial trouble and for most of this time I have supported her by buying groceries and taking care of bills she can't afford to pay. Lately I've been chipping in at least 600 to 800 dollars each month to help her.  While this won't get me into trouble for now, it does interfere with my own goals of saving money, paying off student loans and starting my own business. I don't want to be in this situation but I can't just abandon her. She's my friend and can hardly count on others to help her out.   A week ago she was in a lot of pain due to back issues and couldn't sit on the sofa. It was hard for me to see her like that, so I paid 250 dollars for an ergonomic chair that would provide some relief. I had just spent around 500 dollars on bills, but I didn't want her to suffer. We found a chair that she liked and I had it delivered to her house. Luckily it helped. So far so good.  A few days ago she told me two relatives independently offered to give her money to buy ergonomic chairs as well. Normally she wouldn't get gifts from family members so she was thrilled. She wanted to use the money to buy two more chairs to match the first one, because she thought they where really cute. I asked her if it wouldn't be more appropriate to spend at least some of the money on bills that still needed paying, because otherwise I would have to take care of those.  She got angry and said it was insensitive and controlling of me to tell her how to spend money someone gifted her. I was way out of line and hurt her, because she has hardly ever gotten gifts from them and she never buys anything nice for herself. While I can understand that must feel terrible, I didn't think my opinion was inappropriate. I told her it was just a suggestion, but she insisted it came across as a demand. She has made me doubt my behavior and thoughts before, so now I'm wondering if maybe I'm wrong.  Am I mistaken to have some expectations about how she handles her finances? Or is this something I simply don't understand, because I've never been in the same situation as her? That's what she is saying at least. To me it feels more like frivolous spending and I'm the one who ends up paying for everything eventually. Usually I give in to avoid confrontation, but being frugal is too important for me at this moment.  I simply don't know what to do or think anymore, so I would truly appreciate any thoughts.	1643142963.0	scn9aw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scn9aw/aita_for_critizing_how_a_friend_spends_her_money/	AITA for critizing how a friend spends her money while I support her financially?
a9jkoxur	I (15f) have had a cyst for a week now and it has jus popped today. I have been bleeding through my pants bc my parents have not shown me have to bandage the cyst to keep it from spreading. I have asked my dad on multiple occasions if I can go to the hospital and he said “No, because they gonna have you do the same shit I telling you to do(take antibiotics)… you gonna fuck around and come back with something worse”.  I also asked my dad if I can just go yo the hospital with my mom and he said “you know her sorry ass ain’t gonna take you nowhere”.  I have now been giving my dad attitude ever since he denied me going to hospital for help. And he is now mad at me for being mad at him.

j08mqrs4	Am I the a-hole for telling my friend he is a psycho? You see, my friend has been approaching homeless women on the street, and offering them granola bars. Most of them accept the food and eat it. My friend then sticks around and talks to them for a bit, and then he invites them to eat more food. In his car. And he tells the women that they should eat and "hang out" in his car. A few have accepted his offer, and so they went to his car, ate fast food, and then he hooked up with them in his car. He even had sex with 2 of them. Anyway, I told my friend he is messed up for doing this, and also an idiot, because a lot of things can go wrong when putting himself in these situations. He says I'm too judgemental because he enjoys it, and so do the women (according to him). I told him I don't want to associate with him if he's gonna continue this behavior. Am I  the a-hole for judging him like this, and saying that I don't want to associate with him? Or is he the a-hole for engaging in this very wierd behavior?

j0o46j36	So basically I (18f) have been with my bf (19m) for a year. I am in my last year of high-school and where I live its common for people to go to after-school classes. Anyway so there's a guy in one of the classes I attend who I think has started developing a crush on me. (FYI I don't keep my bf a secret I have posted him on my instagram story a few times by now). The thing is I'm not sure this guy knows I have a bf even though I'm sure he's seen him at some point. A few days ago I had an exam regarding the subject of our mutual class and since my friends from that class and my teacher were not able to help me (she had work with other students until late at night) , I figured I should text him since he's the only other person I've really spoken to at least once (also because he understands the subject better than a lot of us). Also important to add that I didn't really know he liked me. That day after asking my bf if I can text said guy to ask him about the subject, and him agreeing, I went ahead and texted him. He was very accommodating and made sure to let me know that I can ask him anything I want but he would keep pushing to continue the convo and while trying to remain nice, since he was helping me and all, I texted him stuff like "good luck" and "I should go study now" in order to end the conversation as early as possible partly because I had suspected he liked me (my bf knew too) and I didn't want to "lead him on".  The next day this guy texted me to ask how I did on the exam. I told my bf that he had texted me and then I replied to him and we talked about the exam for a bit. Once more in an attempt to cut the convo short (mostly because I could tell my bf didn't like it) I told him that I have to study for my next exam (which I did). Next day (today), he texts me once more for the most random reason (about some papers our teacher gave us that he wanted to throw away). My bf told me not to reply (I did not agree as I hate being rude especially to people who tried to help me), and then i talked to my best friend and mum and they told me to be as short and to the point with my texts as possible but that I should reply since he didn't do anything wrong/ it would be really awkward if I ignored him. I ended the convo fast and told my bf that I replied with a short answer and then my bf started ignoring me. He said he had to go do some chores and I apologized because I realized that I pissed him off and told him that I don't care about that guy in that way (I really don't) and I am really not trying to enable him. I said all I was doing was trying to be decent to a person that spent their time and energy to help me. He hasn't replied to any of my texts and it has been hours. I feel like shit and I can't stop thinking about it. I have another exam tomorrow and I can't get this situation out of my head. AITA? what should I do?	1643143876.0	scnlpt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnlpt/aita_for_not_listening_to_my_so/	AITA for not listening to my SO?
j0pa3h8l	My sister 29 has been with her husband for 10 years and has a 4 year old and 4 month old. Her house is very dirty and falling apart (floors falling in and overall crumbling) They keep getting animals who poop and pee all over so it smells of animal poop on top of moldy smell. So bad that when my sister brings her kids over the smell is in their hair. I (27) have 5 kids so I know how hard being a parents is and I have also had financial trouble so I know all about that too. So to me these aren’t excuses for living in filth. She is a STAHM now that she had her second baby but up until 5 month ago she worked full time along with her husband working full time also. Her husband has a really good job so I know he makes plenty of money I just don’t know what he does with it all.  Anyway after my 4 yo niece told me that there was a rat in their house and she was scared I had enough and called CPS and they visited her today. My sister called me asking if I called because some of the things the case worker said are things only a family member would know about. I denied it and she believed me. Which is great. The only problem is that now everyone (her and my parents) think it was my sister in law. There is already issues in my sister and SIL relationship so it’s not hurting that. But I love my SIL so I feel terrible that people are going to have more reasons to not like her. But if they know it was me my parents will be so angry and my sister will never speak to me again. So should I let them assume it was my sister in law or should I come clean?	1643145044.0	sco1dd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco1dd/aitah_for_calling_cps_and_letting_my_sister_in/	AITAH for calling CPS and letting my sister in law take the blame?
9zesc8dd	Hey reddit! long time lurker, first time poster on a throwaway for privacy  some background info: I (16F) and my friend (also 16F, who I'll call Marissa) haven't always gotten on the best. We have very similar personalities (stubborn, driven, ambitious, sarcastic) and often butt heads on certain topics. I also have GAD, OCD and am currently getting ready to be screened for ASD.   Now, onto the incident today.   Marissa started singing a song, and I finished the lyrics, which used the word "hoe" in it. Marissa immediately seemed (what I believed to be) jokingly annoyed, asking me if I really just called her a hoe. I responded "No, I was just finishing the song lyrics." She went on to loudly say "Guys, \*my name\* just called me a hoe!" She said this in a class full of 20 people (the teacher wasn't in yet) and my classmates responded with things like "Wow \*my name\*, this is a non bullying zone" or "I can't believe you would say that!" I think these comments might have been sarcastic? However I can't be sure.   Then , when more of our friends entered she started to tell them about the situation, at which point I was begining to get fed up and butted in, saying "well, maybe you are a hoe."  aftwer these comments were made i went to her and promised her they were all in good fun and i didnt mean to offend her if i did, i was just joking around. I thought we were fine until later that evening (now) when she hasn't been responding to my text messages.   I generally do really well in school and wouldn't want her to report it because i get really bad anxiety around confrontational situations. However, I also don't want to make her feel bad/make her believe that i actually think that about her (nothing wrong with being a hoe but in the circumstances I said it in I can see why it would be seeen as more of an insult).   I feel like I might be the Ahole because I'm generally not known for making jokes, so when I do my friends sometimes have a hard time differentiating between a joke and a serious comment.   Am I overthinking this? Was she really offended or just off her phone/pretending that she was offended sarcastically? Any insight would be apprecaited.

308l41b0	Backstory: I am an 18 year old boy who has family problems, my mother has ALS which means my dad is taking care of her all the time, so I have never been able to drive with my dad. I drove with him for like, 30 minutes. That also means I didn't start driving until I was 18 last year in November. And I was having a blast! I was nervous at first, but that’s normal for students. I did have a break from driving when Christmas came and didn't drive for a few weeks as lessons didn't line up, so it was safe to say, I was rusty with driving. (This is important.) Now for the story, My driving instructor who will now be referred to as DI, met a few weeks ago and nothing has really gone wrong! A few hiccups here and there with turn signals and whatnot, but that’s expected, I'm new. I was so afraid of crashing or doing something wrong to damage the car, I am a person who overuses the word "Sorry". I mean, I don't want to get in trouble, that's the last thing I want to happen! DI Said something to me during lessons, "Don't worry, this car is BUILT FOR MISTAKES." This quote burned into my mind that "Oh, I'm new, small mistakes shouldn't matter much because the car is cheap and old." Which is true, the car looked really old.   Cue today, and they arrive 10 minutes early, so I quickly get off and rush outside, get inside, and try to pull out of my driveway. There was a problem though, my dad's car was in the middle of it and when I try to drive out, I get into a bad position, so I think "Okay, I'll drive just a little forward to try to get out of here" noticing the tree in front of me, so I let off the brake and the car doesn't move forward automatically because of the snow on the ground, okay... so I press on the gas lightly... at least I try to. I hear the engine go loud and move my foot to the brake, or at least... I thought I did. I drove right into the tree. Mind me, it wasn't that hard, I don't even think i broke the car THAT much, but before I could even say a word, before i could say sorry and apologize, DI immediately looks to me DI: "Are you a fucking idiot!?" Now this... this hurt me HARD instantly, at that moment my mind tries to justify me doing this, and I pipe out Me: "B-But I didn't mean to-" DI: "Get out." We bicker back and forth, me trying to apologize and stay in the lesson, as I want to take the lesson! he kept on pushing for me to get out and when I still protested, apologizing more, he yells out DI: "Get out now or I will DRAG you out!" I picked up my stuff and got out, storming inside in shock and a bit of rage as I tell my dad what happened, and he is in shock that I well, drove into a tree... He tries to tell me why he would kick me out of the car and everything, saying he would do it too, and I just broke into tears, I hated myself for driving into the tree and cried for 10 minutes straight, saying sorry to dad and everything... I just stand there, crying my eyes out, only calming down 10 minutes later… AITA?	1643145321.0	sco560	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco560/aita_for_driving_into_a_tree/	AITA for driving into a tree?

j0r58645	I f36 has been dating my boyfriend who's 42 for about 4 years now. He wanted me to be a SAHW so since I was deeply in love with him I did which means I would take care of his daughter when she came over. My boyfriend has a daughter who just turned 18 in November and he has been acting really strange towards her. Before she was 18 he acted like a normal loving father but now it's like all the screws are off him. For her 18th birthday, he got her very expensive lingerie that showed alot. I asked him why it did it and his excuse was that he thought girls her age would want that stuff and he told me to drop it. Whenever his daughter leaves the house he forces her to kiss him or whenever we watch tv he forces her to sit on his lap and he slides his hand up her thighs. I've tried several times to stop this but he would tell me to mind my business and his daughter would say she's fine with it. The last straw was when I and his daughter were having a conversation while she was doing the dishes and he came up behind her and pressed himself against her. Every time I tell him how this makes me uncomfortable he says that it's none of my business and I can leave if I don't like it. If I leave I'll be left with nothing and since she consents to it I don't think I can call the cops. Every time I bring it up he makes me feel like how im feeling is wrong and now he or his daughter won't speak to me and he gave me a few days to pack my stuff and leave.	1643147224.0	scou0w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scou0w/aita_for_being_really_uncomfortable_for_how_my/	AITA for being really uncomfortable for how my boyfriend treats his freshly adult daughter?
h3qd7p5r	I (21F) work in a heavily male dominated industry. My department is a little better, but not great. There are other departments where I’d be amazed if I saw a woman. This gender imbalance sometimes causes a shitty environment for women in my field, especially young women.  Today I had to drop off a handful of heavy boxes at my office. Our office is essentially on a campus, the parking garage is a block away, but if you are dropping things off you are given a pass to do so. I got a pass from security and was told where in front of the office to park. I park exactly where I was told to and start unloading my boxes. The 50ish year old department head in a VERY male dominated department comes over and starts SCREAMING at me at the top of his lungs that I can’t park there. I told him that’s where the security guard told me to. He just screams louder.   I was raised in a household with an abusive father and I simply refuse to be spoken to in that way any more so I say, “do not talk to me that way, this is a work place.” He keeps screaming so I go, “Do you like screaming at 20 year old girls? Is that fun for you?” Some of his team laugh when I say that and he sees red and loses it and throws what he was holding (away from me). I just decide to go about my business while he has his temper tantrum.  I go inside and tell my boss what’s happening and he goes out there to “deal” with it (idk what that entailed). What I do know is that while a few (very high up) women came to say they were sorry what happened and one called me a badass, one other department head went off on my boss. I was in the next office and overheard her tell him that I was way out of line and just needed to placate him. My boss said, “I’m not going to tell a woman in her first job to accept abuse.” And they argued a bit more. Other people in the yelling guy’s department have made shitty comments since he (I think) got sent home.   So AITA for my smart ass comment and also for putting my boss in a situation where he has to defend me?	1643147303.0	scouw5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scouw5/aita_for_making_a_smart_ass_comment_to_a_coworker/	AITA for making a smart ass comment to a coworker who was SCREAMING at me?
8x1xjzp6	I (24F) have been dating this guy (26M) for a year now, let's call him Alex. I got out of a pretty bad heartbreak, so Alex and I hung out for months till he gained my trust and we started dating. I've found him very attractive, and we had a lot in common. What I liked the most about him was the way he talks, since he used to tell me a lot of sweet things.  His workplace was pretty close to mine, and we lived in the same area as well which was a fantastic coincidence. We got together during January, and he kinda hyped me about Valentine's day, saying it would be special.  He even asked if I liked rings over necklaces. I thought to myself that he probably wanted to choose a gift for me and got excited. Fastforward to valentines, we met up and I asked him where we were going, and simply replied that he has no idea. I thought he was joking but he wasn't apparently.   Anyways, I proposed to go to a nice café, but as soon as we got the menu he complained about how expensive everything was.  I didn't give it much of a thought, so we walked home and I still had some hopes about getting a gift, but nope, nothing. I prepared for him a heart shaped cake for the occasion so I was really hurt when I didn't get anything at all, not even a single rose.. now I am not the type to expect too much so he hyped me for nothing. My birthday was three months later, and again, he hyped me for it saying it'll be special and that we were going to celebrate. I wore my best dress for the occasion and went out to meet him. I asked where we were going, and guess what? He said that he has 0 clue. I had to pick the restaurant, and there was no gift too. On our way home he noticed that I was feeling down so we walked up to an ATM nearby and he took 100$ and handed it over, telling me to buy whatever I want with it, and that was the gift he had to offer me.  I was shocked and started crying, telling him how insulting that was. I have a stable job and can technically afford whatever I want, and I wasn't waiting for anybody to hand me money. Gifts are supposed to be little ornaments someone thinks you might like, and he didn't even bother getting me any. We reconciled afterwards, and things were going smoothly between us except for when he keeps coming late to our dates (about 20mins-1hr) every time. Our couple anniversary was the 1st January and once more he hyped me for it. I reserved at a restaurant the night before since it was the end of the year, so days went by and we didn't celebrate our anniversary at all.   Yesterday I've had enough of it and called him out for it, but he said I was just overreacting and that we went out on new year's eve (btw it was my idea), and that we already celebrated in his opinion.

I was stunned and did not call him out at that time but I felt bad and thought it best to share my feedback with him over chat immediately after the meeting.  OP - "Hey D, just wanted to share some feedback, you shouldn't laugh at someone in a professional meeting that was set-up for the purpose of resolving any questions/doubts (as stupid as you might think the question is)"  D - " sorry, I didn't get you"  I go ahead and explain in detail about how I perceived the situation. He told me that I misunderstood and he wasn't laughing at me. I told him that I accept his point and let it go untill he said this as his closing remark -  D - " I don't appreciate you making baseless accusations at me"  At this point, I lost it and told him that my accusations were not baseless and it was evident that he was sniggering. I was respectful and make sure I was just stating the facts and how I perceived them.  He responded back that " he was disappointed and that I was making a big issue over some laughter "   He also went ahead and told multiple co-workers about our "fight" which I found very unprofessional.  Later I started thinking if I should have just let it be.  So good people of Reddit, AITA?  P.S - He has a habit of subtly mocking new people in the team ove their lack of knowledge but he is careful to hide his disdain in front of our superiors. I have faced this in the past with him but haven't been able to complain because he has a very good reputation in the team and I don't want to be the new lady who is "over-sensitive"	1643148501.0	scp9vx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scp9vx/aita_for_making_baseless_accusations_at_my/	AITA for making baseless accusations at my colleague and creating a mountain over a molehill?
j0t1eqdf	I've liked a guy for a long time and I learned recently that he does too. However, I was teasing him sarcastically about not being obvious and telling me from the get-go.   We literally met at the end of 2017 and he never said anything and elected to tell all of his friends and some of my friends but never told me. Moreover, I swear that he flirted with other women in the time between 2017 and now and seemed really into this one person.  However, my partner insists that he did try to make it obvious that he liked me, such as joining this one organization I was a part of and going to one of my work award ceremonies and bringing me flowers. I must also note that when I ran into him at the ceremony, he said that he was there for someone else.   He also weirdly tried to ask me to tutor him in a language I know when Google Translate and Duolingo and people who teach languages for a living do that better.   I don't think any of the things he did were that obvious. I thought he was just being friendly and he got upset with me because he said "he tried hard and I never noticed and it stressed him out."	1643149999.0	scptnz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scptnz/aita_for_telling_a_guy_that_he_was_not_being/	AITA for telling a guy that he was not being obvious about his feelings for me?
ik0usbij	My boyfriend (m22) lives in a flat (apartment) that his father bought. His sister (f24) also lives in the apartment. Due to me working night shifts and the commute from my work to my boyfriends apartment taking 20 minutes instead of one hour back to where I live, I’ve been spending more time at his apartment. Because of my night shifts I get in really late so he gave me a key so that he can sleep and doesn’t have to buzz me in.  Because I’ve started to stay at my boyfriends more, I’ve asked his father if there is any compensation (rent, electricity bill) I can pay for but he said no, as he’d pay it anyway because his kids live there and one person doesn’t make much difference. I really appreciate that because I’m a student and don’t earn that much of a salary. I split all the grocery bills etc. with my boyfriend (his sister only contributes to the bill when she feels like it). I also clean the apartment and do everyone’s laundry, because I feel like I can show my gratitude for being allowed to stay in the apartment occasionally by doing that. This has been going on for about one and a half years.  Okay so here’s the thing: I bought a rather expensive wine to celebrate a big exam I wrote. I got back to the apartment to find that the wine bottle was empty and I got quite angry. I phoned my boyfriend and asked if he’d maybe drunk it but he told me his sister had drunk it and he’d told her but they’d both just shrugged it off. In the past she has eaten or drunk stuff I bought but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to make a fight.  I confronted her and she said I had no right to get angry because the wine was in her fridge. I popped and told her that I find her behaviour disrespectful and asked her to buy a new bottle but she refused, stating that I “owed” it.  I told my boyfriend and he said I shouldn’t make a big deal out of it and is mad at me for making a fight.  I feel bad because now there’s so much tension and think that I maybe don’t have a right to get angry about it and maybe I’m overreacting?   Ps: I don’t come from a rich family and was taught that you have to earn things and not take anything for granted. My boyfriend’s family know that I don’t come from a rich family and work and study. Where his mom “pities” me for this his father (who is the breadwinner of the family; he’s the only one who works, the mom and kids live off of his salary) somewhat respects me for it I guess. However his sister uses every possible opportunity to rub under my nose how wealthy her family is, and all the great stuff she can buy and I can’t. She does things like shame me for the clothes I buy or wear because they aren’t sustainable- but I can’t afford new sustainable clothes (i buy second hand clothes, but shirts that I wear to work I buy new from fast fashion stores). So there’s kinda always been tension between me and her.	1643150637.0	scq2hp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scq2hp/aita_for_getting_mad_over_a_bottle_of_wine/	AITA for getting mad over a bottle of wine?
ilp88qiw	Look. I’m in a relationship. 29F with a 28M and we’ve been dating for 2 years.  The guy I’m talking about 29M randomly hit me up on Instagram and sent me paragraphs upon paragraphs professing his love for me and then alluding to the S word.  I called him and he confirmed he had taken a bottle of pills and turned his gas on. I asked for his address but he wished to die. So, I got ahold of his family (mind you, I haven’t spoken to this guy in years and we were old childhood friends through my boy cousin years ago)   So getting ahold of these people wasn’t easy. Long story short, he was rescued and admitted to a hospital for a few days. My cousin and I wanted to meet up w him for coffee but it never happened.  Since then he’s been hitting me up constantly on ig, sending me romantic songs , telling me he’s thinking of me and all this while I have a bf whom I love a lot.  I feel guilty. I don’t want to respond because I don’t want him to get the wrong idea, but I also understand he’s going through a lot right now.   I haven’t told him that his messaging makes me uncomfortable / is kinda annoying because I don’t like having convo on Instagram , so AITA for ghosting him instead? I left his recent ig message on read where he asked how I was doing and said he was thinking about me.  We weren’t amazing friends before this and I still don’t feel like we are so.   TLDR; I saved a guy from capital S after he randomly messaged me after years on Instagram. After saving his life I no longer wish to continue our convo on ig.

cii4pu3z	AITAH for being mad at my best friend of 20 years for stealing my tattoo idea?    I need to preface this by saying it was definitely not an original idea, I’ve been obsessed with horror for as long as I can remember. My friend and I have always talked about the tattoos we want to get ever since we were teenagers.    I’ve always wanted a horror themed sleeve (not an original idea I know) but my best friend was never into horror and was even scared to watch the cult classics with me. I have always wanted a Captain Spaulding tattoo followed by some of my favorite horror characters, I’ve talked to her about it for over a decade.    Randomly she sent me a picture of her new tattoo and it was him. I am furious as I no longer want to get it because I don’t want to have the same tattoo as her. She got mad when I told her hey that was my idea and she turned it into well you slept on it so I got it. I explained to her the reason I haven’t got it done yet is because I’m waiting until I find an artist I trust to do it. She pretty much said oh well I’m turning this into a horror sleeve and you can get yours done in a different style. We are both heavily tattooed but I would never get a design that she wants.  I told her that at this point the friendship is over so AITAH? I know it’s just a tattoo and that I’m probably over reacting	1643151856.0	scqiu2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqiu2/aitah_for_being_mad_at_my_friend_for_stealing_my/	AITAH for being mad at my friend for stealing my tattoo idea?
j0t1eqdf	I teach in a suburban area and my new boyfriend lives like, 7 minutes away from the school I teach at. Walking honestly doesn't take that much longer.   Anyway, since this week is finals week for my school and tons of my colleagues are sick, he suggested that I stay at his house. I said okay, since I live further away and that I need to save all the time I can.   However, what I'm not okay with is that he said that he wants to go on walks with me and I'd rather not because I don't really want to run into my students or their parents.   I purposely chose to live further away from where I teach so I have boundaries and privacy, and he thinks I'm making a big deal out of it.	1643152056.0	scqlce	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqlce/aita_for_telling_my_partner_we_cannot_walk_around/	AITA for telling my partner we cannot walk around where I work?
j0ua5o6e	 I (m20) was called the other day by my mom asking me to come pick her up from the mall. She wanted to return something so I had to wait like 8 minutes for her to do it.   I was sitting on one of the benches near a chain of stores playing with my phone, a group of girls was walking around from a store to another and this girl (20s) kept giving me weird looks after they stopped to look at some products outside one of the store - to clarify the store was across from me. I had my phone to my sight level while checking my messages with my girlfriend. Few minutes later the girl approaches me and asks to seey phone. I'm like excuse me what...? she then points at the store across from me and says that she and her friends noticed me pointing my phone cam in their direction and most likely recording them. I tell her I wasn't but she insists I was. I tell her to prove it but she turns it around on me and say the proof is my phone then demand to see it. I refuse and tell her this won't happen and she needs to keep walking. She insists and threatens to get the security guard. I lash out and tell her I can't show her intimate, private messages I was sharing with my girlfriend and she needed to have some respect. She then claims I was making this am excuse and doubles down on getting the security guard. Mom shows up and starts arguing with the girls telling them to back off. And they did eventually though this girl said she was going to get the guard to check the cameras and get my face for later confrontation. Mom laughs at her then they leave. Mom and I left and we sort of forget about it. But when I brought this with my friends they said I fucked up by refusing to give that girl a peace of mind and eliminating her concerns of being recorded and should've just let her take a look at my phone since she's a stranger and wouldn't care about my intimate messages with my girlfriend but I thought that would have been huge breach of privacy. They even said I made a joke out of myself for letting mom get involved and handling it like that.

8rss54ki	I (39f) have been with my partner (41m) for 8 yrs. He could not keep a steady job because of some  health issues (mental not physical) so I helped him get on Disability. With his disability check he pays about 2/5 of the bills not including groceries. I buy the groceries, always. I work 50/60 hours a week. He takes the kids (17f, 16f and 15m) to school and their appts. He does get the kids up but lays right back down after he knocks on their bedroom doors once. He gets back up when it's about 20 minutes before they have to leave for school. They're usually not up so he then starts rushing them around. Typically he will make some mac and cheese for dinner or ravioli (chef boy ardee). He doesn't clean often.  He does do laundry but just ours (originally he just did his own) he won't do the kids unless I pester him. He cannot set a schedule for himself so he asked me to. So I spend my breaks and lunch at work texting him reminders of what he was supposed to do. If I do not remind him it is unlikely that it will be done. It I ask him to do something typically I have to be involved in every single step of the process even when I am at work. I am mentally exhausted, he is like a 4th child. I would never leave him because he needs me and he's an amazing Dad to the kids. He loves them as if they were his own and is incredibly supportive of them. Recently our middle daughter became very very Ill and he goes with her twice a month to her specialists that are 1 1/2 hrs away. He is the sweetest kindest person I know. However I feel like his mom. I recently told him that I resent him. we have talked and talked and talked about him contributing more to the household and he agrees, but rarely follows through. His feelings are hurt and he is mad because I told him I resent him, but it's true and I am intensely unhappy. He is so emotionally supportive, but I need a partner. I work so hard, I get up at 2am every day, I am just asking for him to put 2 or 3 hours into the house everyday. I am a person who expects a partner to put in an equal effort. Am I really the asshole because I am upset that he doesnt?	1643153258.0	scr1fv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scr1fv/aita_i_told_my_partner_i_resent_him/	AITA I told my partner I resent him.
inq56up7	Single Man here. People say I'm attractive, funny, etc. For various reasons I'm not currently dating. My social life is a group of married men at a bar. Our group has a really cool girl friend M that will hang out with us like she is one of the guys. M has an older sister E who comes up to the bar quite often, and always has another friend in tow, L, a woman much older than us. I do not find E & L attractive. E has a way of being in our space. E makes eyes at me. She always gives hugs, crowds us and she's always looking at me and laughing at my jokes. It is obvious to me that she's into me. My group has a younger guy H. Once H got drunk and hooked up with E. They were off and on. No one made it a big deal. Last night H and I were hanging out with a visiting friend. This friend is always horny, and he asked us about M and sister E. I said he could probably hook up with E if he wanted. He points out that H had done that already, which H denied. H explained it was never sex, just 2nd 3rd base. Okay fine. Later my friends left and I stayed and drank too much. I went to the bar for a beer. M, E, and L were sitting there. I made small talk. They asked about H leaving for the night. Without thinking I regurgitated H's earlier remark about he and E never slept together. BIG OOF! Awkward silence, I got my beer and walked off. Moments later M approached and asked to talk outside. She said that I made her sister cry, and that E's personal life is not my business. A bouncer confronted me saying I was making girls in his club cry so I got to go. I was surprised, but everyone remained calm. M and the bouncer told me to go apologize. I go find M, E, & L. Immediately L calls me an asshole and asks why I said what I said. I explained it wasn't my original idea, I was just telling you what H told me earlier. L kept raging and says it is none of my business, I'm an asshole, etc. She then yells at me that I have a small dick (I don't) and proceeds to claim that a girl I hooked up with a while back said so (even tho I heard the opposite if you know what I mean). I was tipsy so I eye roll and say whatever. I saw E come out of the bathroom and I told her I was sorry. I should have left it at that. But feeling deservedly defensive I tried to rationalize with her that I was just repeating what H said earlier. E starts crying again and and tells me I'm making it worse. Her sister looks at me and says "you know I love you but you need to go". I paid my tab and left without another word. I could care less what E and L think, but I don't appreciate feeling attacked or the attempted dick shame in public. I've never had anyone say that to me. I like M. She is fun to be around. I feel this may change our friendship and I don't like that. Also, I'm worried about my social circle now. I don't want to fear E and L randomly walking in and being in my space again. I'm not the one telling lies about hooking up. Either H is fibbing or E is fibbing and I let the cat out of the bag.

2a56gp3p	For context, Sunday is my 16th birthday, and as I can't really have friends over because of the Nazi government, I invited only my girlfriend to come spend some time with me.  My mother will not be home on Sunday, and thus she isn't OK with it.  Now you may be thinking that she's not OK with it because no parents are home to make sure we don't do anything stupid, but no.  My father will in fact be home, and yet my mom is still being an ass about it.  We had a bit of an argument, and I said that I was getting the vibe that she was intentionally trying to keep my girlfriend away from our house, to which she got really upset at.  On top of that, maybe I said some things I shouldn't have, so that was definitely a contributing factor too.

7q0hcczl	Me F39 and BF31 (“Tom”) have been together for 2 years.   Tom’s best buddy since childhood asked him to be his best man. For a destination wedding. In Mexico. Without asking or any heads up. We are to foot the bill. For. Seven. Days.   Neither of us have passports, Tom has a felony that may or may not affect getting a passport or entry to Mexico. They sent out a save the date for a year and a half out. I’m he total cost if both of us went is almost 10k, which we don’t, and won’t, have by this fall.   I refuse to go as I have zero desire to go since a friend of mine was killed there in HS. I also don’t want to go as I do not support their marriage (they get in fist fights and go on drunken benders and think it’s normal, that kind of relationship).   Tom has been sober for only 6 months and his buddy has been giving him shit about it, calling him a pussy. If he goes to Mexico without me, he will surely drink at the behest and goading of the raucous group of alcoholics going.   I love Tom, but feel like I’m being pressured into going to “save” his sobriety. I shouldn’t have to babysit anyone or go on a trip like this. Tom isn’t even that excited, but is now on the hook to go. He expresses concern that his friendship is already on the rocks (it is, it happens) but thinks that going will get him in his buddy’s good graces. I think it’s a pisspoor reason to go.   So, AITA for not wanting to spend money we don’t have, to attend a wedding for someone I don’t even like, who doesn’t even call us for hang out, out of the country, without having passports, in the middle of a pandemic, and not wanting  Tom to go either? I feel like this wedding is going to be what ends our relationship. If Tom loses his sobriety, I’m done. He knows it, but I already hear “what happens in Mexico stays in Mexico” as an excuse.	1643154601.0	scrj2j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrj2j/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_a_destination_wedding/	AITA for refusing to attend a destination wedding?
j0vghq35	  I (M25) don't have a good relationship with mom, she blamed me for it saying I made plenty of bad choices in my life including marrying my wife.   Background: My wife is of different ethnicity, 8 years older than me, and we're incompitable when it comes to wages. Mom listed these reasons to get me to leave my wife but I refused and told her she had to respect my wife and accept her. Mom tried to be civil but the nasty comments towards my wife kept coming in, my wife remained civil and graceful which made mom bolder.  I told mom she either respect my wife or won't be seeing much of mr which caused her to behave but still threw comments at my wife.   When we announced that my wife was pregnant, mom started acting strange, she then pulled my wife aside and told her to do an ultra sound and see if the baby "looked like her" then she needed to abort it or just flush it down the toilet. I was furious when my wife broke down and told me. I had a huge argument with my mom and stopped visiting her home desoite her apologizing profoundly. I just think her comment has done irreverseable damage to my wife's mental health.   Now our son is 4 weeks old, only few family members got to see him. Mom started reaching out again crying and begging and sending people to get me to let her see her grandchild. I kept refusing as I'd seen no apologies nor change. The family kept pressuring me and said mom still don't want anything to do with my wife, just wants to see her grandbaby. I said alright then and I agreed to visit her alone without my wife.   Instead of taking my son, I brought a baby doll and covered it in a blanket and brought it inside the house with a carrier. I saw an eager look on mom's face while reaching out for the carrier. I watched silently as she removed the blanket and found the doll. She looked at me in shock and so did the others then she threw the doll on the floor and started yelling at me calling me crazy, demon possessed and whatnot. I told her she doesn't get to see the grabdbaby that she wanted flushed down the toilet and that my wife did not deserve any of this. She argued that what I had no right to pull this on her and punishing and humiliating her by keeping her grandbaby away from her. I decided to just leave after she refused to stop yelling at me. Other members of my family strongly sided against what I did and called it petty. They said what I did messed mom up mentally and shattered her heart. They demanded I bring my son over and make it up to her, called my behavior disgraceful and pethatic.   I went home and cried, my wife said we should've given mom what she wanted and said she doesn't want to ruin my relationship with my family since they're all upset with me now.

j0wm7hfl	 I (f26) was recently diagnosed with Cancer, I knew it all along but the lab result came in last thursday. I was home alone when I recieved the results. I was scared, I cried and then I tried calling my husband.   I decided to wait for him to get home to tell him face to face. When he got home I gave him the news and showed him the lab results. He took a look at them then at my teary eyes then said "well, it's not the end of the world you're not the first person to be diagnosed with cancer" I had no idea where that came from. I was too shock to speak and so I lashed out calling him awful and horrible for saying what he said but he defended himself saying that he was just trying to comfort me and I flew off the handle for no legitimate reason. I had a fight with him telling him I was disappointed in him but he kept on about how worried he was for me, even noticed something was wrong with me beforehand and so supposedly already helped and supported me but I was acting oversensitive which is unfair to him.   He went to call his sistee claiming this is all too much for him and I was lashing out unfairly.  I've been going to the hospital by myself since he's stopped speaking to me or even ask if I needed anything.

e9kbv76t	I probably could have posted on here so many times about my mom but let’s just talk about tonight. I (20) still live at home, but I just got out of school last year & im working full time, trying to pay off my loans while saving up to move out (trust me, i’m really working on it). I went skiing two hours away all day today, and had forgotten to put an enveloppe I had gotten in the mail with a pair of earrings I had bought from a small business on etsy in my room and had accidentally left it on the kitchen table. To my surprise when I got home, 8 hours later the table was clear & the enveloppe was nowhere to be found. I asked my parents, ‘where’d you put the enveloppe that was on the table earlier?’ and I got back as a response from my mom ‘I cleaned up today, if it was on the table I probably threw it out’ I got super angry and asked if she’d even looked in the enveloppes before throwing them out, especially when they had MY name on it, and she said no. I dug through the top of the garbage & the recycles and couldnt find it, so i freaked out and finally my dad got up even though he wasn’t the one who threw it out to dig through the garbage and finally my mom comes to help. this is where i may be the asshole, I was obviously mad, especially when they ended up finding it covered in food at the bottom of the garbage bag, and I was just ranting the whole time saying how upset i am and how could she do this & my dad was saying ‘why didn’t you look before throwing things out’ and all my mom would say was ‘can you stop talking or else i’ll stop digging through the garbage and you can find it’ & my dad kept saying ‘well i’m not gonna stop we’re gonna find it can you stop’ to my mom.  finally when they found it, because I still had not gotten an apology during the entire 10-20 min search, i said ‘you fucking bitch’ and walked to my room. She then starts crying to my dad and brother saying that i’m so disrespectful, that she would have been kicked out if she was me etc etc making herself the victim, still hasn’t apologized. Then, starts saying that she’s never going to clean again because this is the thanks she gets for cleaning, and then starts threatening to kick me out of the house. Threatening to kick me out because I called her a bitch because she didn’t apologize for throwing out an expensive pair of earrings i meant to put in my room before the ski day trip but completely forgot.   (if i could leave right now i would but I have literally nowhere to go & i still owe like 2k out of 12k or something on my car to my parents & my mom told me if i ever took the car if it wasn’t fully payed of, and she kicks out, she’ll call the police and report it as stolen because it’s still under my dads name. )  So … Am I the asshole?	1643156554.0	scs90t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scs90t/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_mom_for_throwing_out_my/	AITA for being mad at my mom for throwing out my earrings?

54c690pk	I’ve worked at a sports complex for about two years now and i’ve managed to make some really great friends. The main friend group i had at work though was this group of two sister pairs. Three of them are around 20-23 so the one i was closest to was the 16 year old because i’m 17. We used to go get boba, have each other for birthday parties and everything was fine. Then the older three all decided to quit at the same time while me and the other sister (16) stayed working. Ever since then we haven’t all hung out together again but i’m best friends with the younger sister and we do everything together. She lives 30 minutes away from me though and always tells me she can’t drive to my town or just doesn’t want to come to it. So when i found out from these other girls from my work all of them came to have a tour around my town (none of them live here all also live 30 minutes away) and have a picnic in the park that’s in walking distance from my house i was shocked.   I didn’t believe it at first but then i messaged my friend about it and she admitted to it happening but became incredibly defensive also. She said she wasn’t obligated to invite me just because i live there and she was the ones who made the plan to look around my town. I just apologized for asking her why she didn’t tell me anything to avoid conflict because i guess technically she is right that she’s not obligated to invite to plans but it would have been nice for them to tell me because you know i can see the park from my house. I’m still on friendly terms with her sister and the other sisters also so i don’t see why they hid it from me. Am i being over dramatic about this?	1643159083.0	sct5hc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sct5hc/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_friends_had_a_picnic/	AITA for being upset that my friends had a picnic behind my house without telling me?
pvxojrq	My fiance (21f) and I (23m) have been together for a year, and are very excited to be getting married next week.  Anyways, we had been planning this whole wedding on fairly short notice (about 3-3.5 months advance) and had everything organized and ready to go as of this week. We had originally contacted our celebrant, had a face to face with her to go over paperwork, and just get a feel for what the ceremony would be like. From the initial meeting I could tell something was a bit off, as she seemed to want to leave everything last minute in order to keep the “thrill of the moment”. She also made an effort to mention multiple times about hiring her musical duo with her husband to provide the entertainment for the reception/ceremony.   Both my fiance and I overlooked this and decided to book with her anyways. Last week she sent us her “wedding questionnaire” which was meant to be filled out by both my partner and I individually, and was about 12 short response answer questions, basically a small essay and at least an hours effort, about my partner, how we met, and a plethora of other wedding cliches. Basically it seemed to me that this woman was trying to get us to write the whole ceremony for her. After seeing the questionnaire we decided to just do a short and sweet legals only ceremony since it was half the cost, and we didn’t have the time to spare as we were still organizing a fair bit for the wedding itself.   Last night, a week before the wedding, i receive a text at 10pm saying that she needs to cancel, as there’s been a “family health emergency that can’t be helped”. She went on to say she has other celebrant contacts and that I should call her today to discuss options. Today is a public holiday which I easily could’ve been out of town for, or uncontactable as this wouldn’t be out of the usual for celebrations.   I’m tempted to leave her a terrible review, as my partner and I are now freaking out a week in advance of the date we were very specific about and excited for. Now, I have to take the time out of my holiday to call her and discuss potential options, then follow up with those celebrants, all hoping and praying that they are available for our date. I’m very worried that since it’s only a week advance we won’t be able to find someone in time. Being a sole trader myself, if i couldn’t do the job on short notice, i would organize someone to take the job over from me, specifically so that i wouldn’t dump my shit onto my clients plate, and i don’t work in something as personal, special, and emotional as weddings, not to mention, costly.   I want to write a review now slamming her business practices and her character. I don’t think it’s right for us to be stressed and worried about being able to get married on our date, losing our deposits, etc…. Im really trying to be understanding here but I just feel like we’ve been completely shafted.

f6a0sh8f	I'll try to keep this short, so my bf had a dog a few years ago that had passed away because he was hit by a drunk driver. A year after this incident my friend and I decided we wanted kittens, I asked my bf if he okay with that since we live together and he didn't say much, it was along the lines of "do whatever you want". I was a little upset because if he didn't want me to get a cat, he could just say so. My friend and I picked up our kittens and were very happy. He was suddenly mad one day because he said I never asked him if it was okay with him (except I did) and I told him it was his fault for not saying so before I got the cat, especially since I gave him a chance to do that. Well a couple months later, he decides he's going to adopt a puppy. Instead of asking me like he wanted me to do, he TOLD me he was getting a dog. Whatever. He was a very cute puppy. But now it's a year later and his dog has a lot of behaviors that aren't acceptable (eating things off the coffee table, begging for food as we're eating, taking things out of the garbage and chewing it up on the couch). The only tricks and rules he follows is because I trained him. My bf refuses to do anymore training because he doesn't see a problem with this behavior. I don't like dogs in the first place, because of their overly attached personalities and constant ass-licking.   Am I the asshole for being upset about this?  EDIT: my bf has done nothing as far a training goes, I'm the only one putting in the effort. He potty trained him and that's basically it. I don't even like this dog yet I am forced to deal with it.	1643160638.0	sctoxx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctoxx/aita_for_disliking_my_bfs_dog/	AITA for disliking my bf's dog?
9pw9mrns	I've been having trouble with two if my roommates, let's call em Marc and Saul, since the beginning of fall semester. We butt heads mainly because they're weed addicts and Saul is a drug dealer. So far they have chased two guys out of our apartment in one semester because of their activities. They're also assholes.    I've tried to have a conversation with them to fix our issues but it ended with them screaming at me that I thought I was better than them or treating them like kids. Since then, Marc has changed the story about the confrontation and added that I tried to harm him. Luckily i had been documenting everything with my RAs and our other 2 roommates, to prevent this slander from affecting me academically or legally.  However, I'm concerned about the dealing and how it may affect me still. I live in the hispanic dorm on campus because I went to white schools all my life and I feel at home here. But all of us being brown and the stereotypes around Latines with drugs, I'm afraid of if my roommate gets caught, what will happen to me. I've seen how police and even campus police act towards us. Too risky and I want to get away from the possibility of being involved in a bust. Idc if people smoke weed, my problem is them doing it indoors and dealing. In our state, dealing is punishable by jail time.  The school cant do anything until they catch them smoking or dealing but they rely on my RA for reports. Unfortunately for me, my RA uses my roommate as a plug so he wont do anything.  Both of my parents are mad because I'm being pushed out of my apartment that they paid for especially since it's the only lived community for latines on campus. My dad's a lawyer and wants to write a letter about the RA's involvement in these activities. He had admitted to my parents he is aware dealing is going on from who and how. The activity is against school policy at best and illegal at worst. As a latino, I know what this can do to my RA's reputation and possibly future. Theres so few of us here and this could reflect badly on the dorm entirely.  But mostly I feel guilty that the RA could find himself in massive trouble. I dont know if possibly I could be ostracized from the dorm residents as well. Others have issues with my roommates and the RA isnt ever there for them either.  I'll admit I'm peeved I've been ignored this past semester and this activity and bullying has carried on but I worry I'm letting the anger get the best of me. Two guys have already been chased out of my apartment so it's not anything new or personal.  Should I talk my dad out of writing the letter knowing it will get the RA fired? Even if it means I have to leave?

egkdkqw8	I (F19) have a friend (F17) whom I met from an online game a year ago, I have stopped playing that game and instead I introduced her to another mobile game I like a lot called Arknights. She started playing Arknights and immediately fell in love(?) with a certain character from there. For context she likes anime and anime themed games a lot almost it's like she's addicted to them. No, I don't have any problems with that, but hear out what's keep bugging my mind.   We talk almost everyday and discussing about light matters such as video games updates or just chit chat asking how is your day etc. In the middle of the conversation she would bring up stuff "Ah this character (the character is from Arknights, the one I told you before) is so hot!" Or "I want this character to do inappropriate things to me." At first I didn't mind and laughed it off trying my best to ignore them, but it progressed til the point at when I'm talking about serious matters, and she keeps making those dirty comments about the character she likes.  I told her to stop and it's immature to verbally fantasizing fictional characters, in dirty manner even. AITA for shutting her down when talking about what she likes?

13wxpw5b	About a week ago my brother moved in with me and my father. He’s been homeless for the past year because he got back on heroin. He lost his car, home, and custody of the only child he talks to (he’s basically abandoned the other one). He’s in his 40s and has been doing dope for 20 years.   I’m currently in college and work as an intern (requirement of my degree) and go to school full time (16 credit hours). I genuinely have very little time left over to get a paying job (internship doesn’t pay). I’m living here to save money and simply because I can’t move out until I graduate.   My brother has always made me uncomfortable. He’s racist, arrogant, and paints himself as the victim in every situation. My dad took him in because he fears that my brother will be dead soon. However, my father (who has a grip on his alcoholism) is now drinking every day. My dad also has high blood pressure and a heart condition. I have very bad anxiety about my dad dying in general and this entire situation has made my anxiety soar.   My brother was dope sick for the first two days. Then, on day three, he snuck out of the house and went and got dope. He told dad what he did, said he didn’t get any dope, but needed a ride home. He said “I’m freezing and i just need a fucking favor”. My dad had a rule of no dope otherwise he was out. Welp, turns out my brother *did* get dope and is just now coming out of another phase of dope sick. At this point I told my dad I want him to leave. He makes me extremely uncomfortable, to the point where I hate leaving my room. Currently hiding out until my dad gets home so I feel comfortable enough to take a shower.    I don’t like my brother, straight up. He’s stolen from me (when I was 13), he’s stolen countless items/money from our father, and was banned from being around grandma because she thought he would fuck her over too. He’s a dead beat dad and whines about his life even though he came from a middle class home with two parents that spoiled him and were active in his life. I personally think he will die from this, especially after losing three family members to dope in the past two years. He’s using our dad and makes me uncomfortable. However, I feel that I’m being selfish.

2kmw52vj	I'm autistic if that helps.  I was in their car few days ago and I needed to blow my nose so I asked my mother for a tissue and my mother handed it to my just like that out of the package and that pissed me off a little. Because germs. and I told her I'd rather take it out of the package myself like it's nothing big obviously but you never know what they need it for maybe a cut or something like that. And she just got Mad, like her tone of voice changed completely and she said "you shouldn't have taken it then and I'd obviously know if you had a cut" I told her I don't need to tell her everything but next time she should just hand me the package because of germs (she knows how utterly I hate them very well) I was ready to leave it at that if she said sorry but that made her even more mad, like I just want sorry because she stepped over the boundaries she very well knows I have there. It escalated and she started screaming at me in front of a shopping center while I was telling her I just want sorry nothing else.  I just wanted her to treat me with a little bit of respect but she's never able to say sorry even when I told her about how piercing baby's ears is bad and hor dysphoria inducing it was when I was young she still isn't able to say sorry after more than a week of me talking about it and giving her time.  Maybe I'm overreacting.

j0zpawbm	I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years attending family get togethers, buying family gifts for birthdays/Christmas, and overall have made a huge effort to show I care about his family. For Christmas this year my sister gave his parents a photo of us (me and my boyfriend) from her wedding that my MIL proclaimed she really loved. This was a surprise to me as she didn’t tell me she was getting them anything at all. I was even more surprised and excited when my boyfriend told me they put it up in the living room. Fast forward a few days, when I visit on my boyfriends birthday I notice it’s not there anymore and just assume they moved it or something. My boyfriend tells me a few days later they put it in the drawer….   Am I crazy for feeling a little hurt by this? I didn’t even get to see it up for the 3 days it was. When I personally take photos down it’s usually something personal and If not I make an effort to move it somewhere else. I asked my boyfriend why they took it down and he shut me down quick saying not to make a big deal. I don’t want to ask them personally or cause any issues I’m just a little disappointed because I think it’s one thing to just never put the photo up but.. to put it up and then take it down.. idk that just kind of hurts. I explained to my boyfriend I was just excited to see it up and it gave me a warm feeling when I heard about it but I understand there was probably no malicious intent and they just don’t value it like I do. But deep inside I feel a little more insecure than I would if they just never put it up.😥	1643163070.0	scuiyc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scuiyc/aita_for_being_upset_our_photo_was_taken_down/	AITA for being upset our photo was taken down
hplg3xtb	I (21F) have a roommate (21F) who I can’t stand. We used to be pretty good friends and she asked me to room with her because she was in a predicament and I agreed.  She’s a slob, in all shared spaces, she leaves her trash, half eaten eaten food, and takes up all the space in our fridge with take out she never finishes. She also uses the things I bought for me, which I’ve never minded, but she doesn’t clean them/use them right and when I ask her to clean them, she says “well it’s not mine”. She hates when I decorate but doesn’t give her opinion when asked.   She also talks to me like I’m a child. She gives me pet names like “honey” and tries to explain things I don’t need explained in a slow, condescending voice & tells people private things about me.   Everything has to be about her. When a friend of ours was going through a breakup and was explaining how she didn’t know what she would tell her mom, my roommate said “oh wow, I wish my mom actually loved me” and made multiple comments about how she used to be homeless. When I told her it was inappropriate she insisted she was joking and trying to lighten the mood.  She also expects me to pay every time we go. Even when I’m not the one suggesting it, and when I say anything about her taking a turn she tells me that she’s too poor to pay for us to eat out or she doesn’t have her card on her. She asks me to buy her things, and I’ve done it before for little things I think she needs, but sometimes she asks for insane stuff that I wouldn’t even buy for my self. When I tell her I don’t have the money, she says I can just ask my dad for it since me and him have such a good relationship. She always tries to guilt me like that.   Recently, I didn’t have any money and no way to get any. My dad said he’d bring me cash but it would have to wait for the next day and I asked my roommate to borrow 10 to get fast food and told her I would pay her back the next day, this is the first and only time I’ve asked her to borrow money and the last, and she has asked to borrow money on multiple occasions. She told me no, and went about her business.   She’s telling our friends about me asking to borrow money now.  A lot of my friends say that she’s entitled/using me. Everything that has happened has made me despise her.

Everyday it’s just “Omg he did this” or said this, everything is about him and when he’s hanging around them, they just act so annoying. Just trying to impress or messing with him being like “ omg (M)” this and that it’s just so irritating hearing it everyday, I’m just so tired of not being able to have one normal conversation without my friend bringing him up. It’s to the point where I can’t stand being around them, it’s just worse when I’m around the two I feel so alone.

I have told both my parents I'm done with him and their ways of enabling the youngest to be an asshole without being reprimanded for his actions since we were kids. I also told them I want no contact from him or his girlfriend towards me and my kids multiple times.  I have two children with my ex wife, we get along for the sake of our kids wellbeing. He recently sent my ex a message asking if he could drop off some gifts for them. She told him she would ask me as she knows the situation between him and I. I told her I will not accept them.  I called my mother and told her about my brother asking my ex about the Christmas gifts to which told her to tell my brother" I will not accept them sending my kids gifts when he doesn't have the balls to apologize for any of his actions"   I found out a week later when my kids where at my mothers house that she took the gifts from my brother and gave them to my kids without my permission.

2o9ai46b	So I 22f work at a middle school cafeteria I am the youngest of my team. During cold temperatures my hands start to crack and bleed when it's too cold. My coworkers and boss all know this cause they seen me bleeding. So yesterday I had to helo wash tables and the soap and bleach we use damages my hands more and the gloves we are allowed to use are just as bad as not having them on in the first place. So I was washing tables and chairs when my coworker Betty came and told me I was doing it wrong because 'it just don't look like it's been wiped' (note she says anything I do is wrong cleaning bathroom/stacking food/etc) so I was getting annoyed and said ok and walked away from her. She followed me qnd kept repeating. I have a bad temper so I just kept saying ok, she was like "I am just trying to help don't give me an attitude y don't u use the gloves and bleach since this is how we are supposed to clean the tables anyway" I was annoyed qnd reminded her for the 5th time my hands can't handle is and they r already bleeding at this point. She tries to tell me the reason my hands r cracking is because of the soap (my hands been cracking like this since I was 15 and Dr's tell me to just moisturize often). I told her "my hands crack cause I cold I told u this b4 u don't know my body like I do". So today I just ignored her cause I am tired of her thinking cause she is older she can tell me wat my body is doing when she isn't even my boss. She was complaining to some other workers about it saying I was being disrespectful and she is just trying to teach me how to do things right. I am just tired of her telling me how my body works when I am the one who has to deal with this and my boss gave me approval over how I do my job.

artdw4bl	AITA for getting a DNA test and finding my father's biological family?   Backstory:  My father was born as a result of a one night stand turned marriage during the Vietnam war. His parents divorced when he was under 10 and there were rumours that the man raising him wasn't his father. When he was in his adult life (his 30s), his mother told him who she believed was his biological father. After his mother passed away, those rumors died and weren't brought up(especially around me growing up.) Now that I'm an adult, my step-grandmother told me that my dad's biological origins were even a question. Since my family wasn't always on the best of terms with her, I never gave what she said much merit until recently. One ancestry DNA test and a little sleuthing later, I found who his biological father is and made contact with his biological family. They are asking about my father, and want to speak to him.  Here's the issue:  My father has a horrid relationship with his family and is mostly estranged from them. When waiting for the tests to process, we talked and he said he doesn't mind me pursuing relationships with his biological family, but he has no energy to build a relationship with a whole new family. Am I the asshole for contacting members from his biological family and building a relationship with his half brothers?	1643164666.0	scv2mb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scv2mb/aita_for_getting_a_dna_test_and_finding_my/	AITA for getting a DNA test and finding my father's biological family?

She pushed to get engaged just out of high school and set her wedding date before our’s because “she was dating her boyfriend first.”  They were teenagers.  We were in our late twenties.  Now she and her husband live states apart because she’s in college and he’s in the army.  We just had a daughter.  At her Baptism I asked her to hold her as I was setting up the party.  Random stranger walked by and told her she had a beautiful daughter.  Her response, “thanks.”  My husband overheard and he took back our daughter.

I got pissed at him because he had already said that he would hang out with me but he said that we hang out all the time and he barely sees his girlfriend and that because it’s Valentine’s Day he should be able to hang out with her. I told him that he was being a dick and that I feel like my birthday is more important, he disagreed. Later that day in a grump I texted his gf and asked if she could let us hanging out on Valentine’s Day she said no said and I was being selfish. Now my friend is mad at me for arguing with his gf.

5kiysvxx	My husband and I decided to organise our garage and bought two sets of shelves. We assembled the first one yesterday and followed the instructions and it came together just fine. We ran out of time to do the second so decided to do it today.  I remembered the process from yesterday (it was much easier the second time) and was getting the parts needed and putting them in place for my husband to hammer them tightly in place. I thought we were working great as a team until he started getting rude and nasty to me for following the process and he wanted to do it his way which was to secure the middle shelves before the top part of the frame. I thought we should follow the instructions because it worked good yesterday and I saw no reason to change it. He said he felt it was better his way and he knew better because he’s an engineer. He made out that because he’s an engineer he knew better and I wasn’t as smart and should just shut up and do what he says. He then sent me away so he could finish it alone and didn’t want me involved.

I asked if she’d mind picking me up dinner if I placed an order online with my card after she got out of class tonight, and I made it very clear that she did not have to. She said she didn’t mind. For context, I am very picky about food temperatures and do not like food that isn’t fresh and has to be significantly reheated. I also have some sensory issues, unsure if they’re related  She told me to go ahead and place the order around 7:30 and said she was ready to pick it up. I placed the order for my wings and told her it would be ready in 10 mins. The wing place is 2 miles from our apartment, and it always takes 10 mins. She picked it up after almost half an hour and then stopped on the way back at another establishment to get her own dinner. All of that is fine by itself, but she knows I am picky with food temperatures and would’ve much rather made something for myself if my food was going to get cold before it got back to my apartment.  I want to make it very clear that I’m not viewing my gf as a delivery driver here. I really appreciated her picking up my food and made it clear I didn’t expect it, but since she agreed, I felt it was a little disrespectful to let the food I paid for get cold by taking a long time to leave after telling me she was ready and then making an extra stop after grabbing my food. She could’ve let me know she’d be longer so I could make an informed decision instead of wasting my money.   She responded to this by saying “just heat it up” (which is fair), but by this point, an hour later, it tastes like cold leftovers. She then called me a brat. I responded by saying “it wasn’t about the wings, I just felt mostly disrespected by you saying you were ready to grab it when you weren’t, so my dinner ended up being cold. I would have rather you just told me you couldn’t get it, or would take longer.”  This devolved into a larger argument about whether I’m being disrespectful since she was doing me a favor or if she was disrespectful for offering to do a favor and then letting the food I paid for get cold when she knew I would have rather made something myself  Yes, I know it’s petty  TL;DR: Asked gf to grab me dinner since I’m quarantining; said it was fine if not. She agreed, let the food I ordered get cold by picking it up late and making an extra stop, and then called me a brat for saying that was disrespectful of my money	1643166423.0	scvodx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvodx/aita_for_getting_frustrated_at_my_gf_for_letting/	AITA for getting frustrated at my gf for letting my food get cold
96dqgnc4	i (17f) have been dating my bf (18m) for a little over 7 months now. i’ve always deemed him a little suspicious, he gets a few too many “____ has added you back!” notifs from chicks on snap and he had a whole secret acct to follow egirls with onlyfans links in their bios. now he’s talking to this girl we’ll call janette, she’s white (this is important later) and 16 and ALSO pregnant with her exe’s kid. all she does is bitch and moan abt her ex and how she hates her life SOOOO much to my bf. or well that’s what my bf says, he lives over a half an hour away so we go to separate schools and thus i only know things abt her from social media and him.  anyways i see him typing at the speed of light with her while we’re facetiming (i can also see images in the dms but through the reflection of his glasses so i can never tell what they are) and he always texts her back immediately when he’s with me. although it will take him several hours to get back to me.   my bf is hispanic and so is her ex, found her tiktok and she had a post abt how “she doesn’t have a type” then listened “hispanic, chubby and short.” that describes her ex sure but like also my bf. and she’s the one who hit him up first. all she does is post abt how bad she wants dick and how horny and sad she is.  everytime i say how i’m uncomfortable with him talking to her he kinda just shuts down on me. he says he’ll stop talking to her but he hasn’t. i don’t want to bring it up again i’m fear i’m overdramatic and it’s nothing, but i hate how he always claims he’s like “all she’s got and she might do smth stupid if i cut her off” like?? is it wrong i just don’t care? she gives me the worst feeling and i want to trust my bf i reallly do but with all that’s happened it’s hard to. he even told me theres dating rumors between him and her at his school.  so i told him to cut ties with her  i’m on the phone with him now and he’s all pissy abt it. saying things like “if you don’t want me talking to any girls that’s cool” in a condescending tone. so reddit, am i the asshole?	1643166938.0	scvuox	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvuox/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_wont_cut_off_ties/	AITA for asking my boyfriend won’t cut off ties with this girl?
8hfgbhen	My older sister recently got divorced. She has a habit of making bad decisions that has continuously annoyed the family. She cheated on her husband and ran off with her BF for 2 months. The ex-husband has filed for divorce and now has full custody of their two kids.   After 2 months, they called it quits. She asks to come over to my place for a few days until she figures things out. I recommended that she goes back home to our parents and own up to her mistakes. My parents and my middle sis opened up their places for her but she decided she doesn’t want to stay with them. She purchases a plane ticket to go back to my parents city and start anew there. This is 10+ drive from me. She tells me her plan. Get a car, get an apartment, get a job, become stable. Off she goes.   2 weeks later, I get a call around 12AM from my older sister saying she’s about an hour away and is going to come stay with me until she can get back on her feet. I was confused b/c she was so adamant about her plan to be independent and get her life together. And now, 2 weeks later she’s back with a new plan. Her excuse was, she decided she likes my city more and will try to get a job here instead. I had never mentioned allowing her to stay with me for months. The most I ever offered was a few weeks at most. But she’s my sister so I decided to not say anything and just let her stay.    The reason why I didn’t want her to stay with me was because I am currently living with my fiancé. We like our privacy & we live in an apartment. Also, b/c I was annoyed with her being irresponsible. We have warned her many times before about her behavior but to her, nothing matters if she believes she’s correct. I was annoyed & didn’t want her to live with me.   Around the 2 weeks mark of her living with me I sit her down & asks what her plans are and how long she plans to stay. I wanted to hold her accountable for the goals she sets for herself & to really make an active step to reach those goals. She says she’s going to find a job & get an apt. I’m like cool, what’s your timeline. And she says 3-4 mths . I told her I was thinking more around 2-3 mths. She said ok.   I talked to her about her plans because she was out all day. Sometimes she goes out the whole night until morning. She’s a grown adult so I know she can do whatever she wants. But I suspected she was either going back to see her ex-bf or ex-husband. I would ask her where she goes all day and her answer was always “shopping” or “looking for a job”.  I honestly think none of that was happening.   1 week after our talk I come home to my spare keys on the table. No goodbyes. Three days later, she texts me “thanks for the stay”. I find out she went back to my parents city.   I suspect she left because she felt my energys of not wanting her stay with me. I feel bad because she is my sister, but also frustrated over her behavior. Am I the asshole?	1643167956.0	scw746	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scw746/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_stay_with_my/	AITA for not wanting my sister to stay with my fiancé and I?
ekdnlhs9	Idk who came up with this rule or whether it’s the right thing to do but I call bullshit. I have 6 siblings and we don’t want to take care of our parents. Some people gave us disgusted looks as if they know us. My mom is a great mother but we can’t deal with that. We have our own lives to live. But I get the most disgusted looks as if I should be the one to take care of my mom. None of them know I am the least stable person in the family. I won’t even be in the same state. I’d be surprised if I even made it to my 30s (if u know u know). I’m only in highschool and I fucking hate my life. I can barely take care of myself. My younger sister says she’ll take over. So I don’t think I’m being an asshole.	1643168272.0	scwayj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwayj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my_parents/	AITA for not wanting to take care of my parents when I’m older?
i6a6m0tx	My friend (F24) decided to post a bunch of photos of herself and friends from her birthday. We threw her a surprise birthday and we took a lot of group photos and photos of the birthday girl.  I don’t have an Instagram so when I was shown the photos she posted I was in shock because everyone in the photos expect the birthday girl looked lopsided. No one is ready, it’s like she chose the photos she was the only one ready in.   I asked her to take it down. She kind of brushed me off saying ‘Well it’s my birthday’ and I responded ‘I know but you could’ve asked permission’ Her argument is that it’s her Instagram and she can post whatever she wants.  Now I’m upset the photo is getting many likes and shares. So I ask her again to please remove the photo and feel free to repost it just not the group photos, she got really upset she eventually did remove the photo but is upset with me that I took it too far. She thinks I should’ve let her kept the photos up.  I spoke to this with another friend and they called me an asshole because it’s just a photo?

j0vnqcsh	I (22F) am unmarried (saving myself for marriage) & CF (considering adopting in the future).  My B(30M) & his W(31F) have been married for 6 years, they are devout Christians. They had their 1st child, a son in 2017. He has congenital malformations: an abnormally large head, epilepsy (diagnosed 2020) & a cyst on his brain (diagnosed 2021). In 2020, I found out that my SIL’s uncle has severe debilitating epilepsy; it is highly likely that the congenital issues are from her side of the family as no one in my family (that I know of) has any disabilities.  My SIL had a miscarriage 2018/2019, my relationship with my B & SIL was relatively good up until 2021. It became strained upon learning my SIL was pregnant with their 2nd child. They were discussing adoption, which I thought would be the most moral course of action taking into consideration their firstborn, climate change, the coronavirus pandemic, inflation, the human population nearing 8 billion & all the other issues in our society, but I guess they decided to try for a baby anyway. I rarely speak to my B now, my SIL & I ended our contact, except for wishing one another a happy birthday.  My B & SIL had their 2nd child, another son in late 2021. Again, their 2nd child has congenital malformations: an abnormally large head & a ventricular septal defect (which they found out about in January).  My dad, who was raised Christian, said that they may grown out of it because they are so young, which doesn’t make any sense, my dad often states nonsensical optimistic things. All 3 of my parent’s grandchildren have congenital disorders. Last I heard, my B’s family all currently have coronavirus & my SIL has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  My personal opinion is that these were the choices of my B & SIL & now they are experiencing the repercussions of their actions. Humans through their actions have polluted their environment & themselves with toxic materials that contribute to birth defects.   My B & his W are morbidly obese (they have been for over 10 years, even more so now) & my SIL has various physical conditions. Having another biological child despite knowing that there are genetic disorders in your family, knowing that your firstborn son was born prematurely, has multiple congenital disorders, has long epileptic seizures & is often in hospital, yet wanting to risk having another child for your own self-serving desire (she is surely not considering the future prospects of her children & the lives they‘ll live) is so saddening to me.   I do have empathy & sympathy for many. I feel it for my partner, my late uncle who passed away from cancer last year; my nephews, niece & all of the children that have to grow up during these times, & I feel it for animals, which is why I do not eat or wear their flesh.  Please, I need advice because I am struggling mentally.	1643173891.0	scy276	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scy276/aita_for_not_having_empathy_for_my_brother_and/	AITA for not having empathy for my brother and his wife as well as not wanting to maintain a relationship with them?
ijtdl8d3	So:   PART ONE: My friend has ADHD, and has been looking for an escape from a really toxic household. I was in a similar situation a few months ago, and have managed to (fortunately) break away from such a household. When she said that she wanted to move, I immediately jumped in to help. I got very few responses, but let her know that I was around to help. She never even told me that she got a new place when she did.    PART TWO: This friend can't hold on to a job for too long, borrows and runs out of money fast, and splurges on her lifestyle. I understand the need to buy stuff when one is sad, but I do feel upset because this friend has also borrowed money from me in the past, and has never returned it. I'm not well off by a long shot, but have never asked for it back.   PART THREE: This person is very active on social media, and always gives shout out to friends and never mentions me. This is hurtful especially because of PART 1 (wanting to help out) and PART 2 (lending money)  So AITA for 1. Thinking this friend uses ADHD as a crutch and 2. wanting the money back now?	1643176696.0	scyv54	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyv54/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_friend_with_adhd/	AITA for being upset with my friend with ADHD
16k0ny3w	So I’ve (25M) have been dating this girl (25F) for a little over two months. We met online and had great chemistry. Everything was going well even though we were having a few issues in the first month. We talked a lot about our future and everything. We would face time every night for over an hour and then we even started FaceTiming in the mornings as well.  We found out a month into dating that she had a suspected lymphoma in her neck. We cried together and she gave me the option to leave. I decided to stay and hope that maybe it’s really early and she wouldn’t need chemo or anything like that. She had a scan a couple weeks later confirming it was early stage and that she would be fine afterwards. She met the doctor and they decided she would need 6 months of chemo to get rid of it entirely.  This is really hard for me cause I’ve never been in a relationship before. I feel like something was taken from me before we could even get it started considering we were still in the honeymoon phase.  I told her that I can’t handle all that while trying to form a relationship. I’m starting a new job as well which will make it harder. I really think I loved this girl but I had to end it for my own mental health. I already deal with some anxiety and the constant stress and fear would hurt me a lot. She would also deal with many physical changes which may affect our relationship as well. I’m trying to stay friends with her but even that is difficult for me because it never should’ve happened like this. Being reminded constantly is really difficult.   Sometimes I feel guilty but I think ultimately this is what I had to do.	1643180967.0	sd00vm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd00vm/aita_for_leaving_a_girl_i_was_dating_when_she_was/	AITA for leaving a girl I was dating when she was starting treatment for cancer?
a1gxuefc	Below is an email I sent to my building management on Dec 28th. My neighbor moved in on November 2021. This post is being written at exactly 11:49pm today, 01/25/22. My neighbor’s toddler is still running around and stomping. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m losing my mind. Please help. Management claims they have given them a warning. Doesn’t look like it. Any advise would help. Thanks   “Hi guys, This is the second time we have reached out to you regarding our neighbor upstairs. The first time, we never heard from your office at all. I myself left a review and told to reach out to you again so here i am doing so. At this very moment and every moment for the past few weeks or so we have been able to hear the small child upstairs running. We have reached out to the neighbor directly about it and was told that they put the child to sleep by 9pm. This hasnt been the case most of the time and we do not blame the child at all for most of the noise up there. Although from the moment this child is up (early morning of course), i swear its constant running, pounding, banging, stomping and its all day until almost late night. We hear it while taking a shower, while trying to watch tv, while cooking, on the phone. The only time we don t hear it, is when we’re out, or theyre out. We are currently working from home. One of us is an essential medical worker and a quiet peaceful work environment is the least we ask to make our home a better place to live and make a living. I m getting to the point where I feel like crying. We’d notice the pool be dirty sometimes. We’d pick little trash here and there on our way to pick up our mail and back. We would see dog poops in non-dog park areas. Our biggest problem is the noise. We are good at our paying our bills on time and will always do so and follow all rules and policies of the management to our outmost best. We understand kids are going to play on the floor and make a little noise here and there....but this is getting to be so beyond excessive. But, I think when you live in an apartment community there are things you need to sacrifice. Like, I don t have parties and I don t scream and play my music too loudly. I expect my neighbors to understand that there are other people living here too. It s taking a toll on my nerves. I don t really know how much more I can take of the loud running. I can hear adult footsteps too...but it s occasional and for some reason not as nerve racking as fast pounding footsteps a good 17 hours a day. Apartment living does come with some noise but what people fail to realize is that it also comes with responsibility. My neighbor has a responsibility to me like I have a responsibility to my neighbor downstairs and so on and so on. There is simply NO EXCUSE. I hope you as a management can provide some resolution to this. I’m sure this is not the first same situation you had. I am really looking forward to hearing back. Thank you.”  Please please, any advice would help.	1643180726.0	sczyvo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczyvo/aita_to_be_against_my_neighbors_child_for_being/	AITA to be against my neighbor’s child for being so loud that I made multiple noise complaints about it?

j13kccmt	I really don’t know where to begin.  I’m a 23 year old man.  I was born with a physical deformity known as ectrodactyly.  Basically I have three fingers on each hand.  I’m basically the human form of the ninja turtles.    This caused me great stride growing up.  I was severely bullied during my childhood.  I also didn’t have much of a dating life because most of the girls I grew up with and went to school with were shallow and didn’t want to date a guy with three fingers.  Fast forward to now,  I started dating my now girlfriend about seven months ago.  I really like her and enjoy our time together.  However, there has been a recent dilemma that has come up that makes me feel like an AH.  I had dinner with my girlfriend’s family last weekend and I met her younger sister for the first time.  Her sister was kind of standoffish and avoidant towards me.  I didn’t really pay it much mind.  However, after we left, I asked my girlfriend why her sister was acting such way towards me.  She told me it was because of my deformity.  This hit me hard because it reminded me of my childhood.    Her sister is only 7 so I can understand why she might be weirded out by it.  My girlfriend asked if I could possibly wear gloves or something while we are around her sister so she won’t be uncomfortable.  I told her that I really don’t care how she feels because my deformity makes me  who I am and if she can’r accept that then maybe I’m not the right guy to apart of the family.  I realize I may be the AH here because I’m not taking her sister’s feelings into account but it took me a long time to finally accept my deformity and having to change it or hide it to accommodate someone else would be a huge blow to my progress.

j13sc67g	I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for over a year now. From day one I couldn’t list one bad thing about him at all, and I still can’t- he is amazing, however his mother has begun to severely distress everyone in her life, including us, and she has pushed me far away.   I noticed off the get that she was extremely attached to him and at first it was adorable but soon, I became scared with her aggression and complete lack of empathy for those around her. For one, she is in denial of the extremities of her husband’s sickness and she does not care for him or feed him properly, leading to him to be under hospitalization for two months spanning over the holidays.   My boyfriend had COVID in December and had to quarantine at my place to avoid contact with his parents who are older and have health problems as stated. When he went to get his belongings, avoiding contact through a separate entrance, his mother came into his space knowingly and without any care, just to be around him. She then went to her 90 year old father’s house, and transmitted it to him leading to his ultimate passing, just a few days shy of Christmas. My boyfriend was a mess. She also acted terribly at his grandfathers funeral, blaming his death on other family members in attendance among many things.   Aside from that, a couple of months ago my boyfriend offered to let me move in with him due to my current living situation. Immediately I knew it would be a bad idea, knowing his mother and how territorial she is. But when she seemed over the moon about the idea and welcomed me with open arms, I eventually gave in, paying my apartment for another month anyways just to have it, just in case. And thank God I did. On the second day we found my belongings rummaged through, & after denying, she admitted to snooping through my stuff when I wasn’t there. I let it go.  The day after, she came down and cornered me while my boyfriend was at work and told me essentially that the living situation would not work out because she felt as though she “wasn’t allowed to touch anything”. She rummaged through my boyfriends drawers, putting away his underwear while ranting at me. (I had offered to do laundry but she sharply declined stating that I’m not his wife and she has been doing his laundry all his life so she couldn’t just stop now.)  The way she spoke to me so coldly and nastily and basically kicked me out without my boyfriend around to witness made me feel so uncomfortable that I just took my stuff back to my apartment and cut the arrangement off entirely, despite her eventual pleas for me to try it again.   My boyfriend decided to distance himself a bit from her, and he has decided to stay at my place since the confrontation between her and I. Since then, she blows up his phone all day, even calling his job when he doesn’t answer her. She tried inviting him to dinner, specifically wanting to schedule it while I had work, which shows me she is only interested in reconciling with her son and is avoiding/ could care less about mending things with me. He decided to pass on her dinner invite.   I haven’t spoken to her much since moving, but her behavior obviously hasn’t changed. Her birthday is coming up & he gave me the option of coming to a small gathering or not. Honestly, her behavior makes my skin crawl and her constant negativity makes me want to remain distant. Am I the asshole for declining the invitation?	1643182278.0	sd0crp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd0crp/aita_for_declining_to_go_to_my_boyfriends_moms/	AITA for declining to go to my boyfriend’s mom’s bday party?
ikzfctl5	I [18F] had just gotten home from the beach. My bikini was literally full of sand so I went right to the bathroom and took it off. I realized I didn't have a towel so I walked out naked to the end of the hallway to grab a towel.  While I was walking I realized my twin brother was there and could see me. He asked me what I was doing and I just said that I was back from the beach and forgot my towel. He asked how the beach was, I said it was good but that I got sandy and told him thats why I was naked. He literally just said "oh alright no big deal". That was it. I don't give a shit if he sees me naked.  Well our mom saw that whole interaction and has been yelling at me for "exposing myself" to my brother. Sometimes I will walk by him undressed to grab something in the middle of the night or during a shower or whatever and he might see me naked for a second. It wasn't a probem before but now she's making me feel bad.	1643182785.0	sd0h4r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd0h4r/aita_for_not_caring_is_sibling_sees_me_nude/	AITA For Not Caring is Sibling Sees Me Nude

We works from home and does not have work until 9 am, I work in the neighbouring town and have to leave at 7 in order to make it in on time.  This is because there is not a great public transport route so I have to take a train and a bus. I do not drive but my boyfriend does and I contribute to fuel every week.  So this morning I really don't feel great and I ask if he would drop me in (about a 15-20 minute drive). He starts to moan and give out so I just storm out.

be0a4pmo	so last night, i went out to get some juul pods across the street. we live in alaska and it was a fairly warm night of 34°. so i just put some joggers on and a jacket and flip flops, hair in a bun and glasses. total bum look but i figured i’d just be right back since i’m just grabbing us j-pods. i bought my pack w my money and i bought his w his money.  when he came home last night, he told me both headlights were out and he drove w the high beams. it’s still winter and we still only get about 4 hours of sunlight. so before i left for j-pods, he asked me if i could take the car in the shop for oil change and headlights (since i was to borrow the car to get a c***d test- i’m stupid sick rn, have missed 3 days of work) and i told him no coz no one will pick me up from the shop. he said ‘oh right’ then i’m out the door.   on my way back home, i stopped by o’reilly’s to get headlights so i can replace them myself since it’s pretty important. so i called him, asked him what year his car was. he asked why and i told him i was at o’reilly’s grabbing headlights. welp, i looked under the hood and i didn’t have any tools for the job. it had bolts of different sizes and some trees. so i asked o’reilly’s if i can borrow tools and got to work in their parking lot. my phone was in my pocket, on silent (like always, he knows that) and i guess he’s been calling me while i’ve been working on his car. took me an hour and a half since i had to partially take off the bumper and get behind the wheel well.   an o’reilly’s employee came out and helped me since 1. he saw that in a woman alone in a parking lot 2. it’s 32° out 3. i needed help getting the bumper to detach from the wheel well. the whole ordeal took a hot minute, but i did it. off to the house i go, thinking to myself that he’d be happy for the surprise.   and boy, was i fucking wrong. he was pissed the off that i didn’t answer his calls. i told him i was changing his headlights so he doesn’t get pulled over coz we have no insurance on the car and my hands were obviously so dirty from the ice and mud and car parts. he said he didn’t care and proceeded to be mad and look through my phone. i even called o’reilly’s for them to verify that indeed changed my headlights out there for an hour and a half. he changed his tune and said that he was ‘worried’   after a shouting match, he finally went into the bedroom and i finally looked through my phone. i saw one of his texts that says : ‘Bro I know you got your fucking phone on you I don’t know who the fuck you’re meeting up with bring my car back’ to which i respond : ‘yeah. this is sounds ‘worried’ to me’ i understand that i was gone for a while and i didn’t pick up the phone.. but i called him at o’reilly’s and told him i was getting headlights. i ended up sleeping in our living room last night coz i really felt hurt than instead of him being grateful, he got mad at me coz i didn’t answer his calls.

4d9an1gx	I am a college student and a guy who  lives in my dorm has been trying to be my friend. I don't know why, but he has always creeped me out. We first met in the elavator when I complemented his camera. The next time I saw him was weeks later leaning on my desk at work and introducing himself with a full length conversation about his name because he was named after someone famous. Keep in mind I am still working and there is a line. I asked if he was on one of the teams because he was wearing a jacket some of them had on (he wasn't) and he eventually left. Next time I saw him was at the elevator and he decided to stand in front of me making direct eye contact. He asked if I remembered his name and tried making small talk that I answered curtly and I speedwalked away when the elavator opened. He shows up at my work again and I kept the conversation short and hand him his ball. When my shift ends hours later he is at the front and decides to walk home with me. I thought it was a little stalkerish but I dismissed it. Another time when I was leaving he started walking with me and he asked where I was going after work. I was still creeped out and I lied saying that after work I was being picked up early for break. When I came back the girl at the front desk asked if I was okay and it turns out the guy had a habit of cornering girls in the elevator. During break I end up getting an infection and my aunt and uncle were hospitalized. When I came to school back I found out my Uncle was put on a ventilator. The next day I ran into him and my RA and we end up talking. He seemed less creepy, but we had nothing in common and he insisted that I take my mask off because he had never seen my face, which I refused. The next day I found out my Uncle died and I had Covid. After dealing with quarantine, the funeral, and hospital visits I was mentally done. So I go to work and mid-shift he shows up. Everytime I see him I feel uneasy and while I still felt I should give him a chance, I was tired. By the end of my shift I'd decided that I would end the frienship the next time I saw him. That night I'm scolling through TikTok and this is where the AITA part comes in. A video pops up with a person telling you you've been ghosted. I impulsively sent it to him and his response was along the lines of "Fuck you this came out of nowhere". And agreeing that it was a shitty move I explained to him why I didn't want to be friends. I didn't call him creepy, instead I told him how I didn't like his taste in music, didn't get his humor, and that we just weren't clicking. His response was that I should leave or I would regret it. Called me fucked up. Said he didn't see me as a friend just someone to waste time and space with and to stop talking to him. While I agree that sending the Tiktok was a bad decision, am I the asshole for ending the friendship with someone who makes me feel uneasy?	1643184600.0	sd0xvu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd0xvu/aita_for_ending_the_friendship/	AITA for ending the friendship
izyrmhhf	I (21M) was complaining to my cousin about how I'm not comfortable flirting because it's not in my character. I said I'm also not naturally playful, don't tease people, make jokes, or engage in banter. Complimenting people is also not comfortable to me, so I was venting to my cousin about how it's a very low chance any woman would ever catch feelings or turn interested in a guy who doesn't engage in flirting, teasing, banter, compliments, etc.   My cousin argued that isn't true. She said some women will catch feelings or interest from things such as being nice or treating them well. She mentioned things such as remembering small details about someone, helping them out with things, treating them with respect, doing small things for them like bringing them a chocolate bar they were craving, being a good listening ear to them, asking questions about them to get to know them, talking about common interests, and other things.  I argued that even if I could do all of that, the chances of a woman liking me would still be low if I don't flirt, compliment them, or engage in banter. I said most women I've noticed turn interested in guys from them being flirty and giving them good attention that will validate them or make them feel good about themselves.  My cousin argued that it's still possible for someone to like a person off of other things that have nothing to do with flirting and other stuff like that. She said I'm being closed-minded and thinking too simple, saying I shouldn't be using "players" as my basis of what women are attracted to. I got annoyed and said she's wrong, so now she thinks I'm being annoying	1643186216.0	sd1btf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1btf/aita_for_arguing_women_wont_want_you_if_you_dont/	AITA for arguing women won't want you if you don't flirt or banter?
avng8sna	My (20M) coworker asked me (22F) on a date a few weeks ago. He seemed like a sweet guy so i agreed to go on a date with him. He took me to a drive in movie theater. We had a good time. On our way back he asked if it’s ok for us to hold hands and kiss. Because of covid we had to wear masks at work. Also the drive in movie place didn’t have bright lights.I didn’t realize how horrible his oral hygiene was until we kissed. God!! I almost gagged. When i turned on the dome light to take a closer look I couldn’t believe someone would show up like that on a date. His teeth were full of plaque. No wonder the smell was that bad. I asked him to stop at wawa and said that I need to use the bathroom. Called an uber for myself. Texted him to leave without me then blocked his number. IDK what story he told everyone. All of my friends at work think I’m an asshole for leaving.

5ytowc5t	I'm not a native, so excuse my broken English.  So my five friends and I were supposed to go to a VR-game this Saturday. My friend Jenny paid for everything and so wants us to pay back: I told her prior to everything that money was a problem for me (I live with less than 100 dollars per month) and if I could come, I wouldn't be able to pay back before February. She insisted I come, telling me it's no problem.  On the day we were supposed to go to the VR-game, I just felt terrible. I told my friend Jenny a few hours before the game I was not gonna make it (I still had hope on the morning but I just had this terrible "cold"). She told me "no prob" and I asked her if I could post on our WhatsApp group to ask if someone else could come: she refused heavily. I still did eventually, and one person asked for her friend to come instead, but Jenny refused because "she didn't want him to feel as the stand-in". So they didn't invite him.  I did a test on Sunday and I have COVID (yay). So I told them. (I think it's one of the girls from the group who gave it to me because I learnt on Thursday that she went to school even if she tested positive).  So now, yesterday, my friend Jenny sent me a message to ask me to pay her right now. And I was a bit confused because I didn't go. She told me she paid for six people : I told her to contact the VR-center they went to to ask me to pay her back (since I have a proof I have COVID, they refund in my country). Jenny was like "I don't wanna bother them". So I contacted them, and they paid back the difference: they made the package for five people instead of six, since they were five without me. But all the friends will have to pay 2 dollars more (if we were six, that was 23 dollars each, and if they were five, that was 25 dollars each).  But Jenny doesn't want to ask people of the group 2 dollars more ("she doesn't want to bother them") and wants me to pay it: that would be 10 dollars on my account for a game I didn't play because I was sick.   I was going to pay her back, but I told my sister the story and she told me to absolutely not pay. I told a few of my friends, and they told me to stand my ground. My boyfriend tells me to contact privately the people who did the VR-game and ask them to pay 2 dollars more.   I'm torn because that was my place and I bailed out a few hours before the game.  I know I'm gonna pay her back anyway: I don't want any drama and quite frankly, I want this whole story to be over. But morally, WIBTA if I chose to not pay?	1643190114.0	sd28ed	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd28ed/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_back_a_friend/	AITA for not wanting to pay back a friend ?
ce9e4j9d	I (26 married male) am visiting my parents that live 3ish hours away. Decided to go shoot pool by myself to kill some time. Blah blah blah end up shooting pool with a group of strangers, all good fun.  A (39 married female) is in the group, we’re talking and enjoying our time with the group and even one on one everything is very respectful in terms of us being in committed relationship.  She and the other girl in our group are ‘super close friends’ with a much older male (age unsure) and we start playing pool together.  Little bit of context to that is that I notice how they hug him when they’re greeting him when he walks in… I didn’t really GAF when the single girl (23) hugged him… excessively.. and when the married girl hugged him the same way, it bothered me an amount… ignored it… I’m trying to do my thing and not be involved in anything because these are strangers that I don’t give a shit about.  Every time they’re interacting it’s highschool status flirting…  I ignore it. The excessive. weird. leaning in. the guy does when ever the married girl is walking by. I ignore it. Their playful banter leads to her. -jokingly- asking if he just touched her ass. I attempt to ignore it. I wait a very short amount of time to pull her aside and ask her if he did and what that was about. She try’s to play it off joking that he’s like a dad to her. I ask her what her husband would think about that. I ask what he would say to that. And I ask her if that’s something her dad would do to her.  She deflects and eventually sums it up to it ‘not being my place to ask that’?  I lose my nerve a bit. And I go up to him, very much so in his face asking the same things  That’s a married woman, do you think it’s okay to be touching a married woman like that?  There was plenty of other physical contact before the ‘did you just touch my butt’ moment.  He… mumbles? Idk I’m so angry at this point all I can remember is he has nothing to say that is worth remembering.   He then responds to my aggressiveness with some eye contact, and I’m ready to bust this old fuckers face up. I’m starting to run my mouth trying to egg him on so that he’ll egg me on more. He stops making eye contact.   He has to call out ‘Chris’ the bartenders name, so that he’ll call me over and give me my card.  I go and ask the bartender if he knows that that’s a married woman and ask if he thinks it’s okay for him to be putting his hands on her. He’s just trying to…. Deescalate the situation?… and says he knows and it’s what ever? Idk he’s talking like the woman was taking.. as if it’s just a normal thing that people should expect to happen and be okay with????  I walk back over and he’s found some more courage. More eye contact.. I don’t even know what I was saying at this point, just egging him on asking if he’s feeling tough and to try me.  Try me mother fucker. Try me. ‘What are you gonna do’ Try me and find out.  The bartender. And I believe his friend are on the side line. Let’s pretend my name is SIR.  ‘SIR you gotta go man, I know, I know,’ As I’m asking them again if they think it’s okay for this guy to be touching a married woman.  Him using my first name makes me remember that there are always consequences… he has my name and card on file. And this guy,  now with the bartender and the female telling me I should leave, feels tough enough to start sticking his chin out and making eye contact with me.  I am very much so within solid striking distance of this guy and know I could land 2-10 clean shots depending on how he falls and these 2 guys behind me react.   I leave.. I’m. So. Fucking. Angry. And I don’t know why. I’m still not even calmed down enough to feel embarrassed.  I drove 3 hours and had 3 beers when I was there. I am not.even.close.to being buzzed let alone drunk.   - yes it’s wrong to beat up old people - yes it’s not my marriage and it’s none of my business  - yes busting this guys face up and maybe breaking one of his arms wouldn’t change anything  AITA for reacting like this? Am I wrong for feeling like there’s something so wrong with… what ever that was?… more and more people seem to be pounding into me that I should just mind my own business, and.

3kocdtod	first, i want to rant anonymously about this situation.  i have decided to take my roommate’s single on the second semester. first, i live in a triple situation. i am in the tiniest room with my other roommate. it’s really hard to live in because the room is so small and crowded. there’s not enough room for two desks and two beds to fit.   my other roommate has the single. in the beginning of the school year, they were here consistently. as time went on, they were here less and less. to the point where they took their shower stuff, laundry basket, and clothes with them. i have no idea where they go and they get avoidant when i ask their whereabouts.   since the beginning of the second semester, they have been here once and that was 3 weeks ago. i haven’t seen them at all.   with this vacant room open, i feel like it’s wasted space and that it is unfair that my roommate and i have to stay in a crammed room. my other roommate needs space for their club and i need alone time for studying. we used the empty room as a storage until today.   first this roommate only got the single based on the random assignment. we are all paying the same price for the room. the random assignment did not consider our situation that one roommate would be always out. i believe if it did, the person who goes out and stays out would be in the double room so that everyone can have their own space .   we did ask if we can just put our stuff in the room while they can kept their stuff in the room, but the person just threw everything out. they said bc they got the assignment, the single belongs to them. how can it belong to them if they never use it and are never here?   am i the asshole for taking the room?

7y3ez3gu	For you to understand the story you need to know that school is separated into 2 groups Group 1 and Group 2, when group 1 attends school the other doesn’t, they instead have online school.  Basically during school, some people were being stupid and a guy ( I’ll call him B ) took an empty bottle of water and threw it out the window ( we’re on the second floor ) during the lunch break, during the final class of the day the principal called our teacher and told him to tell us to not leave the class when the bell rings, the bell rings and we wait for 3 minutes meanwhile all the other students went home, a teacher comes in and tells us who threw the bottle, no one snitched so we waited for 2 hours until someone told on B and then we went home.   When I went I opened the group chat which had both groups in it and said “we just got out, they didn’t let us go lol” without even mentioning B, he then gets mad at me and one of his friend agreers that I shouldn’t have said that, I thought it was a minor thing but they saw it as something major.

f5ecw7w5	     Go to the bottom for TL;DR.     A few years back in middle school where I kinda simped for a girl (I regret it now) let's call her "Ava", I wasn't really close friends with her but had her insta, I made it a little too obvious I was into her, she rejected me but I accepted my fate, (side note: after she knew I was looking into her insta, she blocked me even though I didn't even comment just liked her pics and didn't even message her) she blocked me which at first I was confused what happened so I logged in with another account and saw her account, it was clear she blocked me, I didn't use Instagram after that and instead went to her TikTok, I watched her videos daily but never messaged her since I don't want her to think am harrasing her after she blocked me on insta, in school we used our phones for a project and like everyone else I hopped on TikTok, my friends snatched my phone and looked at the search bar, It was full of her name on there, my friends went to the other classroom and told everyone, after that Ava came in my classroom and told me why tf I was "stalking" her, I kept my cool and said I was just looking at her TikTok but never messaged her, she told me "I don't want some boy looking into my insta" (note that her Insta was public, PUBLIC) from that day forward everyone thought I was a creep and was even banned from playing football ⚽ by my friends who owned the ball, the teacher came up to me and said why I was betraying my friends, I was tired of this shit and said I was just watching her videos that she posted, the teacher then realized that all of this was bullshite And said that she posted the video to the public and anyone can see, basically she's mad I was watching her videos even though they were public but I was wrong for not respecting her privacy ig, so reddit AITA?   TL;DR: I got blocked on insta and hopped on TikTok, the girl was mad for watching her tiktoks even though she made it public.	1643194038.0	sd37g5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd37g5/aita_girl_mad_i_stalked_her/	AITA Girl mad I "stalked" her
yek1z	Literally right before all the lockdowns etc my brother and sister in law's gave us all ( the entire family ) a holiday to France in some centre parcs esque camp.  As the date approached it was obvious with all the restrictions it would have to be postponed or cancelled altogether.  Since then many things have changed, my family and my mother and father in law's have brought dogs into the family, traveling from the UK to France is a long journey which we are not sure the dogs will like, our dog is also an ex rescue from Bulgaria and still freaks out of she hears odd things like a particular Van door opening ( that may remind her of either her journey, or past life) so leaving her here in Kennels or taking her just isn't fair IMHO, she's been moved multiple times and I just don't like the idea of it, she's been with us 2 years.   Financial pressures also, we just can't afford a holiday, even if someone else is paying EVERYTHING, it's not much fun just sitting about just being there.  This is meant to be a family holiday and being together right?   My wife and I are also self employed and she in particular works as a wedding photographer, so the time they want to go is peak earnings time.	1643195107.0	sd3hjt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd3hjt/aita_for_leaving_the_group_holiday_chat_rudely/	AITA for leaving the group holiday chat rudely?

j1hj1jjn	My BF got a dog almost a year ago. I didnt mind having a dog in the house but prior to him even getting this dog I set hard boundaries. I grew up in a household with a mother who liked dogs more than she liked her own kids so we easily had 6+ dogs in the house at all times that got better treatment than her own offspring. As in- feeding the dogs top of line steaks while her kids were lucky to have a pack of ramen for dinner. This also meant that all of her kids bed space was taken up by an animal because "no dog should ever be forced to sleep on the floor". My ex was the exact same way and had even kicked me out of the bed several times so his dog could sleep comfortably, with him on the bed. It didnt make me dislike dogs but I'm very clear on my boundaries.   My boundaries- imo- arent in any way, shape or form hard to follow and they arent mean by any case and point. I simply do not want this dog on me 24/7. I like my space and once my space is invaded by the dog I get incredibly frustrated. Given that I knew I was like this prior to even getting the dog, I held firm on my boundaries once we got her and started training immediately. She quickly learned that while she can get in my BFs face and maul him to a point where he cannot breath, she is not allowed to do that with me. She is also not allowed to sleep on my bed under any circumstances. Again, boundaries I established prior to allowing this dog in my home.   At first my BF was super respectful of these boundaries and didnt push the issue at all. He witnessed how uncomfortable and/or irritated I became when this dog would jump on my lap to maul my face (she is the type of dog who needs to get your face- licking, nipping, chewing on your chin, etc) so even he would help get her training in order so she no longer did this to me and everything was going great up until last month. Dog was fully trained to know what I did and did not allow and there were never issues. However last month she got in to my BFs edibles and ended up at the emergency vet (she was fine- just ultra stoned) and since then he has babied her to a point where he gets pissed if I wont let her in my face or sleep on the bed. She has drawn blood on me several times because she doesnt know when to stop (super energetic), she has now started head butting when she is in your lap and has even done the digging motion on my chest several times. All of which I'm not even remotely okay with like he is. So last night he tried sneaking this dog on the bed and would have gotten away with it except for the fact that as soon as she was on the bed she head butted me and started chewing my chin. I tell her to get off the bed and my BF gets pissed. Stating that I am an AH for turning my back on a dog that just wants to love me and even stated that I hate this dog, despite me not hating her- just having boundaries. I argue that he is an AH because he knows my boundaries and is stomping all over them simply because he thinks I'm hurting the dogs feelings.

j1i20xen	29F. Met my fiance (30m) 5years ago and hit it off immediately. I came with children from my previous relationship.   Last year my fiance all the sudden wanted a dog to a point where that is all he would talk about. Constantly watching dog videos on youtube and TikTok. Up until this point we were both dead set on never ever getting a dog as long as the kids are still young because I personally cannot deal with the added chaos. My sons have ADHD as it is. Having an energetic dog on top of this would probably be what did me in mentally. So it was a hard no. He held the exact same tune up until a year ago, as I stated. He didnt want a dog, didnt like them, etc.   So for the past year I have continuously said no to getting a dog. I simply dont want one. I like other people's dogs but dont want my own. I like being able to send them back to their owner and not have the responsibility or an extra mouth to feed/something else to clean up after. All set. Well my fiance's mother found a dog on the side of the street roughly 3 months ago, brought this dog to the vet to see if it was chipped (he wasnt), put out ads searching for the owner and no one came up. So she decides she is going to keep this dog until she can find a good home for him but she also works FT so she soon started asking my fiance if he would take the dog on occasion when she worked. This turned in to the dog staying her 24/7 within a month. I have been clear since this dog came in to my home that we are NOT keeping him. Not only because I do not want a dog but also because our rental agreement clearly states we are not to have dogs here.   Roughly 2 weeks ago I noticed my fiance searching for different rentals that allowed dogs. I asked what he was doing and he said he wanted to get the fuck out of here (shitty area so I want to get out of here too) but I asked why he was searching for places that allowed dogs and he just looked at me like I was dumb and pointed to the dog. I again said we were not keeping this dog. I have been searching for home placement since he arrived. He started saying he is growing too attached to the dog to get rid of him and that the dog likes us too much to give him away so I personally brought this dog back to his mothers house and told her he needed to stay there until a home was found. He is saying I'm an AH because he has wanted a dog for over a year now and I'm denying him of this.

5ft1nsow	So today at school I was in the bathroom with two friends. At one point, they went in a stall to vape, so I decided to wait around for them since we’re in the same class. (For context, in my country we share all our classes with the same classmates and we sit in the same classroom all day.)   While they were in there this cleaning lady comes in and I guess she smelled the vape because it had a pretty strong flavor. Vaping in the bathroom isn’t that uncommon and no one does anything about it usually but I guess we got unlucky. When my friends got out we went to our classroom and the lady followed us. Eventually she talked to some people and our class master found out.     My friends left school early so when our class master came to ask about this situation only I was there. Without going too much into detail, she’s generally an insufferable and overbearing person so I really didn’t feel like having an argument with her. She basically said that even if we didn’t come forward she would find out who was in the bathroom because the cleaning lady who’d seen us knew what all three of us were wearing.   My problem was the fact that she said three of us were vaping when I was literally just standing there waiting for them to come out. I guess I felt annoyed by this and felt the need to defend myself so I just said I was one of them but I hadn’t been vaping. At this point I couldn’t back down because she kept pressuring me and asking me who the other two were, so I told her.    Understandably, my friends got upset. We argued over text and I apologized and tried to explain my perspective but they weren’t having it. They told me I shouldn’t have said anything or I should’ve lied and said it already smelled like that when we got there and that the cleaning lady was mistaken. I think that could’ve been a good excuse but it just didn’t occur to me at that moment and there isn’t really much I can do about it now.    I’m not sure if our class master will do anything more than give us/them a warning. I mostly feel bad because if she talks to my friends’ parents about this, my friends won’t hear the end of it and it will be my fault.    I know I acted selfishly but I would like to have some outside opinions so I can figure out if I was completely in the wrong or not. 	1643206422.0	sd6waz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6waz/aita_for_snitching_on_my_friends_who_were_vaping/	AITA for snitching on my friends who were vaping in the school bathroom?
j1lb9rwv	    AITA  … for not attending my sister’s wedding?   Correction: for not attending my sister’s *fourth* wedding.  She is more than ten years my senior. My sister married her high school sweetheart and they had many wonderful children together. Bear in mind, I’ve known husband #1 since before I began elementary school. So, you could say I was somewhat attached. The night before *my* wedding, she kept me and her daughters up all night in absolute hysterics plotting her divorce from husband #1 (whom she was already cheating on as she confessed to my mortified friends during my bachelorette party).  Buh-bye, husband #1. Hello, surprise wedding to husband #2 at Thanksgiving dinner. (Thanksgiving *is* the most romantic holiday after all.) Husband #2 had been divorced for four long months which oddly enough coincides with the length of his relationship with my sister. Yada, yada, yada… Husband #2 offs himself in a most unpleasant way. I attended his funeral. It was terrible.  Never fear, husband #3 was waiting in the wings. That was an elopement and the marriage was about as long-lived as you’d expect. The divorce was ugly and dragged on longer than the entire marriage… but hey, nobody died so that’s a win…  Ah and at last we are at #4. Last Thanksgiving there was an engagement in Italy. (I told you Thanksgiving was romantic). I was informed at the end of December that there would be a wedding the last weekend of January. I said I would make it if I could (in my heart of hearts I have zero desire to go) and then my sister jumps down my throat because how dare I miss a 4th fiasco? Now I am adamant that I do not want to go. We are not all extras in her grandiose life story. I really can’t stand her.

i5es2h9h	 I (32f) have been married to my husband J (32M) for 1 year. J has a daughter, L (16f) with his ex, R. I have to admit R is a very beautiful woman, and so is L, so I’ve been quiet insecure sine I met R 4 years ago.  My husband has assured me that I’m just as beautiful as R, But I never believed him. My husband has a picture of the three of them from the day L was born, and before my husband wakes up, I stared at the picture. I’m also infertile, So I always thought of L as my own. And since then, I’ve asked her to call me “Mama” since she calls her mom “Mommy”. Even though my husband and his Ex had told me that L doesn’t have to call me that  Anyways to the real story, J and R have spilt custody, so J sees L every Saturday or Sunday. On one of these Saturdays, L was being herself, ignoring me, and I was trying to talk to her. When she walked into her room, I broke down. My husband told me that it could be that R and her had an argument over R’s job (a neurosurgeon). Afterwards, J called L down to eat, and we ate pizza together.  The next day, R came to pick up L, so she could go back to boarding. L was more then happy to leave, But first, R and J had to talk to L about her behavior. R let me be in the room when they talked to her, even when husband said no. They talked about responsibility, respect, and general behavior. Though L didn’t care and said some hurtful things to me. I instantly cried, How could a girl do this to her mom?  After L stormed out the house, R came to apologize, But I didn’t want to hear it. I told R maybe if she being a good Mom, instead of being lazy and performing surgery, L wouldn’t be a selfish bitch with mommy issues, and would actually like me. R looked flabbergasted, and left. My husband is calling me an asshole for saying that about R and his daughter. And making L cry.

crdu81u1	My wife and I found a kitten and gave it to my brother in law. She said we would pay to get him neutered expecting it to be around 100 bucks, like our cats were. He dropped the cat off and sent my wife a picture of the bill for over $600. AITA for reneging on that verbal agreement? (Mind you the humane society will do it for $81)	1643209302.0	sd7xur	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7xur/aita_for_reneging_on_an_agreement_to_pay_to/	AITA for reneging on an agreement to pay to neuter my BIL's cat
bxspmw9l	So basically my sibling and I are in our 20s and live with our parents and other siblings, etc.    I don't have a lot of money, I've been unemployed since June but don't pay rent or anything.  So for Christmas I bought my sibling a poster from a movie that they like, sure it's not their favorite movie ever but it is one that they like.  They didn't seem to care for it that much upon opening the gift, but again, I had limited funds to allocate for presents so I had to be creative.  Anyway... fast forward to today, a month later.  We took the tree down and I found that my sibling had just left the poster rolled up in its case there on the floor near the tree.  I'm trying not to overreact / be sensitive because it's not like I spent a lot of money on it, and if they really didn't like it, that's okay.  But there's something about the gesture of just leaving it there that seems so indifferent to me, I feel like they don't even care that I try to be nice to them sometimes...   But yeah, am I the asshole?  Should I just get over this?	1643211888.0	sd8wkf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8wkf/aita_for_being_hurt_mad_at_my_sibling/	AITA for being hurt / mad at my sibling?
