1bf418yx	I am thinking of moving to Saudia with iqama. I have 10+ years experience in AI and data science. But I don't have computer science related degree or diploma. I did graduation in finance and accounting more than a decade ago. I also did a 1 year certification course 8 year ago in data analytics. I have also authored book in my area of work.  Just wondering if someone has been in same situation and were able to get valid iqama. In some countries for example in Germany, if you have 5+ years of experience in your job as a software or Tech industry professional, they consider it as compensating factor for lack of degree in same subject as your work. I am wondering if there is any such option in Saudia also.   Also, I saw in the website towards the end, there is a section for "Register without diploma". Does it mean we can apply for iqama even without degree in relevant subject?  https://www.saudieng.sa/English/Eservices/Accreditation/Pages/Guidelines-for-Registration-of-Technicians.aspx	1643101162.0	sc9dqu	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sc9dqu/iqama_without_diploma_for_it_jobs/	Iqama without diploma for IT jobs

933g795b	Salam alaykum, so I’ve been doing research and I’ve been interested in teaching English in Saudi Arabia. After researching on the internet I found out I had to have a bachelors degree to teach English there.  However, I’ve recently spoken to a couple of people who said if you are a native English speaker and have some sort of TEFL or TESOL certification you can sometimes get a job without your bachelors finished. I do have a couple of more years before I finish my bachelors and I’d love to move to Saudi Arabia as quickly as possible. So if it were possible for me to come to Saudi and work AND finish my degree there that would be great. Does anybody have any information pertaining to this if it’s possible at all?	1643609632.0	sgu7q2	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sgu7q2/native_english_speaker_from_us_looking_to_move_to/	Native English speaker from US looking to move to Saudi Arabia and teach English there

Idk man I feel like some countries now are more religious than Saudi Arabia such as Somalia,Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Do you guys think the reason for that is bcuz parents pressured the generation? Is it really bcuz parents failed to educate their kids about Islam? The sahwa period was a big mistake it mixed religion with jahil culture that Arabs used to do in the past.

s2gk63w	You may find this well-known essay by Umberto Eco helpful, it is specifically about identifying fascist ideology. He goes over 14 most common features of fascism:  [https://web.archive.org/web/20170131155837/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/](https://web.archive.org/web/20170131155837/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/)  distilled points here:  1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.” 2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.” 3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.” 4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.” 5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.” 6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.” 7. The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.” 8. The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.” 9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.” 10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.” 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.” 12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.” 13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.” 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”  One of the best books on the subject is Hannah Ardent's timeless 1951 classic "On the Origins of Totalitarianism." which analyzes totalitarian regimes such as Nazi fascism and Stalinism in the USSR and goes over how such ideologies are formed and identified.  Another great read is "They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45," by Milton Mayer. It is specifically about Nazi fascism but it is a really enlightening look into the mindsets of a fascist society. It also contains this wonderful quote:  “But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.”  Credit: u/BostonBlackCat  Q: How many of these points can you already spot around you?	1643935646.0	sjzkp8	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sjzkp8/what_is_facism/	What is Facism?

c8xjt1xh	So a friend of mine is able to come to Riyadh with an event organizer. She is white, and a college student.   What rules should she definitely follow to be safe?   She is planning on bringing a hijab, should she cover more to be more safe/respectful of the culture, or is the hijab even necessary?  From my knowledge the company is legit, but is there any danger that could come from going there alone?  What are things that are illegal and that we might not think of and accidentally do?  I am very sorry if this is stereotyping, we are not familiar with the culture and there is  sadly a lot of crime. The company isnt really telling them any rules at all, just to go and not think about it, which is why I am asking.	1643989984.0	skgk98	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skgk98/advice_on_traveling_please_please_please/	Advice on traveling please please please!
