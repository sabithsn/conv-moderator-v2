f5e6ff7k	I have been reading about the different antibody responses to natural infection vs. antibody responses to the different types of vaccination (mRNA, viral vector etc), as well as how in cases of both infection and vaccination, the response can be different if you were infected first, or vaccinated first.  I'm wondering what, exactly, a commonly available, relatively cheap (ideally a two figure sum) antibody test would reveal. Will the result just be positive or negative? Or is it given in terms of the types of antibodies and their relative concentrations?  In other words can such tests differentiate between those with infection- and vaccine-aquired immunity?	1642694766.0	s8mbjb	/r/askscience/comments/s8mbjb/what_do_common_antibody_tests_reveal_can_they/	What do common antibody tests reveal? Can they tell between a person previously infected, or vaccinated, or both infected and vaccinated?

hfdak0u0	Generally, when popular science outlets try to explain an object being in orbit simply, it is explained as "constantly falling and constantly missing" or similar. I can kind of see what they mean when they put graphics of it up, but it's in no way intuitively easy.  My thought before I saw that explanation was simply that gravity and the centrifugal force from rotating around the planet/star/etc. cancelled out, and hence the object stays in the orbit and experiences net zero acceleration/gravity.  Does the math support this interpretation? If it does, is there anything else with it that is incorrect, or is it just different ways of thinking of the same thing?	1642865075.0	sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/	Can orbit be understood as gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out?
