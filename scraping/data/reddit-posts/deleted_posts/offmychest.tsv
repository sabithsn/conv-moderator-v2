iat94ot9	Sixteen year old me made a decision after my younger sister graduate i will die. She was in 6th std that time. Last year she graduated college. I am very confused now. I thought i should do some job but my immature father doesn't let me work because i have to talk to men. He has not allowed me to talk with boys even girls. I talk with everyone just i hide from him. Doesn't even let me get married. I am 27. He and my stepmother are abusive. I fear my young sister will be abused if left her in that house. She is rebellious unlike me.	1642774918.0	s9btlb	/r/offmychest/comments/s9btlb/how_to_live/	How to live?
iihrnosa	I struggle with depression. I've had it since childhood.  I lost my best friend to Covid in 2021. I've taken his death pretty hard and haven't felt like myself for a long time. Without him I feel like I'm not me anymore. Last Friday, my spouse brought home a puppy. He knows I didn't want a puppy. But along with endless promises that I knew he wasn't going to keep, his answer was that this could be a "Therapy" animal. Our kids have wanted a dog for a long time so this was why he brought her home. They have never really helped me around the house. Everything home wise is on me. I started college last fall and I just started Spring classes Wednesday. Now I have even more responsibility on me. Since I work at home I'm here 90% of the time except for the two days I go to class. This dog loves me. I'd like to be clear there is nothing wrong with her. She is a good pup. But... she's a puppy and it's a lot of work. Actually more than I thought. I am constantly having to get her out of things, take her outside every hour and cleaning up after her. This is normal and I know that. This is exactly why I didn't want a pet. This is why I told him I didn't want a pet. My fish Cheeto is enough. I don't have time for myself anymore. I don't have time to do anything anymore. I don't blame the dog. I blame myself. When everyone comes home, I hide in my room. He doesn't like that I'm just out when he arrives. I just don't know how to deal with it. But now, I'm stuck. And now.... I just want to kill myself. I don't want to do this anymore. It's not that she's bad or that I don't like her. That's not it. But it makes me feel guilty. I feel guilty that I want my old life back.	1642780155.0	s9dqc5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dqc5/i_hate_myself_so_much_right_now/	I hate myself so much right now.

I feel completely normal but I genuinely cannot get quick or witty enough to banter with other people.   I've actually asked people for pointers, I've practiced, and I actually try to remember light hearted lines to say back to people.  But I'm just tired and I just want to stop trying so hard to naturally fit in with friends and family. I'm always the one who needs the joke to be explained and I never understand innuendoes or grasp concepts. Nowadays most people just shrug me off with "don't worry" because they're anticipating me to be a bit slow and don't bother.  It's like tone of voice and facial expressions just don't register in my head. I take it all too literally.

dknd3oi5	It's a long one. But I don't want to burden my loved ones with my ranting.   I just plain don't see how people can be happy. I acknowledge I tend to be misanthropic and fairly critical of most things, but still. It seems there is a constant background "dread" or "badness" feeling at all times.  To be fair I'm an author, so it might just be that. There are a whole bunch of alarming statistics about the poor mental health of writers.   But does anyone ever feel a constant background melancholy? Maybe not depression per se, but like a "nothing matters" type deal?   I'm not a risk to myself or others; in a way "nothing matters" can even be empowering. Make a mistake? Just fix it and move on, nothing matters. Want to go back to school or write a book? Go for it, nothing matters.  It should be said my home-life growing up was nothing short of atrocious. So much screaming, so much criticism. All of it pointless. Do these feelings stem from that?  The weird thing is, I should be happy. I have close friends and also "acquaintanceships". My novel, that I wrote at the incredibly young age of 22, has been read on every continent. I've since written another book, and started writing my third. A huge accomplishment at 23.  I'll graduate college and move on to university this year too. That may sound odd, but I'm in Canada and you can do that here. It's encouraged even.  I'm also 2 and a half years sober off of pot. I used to smoke an ounce a day at my worst. I've also given up drinking.  Written all out, I'm receiving an education, have loving friends AND I'm an author. But for some reason this brings no joy.   It also feels like I'm just an author, nothing more. People are impressed of course, but in a way I don't think I am. The harshest critic of my books has always been myself, and I think the more praise they get the more critical I get of my writing somehow.   Am I looking at things wrong? Perhaps my mindset is off? I'm incredibly analytical but understand and value emotional health and wellbeing. I'm solution oriented and tend to try to "fix" every problem I have, though I have the social skills to know not to do that with other people and their problems.   I have to keep writing and be there for the important people in my life so I must improve, just like I did many times before. Really any advice or direction would be appreciated.	1642781447.0	s9e7ph	/r/offmychest/comments/s9e7ph/i_dont_know_what_im_doing/	I don't know what I'm doing
cv26ffr2	I feel like an annoyance most of the time. Even when I go to family stuff most of them just ignore me or talk over me. When I do get to talk nobody really responds. Even my girlfriend doesn’t respond to half of what I say. Nobody respects me, and when I stand up for myself people just get mad. Even when I do nice things for people nobody really seems to notice (which isn’t my motivation for doing so, but once in a while a thanks would be nice). It really put things into perspective this morning when I sent my mom, my sister, and my girlfriend coffee money just to brighten their days a little, and not one of them even mentioned it or said thank you. I feel like dropping everybody and starting over somewhere else. But will I? Nope. I’ll just day dream about it and move on with my life like always.	1642782449.0	s9elav	/r/offmychest/comments/s9elav/i_feel_like_everyone_tolerates_me/	I feel like everyone tolerates me

7wmlf0hy	I don’t have anyone to talk to about this and it’s actually starting to stoke the flames known as my suicidal thoughts.  I can’t stand that I can’t be a better person to my little brother(just for clarity I call my nephews/nieces brothers and sisters) I try but it’s not enough, every time I get mad, or have a bad reaction I can’t help but think what psychological damage I’m doing to him, the same way my dad did it to me.  He looks up to me, I’m the only male figure he has in his life besides his brothers. I should have never been in his life, I should never have had a hand in raising him in any capacity, if I wasn’t a fuck up I would be capable of living on my own and I would have no where near this relationship I have with him.  It doesn’t matter if I apologize to him when I’m wrong or react badly, it doesn’t matter if I’m honest and explain why I might react badly or how I have to put extra effort into managing/coping. He shouldn’t have to deal with it.  I want him to be better then me, but how can he when he’s being influenced by me. I literally have breakdowns about him seeing me have breakdowns.  The moment I raise my voice or have negative interactions with him, my entire day is fucked.  I can’t even properly get this off my chest because I could fill a novel and still walk away thinking I’ve wasted everyone’s time.	1642783602.0	s9f1d7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f1d7/it_hurts_knowing_my_mental_health_stops_me_from/	It hurts knowing my mental health stops me from being a better person
dekq86bl	I'm currently possibly in the worst time of my life. I live with very strict, conservative parents, I had tons of problems with them over all these years. Especially mental and physical abuse. And recently, they have discovered that I'm gay.  And despite my age, I am denied from leaving the house except for the school, I can't talk with my boyfriend, I'm not allowed to see him in any way, and I was told to break up with him. I'm constantly being monitored by my parents (unless they're away from the house), they check all my phone calls, they come to my room very often to check if I'm not texting with anyone. I'm basically being hold in my room all days.   Me and my boyfriend are trying to solve this situation all this month. We had a lot of plans which have failed, a lot of people we trusted turned away from us, his parents unfortunately aren't able to help much, we are left almost alone in this. I can't really go anywhere too, his flat is really small and we both don't have much money too... I tried to search for some rooms to rent, but heard only from one guy who is still not sure about renting it to me. I still need to find a job, one that doesn't conflict with the school.  Everything is really hard and stressful. I feel really bad about this all, but what makes me feel a lot worse, is seeing how my boyfriend suffers because of this all. He really cares about me a lot, he's always texting me all days whenever we can talk, always makes sure how I feel, if everything is fine, if I'm safe.  He tries to help me as much as possible, he looks for rooms to rent, he pays them a visit in my name, he helps me with everything he can, he always looks for new ways to help me. He's really worried about me everytime when I'm with my parents, as he knows what they can do, and done.  And... I see how he's really tired and sad because of this all. So many plans to take me away from here have failed. We tried to look for help everywhere but with no success. And because we live in Poland, we can't really get any help for our problem.  I just don't want to cause so much pain to him. He constantly thinks about me and is worried, I know that he does this because he loves me and cares about me, but I can feel it getting into him and really making it hard. I was always worried that my problems would one day make someone suffer...  I love him, and I really want to do what I can to end this situation, so we can both finally be free to be happy with each other. But it's really hard, we still have some plans, we are not yet sure if they'll work. I really hope they will though. I don't want my boyfriend to suffer because of me anymore, he's been through so much, all I want is to bring happiness to him, not pain.	1642784061.0	s9f7sd	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f7sd/i_18m_feel_terrible_seeing_how_the_very_hard/	I (18M) feel terrible seeing how the very hard situation I'm currently in affects my boyfriend.
d709pz8u	I met her on a dating site. We had known who each other was for some time, but were never really in contact. We starting talking and connected really well - which turned into one of the most genuine connections I’ve ever had with another human being.  We spent a lot of time together, a bit undefined, but I was more interested in maintaining the friendship we had knowing that turning it into a relationship could end poorly (I suppose past experience / baggage that was not fair to her). She was my best friend and I selfishly wanted it to stay that way. I was also at the tail end of dealing with an ex- whom was slightly manipulative and wanted to keep me hanging around, but didn’t actually want me (and I couldn’t move on).  Over time, I developed strong feelings for her. I kept them hidden to maintain what we had. She eventually moved to a new city and it broke me a bit. One thing led to another and it happened: I decided to drop my anxious fear and enter a relationship with her (then long-distance, which was something I’d never done).  While at first it was lovely, spending nights on the phone, it didn’t last long. It was coming into the winter months, and while I hate using it as an excuse for my behavior, it was time for my seasonal depression and anxiety bouts.   Unfortunately, I was not able to handle it well. Since she was not near, I regressed into a recluse, avoiding my phone and other people. The communication between her and I became less as I struggled my way through my own problems. I got the best of myself and things ended; I had essentially ghosted her.   Since my main personality trait is anxiety, I had trouble trying to reconnect and mend what I had done as I started pulling myself out of it. We briefly spoke a few times, unrelated to anything important, but then it was over; we no longer communicated.   Unfortunately there is no excuse for my lack of attempts, inability to vocalize, or inability to apologize. Worse; it’s been several years now. While I can’t stop thinking about it, I also can’t work up the nerve to say anything. It’s like I’ve lost the ability to be an adult about it. I know what I should do, but I worry so much that it will be moot. It will likely not do anything for either of us.   I often have long nights thinking about and missing her. I miss my friend. But unfortunately, for one reason or another, I will never get my friend back. It will never be fair to her.   So here I am - venting - and maintaining my unspoken distance.	1643118385.0	sce3y2	/r/offmychest/comments/sce3y2/i_ruined_our_friendship_and_more/	I ruined our friendship, and more

bbf08yu9	If we have all sorts of clinics and options available on demand for free or low cost abortions, then the same should be true for people who actually want to start their families. As it stands, individuals who have to undergo fertility treatment often times have to take out thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in loans just for the chance to maybe have a child that they desperately want. This is never discussed in the healthcare conversation. This is an issue that affects millions of people in America, however it is entirely underrepresented, under-researched and underfunded. Improving access and affordability to fertility treatment services is a win win for this country. For conservatives, it’s very pro family. And for liberals, it is an expansion of health care access and also reduces inequity (think about working class families or lgbt couples). It just frustrates me that someone can so easily terminate an unwanted pregnancy, but those who suffer from infertility have to undergo massive amounts of emotional and financial hardship in order to have a child.	1643121652.0	scf8zv	/r/offmychest/comments/scf8zv/if_abortion_is_healthcare_then_so_is_fertility/	If abortion is healthcare, then so is fertility treatment.

4qm3yi14	I've been stuck with my narcissistic family because of some unavoidable circumstances, they have absolutely no sense of personal boundaries or empathy. I recently came down with covid and my body feels like it's been run over by a truck constantly. It's very hard to even get out of bed. Constant unintelligible nightmares seem to have disrupted my sleep further, I feel unsafe and have been getting resting tremors all over.   Sometimes I think I can pull it together and finish my deadlines if I avoid feeling too much. But then so much as my mom forcefully kissing me or touching me the wrong way sends me into a panic attack. She seems to have forgotten I've been SA-ed. I don't think I even have any real friends, just people who think I'm resourceful sometimes. Feels like I'm just a magnet for shitty people no matter how hard I try to form meaningful bonds. At least where I live.   I'd like to move out you know, start a new life if the circumstances just allowed it. Far away where no one can hurt me. I don't wanna lose hope. Because what else would I have anyway? But with each passing day, it feels like parts of me are chipping away.	1643123813.0	scg073	/r/offmychest/comments/scg073/i_feel_so_defeated_please_remind_me_that_theres/	I feel so defeated, please remind me that there's still good in this world
dxpj0dr4	I had Covid over the holidays. I emailed my boss to let him know and he replied saying he hoped I was feeling okay and to rest well.

A couple of people, not everyone, replied saying they hoped his kid feels better soon etc. (we have a pretty casual friendly work culture). Our boss replied saying thank you to them all. I don’t know why I just felt kinda bad that I didn’t say anything. It’s so stupid at the end of the day he’s my boss not my friend, it does not matter if I didn’t wish his kids well and he’s not say there thinking about how I didn’t say anything but I just…I don’t know.

I've chatted with plenty of people over the years, but ultimately, I just go back into my void.

It's either do heavy lifting on a knee I just injured or pay hundreds of dollars on movers. I sit and wonder where the hell are my 2 brothers and why do I have to do all of it alone?

3qmbqpec	Get this. I immigrate to Montreal 4 years ago, obviously French isn’t too strong but I manage to go to a normal French Secondary school. Then i do somewhat well despite my average in French being trash(60-70%). Finally get accepted into CEGEP. Dawson, one of the best english colleges. Only caveat is that I’m in the evening division since my highschool grades weren’t high for that competitive cycle (87% needed a 90% to get in the day division).  I work my ass off and get As in everything and one B in Calculus. I was expecting an r-score of around 34-36. Nope. I get an r-score of 31. Now I genuinely have no shot at making it to med school. What boils my blood is the fact I have better grades than my friends from the Day division, and I have a lower r score than them.  Seriously fuck Québec. I’m moving first chance I get.

h229l4dq	We were together on and off for five years. We were vastly different people when we first met. It was both of our first serious relationship. We lost our virginity together.  I had been frustrated and unhappy for a long time - I wanted to get married, yes, but more than anything else, I wanted to have a baby. Five years I waited, though, and nothing changed. COVID striking the world was where the tides began to turn. It was a real eye opener in many ways, and things began to sour. Among other things, he was living with his Mother at the time, and she would not permit me to visit for a very long time.   We always spent time together there, because he has severe cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, and my house was not accessible. I was hurting a lot, we spent a lot of time apart, and our relationship suffered. My heart was breaking.  Christmas Day of last year was pretty much where things fell apart completely. I had come over to stay and when I walked in the door he would barely say hello to me or give me a hug. I was in tears most of the night, and left heartbroken early the next morning.  However, I tried to continue a wary sort of friendship with him, because his Father was terminally ill with cancer. I felt so sorry for him, and wanted to be supportive.  His Father passed away at the end of January. I tried my best to be there for him through the whole process of grieving. I went with him on several visits to the cemetery afterwards to help him get to the grave and lay flowers. I only wanted to help. I cared, but I really didn't consider us a couple anymore.  I met another man in May and was swept off my feet. He gave me a ring on our second date. We are perfect for each other, we understand each other, and above all, are on the same page with our priorities and what we want in life.  My ex knew about all of this. I told him everything.  Then, at the end of July... he suddenly appears with an engagement ring and proposes to me, says I'm the love of his life and desperately wants to be with me again. White gold set with emeralds. He even promised we could finally have a baby. I accepted because there were other people present and  I felt pressured... but, my heart was not in it. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  I was suffering from severe depression, and was even hospitalized from a drug overdose. He supported me through that.  I do believe he loved me, but I did not love him anymore. My heart had suffered and been broken too many times. I do not believe there was anything either of us could have done that would have made the other truly happy.  A couple weeks later, in August... I left his ring behind for my Mother to return. I packed up and left town without a word to anyone, to be with the man I had fallen in love with.  We had a mutual desire to have a child, and I found out I was pregnant a month and a half later in September. We are expecting a baby boy in June.  I'm deeply in love with my partner and couldn't be happier that we will be parents soon. Yet... I still feel sad that I broke things off with my ex the way I did.  He was in contact with my Mother at least once after I left; she returned the ring. Apparently, he said he would always love me, even though, again, he knew about everything.  He did text me once, I can't remember when because I didn't keep it (and deleted+blocked his number). His last words to me were, "I don't believe you would just walk away from everything you love, and the people who love you".  I know it was wrong. Everything I did... I should have done it differently. I was in such a bad place at the time, mentally... I was abusing drugs and alcohol (something I have thankfully since been able to stop), on a steep downward spiral and would have been dead soon, one way or another (the drug overdose was a suicide attempt, though of course I refused to admit that to anyone).  I didn't believe for two seconds that anyone could help me, or really cared what was happening to me. Something had to change. I needed to just... break free, or else, I knew death was coming for me.  I am haunted by it all. I never wanted to hurt him... never... but I know that I did through my actions, more than words can say. I no longer loved him, but I did care. I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for that.  Can I ever in any way, make this any better? I will not contact him directly of course, because I genuinely do not wish cause him any more hurt... yet... I don't know. I want to do something, yet is there anything I can do?...  ...Perhaps, there is no redemption for me. I will eternally suffer for the anguish I have caused multiple people... and it is well deserved.	1643131061.0	sciq2b	/r/offmychest/comments/sciq2b/i_didnt_love_my_ex_anymore_but_feel_bad_about_the/	I didn't love my ex anymore, but feel bad about the way I left him.
2vycztd9	Let me preface this saying that this is from a male perspective.  &#x200B;  Relationships have 2 main offerings.  1. “Partnership” i.e. someone to talk to, share burdens etc. 2. Improved Sex Flow i.e. similar to smoothing your cashflow, relationships allow you to have a sexual partner on retainer  Here’s why there are better options  Partnerships are the payday loan of mental strength and resilience. Why is this? Partnership solves a problem you should not have. An individuated righteous man or someone on the path to becoming one should be able to deal with any mental or physical burdens on their own, it is hard, but it is necessary if you wish to become an individuated man. Your own inner mind is the most interesting and powerful object on this planet. Instead of using another person or crutch, enter your own mind, pay attention to everything you do, say, & think. Analyze why you feel what you feel. Notice the different personalities in your mind and start to fortify, mature, & individuate. The taller the building the greater the foundation must be.  And if you choose to use a crutch you will pay dearly in loss of freedom, time, & money. You will spend time talking to the person which could have been used on other tasks, you will lose money on dates, gifts, missed opportunities, and heaven forbid you get married and become successful, you’ll then have gambled 50% of your life’s work on a coin toss. Most tragically you’ll lose a large amount of freedom which is any human’s most valuable resource.  Secondly sex:  This one is easy, a women’s sexual peak is around 21 and begins to taper off after 25, while man’s sexual fitness slowly increases over time and peaks at round 40-50. Essentially women are buying low sell and selling high. They try to trap you while you're young and have a fairly low sexual fitness and will then divorce you once you have accrued wealth and their asset has devalued, it's basically an investment. Don’t let that happen to you, let your sexual fitness reach maturity, you will have access to much higher quality sexual partners and you will retain your wealth.  Don’t fall for the trap, your monkey mind will trick you into replicating and hot women will try to seduce you into hunkering down, don’t sell early, don’t listen to the sirens call. You will be a better, wealthier man with more higher quality sex partners for it.	1643131381.0	sciujj	/r/offmychest/comments/sciujj/relationships_are_not_worth_the_risk_or_time_for/	Relationships Are Not Worth The Risk Or Time For Young Men
8jszbk4b	I work as a paramedic and I'm so tired of covid and it dividing people. I go to multiple covid calls a shift, some people with mild symptoms- I teach them to take tylenol and advil to help with their fever and pain. I go to people with severe symptoms that aren't vaccinated- they can't breathe. I've started asking them if they wished they were vaccinated, and all of them say yes. Even the unvaxxed people with mild symptoms say they haven't felt this bad their entire life. One lady, who I don't think will survive grabbed my arm and said "you probably hate people like me, I'm sorry". My heart broke for her and I told her I don't hate her, I hate the world we're living in.   With the media and false information dividing everyone, my family included; it's extra taxing. Science holds no value anymore, yet these people still call 911 exposing us to a virus that some people believe doesn't exist. Covid can't be the reason her husband is in cardiac arrest right? "It doesn't exist". He's dead now, tested positive. His lungs were impossible to ventilate, we even tried putting him prone, tried rescue Ventilation strategies- his lungs were fibrous but it still cannot be covid. He died of covid, but no it's absolutely impossible because "COVID DOESN'T EXIST". RIP 44 year old man with a family and many more. Victims of media.   The hospitals are max capacity. My coworkers mental health has declined and so has mine. I used to love going to work but after 2 years of this I'm at the end of my rope. I smashed my hand against my steering wheel over and over when I saw the convoy of truck making their way through my city.

6mq0xovk	I can’t seem to figure out if my logic makes sense. I was hanging with my bf yesterday super bored and I started messing with his phone when I found this. He has an iPhone and on the locked screen there was a Apple tip suggestion that read “how to hide message notifications”. He’s telling me it randomly suggests tips and he accidentally butt dialed the tips open, and saying my logic isn’t warranted. I feel like I’m losing it, because it seems reasonable to be worried.	1643132504.0	scja61	/r/offmychest/comments/scja61/thoughts/	Thoughts?
6no5s523	To put in some context, I’ve been with my SO for about 4.5 years. Over those 4 years I (26F) feel like I’ve grown quite a bit. I went from being a medical student to reviewing for my boards and now practicing as a GP.   My SO (28M), on the other hand, has been through a series of jobs that only lasted a few months and some job applications that got rejected here and there. I was with him through it all. He works with his dad’s paint jobs on the side but it’s pretty sparse I would say (the last one was maybe 3 months ago). Careerwise, he’s still in the same spot where he was when we met. He and I have talked about his career (or lack thereof) numerous times and the last time we had a serious discussion was 2 years ago. During that talk, he promised to do an online course that should have only taken him less than a year to accomplish but he still isn’t done with it til now. He literally spends his days lounging at home doing random errands for his parents and whenever I ask about the course he says he’s working on it and he’ll be done soon. Money isn’t a huge issue for him since he lives with his parents and he does some online trading as well.   I don’t have the heart to tell him that my mom isn’t 100% sold on him because she doesn’t think he’s financially and career stable. And I don’t think she’s wrong. Whenever i get asked what my SO does, I never know the right answer because even I don’t know myself. Should i even talk to him about this again? I just want to be proud of him but I dont know. I just keep asking myself like is this how he wants his life to be forever? We keep making future plans with each other but all those plans require premeditated steps that we should be doing right now, right?	1643133187.0	scjjk6	/r/offmychest/comments/scjjk6/i_dont_feel_proud_of_my_so/	I don’t feel proud of my SO

bavmf80b	Okay okay I know I’m probably instantly going to regret posting this, but I just need to get it off my chest lol  I am 26F and haven’t had sex in my twenties. The last time I had sex I was in University, and it was a one night stand with a guy I was sort of friends with. It wasn’t very impressive and didn’t go anywhere after that.  Since then I sort of just wasn’t bothered by guys. I was busy graduating. I then lived at home with parents for a year to save money before moving to the big city to live in a houseshare and get a job.  Anyways, I haven’t had sex since moving out of my parents house. I guess I’m not really embarrassed by it, in all honestly my previous sexual encounters make me think I’m really not missing anything, but my friends look at me like I’m insane.  It’s not like I’m anti sex? I think part of it is having gained weight, and feeling so much shame around my body I couldn’t imagine anyone seeing me naked. It actually makes my skin crawl. The other part of it is that I guess I can’t miss what I never had? I don’t think I really had any ‘good sex’ from 18-19 so I don’t miss it? Is that weird?  I guess I’m just worried about finally getting to a place I’m comfortable with my body (whatever size that is), but being like nearly 27 and having NO idea what to do with my body, and like will it hurt? Who knows?  Sorry I probably sound insane but yeah, I’ve lost count of the number of friends who are like shocked by what I say about it all hahaha	1643136202.0	sckpjf	/r/offmychest/comments/sckpjf/born_again_virgin_lol/	Born again virgin lol
7si2bojv	My significant other told me that she isn’t ready to maintain a romantic relationship of any kind. She sent me a long message which said other stuff as well. We are still on great terms, and we both said that we’d love to stay friends. I told her that I will wait for her, and whatever she decides to do in the future, I would support it 100%. Although she said that I can still talk to her, I’ve been distancing myself and giving her some time and some space. These past few days have been very tough for me, and with the schoolworks that I have to deal with, I feel very burnt out and sad. I’m still getting used to everything, especially since I used to spend a lot of time with her. I miss her. I miss our late night talks, our music listening sessions, I miss sending her funny and wholesome memes, I miss sending her good morning and good night messages, and many more. I honestly don’t think I can handle this, but I told myself to stay strong for her. I’m glad that she’s putting herself and her well-being first. She means a lot to me, so knowing that she’s focusing on her feelings and taking a well-deserved break is great. I don’t know if she’s gonna come back to our relationship, but if she decides to end it completely and I have to let go of her, I’ll have peace in knowing that she’ll be happy. I love her so much and I’m so grateful for everything that we’ve been through. She has made such a positive impact on my life and has given me a reason to smile and get out of bed. I’m so glad I’ve met this wonderful person.	1643136328.0	sckr88	/r/offmychest/comments/sckr88/idk_what_to_name_this_lol/	Idk what to name this lol

izxpbaqo	 I pretty much have been psychologically destroyed by being raped and abused by older male teens who lives right across the street from my house, told my mom, mom told police, police didn’t care (I live in a shitty country), now I’m even worse mentally because I grew up watching my abusers in my face for the rest of my upbringing.  I want to escape the mental torture, the freaking cloud over my head that doesn’t let me a normal person who can be a normal and shit. I’m a 23 year old guy who gets ask ‘’how you don’t have a gf?’’ because it’s hard to explain that being touched, kissed even if it’s a girl, causes disturbance and not the good kind, the anxiety, ptsd kind. This hard to explain to women, dating is literally impossible and I’m realizing that if I don’t sort this out I’m going to die alone.  just finished my degree in criminal research and even though from the outside I might look strong, detective wanna be (i want to be) yet I can’t deal with my own child hood trauma because as a man I can’t sit in front of a person and admit that I’ve been raped. Leading a life on revenge, I realized I do what I do because I hate criminals who get away and I want to be the best at it, that’s it.  I want to enjoy sex, I really do yet all I did was become afraid of it because in my mind it all feels wrong.	1643136687.0	sckw4q	/r/offmychest/comments/sckw4q/i_want_to_overcome_my_child_sexual_abuse_trauma/	I want to overcome my child sexual abuse trauma, does anybody have tips or know how?

j0781vgm	We had been together for close to 1 and a half years (me 19M and her 19F) but have been friends forever, and our relationship was perfect, especially for the 1st year or so.  She broke up with me about a month and a half ago. Looking back I can see why. Our relationship was not as fun anymore, and actually was more like a friendship.  I do believe that there is more to it though. The last month before we broke up we were constantly together, she never had space for herself and was feeling pressured. She is an introvert after all, and needs time to recharge and time alone.  What she didn't know is that I had discovered something on me, that had an over 50% chance of being cancer. I didn't tell anyone and for the 4 weeks I waited to get checked by a doctor, I tried to be with her as much as possible, because when I was left alone, it was too much for me, knowing that I might have cancer.  I actually got checked and all went well. She broke up about a week after that, saying that she doesn't think we match, and I'm certain that always being together when she is introverted played a major role in her decision.  I never told her, or anyone about this, as she gets extremely nervous and would honestly lose her mind if she knew before I got checked.  I backed off for about a month and reinitiated contact with her. We're talking every few days (both of us are reaching out) and we met once and it was pretty fun. I honestly want us to get back together. I just don't know what I should do, or even if I should ever mention the above.  Also let me point out that we had more problems as well, as all couples, but I believe they were miniscule, and actually wroked on fixing everything, while I spent some time with my self.	1643137855.0	sclca2	/r/offmychest/comments/sclca2/we_broke_up_but_she_doesnt_know_of_something/	We broke up but she doesn't know of something
cgcplz7w	Hey guys so I meet a girl online and we live very far from each other. We’ve been talking for about 6 months now. I first told her I had feelings for her maybe 2 months in and she told me she wasn’t looking for a relationship, but we kept on as friends and about 2 months ago she began to get very flirty and acting like she liked me. So after a few conversations were we both talked about liking each other and having feelings, I told her that I loved her(which I do and have for a while). At first she said it back immediately, but a few days later we had a talk and basically she said she loved me but to much other stuff in the way( distance,money,etc) at first I didn’t want to accept that but eventually I did. We kept talking, but it wasn’t the same anymore and eventually I told her that if she didn’t think it would work that I think I needed some space because my feelings aren’t going away and it hurts to have them knowing it isn’t going to amount to anything.She said she didn’t want me to leave, and that she really loved me and we could try to make it work. It’s been about a 2 week since then and I feel like she’s distancing herself again, hours in between text with no explanation. She’ll say we can have a video call at such and such time, but she’s got an excuse whenever it’s time(which isn’t like her). I don’t know I feel like I forced her to say she loved me by threatening to leave, but that wasn’t my intention.I genuinely was heartbroken to do it and I really thought it was going to be the end of us. I was so happy when she told me not to leave, but now I feel like a manipulative piece of shit. I know she cares about me and didn’t want to leave, but I’m not sure she actually loves me, and I feel like she might have thought she had to say it to not lose a friend. I feel so guilty about this	1643138110.0	sclfr2	/r/offmychest/comments/sclfr2/she_says_she_loves_me_but_she_doesnt_act_like_it/	She says she loves me, but she doesn’t act like it
cy7k3e4c	As the title says. I grew up in a Christian househould. My mom was a stay at home mom and mentally unstable. She was bullied as a kid and kind of became the neighbourhood freak. She raised me in a protective way and I likely have a mild form of autism. I never really had friends and when I did, I only had one friend. After I graduated I have not had friends since. Ever since I was around 12 she always asked if I had a boyfriend and if I was populair. Sadly that was the only thing I was bad at. She never cared about my grades or my amount of hobby's. I really tried but likely being autistic and being raised the way I did, made me not only weird socially but I also got bullied. After a while I just gave up and focused on things I am good at: getting good grades and stuff. Now I am 24 and I finally start looking for a serious relationship. I have never dated before. I try to be engaging but the guys act like they are not interested and I got rejected by my work crush. It feels like high school again. I have gotten hobbies but I honestly feel like it does not matter as long as a guy does not like me. I started teaching myself the piano and learned an amazing song and showed it to my mom and she did not care at all. When I told her I had a guy I was talking to. She was very happy and I felt so proud. Now the guy ignores me and I feel like crying again. I am afraid of ending up as an old spinster. I have to add that my mom is kind of right wing.	1643140291.0	scm8yt	/r/offmychest/comments/scm8yt/i_feel_kind_of_worthless_without_a_guy/	I feel kind of worthless without a guy
2wzvoksp	I'm a student, and unemployed so I am broke to begin with. But today at the supermarket, when I was about to get my groceries scanned, a woman skipped the line and was waiting awkwardly in order for the cashier to notice her. The cashier then grabbed some groceries which were placed on one side and asked the woman what she was going to buy in the end. She kept adding the prices trying to figure out if she can afford buying what's most important. At one point she wasn't sure what to choose between the toilet paper or two packs of ramen.   I was already an emotional mess because of my shitty day, so this nearly made me cry. I wanted to pay for all of her groceries, but I didn't have enough money either to afford both of our groceries. I only got her what she left behind: a chocolate spread jar and some cherry tomatoes. It wasn't much, but her face turning from worried to slightly smiling made my day, I hope her day got a little better too! She seemed embarrassed, but grateful so I hope I didn't make her feel bad, I didn't mean to insult her in any way.   I wish you the best, sweet lady!

ev7peks8	As the title stated, two years ago today my friend had passed away. He came into my life when I was in a really bad place, fresh out of the hospital from a suicide attempt and trying to get my life back on track by getting a job. I got hired into the job I applied for and was pleasantly surprised to see this guy there, treating me like I actually mattered without even having to know me. Every life he came across, he shed such a bright light onto that literally no one who knew him would have anything bad to say about him. He would do anything for anyone, he even helped a new employee who was struggling to make ends meet for her kid by giving her a gift card with a very significant amount of money just because he wanted to help. He was a hard worker who loved his job. We would talk every day on shift and just smile the whole time because we really related to each other. When the news broke that he passed, it was so sudden and no one saw it coming. I was a mess ever since, even still occasionally thinking about him because there’s so much I never got to tell him. I hope he knew how loved he was by so many, and by me especially. He helped me through everything ups and downs and I wish he was still here so I can tell him about all the amazing things that have happened since he’s been gone, along with all the progress I have made. There will be absolutely no other human like him, but I hope to find someone one day that cared about me the way he did, and was just as pure spirited as he was. I’m not losing hope on that though. I’m glad I was able to stick around to experience his presence, but more importantly glad to even be alive right now because he inspired me to not give up on myself and that there are good things out there. He showed me my value, showed me how strong I am. I know he would be proud of me right now. I just miss him a whole lot, it was really the first significant loss in my life and sometimes I still find myself not knowing what to do without him.	1643142383.0	scn1j8	/r/offmychest/comments/scn1j8/today_marks_2_years_since_one_of_my_good_friends/	Today marks 2 years since one of my good friends passed away and I’m really missing him.
hi82tjke	Hoards of women will comment, claiming that they are the exception, but what's more valid?...the exception or the general rule? This post is about how women act IN GENERAL. Women want to be treated like delicate little flowers but can't take it when men call out these behaviors to prove that most women operate through a childlike worldview where everything is done for them by men because "women deserve it". So, as a woman, if you accept these acts of benevolent sexism, you are by default either saying that men are women's little slaves or you're saying that women can't handle the real world and can't survive without men taking the lead. With that being said, here's a list of things women should stop doing/accepting if they actually believe that men and women are equal.  1. Expecting men to open car doors for you  2. Expecting to be swept off your feet by a man while you literally don't reciprocate anything.  3. Expecting men to check if there's a burglar if you hear a weird noise in your house at night.  4. Expecting men to help you with luggage.  5. Dumping your emotional baggage on men yet being repulsed when men do the same.  6. Expecting men to fix what's broken around the house.  7. Expecting men to give up their bus seat for you if the bus is too crowded  8. Expecting men to pay for dates (I don't care who asked who, buy your own damn food. It's an    easy cop out for women to say "whoever asks should pay" knowing full well that women almost    never ask the man on a date.  9. Expecting your wedding ring to be full of diamonds while your husband has a shitty plain    wedding band.  10. Becoming aggressive with men then cowering down when the man himself becomes aggressive.  11. Teaching your son "ladies first"  Either accept that men and women are not equal or just admit that you're a hypocritical woman who likes to milk the perks of being a woman while still proclaiming that "men and women are equal".	1643143405.0	scnfc8	/r/offmychest/comments/scnfc8/if_men_and_women_are_truly_equal_then_women/	If men and women are truly equal, then women should stop the following behaviors
cahg6ch1	Trigger warning: Story makes reference to rape.   I just want to provide context first. I have been friends with this person since our school days over fifteen years and for the most part we get on really well. For the sake of this story, I will refer to him as L.  L has had a rough couple of years after losing a close family member who he considered a father as well as a bad breakup with his partner whom is the mother of his daughter.   More recently, L has been back on the on the single scene and meeting multiple women for casual hookups.   What he does in his private life is his business and I have no concern with that.   However, what I do have a concern with is his attitude towards women in general and how he objectifies them.   L often tells me about his escapades and how they are ‘sl*gs’ and ‘up for anything’ and also how his ‘numbers are getting better.’   Whenever I meet up with him for a catch up and some drinks in an evening he is always trying to ‘pull’. He also asked me how many people I’ve slept with as if it’s some kind of competition?   I’ve expressed my concerns to him and avoid encouraging his behaviour, but it seems to just go in one ear and out the other.  More recently, just a few days ago, I was looking at the local news and was in sheer disbelief that one of our old college teachers was convicted for raping a young woman.   L called me later that evening and I broke the news about our former college teacher being convicted of rape and his immediate response was laughter.   I immediately told him that it wasn’t funny and he found the news article and recited certain parts of the victims account whilst laughing.   L then went on to justify how ‘you cant really blame him if he hasn’t had sex in so long’ to which I replied ‘you can blame him and you cannot justify rape no matter how you try and spin it.’  After the phone call (which was on loudspeaker and my wife heard everything) I looked at my wife and said I’m genuinely worried he will rape someone one of these days. It might seem an extreme statement but I wouldn’t say it if I wasn’t genuinely concerned.  I was tempted to mention in the phone call with L what he would say if that was his daughter was a victim of rape, but I bailed as although it would maybe put things in perspective, I feel he would get angry.   I don’t know if and how I would raise my concerns tactfully to him without causing problems.	1643143778.0	scnkg3	/r/offmychest/comments/scnkg3/my_best_friend_laughed_about_a_woman_being_raped/	My best friend laughed about a woman being raped
iu0hp7f8	I recently started a new job and I feel so hollow. I’m financially recovering after dissolving my 401k and selling every stick during 2020 to pay rent. Now I wonder the actual positive impact working 40-50 hours a week could have on me. I want to buy a small house and put it on property, cultivate a garden. Actually live around plants, nature and sunshine. I work in IT an accepted a job with it as it will pay better than other jobs I am qualified for. I am 32 years old and have worked full time since I was 16 and it seems so pointless. I wish I could fast track to having money saved to buy a small house and try to live off the land. But in this climate I don’t think I’ll ever make enough to support myself and still save enough to create a happier life for myself.	1643145121.0	sco2gz	/r/offmychest/comments/sco2gz/i_dont_see_how_i_can_be_happy_or_successful/	I don’t see how I can be happy or successful.
c5hgbf5g	 I’m married (for almost 10 years now) and I have kept my birth (last) name. My family and friends know this. Before I was married I knew I never wanted to take my partners last name, solely because my identity and whole understanding of who I am is my name. However it feels like friends and family and society just can’t accept this. I keep getting letters and invitations that state “Mr. and Mrs. Hislastname” or “Myname and Hisname Hislastname.”   I am a whole person, period stop end of sentence.	1643146253.0	scohk9	/r/offmychest/comments/scohk9/my_name_is_my_identity/	My name is my identity
j0phzj9d	I have a father, but he doesn't get along with anyone. I also have a younger brother and is not exaggeration to say that I see him almost like my own kid.  I'm disgusted with myself. I just feel way too close to my mother. Of course it's absolutely nothing sexual, and I love my mother deeply... but I can't help but resent both her and myself.  It just seems abnormal. I don't feel like her child, but almost like her partner. She'll always talk to me about the stuff that troubles her, will try to get us to snuggle together when she's feeling down, we have dinners with other couples/families, I always drive her around, drive her and my brother to have holidays together, we'll often sleep together, cook for her, be physically way too close, etc...  I don't know how to put it in to words, but it's nauseating. We're just way too close for my comfort. I stopped reading romantic novels because it reminded me of her in a platonic way and it made me cringe extremely hard. I just feel disgusted with myself. I don't know why, but I just can't see her as my mother (as in, a figure I look up to/could rely on). She's just some fella I like and more often than not I feel like her caregiver.  I don't know what the fuck it's wrong with me, but I've never felt this level of self-hatred or disgust before.	1643146268.0	scohro	/r/offmychest/comments/scohro/i_feel_like_im_my_mothers_partner_rather_than_her/	I feel like I'm my mother's partner rather than her child

5xhure62	I have a serious problem. Not really sure who to tell, but I need some advice. I am very attracted to my mother in law. Two things. This is not going to be a sex story, it isn't some fantasy, it is an true issue. I will preface by saying that I love my wife, she is gorgeous, sexy, and amazing. I would never do anything to hurt her. That includes ever trying to act on something. I am too faithful for that. That being said, this attraction is bad because I don't know how to deal with it. Strangely enough, my wife unknowingly enables it. My MIL is only 11 years older than me, she had my wife young. I have always had a thing for older women too. Kind of dated one a year before I met my wife. We never were official and never did anything together but we called each other wifey and hubby. Anyway, her mom had a tummy tuck and boob job after her last child, it gives her literally my perfect body type and she is stunning. I would say that she could easily create an only fans where she doesn't even get naked and make millions just from posting selfies. Don't get me wrong, my wife is stunning too and turns me on just as easily. However, her mom just has exactly what my primal brain desires. I think my wife is prettier in the face though, but that doesn't diminish her moms looks though. She and my wife are also extremely close. They tell each other everything, literally everything. My wife often talks in detail about our sex life and the things I do with her. To top it off her mom has gotten extremely comfortable around me over the last 10 years of my marriage to her daughter. She does things in front of me she would never do in front of ex husbands, like farting, LOL. Another bad thing about all this is that I think she knows I find her attractive. Lately she does these things, just movements and actions, in my presence and I see her out of the corner of my eye glancing at me. Sometimes when she and my wife are together and we are all hanging out, the two of them will start dancing, playing around, doing twerks, and other things in front of me. Her mom will constantly look over at me smiling like she is looking for my reactions. I try my best to just smile and show I am dancing and singing along too. I have had discussions with my wife, she knows I find her mom pretty, I have directly told her so. My wife just doesn't know the extent of how much I do.       Previously I mentioned my wife sometimes unknowingly enables it. I will give an example. Her mom came over wearing those "tick tock" pants, the ones that form to every crevice leaving little to imagination? yeah those. I was in the bathroom, naked ON THE TOILET ffs, and her mom came to our bedroom and stood there casually talking to my wife. They left and I joined them a little bit later in the sitting room. I was sitting there and my wife exclaims, "BABE!" My wife tells me that I need to see her moms butt in these pants. Nervously I said," You want me to look at your moms butt?" She laughs and says "Shut up, you know you find my mom hot". Her mom stands up, without hesitation, and shows me her butt in these pants.... I literally cannot put into words what this did to me. Then my wife and her start comparing bellies and talking about how my wife has a flap and her mom doesn't. Her mom casually pulls her pants down a little and shirt up showing her underwear a little and mid drift. Again grinning at me like she is looking for a reaction. I don't know what my face looked like by the time she left, but it was probably a mix of shock and hunger. On the plus side, it made me want to go do something with my wife immediately. When I told my wife this an hour later I wanted her, she says "You are just turned on because of my mom, hahaaha". I don't know who I was kidding telling her "no I didn't, I just wanted you!" My wife just laughed and we went on with our day. (we had kids so we couldn't do anything anyway).      All of this is what I need advice about. I mean is the staring that her mom is doing just her checking to see if I am creeping on her and she is actually really uncomfortable? Does she just do the things she does around me with my wife because my wife pushes it and she doesn't know what else to do? More nervousness uncomfortable? My wife is very very jealous. If she has a problem with something, you will know it. She has no problem letting me know she is mad at me. I know that if this was all another woman other than her mom, she would be livid. However, she genuinely does not seem bothered by me finding her mom attractive. I find that fact even more weird. Now to make all this situation even more hard. Her mom wants to divorce her husband. She has been unhappy with him for a long time because he just treats her like a piece of arm candy, lies to her allot, and spends allot. She and my wife have this whole plan worked out that she moves in with us for a year, then we buy a big house together and live happily ever after. (my wife's words, not mine). I am completely fine with this, I know it will make my wife extremely happy and her mom will be happy too. However, for obvious reasons, I am worried about this. It is going to make my attraction even worse. Seriously what do I do? Am I just reading all these things wrong? Should I tell my wife the degree of my attraction to her mom and ask for her help to over come it and not enable it? Should I just suffer in silence and never say a word. Use the fuel to boost my wife and I's sex life?	1643149670.0	scpp6c	/r/offmychest/comments/scpp6c/my_mother_in_law/	My Mother in Law
5g1x3gi0	I feel as though I'm fucking up everything. I feel so lonely but I'm not alone but evidence suggests I need to repress myself to get by.  I got pregnant 2019. Wonderful for us etc but I feel as though I have lost my brain. My daughter is now a wonderful 20 months and I still feel so stupid compared to how I used to be. I can't stay on top of the house. I'm no longer good at what I used to do and I lack the energy to do it consistently. It's like all the things I learned about how to adult have been erased. My memory is nowhere near as good too.   Doing things I need to do consistently require so much work mentally . I started a new job and am doing so badly and it's frustrating as I really want to do well. I have no idea what to do. I feel so stupid and useless. Being fairly intelligent was the only thing I prided myself on so I'm also having an existential crisis.  I have done short term counselling (NHS) during which my counsellor agreed I'm not depressed or anxious.

j0s8poi7	I live a country where the average male height is 6’ & the average female height is 5’7, I am a 28 year old man and I’m 5’6.   Everything about being a short guy fucking sucks. When I was a teenager I was very confident, happy etc. Eventually everyone grew much much taller than me and I have had a crippling insecurity about it since.   The problem is the way my society treats me as a whole. I go for a promotion when I am objectively and measurably better than a taller colleague and the taller colleague gets it over me? Why? Because people don’t take me seriously.   Other Men think they can just bully me in random social situations. I am a strong guy for my size, I will be using a rack at the gym and they will start to take my weights (strangers) and when I ask why they will say “you are done” (happens all the time) then get shocked and surprised when I say “no I am still using this”. Get angry like I should defer to them.   Anytime I’ve assertive or stand up to myself people tell me to stop acting like a short man? Am I supposed to be a door mat?   People I don’t know will make fun of me for my height at pubs, clubs or events, try to start fights on me to impress girl.  I tried to become a teacher and the kids just laughed at me calling me “oompa loompa”.  People act like I am not there . I always have to assert and then it makes feedback loop “short man”.  I have good job now but all colleagues joke my girlfriend is only with me because I stand on my wallet when I met her, it hurts because there is some truth.   What is the point? Every day is another microaaggression ? I don’t even want to reproduce I wouldn’t want a son to struggle and play this life on hard mode like me.   Cannot even talk about it, no one cares. “I’m sure it’s not that bad”. I would just like to be treated with respect I see others given each day around me that I don’t receive .

j0781vgm	We had been together for close to 1 and a half years (me 19M and her 19F) but have been friends forever, and our relationship was perfect, especially for the 1st year or so.  She broke up with me about a month and a half ago. Looking back I can see why. Our relationship was not as fun anymore, and actually was more like a friendship.  I do believe that there is more to it though. The last month before we broke up we were constantly together, she never had space for herself and was feeling pressured. She is an introvert after all, and needs time to recharge and time alone.  What she didn't know is that I had discovered something on me, that had an over 50% chance of being cancer. I didn't tell anyone and for the 4 weeks I waited to get checked by a doctor, I tried to be with her as much as possible, because when I was left alone, it was too much for me, knowing that I might have cancer.  I actually got checked and all went well. She broke up about a week after that, saying that she doesn't think we match, and I'm certain that always being together when she is introverted played a major role in her decision.  I never told her, or anyone about this, as she gets extremely nervous and would honestly lose her mind if she knew before I got checked.  I backed off for about a month and reinitiated contact with her. We're talking every few days (both of us are reaching out) and we met once and it was pretty fun. I honestly want us to get back together. I just don't know what I should do, or even if I should ever mention the above.  Also let me point out that we had more problems as well, as all couples, but I believe they were miniscule, and actually wroked on fixing everything, while I spent some time with my self.	1643151289.0	scqb9r	/r/offmychest/comments/scqb9r/we_broke_up_but_there_is_something_she_didnt_know/	We broke up but there is something she didn't know

58wtwg83	This is the third time since I was 16 this has happened to me and I’m exhausted. I’m 24, and I’m from the Bronx so tbh I didn’t think being in Long Island would be a problem. But I was waiting for my boyfriend to get off work and was actually on the phone with my therapist outside of the train station. Some dude approached me and was trying to talk to me and I just walked away. He kept calling after me and I ignored it.   I went into the waiting room and continued talking to my therapist. There were four other people in there. The dude followed me in there and started harassing me. He kept walking closer to me and I kept moving away from him. He made fun of me for standing near other people to protect myself and said he knows how that goes and he would take me down…He left and I thought I was safe then he came back.   He then went on to make fun of me for standing by the bathroom and said some racist shit of, “Of course you’re standing by the bathroom that’s so disgusting. Not surprising for a black woman you’re so disgusting.” He’s white, I’m black. Never met or saw this man a day in my life. I literally said nothing to him btw. Just kept leaving. He told me he would keep following me wherever I went.   My therapist was trying to talk me down lol and my boyfriend got off work early :/ I’m safe now with my boyfriend (who wanted to fight the dude but I held him back :/) but I’m pretty shaken up.

cwb646hl	I’m a guy, currently 22 years old and for the majority of my life I have been the weird kid, in early elementary I was the class clown and high school years awkward as hell, also dressed weird and had a really (like really) bad haircut.  After high school I started losing weight, hit the gym, dressed way better. Turns out under all that excess fat I had a really good facial structure, great jawline, blue eyes, really thick hair (my hairstyle similar to shawn mendes). I’m still a bit introverted but my extrovert side is pushing through and I first realized maybe 2 years ago when I was at a party and my friend’s sister started hitting on me. She’s gorgeous like even a hotter margot robbie. I noticed girls checking me out more and more but unfortunately my social skills still sucked.  There are a few negative downsides to this, for example other dudes will throw shade at you or try to belittle you, it’s really common and in the moment it actually hurts to have some people you wanna get to know be mean because of my looks. Also my life long best friend has also started doing this to an extent.   He was always taking care of me through social gatherings and obviously I did what I could to return the favor, now his looks are declining (losing hair also) and he has become different, always trying to ”one-up” me in topics, he’s more educated than me and uses this as leverage I guess you could say. It really sucks, didn’t think my best friend would see me as competition, he never did in my awkward phase.   Anyway that is all I had to say, feel free to ask anything. And yeah sorry if I come across as a bragger, this is the first time I can express how blessed I feel about my looks (although it’s also hard work) in contrast to have always hated my looks, it has really changed my entire life.	1643152565.0	scqs8a	/r/offmychest/comments/scqs8a/im_way_more_attractive_than_i_ever_thought_and_i/	I’m way more attractive than I ever thought and I love it.

birpbcip	I know this is a long read but I would really appreciate an outsiders opinion as I am driving myself crazy.  I’m not sure anymore whether I’m overreacting or whether this is reality. I’ve recently had a conversation with some of my friends, who have expressed they are worried for me because they’ve noticed signs of gaslighting and ‘emotional abuse’ from my partner.  The reason I put that in quotation marks is because I have no idea what to believe. I’m going to leave a few examples to see what you guys think.  1) I have depression and anxiety, which he knows. I can’t tell him when I’m down or anxious anymore because he tells me I’m ruining his night, or ruining the mood around our friends. I could go for long periods hiding these feelings as if they’re not there, and if I bring them up he says he can’t take it, that I’m too much and that I’m not making any effort to be better.  2) A few days ago me and my partner were meeting his mothers new partner, we have been together a long time and his family consider me one of their own. My partner was in another room and myself and his much younger brother were in the living room with his mother and new partner doing handstands. His mother looked over at me during this and smiled, we then went into the the other room to show him. He told me ‘stop you’re embarrassing my mother’.  3) He often tells me some things I say didn’t happen or that my feelings aren’t valid. He’ll ignore me if I have a feeling he doesn’t like or want to deal with, and that I should just suck things up and cope with the realities of life like everyone else.  4) I came to the kitchen just before we were due to go to the movies dressed in a pair of jogging bottoms. He told me I should change to make a good impression. If you have read this far, thank you.	1643156086.0	scs2x0	/r/offmychest/comments/scs2x0/is_this_abuse/	Is this abuse?

I felt very lucky to born in a family where this was never an issue and I was always treated as an equal. Soon, this immense guilt took over me realizing I haven't been able to make them proud of me or am not a good enough daughter to such good parents.	1643156392.0	scs6ug	/r/offmychest/comments/scs6ug/watched_a_documentary_on_the_problem_of_female/	Watched a documentary on the problem of Female foeticide in India and now feeling guilty for not being a good enough daughter
22u7f06v	My gf (f) and me (also f) have been living apart because I am finishing school and she needed to move with her mom for a while. Yesterday she told me she feels like we aren’t connected anymore. She wants a two week break.   It just day 1 and I don't understand how you can just be okay with not talking to someone that you have been with for 7 years. A few days I get but two weeks? Am I wrong in feeling that if you can go two weeks without talking to someone who was supposed to mean so much to you that there is no point in trying to salvage it. I am just feeling super lost and sad I'm trying to focus on school but all I can think about is her and this. Every-time I see something funny I just think this is something she would have liked that I would usually send her. I of course don't know what she's thinking but I just feel certain she's probably not giving as much thought to me as I am her.   If she doesn't reach out by this weekend I feel like there is no point in continuing on because I'm just so hurt that this is happening and it just feels like she's trying to detach so she can leave me at the end of the two weeks.  We have pets and I miss them but I of course cant contact her about them and im so sad because if this ends she will take them because they are currently living with her at her moms. Sorry for rambling this is my only outlet.	1643157429.0	scsk6h	/r/offmychest/comments/scsk6h/my_gf_of_7_years_wanted_a_break/	My gf of 7 years wanted a break.
bmhqgi0d	For info, I am a (legal) teenager. Please refrain from commenting “it’ll get better when you’re older” or anything like that.  I have never been good at keeping friends. In the years I’ve lived, I have made exactly one friend that I continue to speak with until this day. I recently started college and I made a lot of friends, but then winter break happened and I didn’t speak to a single person in a span of three weeks. Now I’m back at college and even though we studied together for the past few days, they suck. Nothing that they did, but I don’t want to have friends, and at the same time I don’t want to be alone. I feel like they don’t like me which might just be my own thoughts but it still sucks. I thought it would be great to go back again after so long and barely going outside but honestly I wouldn’t mind another quarantine lockdown right now.   :(	1643157755.0	scsogs	/r/offmychest/comments/scsogs/im_tired_of_abandoning_friends_but_i_am_also/	I’m tired of abandoning friends but I am also tired of having friends

9xkkpdie	We would have broken up months ago if I weren’t so in love with him as a person. He’s my best friend and the good times are incredible, but unfortunately only occupy 20% of the relationship. It wasn’t always like this, so I guess I’m sticking it out to see if it goes back to normal.      He’s on the spectrum and I’ve been doing so much research to understand how I can be a better partner. I understand noise sensitivity and overstimulation, but it is not an exaggeration to say that in a 24 hour day, 16 of it he spends wearing noise canceling headphones playing games, A half hour to an hour interacting with me depending on whether or not I’ve made him food, and the rest sleeping, usually long after I go to bed. He’s not vocal about his emotions and gets frustrated when I ask him for romantic reassurance. And I know that that can get annoying but I need it, and it doesn’t occur to him on his own.      A couple months ago he got into a fender bender and his car was impounded. At this point, without a real discussion about it, my car became “Our car”. And at first I was happy to help, but he doesn’t seem to respect that I need it too. His need for it comes first.       And while he’s out he won’t respond to my texts asking when he’ll be back. So I’m stranded in my apartment for however long it takes for him to get back. In fact, it’s happening right now.      I’m so tired.	1643159318.0	sct8dk	/r/offmychest/comments/sct8dk/living_with_him_makes_me_feel_lonelier_than_being/	living with him makes me feel lonelier than being single.

dlbmee7n	I just need to write that shit down.   I'm 38 and male, my older brother was diagnosed with lung cancer a few months ago. We all were pretty optimistic but things turned grim at the moment. He has two new tumors and now we're talking about preserving his life as long as possible with as minimal pain as possible. Because of that his wife was under so much stress that she developed a heart insufficiency and needs to be operated in two weeks. She lost both of her breasts two years ago to cancer too. Because of that their youngest son is depressed and in therapy, he has suicidal thoughts and I can't even fault him.  Our mom isn't taking this all well, she has an autoimmune disease and a severe nerve illness, she'll basically slowly loses the function of her limbs and will slowly die. Now my dad was diagnoses with a problem in his right heart chamber, he goes to he hospital tomorrow and will be operated as soon as possible. I don't know how severe it is because he doesn't talk about stuff like this.   I'm living 400km away from them with my own family. I last saw them all about a year ago, not because I don't care but because I just can't make it because of many different things which happened in my family life. It just crashes down all at once. I don't sleep. I go to bed at 4 am and I wake up at 6 am to start my day. I don't know how to cope anymore. I don't drink, I smoke a joint from time to time but more as a sleeping help than a coping mechanism. I talk a lot to my wife, it's not like I'm closing myself in but I still don't see any use in it. I just feel like shit and I don't know what to do. You're just so helpless. Last week I had a long conversation with my brother over the phone. He doesn't want to see me. Not because we don't love each other but because he doesn't want me to see him like that. I never in my life heard him so empty and sad. I could cry the whole day but I have two kids who don't even know what's going on. My daughter is too young to tell her and my son while he would be old enough to understand, he's simply not ready for it, damn I'm not ready for this all at once. He was diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago and while that's nothing dramatic, it just piles on. I feel like I'm unfair a lot of the time and I try to talk to them about it but it's also hard for me to not be stressed out all the time. I try to keep it together but it's tough.    I know that nobody here can help me and I don't look for pity, I'm the one who is at least healthy but I feel like I'm going crazy and I thought it may help to just write it down once. I don't want to involve friends with so much personal drama, it's just too much, so I thought I take this route. Sorry if some things aren't clear, english isn't my native language and I'm not really sorted in my rambling.

3l9396eg	I don’t know if I thought it would get easier? Or maybe I thought that 40s is old but that doesn’t sync with my lived experience? Especially since the pandemic I’ve just been like edging my breaking point. It just doesn’t end. This is it; this is life. Every. Goddamn. Day. I don’t expect to have a cushy retirement  either and holy fuck this is depressing.   25 more years according to the spreadsheet. And that’s pretending we don’t have yet another bubble burst or yet another “once in a lifetime” shitshow between then and now. My parents and my in-laws don’t have much either so it’s not like there’s some chunk of cash coming to help. So I’m just stuck. Grinding like Sisyphus.   I get 10 days vacation every year that I can’t even take consecutively and while I know that in and of itself is privileged it’s just a further reminder that there is no reprieve. You can’t really unwind in short spurts and the grind is taking a massive toll on every aspect of my life.   I know other people have it way worse and this rant is privileged af, but I’ve had a job since I was 15, full time since 19, and the thought that I’m only like half way through my “working years” is crushing and literally makes me want to die.	1643160283.0	sctkid	/r/offmychest/comments/sctkid/im_in_my_40s_and_the_thought_of_having_to_work/	I’m in my 40s and the thought of having to work 50hr weeks for another 20+ years is crushing
akgx1jjx	Hey everyone. I can’t take it anymore, at the verge of a mental breakdown. My family has a business where I helped them ever since I finished high school, so right after college I decided to get a job and you know move away from this business. But the thing is every time there is a problem they drag me back in. I feel hopeless as I feel bad for not helping them back. The problems includes my parent quarrelling and one leaving and I end up going. Second of all there will be a non stop quarrel and fights in the house. The atmosphere is so tense and I feel so pressured even to be in my own home.

izq89k0c	I've never been this distraught before and I feel it's affecting my empathy. Even so I do feel a bit guilty. Misery and desperation push people to do stupid, childish things. Will this make it better? Probably not. In fact if I tell my ex fiancee that I'm going to kill myself and she doesn't even try and reach out to me, what does that say about her? What does that make the point of all this?  No, not kill myself.  Tell all my friends (and my fiancee that ghosted me) that I'm going to kill myself by sunrise and then turn my phone off for a couple weeks.  I already have a place to campout and my lease is up by March 1st anyway.  Please don't suggest that I try and live a successful life for revenge. If anyone deserves to kill themselves it's me but I'm not even pulling that off. And if I ever decide to come back I'll say I was in the psych ward after my failed attempt.  I plan to do this soon, before my rental agreement expires. My roommates finding my somewhat empty torn up room should help seal the deal.	1643161162.0	sctvkl	/r/offmychest/comments/sctvkl/im_going_to_pretend_to_kill_myself_in_hopes_of/	I'm going to pretend to kill myself in hopes of causing panic and hurt to everyone that has given up on me.
9z6scl5f	it is crazy how some people were just created to cause chaos and hurt others. And it is even crazier that some people were just created to endure it and cry silently without showing any sort of emotions in order to "stay strong".   I was doing just fine until he came back. I was waking up early everyday and making sure I was living a healthy lifestyle. I was reading again, something I havent done in years, and was motivated to study. But now he came back just to stomp on me one last time.   He is the type of person who likes to mutilate others and watch them bleed. He likes to cause pain on purpose because he loves when the world struggles. And when I finally catch my breath and stop with the crying mess I made at 3 AM, he comes back just to make sure I fall and never get back up again.   He is pure evil and whatever relationship he ever has will forever be dysfunctional because he will never be interesting enough to hold someone there with him without his suicide threats and "I need you" lies.   He is like a piece of broken furniture: useless, ugly and better off in the garbage can. I swear it takes every single string of my muscles to not report him now.

76ps3p80	i would say hate but i can't bring myself to say it. my mom always told me i shouldn't hate anyone no matter what and i'm still related to them, so.  this might be long. thank you for reading this, if you do.   i'm 17 and the youngest of my dad's four kids. i'm my mom's only child, and she's dedicated all of her time to me. she makes me feel so loved and appreciated and i'm beyond grateful for her.   i do love my dad. he's incredible, and he always tries his best. he tells me he loves me all the time and when i do get to see him, we laugh a lot. he works nights so i only see him on weekends. our schedules don't mix at all.   the problem is with his other kids.   the oldest is in his late 30s. my dad is almost 60, and that alone terrifies me because he'll die one day, a lot sooner than anyone else's parents will.   he's not as bad as the other two, but he's still not great. he lives in another city about two hours away from my family. he sometimes says "i'm coming over" without even asking. it really drives my mom up the wall when he does this. he never gives an estimated time as to when he'll show up, he just does.   he has a baby with his girlfriend (fiancée? i don't know, honestly), and he's lovely. i love my nephew with all of my heart but i worry about him and the environment he's growing up in. both my brother and his girlfriend smoke weed and do other drugs at home, and i can only hope they don't do it around the baby or her other kids (who are both still very young)  my other brother is a little bit younger. i don't care enough about any of my siblings to know exactly how old they are. they don't even tell me happy birthday.   this brother is always in and out of jail. he doesn't have a stable life and he never talks to my dad at all. he doesn't tell him happy birthday or happy father's day. he doesn't make any sort of effort to communicate with him. i haven't seen him in 5 years.   my sister is the worst out of them all in my opinion. when i was little, she used to live with me and my parents, including my biological mom (who is her step-mom), and she would steal from her. money, makeup, jewelry. anything she could find and pawn off she'd steal. she's always hared my mom, she used to tell her mom that she would abuse her and hit her when she never would. my mom tried to get her help so many times but she always refused.   she disappeared for years. i don't know a lot about that situation, but i know she lived out of state for a long time, got engaged to a rich italian guy, and then everything after that i don't know. but she isn't engaged anymore. she isn't engaged anymore, though. i know that.   i don't know where else to post this.i have no one else to talk to without feeling like a burden   all of my siblings use my dad for money, whatever they want. he's so blind to that. i understand that he loves them but i don't get how he thinks they actually care about him, when they don't.   when i was younger my siblings broke up my parents. they were separated for three years and my sad missed some really big moments in my life.  i don't like them.   i am so envious of people who's siblings care for them. i wish mine loved me. i wish they weren't as horrible as they are.    thanks for reading, if you made it this far.	1643164460.0	scv01x	/r/offmychest/comments/scv01x/i_dont_like_my_dads_other_kids/	i don't like my dad's other kids
7nqza30i	I've been holding so much on my shoulders that I can't just ignore the fact that it is affecting my mental health, life choices, and life quality. Since I got here and started high school, I've been doing so much to get honor classes certificates reaching many goals for my academic profile to get a scholarship. More things that could help me and my mom since we are the only ones in this country, starting a new life (everything legal, doing all the paperwork to get political asylum) and working tons of hours to be able to afford each meal, live a mediocre life but still studying and getting many awards, certificates and getting into a lot of honor classes. All of that, for the first three years, I've reached the maximum academic awards with a 4.0 GPA, sacrificing so many hours of sleep, learning a second language that would become the most important one for my academic and professional life, just a lot of things...  once I got to college in the very last minute, all the awards had to be processed through FAFSA. I needed to apply for my FAFSA for all the academic rewards and everything that I received, everything, absolutely everything goes to the trash when all the financial offices rejected all of them for me not having a green card, FAFSA saying that I can't apply even I meet all the legal requirements, work permit, alien number, everything... just no green card (apparently organizations don't want to give you money knowing the possibility you can abandon everything and keep all the money but... bruh). Life has been full of complications, me working full-time jobs to reach the end of the month and help my mom pay bills, barely having anything, studying at the college, barely having time to do any work, and still pulling strength out of nowhere keep a clean GPA. Last year I got my AA, and still, even though there have been many opportunities, COVID has been a lot, professors not even teaching classes and pre-recording everything, my learning capacity not even reaching a decent level to keep going with my cyber security career and everything seems to go worst and in the stupidest lousy way possible. And after everything, suffering from anxiety, depression, and OCD, there is no light. I haven't even taken a break taking summer classes and two jobs to pay bills and keep studying to get a paper to open some doors, and even writing this right now. It's just... I can't describe how tired I am of everything, of people receiving financial aid and failing and not doing anything, the unfairness of living in these conditions, working so much and studying so hard even though I have been like this, I've been keeping an almost perfect GPA, but it is just unfair, I'm going to turn 20. I feel like I'm 40 already, so many responsibilities, no time, just living daily for what? What am I doing during a phase that usually is the best one to live, remember and create good moments with the people you love, but no... every system, every structure is a giant obstacle and feels like I'm breaking down, I'm getting strength from places of my soul where there's none, I am so tired and feel so much agony seeing all of this, feeling all this sadness, I'm just destroyed inside. I'm sorry if my grammar is pretty poor or just absurdly wrong. I'm going on a rant right now over my emotions without overthinking about it. Thanks for taking the time to read this, it's been so much, and this is just a fraction of so many shitty things that have been happening in my life.	1643164708.0	scv35s	/r/offmychest/comments/scv35s/i_cant_describe_how_much_i_hate_the_school_system/	I can't describe how much I hate the school system.
7ukf67wh	lately, I've been thinking about the feelings that come with having the same birth name as your father. It's tiring.   (I go by Vivian now) But being the 2nd generation that's supposed to be exactly what they envisioned or perhaps a better image of themselves rather than a better image of a person; There's this immense pressure that's hard to avoid from time to time filled with expectations, desires, dreams..I just want parents to understand that sometimes ingraining your head with high expectations will often lead you to disappointment.   I can tell my dad isn't really proud of me much. Despite the achievements, I made over time, and the work I put in for my future, I just know he isn't happy with me. I honestly feel like if I did the things he wanted me to do without a moment thought he'd be more proud. and the pressure to try to change my plans and fulfill his dream....it doesn't have to be that way though. People-pleasing is a thing of my past and  I am tired of that. I am not responsible for carrying the vision and dream of a son you wanted for years.   Yeah, I'm not the way you want me to be..hell you might not be happy with the plans I have after graduation, but I am happy. You know how far I came, especially the failures I went through to figure out what I want to do. I don't want to be part of a legacy where I feel pressured to be a certain way just so you can be satisfied.

whqxs	My mother and father divorced after 26-27 years of marriage and it took a few years, in which time we all were fighting and I couldn’t find a job. (This was 2013-2014) when they finally did divorce I was 18 and my father kicked me out with my mother, leaving me with no place to go.  My mother met a great guy (during trying to get a divorce from my father) who was trying to divorce his wife and they hit it off. I met him and he was honestly a very sweet man. When he heard my father had kicked me out, he let me come live with him and my mom.   During the short time I lived with them, he treated me really well and was the father I never had. My own father never wanted me and hated kids, so needless to say there wasn’t a lot of attention given to me that wasn’t already spent at work or on his computer playing various games.   This guy, Bob, was great. But he never divorced his wife and as time went on, my mom and I noticed suspicious behavior from him and suspected he was cheating. We caught him after my mother set up a fake personal profile that he responded to a meet up request with. Despite this, my mother stayed.  I ended up moving to a different state to find work and my mom remained with him and over the years has cried in my shoulder over his behavior; he cheats, keeps secrets, he puts his estranged wife and his previous kids above all of us. It has changed how I look at him as a significant other for my mother, but as a dad he was still.. well, my dad.  Until a few days ago, when he said he would be going out of town on a business trip that happened to fall over his estranged wife’s birthday. I made a snide comment about it and he responded with telling me to fuck off and said some hurtful things. My mother instantly took his side and wouldn’t listen to why I even made the snide comment in the first place, citing I shouldn’t have said anything in anger.  This was last Wednesday and today, things still aren’t good. Though I don’t regret what I said, I apologized to Bob. He never read it, I’m sure he had me on ignore or block and whereas half of me says whatever, the little girl who loved him is heartbroken that after ONE comment I made in hurt after nine years can make him angry enough to effectively disown me. I’m in disbelief this all went down the way it did.   TL;DR: I made a snide comment to my moms bf who constantly cheats on her but otherwise treats her and I well. This lead to fighting with my mom and I and when I apologized, I realized he never read it because he has ignored or blocked me. I’m hurt by both their responses.	1643168600.0	scwerk	/r/offmychest/comments/scwerk/i_started_ww3_with_my_family_with_a_snide_comment/	I started WW3 with my family with a snide comment
j0wzne7z	in the end of december I found out I was pregnant, it was a really difficult decision because my boyfriend really wanted me to have and I felt everybody near me wanted me to have it as well. I always thought I would make a fast decision if this ever happened in my life but I wasn't like that. I allowed myself the doubt but chose to do the abortion anyway. it was i painful process, where I live it is not legal but everything went ok. it was hard on the next day, my boyfriend was pretty messed up and started doing drugs again (after years being clean)... I was pretty messed up too and I guess I still am.  the thing is, after a week we started having sex again, first with condoms but after a few days we stop, it was maybe 3 or 4 times without condoms and cuming outside. anyway. I went to the doctor on Monday and she told me I should have got my period already but it ok if I didn't yet... today I started felling lots of cramps and it felt like a good sign, but it looked like the cramps from the beginning of my pregnancy and a white stuff came out of me just like when I got pregnant. I took the test yesterday and it was negative but I didn't felt relief or anything. I'm really worried and super sad. my boyfriend is traveling for work stuff and I don't wanna bother him with maybes and things in my head.

dx5k11sr	Unfortunately I can’t hate anyone, I’m incapable of not loving every singe person in my life with my whole heart, no matter how awful they treat me.  Never, not once in my life have I felt an unconditional kind of love, not even as a child with my parents. I was abandoned by them. Then I grew up to be used by every single person in my life. I’m no where near perfect but I will legit do the most for anyone in my life to try to make them happy. I will completely lose myself but here I am broken and empty with no one to do the same. I’m always there for everyone but when it comes down to it..there’s no one here for me.   I’m lonely but at the same time, I just don’t want anyone. I don’t want to be used anymore. I’m so tired of living in a world where I constantly give and give every single ounce of my soul but never receive anything. I’m so fucking sick of having such a big heart and all this empathy for other people. I wish I could turn cold like everyone else and be selfish but I just can’t and every single day I end up heart broken and let down by everyone.	1643169245.0	scwmeq	/r/offmychest/comments/scwmeq/i_hate_everyone_but_unfortunately_not_really/	I hate everyone but unfortunately not really
iajplrjw	Hi everyone. I just need to vent, so even if nobody reads this, it’ll feel good to finally say it all. (Also this is a throwaway account because I don’t anyone I know to know this is me lol). So first of all, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD a while back. I struggle a lot with motivating myself to do my every day life. For context, I’m 18 years old (she/they) and I’m currently going to college. I actually really enjoy most of my classes because I’m interested in the subject matter, but at the same time, I have to convince myself to get out of bed and go to class every day. And I’ve been losing that battle more and more lately. As always with new things in my life, I had a surge of energy/motivation during the beginning of my first semester and did awesome. I’m now at the beginning of my second semester and that’s all long gone. And I’ve got several more semesters to go. I’m not failing yet, but I’m scared that I’m headed in that direction if I don’t figure out a way to get motivated again soon. I also started a new job recently, so it doesn’t really help that I’ve added that to my schedule, but it’s obviously necessary because I need money. And I’m in a fairly new relationship that takes a toll on me sometimes. She also struggles with depression, and she tells me she wants me to keep messaging and reaching out, but then when I do, it feels like it’s against her will, and I don’t want that. I really, really like her, and I don’t want to end things at all, and she says she doesn’t want that either. I tried talking to her about it, but we didn’t really get anywhere. I don’t even know what I want from her, I understand not wanting to talk sometimes and I don’t want to pressure her, but she keeps telling me it’s okay and to keep reaching out. But I don’t want to feel like I’m the only one trying, you know? My college is having auditions for a musical soon. In high school, I was a massive theatre kid, and knowing I had rehearsal always got me through the days. So I thought maybe I could audition for that and it would help me be more motivated again. But I’ve also never been this busy before, and I’m afraid I’d just end up getting burnt out on the musical too. I honestly don’t even know anymore. I’m also severely homesick out of nowhere sometimes, but I guess that’s just a normal “new adult” thing. I’ve always been extremely close to my family and they are a huge part of me, so I am struggling a bit to find an identity outside of that. I was never the best at making friends, I’m kinda shy and awkward. This guy from one of my classes invited me to this LGBTQ+ group that meets weekly, but I’ve been either too busy or too nervous to go so far. I don’t know. I don’t have any kind of resolution for this, this is just kinda my life right now.	1643169322.0	scwn9d	/r/offmychest/comments/scwn9d/stressed_and_depressed/	Stressed and depressed
j130w4rb	So one of three things will happen in February: Either I die, ugly people die, or we all die. Because I'm not going to jail. there's no fucking way that's happening, not jail. If it comes to that I'll suicide. Fuck jail. I always promised myself I'd die by age 30 anyway and I'm 27 in the first place. I don't want to get old. I feel like this was always kind of going to happen. My 20s has been a decay towards realising there's no fucking way for me to change anything. I want to go out still being who I am. I don't want to abandon how much I fucking detest ugly people on a fundamental level and how much beauty means to me, I'll take that to the grave	1643169873.0	scwtq4	/r/offmychest/comments/scwtq4/at_this_point_im_just_gonna_do_what_i_have_to/	At this point I'm just gonna do what I have to
z2xoqch	Over the weekend I encountered a group of "patriots" protesting masks and vaccines while I was out walking with my son. I crossed the street to avoid them because frankly they are filthy plague rats. At the beginning of January I had to take 8 days off work because of an exposure causing a mandatory shutdown of daycare. Of course tuition was still due per their policy. My 1 year old son tested positive for COVID and was sick for a while but thankfully got better.  I was just finally at a point where I was getting caught up at work on everything I was falling behind on and we just got a other notice that daycare was exposed again. Per their policy tuition is due.  Another 8 days out of work.   There will be no end to this. I'm going to lose my job. Not for missing work because of COVID they will find another reason to fire me.  It's not even upsetting me that much. I can't seem to give a shit about anything these days. I'm behind on credit card bills. Most of the money I make is gone after pay day. My wife never seems to be able to take time off instead it's up to me. I'm the breadwinner and the stay at home dad.    Can't find a PCR test anywhere right now which is required for my son to go back to daycare. Needs to be tested on a Saturday per their five day rule so we will go down to the local walk in clinic at the crack of dawn and wait for hours hoping to get seen.   I can't stop thinking of those idiots protesting the vaccine. Putin and Xi Jinping thank you for your service. It's one thing to not be vaccinated and lie about it but to stand out there with pride waving your Gadsden Flag? Reasonable people are asking you to act like a grown up and you are out there throwing a temper tantrum. Shame! You should be locked up!  I want to see each and every one of you weeping in an orange jumpsuit broadcast on live television from the 5x9 cell with a metal toilet.	1643170334.0	scwz01	/r/offmychest/comments/scwz01/daycare_is_closed_again/	Daycare is closed again
f3xub4vf	My heart hurts so bad, I made a mistake because I couldn’t handle my alcohol and my now ex boyfriend couldn’t even bare me touching his hand/ hugging him when I told him what happened. I’ve never felt so rejected/abandoned and I wish he would’ve just given me another chance. He didn’t even seem interested in trying to understand.  I took responsibility for my actions and im done drinking alcohol because it has led to nothing but trouble. I know this is a lesson that had to happen but it fucking hurts so much that I hurt him and now i’ve lost him for good.  Im going to therapy and told some people about me not drinking anymore.  I just wish he would’ve just given me another chance.	1643170335.0	scwz0t	/r/offmychest/comments/scwz0t/losing_him_because_of_my_inability_to_handle/	losing him because of my inability to handle alcohol.

4ql4zi4q	This morning a guy she gave a blowjob to a month or two before we began seeing each other texted her to hangout and she sent me the text he said and joked that she will just send a pic of me and her if he texts again. Knowing guys, I knew he would text again and told her he would. She asks me what she should reply with and i say its up to you. She lives in a different city and the guy lives there too, we see each other on the weekends. We are students and im spending my day studying and focusing, we already said we love each other, i was her first sexual experience, i appreciate that she feels comfortable bringing this up but theres so many more important things in life than a past fling chasing her again. This evening she told me she got another text from him and wants to know what to do, like i couldnt care less what she says s long as she isnt flirting back and its platonic. If she cheats she could easily hide it because im not there and they talk on snapchat so its not something i think about but the fact that i try to talk to her about things relevant to the relationship and she changes it to what this dude is saying to her is really frustrating and pushing my buttons.   IF I EVEN ASK HER TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE SHE WILL QUIT UPDATING ME WHILE THE GUY KEEPS CHASING HER SO ITS A MISERABLE SITUATION	1643173052.0	scxt25	/r/offmychest/comments/scxt25/girlfriend_keeps_updating_me_on_the_guys_that_try/	Girlfriend keeps updating me on the guys that try to talk to her on snapchat

The year after I changed universities.  Now that I’ve gotten older I’ve been working out and im probably stronger than all of em, some nights i can’t sleep from the rage i feel for myself for letting these things happen to me.

6im79vq1	 Alright here it goes. I’m 35 years old. In my teens and 20s I was heavy into addiction.. diagnosed bi polar.. had a hard time with life.. but I got a lot better. I developed relationships.. I bought a house.. went back to school.. recently I’m just finishing a degree. I do have a lot going for me in many aspects of my life.   But my relationships have suffered over the years. Been single for 3 years at this point. I don’t blame my ex for leaving me.. at times I can be difficult to be around. My brother died 5 years ago and that set me back with mental health. So yeah I became single just before the pandemic hit. And yeah I’ve been isolated more and more since then.  What I find happens to me in recent years especially is that when I notice that someone in my life has bad intentions or they do something I consider a transgression on me.. sometimes I really overreact. I end up causing the person to get defensive and I lay it all out. Usually I end up banishing the person from my life. I also end up feeling bad about it.. then I play the events over and over in my head and it’s like a circle that comes around to the point that yeah this person is actually an asshole and it’s good that they are not in your life now but you didn’t have to tell them every thought you had about them and make a big scene about it.. why am I not smarter about these confrontations. Why can”t I be the bigger person and just make sure that I don’t put myself in a position where I depend on them in the future…  Cause that’s what I’ve noticed about this life.. when someone gets a chance to fuck you over.. if it’s to their benefit.. yeah a lot of people will take that opportunity.. and they don’t feel bad after.. if you confront those people with anger and hostility.. they thrive on it.. they know it’s getting under your skin… it’s a huge energy drain and basically I give them even more information about my vulnerabilities.  I might be a bit of a jerk sometimes.. but I would never fuck someone over.. I would never do something that harms someone for my benefit. At least not knowingly.  It happened to me again this month. I was working for a guy, racked up 4 grand in hours.. now he is avoiding me and trying not to pay me… so I should be thinking about resolving it in the civil courts… I’m upset but like it’s not the end of the world…   What do I do instead? I end up freaking out… making a big scene .. lose my temper… and you know what.. I’m still not getting paid.. buddy is not shook at all.. basically just wasting my energy…  I wish I could play my cards closer to the vest.. When someone shows you their true colours, that’s valuable information.. I should not be letting the anger direct my behaviour.. especially if I’m in the right. But once I run my mouth… I just feel wrong.  Also, pretty much guarantee the matter will not be resolved and one of these days it’s going to escalate too far. Thinking about getting some therapy. Any thoughts appreciated.	1643177055.0	scyz71	/r/offmychest/comments/scyz71/i_make_problems_bigger_than_they_need_to_be_and/	I make problems bigger than they need to be and then feel really low after.

rjznv	just feeling down and want to vent this out, I hope this is the right subreddit   It was my birthday yesterday, i got 2 happy birthday. I don’t celebrate my birthday so I normally don’t care. I guess I was hanging out with my entire mom side all day and felt bad nobody remembers including my parents .   I don’t really have a reason to be sad. I have a loving family, a good paying easy job lined up. I never really struggled in life.. my parents supported me and I pick things up easily.. I feel bad that I want to disappear and give up when others are struggling more than me.   I guess I been feeling isolated. I haven’t had a social life for last couple yesrs. I just got out of a job where I worked 14 hours on rotating shift work so I did nothing but work, lift my weights , and sleep. I finally quit , moved back with my parents , and started traveling  when I can . I planned to having  bigger plans but I’ve done nothing. I only been helping  with family busines. I am now responsible for taking care of my grandma so I’m scared to get Covid and give it to her.. so I only  lift weights when nobody is there or stay home or work in the back .   I look around to all my old friends and see everybody having move forward while I feel trapped and the same little insecure kid. I thought I got over some of  my insecurity  (mostly height) but it’s been worse seeing everybody settling down. Getting told by my family it’s time for me to find a nice lady, but I haven’t dated for years or had sex for years.   I wish I could disappear but I’m scared to make my parents sad …  I just want to start my next job and drown myself in being busy so I don’t have time to think..  reading this sounds whiny but oh well ..	1643177644.0	scz54p	/r/offmychest/comments/scz54p/just_feeling_down/	just feeling down
itlp0yxj	Im M23.  I have a family that cares about me but I honestly don't think I have ever cared about anyone.  The only way I can describe what I feel towards other people is "cold or nothingness".    I've always wondered why I am this way.  I have no trauma or unfortunate backstory so I am otherwise fortunate.  My genetics are very poor but then again I could have been born with a serious disability so I should only feel thankful when I look at myself in the mirror.  I've never had friends and will never have a romantic relationship for the aforementioned genetic reasons.  Despite this I don't feel sad or regretful.  Again, I feel nothing.  Is this what I'm destined to be?  To live a life where no-one knows I exist?    Not depressed just wanted to get opinions of you normal people.

But at every turn it feels like I’ll never find someone who wants them with me. Sometimes I consider being a single mother but I don’t know if I could provide a good home that way.

ghly4oia	To the usual-  I've had more time to think and look at our relationship. You abused me on an emotional level. I took a test and everything you've done to me fits the definition of abuse almost to a tee.  I was also thinking while talking about religion with a friend that you fit the seven deadly sins  - Lust: You and I both know your past. Let's not go there - Gluttony: I've seen you eat, enough said. - Greed: We've had fights over gifts and have avoided giving me gifts. - Sloth: You are hands down one of the laziest people I know. - Wrath: You are also the most vengeful. You resort to mental warfare as revenge. - Envy: You wished I could be like every woman you know's SO. Nothing I did was good enough and you wanted me to be more. - Pride: You did so much psychological damage to me and never apologized which leads me to assume that you feel like you did nothing wrong. Someone aptly explained it to me as someone who's punishing a student or a child.  Long story short- fuck you and my life's better without you. I pity the next poor bastard you manage to trick. Hopefully he's smarter than me.  Fuck you.	1643180177.0	scztk9	/r/offmychest/comments/scztk9/a_footnote_to_my_ex/	A footnote to my ex
c0s3t8tf	I hate my body and everyone tells me that it’s my fault for not being in shape. But I have tried for years and I found I just can’t do it. I can’t even walk from my dorm to my classes without collapsing by the door soon after I arrive and having to wait until I can stand up without passing out. My heart rate is consistently over 120 bpm and I feel pressure in my chest even when I am sitting at home doing nothing. when I stand up I have chest/lung pain and my heart starts racing even faster. I see stars and my vision goes black very often. I still jog twice a week (I can’t even finish a mile but I try anyway) because people will not stop pestering me about how I’m not putting enough effort in, and during the summer I would ride my bike over five miles every day  (over intervals, of course), even when I returned exhausted, wheezing, and coughing up blood. The frustrating thing is that I’m neither overweight nor extremely underweight, and I’m only eighteen years old. And it’s getting worse as time goes on. It depresses me to know how pathetic I am and that I’ll never be able to improve my body appearance. I am a closeted non-binary so this is extremely important to me. Okay I’m done typing I’m just gonna go internally cry myself to sleep now because I’m constantly fatigued and weak and I need to stay awake through my classes tomorrow so I can graduate, get a job, and get tf out. Side note: it has already occurred to me that I might have a medical issue and probably need to see a doctor, but I do not have the money to do so (was not allowed to get a job before college and don’t have time for it now because I am taking my courses at an accelerated rate) and will be in big trouble with my family if I get medical treatment behind their backs (they think I’m doing faking these symptoms for attention and don’t want me to waste money or maybe somehow they’re right and I just don’t realize I’ve exaggerated them in my mind to try to deny the fact that I’m lazy oh crap I’m spiraling again sorry). People have tried to give me many suggestions to work around these issues, but it is a very complicated situation that I obviously cannot explain fully, and most of them would not work for one reason or another. I promise I’m not that stupid.

8lpey8sz	I am in hs and there is this girl at my school who accused me of attempted sexual assault. This happened months ago and the situation has picked up a lot of speed lately and I truly believe that the only way for it to be resolved is with verbal communication between us. where ultimately there is a mutual recognition of the reality of our humanity, situations and forgiveness. there has not been any compassion (on a scale recognized largey) from either side, validation for either of our experiences.   In a lot of ways, how situation has been treated and how people feel about it is having a huge impact on the community. It had created a lot of division and many similar situations to my own have risen. One person is going through a strikingly similar experience to the one I went through earlier this year  (close friends and other people who listen to both sides, sided with me but also we’re mostly compassionate to the other but people who were moreso from the outside looking in were unreasonable and shook)    it seems impossible for this forgiveness to happen because dramas are being fed into by a lot of people and traumatic events like ones where you think you have or could of been sexually violated are brutal to experience. However division does not seem like the answer here.  I am mocked and shunned and judged negatively seemingly no matter what action, what words, what clothes I wear. Its like im on display. I tried just living with it and my other problems (adhd etc) and eventually I thought I was free from a societal judgment and all these other structures I despised in the past. However, while I actually found peace in not caring, I decided to start caring for the sake of others.

2wom090l	We’ve dated for 4 years, married for 1.  He’s had this dog for 5, coming to 6 years.   When we started dating, we went for spontaneous 2d1 night camps, 4d3n getaway trips to hike, watched movies and sometimes went out on weekends ourselves.   Somewhere along the line, things changed to we had to bring the dog everywhere. The number of places we were able to go to slowly became extremely limited because it had to have an outdoor area so the dog could come.  Trips we went on were limited too dog friendly places too, which was fine except when we brought the dog the dog didn’t wanna eat and sleep. It just kept going back to the car wanting to go home.   When I suggest going out without the dog for lunch or something - it somehow usually ends up in argument cause I’ve changed and no longer love the dog.   It’s also always been ‘his dog’. Until the dog needs grooming, a shower, his undercoat brushed out, nails cut, or anything along those lines of needs then suddenly it’s “our dog”.   I got pregnant and suggested we train the dog so that he doesn’t do a 100m mad dash whenever he wants to poop so we can walk him & pram. No, it’s the dog’s walk, he should enjoy it and do whatever he wants.   I’ll admit it, somewhere along the way after having a baby, a switch in me flipped. I no longer like this dog. I tolerate it, make sure he has food, n sometimes (but rarely) do chores like cut his nails or brush out his undercoat, but I crave just having a chill outing without him where we can go anywhere spontaneously without having to be concerned about having a dog with us.   My husband says I’ve changed and have become evil because the dog is family. But surely.. dog owners are allowed to go out without their dog once in awhile?	1643181993.0	sd0acd	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0acd/tired_of_my_husbands_obsession_with_his_dog/	Tired of my husband’s obsession with his dog.
j0781vgm	We had been together for close to 1 and a half years (me 19M and her 19F) but have been friends forever, and our relationship was perfect, especially for the 1st year or so.  She broke up with me about a month and a half ago. Looking back I can see why. Our relationship was not as fun anymore, and actually was more like a friendship.  I do believe that there is more to it though. The last month before we broke up we were constantly together, she never had space for herself and was feeling pressured. She is an introvert after all, and needs time to recharge and time alone.  What she didn't know is that I had discovered something on me, that had an over 50% chance of being cancer. I didn't tell anyone and for the 4 weeks I waited to get checked by a doctor, I tried to be with her as much as possible, because when I was left alone, it was too much for me, knowing that I might have cancer.  I actually got checked and all went well. She broke up about a week after that, saying that she doesn't think we match, and I'm certain that always being together when she is introverted played a major role in her decision.  I never told her, or anyone about this, as she gets extremely nervous and would honestly lose her mind if she knew before I got checked.  I backed off for about a month and reinitiated contact with her. We're talking every few days (both of us are reaching out) and we met once and it was pretty fun. I honestly want us to get back together. I just don't know what I should do, or even if I should ever mention the above.  Also let me point out that we had more problems as well, as all couples, but I believe they were miniscule, and actually wroked on fixing everything, while I spent some time with my self.	1643182402.0	sd0dza	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0dza/we_broke_up_but_there_is_something_she_didnt_know/	We broke up but there is something she didn't know
a195z6s0	No matter how good or wholesome or wonderful something is, someone will always be there trying to say something horrible or to bring you down. I try so hard to focus on the positive and uplifting people, but it’s so difficult and frustrating to accept that there are virtually no safe spaces from people being senselessly awful. I don’t understand how people can be hurtful so easily and not feel any guilt or remorse for the things they say.

9ecuvin	It took a couple tries but I think I finally feel real love. I went on 3 dates with a girl last month I thought we were falling in love but she didn't feel the same.   This "new" girl feels so different. She cares for my well being, she told me to text her when I got home because I walked home alone at night and she was worried. She then thanked me for texting her. She loves spending time with me, we spend hours together and she always responds to my texts right away. She listens to me and wants to make me happy, all I want is to make her the happiest person alive.  She is so different from the other girls, she makes me so happy.    I just really needed to put this out somewhere I have never felt like this in my life before.

I’ve hung out with her a few times outside of work, and her boyfriend even joined us for drinks.  When I was chatting with her boyfriend one on one, he said that any guy would be lucky to have me… that I’m “one of those girls”. I’d love for him to initiate his girlfriend to kiss me.

I tried to get the day off and my boss originally said I could have it off but decided to fire 2 people this week so he told me I had to come in.   My partner got sad and I apologized and he of course understood cause it’s work and life.   But yesterday we were laying down and I was on his phone looking for photos of his car to send to myself to edit for his car page. And he was laying next to me when all of a sudden he grabbed his phone from my to delete a photo. I’m pretty sure I saw the photos of a ring he had screen shoted before he gave me his phone back and nervously laughed it off. I pretended like I didn’t see anything since he got so nervous before we fell asleep.

They think I’m smart,cheery and kind person but I feel like a sad loser.I thought I’m strong enough to be independent and not need anyone else but I’m cracking. I wish someone was there to hold me tight and tell me that I’m doing alright. I’ve made all my teachers like me by topping classes and doing tasks for them but it’s not enough. They’ve praised me a lot but I still feel like I’m missing something. I think that is unconditional love.If everyone found out that I was broken I’d be completely alone again.I I feel like a fraud.

ga52n9lx	I have this online friend, we talked about our problems and supported each other when things went bad. We were both very lonely people when we met and helped each other through this.  I feel so regretful for how I’ve been lately. They sent me some messages a few days back about how they were feeling lonely and I didn’t respond. I don’t know why, I just didn’t have much energy the last few days and was feeling lonely myself. I feel so horrible that I ignored them, and now they’ve told me they don’t want to talk to me anymore.   Honestly, I’m more upset about this because I know they didn’t really have anyone to talk to in real life whereas I’ve made a few friends at college who I can talk to so I can survive mentally without our friendship, but I’m worried I’ve screwed up this person’s entire life by not being there when they needed me, and that they’ll fall back into a pit of depression because they don’t feel like they have anyone.

cjpb3p3p	In my personal life I still get a lot of shit about this so I'd assume this is still unpopular in the general masses.  I  rent a two bedroom apartment, and have the bare minimum. Why? Is it  because I don't like stuff? Is it because I don't like fun in life?  No,  it's none of these. It's because I value experiences more than material  things and often experiences - especially trips, hobbies, can be a lot  more expensive than buying things and you need a lot of money saved to  travel and have expensive outdoor hobbies.  I have one table, one bed, and one desk setup in an office in the second bedroom. For food, I shop for 2 weeks at a time.  Minimalism also helps with being able to move cities, meet new people, and experience new things in life.  People  see my life as a minimalist as going extreme but at the same time I  don't have debt, I don't have a car loan, and I don't have a ton of  money out in a credit card since my apartment isn't filled with a bunch  of stuff I don't really need.  Another  perk I've found is there's nothing that you can steal physically from  me if I don't have anything besides a desk, a table, a laptop and some  games lying around. All of which are easily replaceable. I've heard of  break-in's before in surrounding neighborhoods where people would have  their entire apartment or house cleared out, and you can't steal from  someone who doesn't keep a lot around.  I'm  also able to save up a lot of cash, invest a lot of money in stocks and  retirement as a minimalist. What I am really buying here is my freedom,  options, and that takes a lot of money to actually go out and purchase,  and it is far more valuable than anything physical I could buy.  Minimalism is not about suffering, it's about getting the most out of what life offers and the most expensive things to buy - freedom, options, flexibility, the ability to not need a job, are very expensive and the price tag is giving up all of my consumer purchases.	1643190134.0	sd28lk	/r/offmychest/comments/sd28lk/minimalism_is_not_missing_out_on_life/	Minimalism is not missing out on life
2yjgfchn	I'm (32f) sorta friends with my brother's (29m) girlfriend (26f), but she gets on my nerves sometimes. It boils down to: she's an anti-vaxxer who always thinks she's the authority on anything medicine related. Her mom is an antivaxx nurse, so she thinks that means she knows a lot as well on the topic of health even though she herself isn't in the field. I'll mention something health related and she'll immediately tell me I'm wrong. Most of the time I stay quiet but sometimes I disagree with her. The problem is my brother thinks I am arguing or being disrespectful when I say I disagree with her, and he will get angry at me. I do get annoyed at her personality, but the problem is my brother will watch me and growl at me and tell me to calm down if I express any little frustration. (I don't get crazy or explosive). I feel me and his girlfriend are two adults and we can respectfully disagree with each other, but he feels the need to get angry and intimidate me on her behalf. He's also 2x my weight and a male. One time my brother and I did get into a disagreement and we weren't talking, every time I'd peacefully walk by the two of them he'd make an exaggerated motion and act like he was shielding her from me. He has gotten in my face and has explosively yelled at me before for other reasons. I honestly think he would fight me for her, if me and her ever truly got into an argument. I'm forced to interact with them due to my living situation with my mom, who watches their children all the time. They live next door. I just wish I can get my own space and never have to interact with them again. He thinks he's in the right and I wish he'd see that it's 2-on-1 and this is bullying behaviour.	1643190600.0	sd2cax	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2cax/my_brother_bullies_me/	My brother bullies me

8kvwrh8o	I've been working for the same company for 4 years, made a few promotions and got more and more responsibilities over the past few years. I'm ambitious and i love taking charge and creating processes to make things go smoother, easier and faster, but i'm hitting a fork in the road  This past year was crazy. Someone significant left my team, and i basically took over half of their job on top of my own responsibilities. I created documents and onboardings to make it easier for the new hires that were supposed to replace them to get acquainted with the work. It's been 8 months, and i am still doing this other person's job and people are not taking their own responsibilities.   I'm getting more and more frustrated. I had so many calls explaining things, even made tutorials for people where i explain step by step what to do and why. They skip steps, mess up the files, ask me questions that are a quick google search away  I'm getting so unmotivated, work just feels like a drag at this point	1643191436.0	sd2k82	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2k82/my_job_makes_me_feel_like_im_pulling_on_a_dead/	My job makes me feel like i'm pulling on a dead horse
alo2n57e	A recruiter from a company I'd rather not name reached out to me via LinkedIn, as apparently they have a job opening and I'd be "a good fit for the role." I looked into the job description and was interested in the company and the job itself.  After some back-and-forth via email, she scheduled a phone interview (it wasn't set at a specific time, just "in the afternoon" but I didn't mind because I was available during the afternoon). No call. At 6pm, I shot her an email asking what happened, and then she replied that she was just about to message me to tell me we had to reschedule. I agreed and I was advised to keep my lines open the next day.  And so we did. Now it's 6pm again and I never received a call. Frankly I'm a bit insulted at this point. I have a lot of anxiety so interviews such as this have me on my toes until it's over. So I had to deal with my damn nerves over nothing.   Anyway, part of me is torn as to whether I should email her to ask what happened this time, as honestly I really am interested in the role. I have a job now, but I've been looking for new and better opportunities lately so I'd thought this could me my shot. At the same time I want to just move on but let the recruiter know that what she did was a bit unprofessional, keeping me hanging and postponing our call without any word beforehand.

rg5ix37	I'll start off by saying this might be super ignorant as Im not at all involved in politics and how shit runs.   So the virus hits hard, lockdowns and restrictions follow (on and off). I don't understand why huge companies are being compensated with our tax money so they can survive this pandemic (I sure as fuck don't pay taxes to help huge international chains such as Hotels). For example these Hotels, 95% of the staff is now put on short time work so they work less/earn less (less guests, less work I know). Those who were unlucky enough for their contracts to run out during the pandemic simply weren't offered a new one. Good luck finding a job as a Waitress or Cook now. But I thought we are paying these big fuck chains money so that they keep employees so we don't flood our country with a bunch of unemployed citizens.  During this time costs have gone up, yet we have citizens that have been in short time work for 2 years already. With no compensation to help them. Lets say they wanna move apartments now so they can save some costs since they are earning less, moving cost money. Money they don't have at the moment. It costs money to save money sometimes.  Another thing pissing me off is we have a mask mandate (I AM TOTALLY FOR THAT) but no matter what you earn you gotta buy them yourself. The amount of times i've had strangers ask me for a mask so they can enter the Train station is sickening, not because I don't want to help but because it shouldn't come to that.

9jmnxpa6	I don’t really know why I’m writing this, I think I just need to write it down as for once I can’t talk to anyone in my life about it.   My girlfriend and I have been together just a few months, but we’ve been friends much longer. We both come with plenty of emotional baggage, as most people do. So far our relationship has been nothing but loving. She is 10 years older than me and has very low chances of getting pregnant naturally. But it happened just 5 months into our relationship. Last week she went to the hospital for a scan, and told me everything was fine and she just had to wait for the results. A week later she tells me that she is 10 weeks pregnant and that she isn’t keeping the baby.   We spoke a bit, I felt overwhelmed. She said that she needed to process it on her own and had been running through all the possibilities in her head all week . I understand and respect that the decision is ultimately hers alone. But I am really struggling with the fact that at no point did she ask me if I thought she had made the right choice, or what I would have wanted. For what it’s worth I think it is the right decision, as much as it breaks my heart. If we were years down the line it would be magical, but we’re not and it’s gut wrenching.   I just wish she would have told me at the time and we could have talked about it and came to this conclusion together. I would never have tried to tell her what to do. And I don’t understand how she has spent the past week sitting and sleeping next to me like everything is normal while I am clueless to the fact she is pregnant with my child.   I don’t feel angry, just hurt and alone. As I say, I know it is her choice. But I just want to feel like I was part of it, like my feelings matter too. I am scared that I can’t trust someone who could keep this from me so easily.   I don’t know what I expect from this, guess I just want to feel like I’ve told someone.	1643200806.0	sd51q8	/r/offmychest/comments/sd51q8/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_pregnant_a_week/	My girlfriend told me she was pregnant a week after she found out, and that she’s not keeping the baby.

8vl7ijmd	It's a long story but to keep it short my mom is a super toxic person, half of the house is under her name and she locked the doors to 1st level of the house as she claims it's hers. Her hobbies is to make me and my sister(16) stressed also  she is an overly religious person.  I'm scared of what she will do, I feel she will try to sue my dad and I don't know what is that about. I think she will try to kick my dad out of the house and make his life a mess with some accusations.   She once wiretapped the whole house and doesn't care about us at all, claiming that we abandoned her. The truth is she was stressing me so much with her behaviour that I was unable to go to the kitchen and grab food when I was at home. It's been a month and I wish I could see my dad and sister but I can't stand the stress of seeing my mom. I also don't pick up phone from her as she never calls because she is interested with me, she only calls to stress me and talk how bad and ungrateful I am, recently she called me toxic too.   I have 2 degrees (almost 3) and never in my life did anything wrong yet she never supported me or said she is proud. For 5 years of my university, I was returning home each weekend to help with the house, move the lawn etc.    As a kid when I was stressing if people will like me, she responded with ' why anyone would like you'.   I'm also lucky to have some savings and I hope to start working as an engineer soon so it should get better at some point.   If she will continue with her behaviour I'm considering moving abroad and/or never speak to her again unless she understands how much damage she made.   I'm sorry if the text looks like a mess but I can't stop crying.	1643204172.0	sd64md	/r/offmychest/comments/sd64md/i_have_enough/	I have enough
9o3wmsea	Im 19 and right now I’m struggling, a lot of things have been thrown my way. I have tried my hardest at every turn and have made changes in my life that I thought were impossible. I’m in a head space thats convoluted, I try to filter myself with positivity and keep my head held high and walk straight. Though a lot of the time I’m alone and thats the heaviest part.  Its like weight that burdens and curls the shoulders. Though I’m probably writing this out of just an episode to be fair. It’s both in its own way a gift and a burden, I have freedom and yet at the same time it feels like I have none.    It fills me with strength sometimes, though can be just as equally draining. I’m working to not just cope with this but hopefully at some point adapt to it.	1643206388.0	sd6vxp	/r/offmychest/comments/sd6vxp/trying_to_make_an_effort/	Trying to make an effort
cqjgl3q7	She did everything in her hand to ruin me and my fiancée’s relationship, because she was against christian marriage. 3 years later and she is marrying one of my best friends.   Never have I had this much hate against a person, and it scares me.	1643208469.0	sd7miq	/r/offmychest/comments/sd7miq/fiancées_sister_ruined_our_relationship/	Fiancée’s sister ruined our relationship.
h229l4dq	I tried so hard to be calm, reasonable and diplomatic about this. I tried SO hard. I really and truly did.  I said it exactly like this: "I'm deeply concerned about the amount of money we have been spending on weed, and I feel we really need to cut back. I went through the numbers and I was very alarmed. In the span of three weeks, we spent almost 500$ at the dispensary."  We're not in good financial straits right now and are really, really struggling, FYI. Also, I am pregnant and have not been using myself. Today I wanted to buy some strawberries and he got upset and objected because it was 11$ for a box, because, apparently we don't have the money right now.  As I was afraid he would, he got really, really defensive and upset. "Yeah, about 130$ a week, that's my normal. I've been cutting back! I cut out a whole bunch of other things! I don't drink or smoke cigarettes! Now you're telling me I need to cut back on the one thing I enjoy doing?"  Then: "It's in the past! There's nothing we can do! Just forget about it!"  I immediately backed down and apologized and said I shouldn't have said anything, because, clearly, it was a bad idea. I said I was not trying to criticize or attack him in any way, and I'm really not. I know he enjoys weed and I am not trying to take that away from him.  I just want to cry. I feel so bad now for saying anything. Every time I try to talk about something I'm upset or worried about, he just gets really upset with me it seems.  ...I don't understand what I do so wrong. I'm trying so, so hard...  How do I always screw this up so badly?	1643210302.0	sd8b35	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8b35/i_tried_to_express_my_concerns_to_my_partner/	I tried to express my concerns to my partner about the amount of money he has been spending on weed.

c204w	My dad doesn't go out, he suffers from terrible mental health issues and has done so for pretty much my whole life. He has his flaws, and hasn't really been the world's greatest dad because of his problems, but he was the one who raised me and we will always have a special bond.   He randomly called me on the weekend and said "listen, I was thinking, what if I come and stay for a weekend. Maybe we can go for a few nice walks and catch up."  I could've died on the spot! Before covid my dad would maybe come and see me once every 4 or 5 months, but he has never wanted to stay. This is so great!	1643210593.0	sd8f6b	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8f6b/my_dad_is_coming_to_stay/	My dad is coming to stay!
22u7f06v	My gf(f) of 7 years requested a break for two weeks. I(also f) personally just can’t focus I have such bad anxiety and I’m worried about this. I thought about texting her and asking if I’ve even crossed her mind because if I haven’t then why pro long something that’s just gonna end. I just don’t think it’s normal to be okay with not talking to someone you’ve loved for so long for that long.	1643210653.0	sd8fzk	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8fzk/thinking_of_texting_my_gf_after_she_requested_a/	Thinking of texting my gf after she requested a break.
8e7x5z4n	 So, okay. I've known this girl for a while through a mutual friend and we went to a party back in December together. Mind you we're seniors in high school and we're both 18. We were talking a flirting for a while until I kind of fucked her over, and used her to get with another girl. Ever since then things have been kind of awkward between us, and she has a boyfriend. He's like not very attractive and his personality is not it at all. I don't like the guy but I befriended him. My plan is to hack into his Instagram account say some out of pocket shit, do some out of pocket shit, get her to dislike him, fuck her over through his Instagram account and watch him deny everything. Knowing her she'll think he's a liar and drop him. Now, I know. I feel so guilty doing this but I won't stop. All throughout high school i've taken highly advanced IT classes, Social Media Security classes and multiple Cybersecurity and backdoor coding classes. I figured out a way to hack into his account but I haven't done it yet. I'm sure it will work. I really like her. I'm not sure if I'll be sorry.	1643211607.0	sd8svw	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8svw/i_hacked_into_a_guys_instagram_account_i_plan_on/	I hacked into a guy's Instagram account.

iwterval	You were a bully, manipulator, and just an all around Karen to me and my friend, and for what? For literally NOTHING.   You did all that shit to be the star of the show and congrats, you got what you so desperately needed; that validation that you’re the “best dancer”. But oh wait, wasn’t the season, CANCELLED DUE TO COVID??? It’s almost like… you played yourself… because in the end… your team was never able to compete at championships with your ego solo… and you never had to stoop to middle school drama and show how ugly and selfish you are.

5w0cvdp4	But for now I’m stuck on a lease with him. We’ve dated on and off for 8 years. High school sweeties. Lots of trauma and ups and downs together. He knows I plan to leave him in 6 months once our lease is up. He probably knows who I’m leaving him for. He’s trying so hard to be good to me and change my mind. It makes me feel horrible and is so confusing. The problem is that I’m in love with this other person, I have been for 3 years. Truth be I need to do this for myself. I can’t wait to leave and start over in a new state with my favorite person. I’ve tried so many times to fully emancipate myself from this toxic relationship. The person who I plan to be with is my soulmate. We both have a ton of inner work to do but he is my person and I plan to be with him within a year. It is so painful to be stuck in this facade for the time being. I know that I’m a bad person.	1643212968.0	sd9b7s	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9b7s/im_finally_leaving_him_for_goodsoonish/	I’m finally leaving him for good..soonish
6m51y620	lately I’ve been painting, sewing, reading, playing video games, working out, and baking, and whenever there’s an opportunity to go out I just go for it. I feel like I’m just trying procrastinate my own suicide. I feel like the next moment I have time to think about my life, I’ll just break down and go to self harm. I went through some hard stuff last month and all I’ve been thinking about is my self worth. I don’t really know anymore if I’m worth to stay. I want to say I’m doing better because I’m able to do so much stuff, but I don’t know how long I can stay like this. school’s about to start again and a part of me feels happy that I’ll get something I can preoccupy myself with.	1643214266.0	sd9t71	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9t71/ive_been_trying_so_hard_to_keep_myself_busy_so_i/	I’ve been trying so hard to keep myself busy so I won’t think about killing myself so much
