i7lavsor	As a citizen of a country part of NATO:  • ⁠Western media does not talk about the fact that most of the population in Crimea identify as russians. They dont talk about the fact that most of the people living there were and are pro-russian. Anyway, ofc, the way Russia claimed Crimea is fairly subject to criticism. But would Ukraine ever give up Crimea freely through election? I dont think so. Crimea also happen to be a strategically important area with important natural resources… So yeah, that adds to the motivation from the russian side - which is obviously not what the russian media talks about - they focus about the right of self-identification and that people in Crimea are pro-russian…  • ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia is an underdog against NATO. And noone talks about the fact that it is unpleasant for Russia to have next door neighbours being part of NATO, including delivery and placing of military missiles at the border to Russia - not far from Moscow.  • ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia feels treathened by the geopolitical development and pro-US and pro-NATO european development.  … Yes, Russia can be critizised. But so can the US. How did the US react to USSR missiles being placed on Cuba? The US would go batshit if Russia attempted the same that the US is attempting with Ukraine…  …Anyway… In the end, this is about Ukraine… Not Russia, not the US… The US is not protecting Ukraine because they are being nice. They protect Ukraine because it is strategically smart and beneficial. This is a story not told by the western media… Russia, on the other hand, are protecting their own interests in not being military treathened at their border in case of conflict… In their fear, they treathen by allocating troops to the border to Ukraine - not because they want to invade, nor because they want war - but because they want to scare Ukraine from allowing the US to gain strategical territory…  The overall situation is super complicated… And there is a lot of propaganda and wrongdoing on both sides… The majority of russians are biased in direction of hating the west. While the west is biased towards hating Russia. The truth lies in the middle, and up - not in between… And the people who should be mad are all the countries and people affected by the geopolitical dick measuring contest by the US and Russia.  What are your thoughts on my perspective?       __Edit: Thank you all for very constructive comments, interesting facts, thoughts, opinions and so on. Please keep them coming!__        __Edit: adding these answers that I got from someone in r/nato (for an alternative perspective and balanced discussion):__  • ⁠Western media does not talk about the fact that most of the population in Crimea identify as russians  In fact 60% are of russian ethnicity. Ethnicity does not say anything about their political belief or what country they want to belong to. The referendum in 2014 was according to every non-russian media highly irregular, so that's not an argument for anything.   • ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia is an underdog against NATO. And noone talks about the fact that it is unpleasant for Russia to have next door neighbours being part of NATO, including delivery and placing of military missiles at the border to Russia - not far from Moscow.  Russia is one of the strongest nuclear powers and the aggressor as well. To use your words: the fact that it is unpleasant for europe to have a next door neighbor stationing thousands of troops near their borders, including delivery and placing of military missiles in kaliningrad - not far from vilnius, riga, warsaw, berlin and helsinki. The very existence of NATO is because of russias aggression.   ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia feels treathened by the geopolitical development and pro-US and pro-NATO european development.  This is naturally a minor concern, when in fact our allies feel threatened by russia who constantly violate european airspace, kill people on the open street in berlin and poison people in salisbury. Who are dedicated to their misinformation program for over 6 years now. Who attack a neighbor every 6-8 years since 1999.   … Yes, Russia can be critizised. But so can the US. How did the US react to USSR missiles being placed on Cuba? The US would go batshit if Russia attempted the same that the US is attempting with Ukraine…  Whataboutism and ancient history. Why am i even reacting to that. Cant be taken seriously.   Anyway… In the end, this is about Ukraine… Not Russia, not the US… The US is not protecting Ukraine because they are being nice. They protect Ukraine because it is strategically smart and beneficial.  This is about europe. The US is an ally and has an interest of not having a major war in europe while china is building naval bases close to their ally japan. Mentioning the US at all smells like whataboutism, especially if you take into account the way not only trump but also biden is playing is foreign policy cards.   The overall situation is super complicated… And there is a lot of propaganda and wrongdoing on both sides…  The situation is not overly complicated compared to other issues of our day and age. Ukraine is a sovereign country. Russia has troops inside it's territory since 2014. Russia annexed a large part of the country in 2014. It also now has more than 100.000 troops at their borders, plain to see for everyone. This is a threat to europe. In europe there is an alliance that was founded because of this exact problem. And putin is playing the victim card, while NATO is doing exactly what it's supposed to and what it said it would do.	1642701834.0	s8ozot	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/	My take as a person from a NATO country… What do you Russians think about my perspective?
akit2qs4	I don't understand.  These stories sound made up when you look into them.  So I don't get why it got so many upvotes on the Georgian subreddit.  I don't even know why Vera Putina has a wikipedia article.  What's even stranger is how upset Georgians get when people point out they look middle eastern or if someone says they're not European.  Even worse if someone mentions the Bagratuni dynasty.  Is ultra nationalism common among the former soviet republics?	1642742322.0	s934sn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s934sn/why_do_georgians_say_stuff_like_peter_the_great/	Why do Georgians say stuff like "Peter the Great was Georgian", "Vladimir Putin is Georgian"?

cz3m2wwe	I recently moved to Moscow from California. Most of my Russian friends live in Moscow the friend in question lives in St.Petersburg and they have  been inviting me to visit with them since I got here.   I finally spent some time with them the other day however I booked a hotel while there instead of staying at their house (they have a guest room) the issue for me was I didn't know if I would be extending my stay so I didn't want to impose on them if I chose to do so according to them I could've stayed as long as I wanted, but I know that sometimes people say that when they don't really mean it ( I told them this after the fact, see below which seemed to only dig a deeper hole for myself)  however they were mostly the reason for my visit aside from some mild site seeing. They seemed really distant and a little weird on the visit.   When I went back to Moscow they called to tell me that I really offended them by declining to stay at their home, even asking if there was some hidden meaning behind it.   Now I know that some people back home in the U.S. can be offend by things like this but I only ever ran into this issue with my Russian friends. This has happened a few times with others, once when a friend invited me to meet with them at their home and I opted for us to go to a cafe instead.  It seems to bother them a little more than it does my friends back home in the States.   I wanna note that I'm not doing it out of any negative place, I'm from California we always find an excuse to go out and as for the staying over at peoples house I just didn't want to impose on them.   If my behaviour is really something that is seen as weird here then, I don't mind compromising as not to offend my friends.  You know as they say when in Rome.  I also wanna say that I did go to their home and spent significant amount time there just that I didn't stay there.  So in the end is this a Russian thing or just a my friend thing?	1642776283.0	s9cb51	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9cb51/russian_friend_upset_i_stayed_at_a_hotel_instead/	Russian friend upset I stayed at a hotel instead of at their home was I in the wrong?
3l8keyzz	Here's the situation: my parents were both born in the USSR (Russia), later moved to Germany, where I was born. My mother still has her Russian citizenship, my father had to give his away at some point. Now he wants to get it back, however. My question would be if it would be possible for me to get a citizenship as well if both my parents have one.

yzuvh	Something  I've  noticed  when following some  NATO  hardware  advances  is  that  how quickly they're developed especially since Poland has been cranking out some  nifty technologies for NATO like the  pl-01,and the  Fb  beryl, while the Italians  have their centauro  tank destroyer design,and  Germany with their leopard tanks. How confident are you in Russia's  current military hardware which from my perspective is decades behind European hardware since most Russian tanks have autoloaders which means most  NATO  armor operators are going to aim for the ammunition storage in the turret basket, subjectively  speaking the Europeans  have the cooler and better toys than the Kremlin  which is why the  US  wouldn't necessarily need to get  involved if  Russia invaded Europe because even the  US is  behind  NATO itself  in  some aspects of hardware development  essentially the Europeans are more than capable of handling the  Russian military. How confident are you in Russia's  military hardware  especially when  its age  starts to show in comparison to  NATO hardware?	1642789120.0	s9h5sw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9h5sw/how_confident_are_you_in_russias_current_military/	How confident are you in russia's current military hardware to match NATO technologies?
55qohj7e	For the past couple months I have been actively searching on the possibility of being able to move to Russia and have asked for help/advice on here previously. (Thank you to everyone on here being honest & helpful with my past posts).  I was in the US Military for a while and would enjoy it again but in the RU military and I came across this online:   “The Russian Armed Forces accepts foreigners of any country to their ranks. Under a plan, posted on the ministry's web site in 2010, foreigners without dual citizenship are able to sign up for five-year contracts – and are eligible for Russian citizenship after serving three years. According to the amended law, a citizen of any foreign country aged 18–30 with a good command of Russian and a clean record can sign an initial five-year contract to join the Army.”   I was wondering how accurate that is as of this year and if that is possible! If anyone present or past Russian military service could answer or anyone who is knowledgeable on the subject.

q2eoay7	So I've come across this band on YouTube. It's called Kino and the lead singer, Victor tsoi was a really interesting character too, I'm not a massive fan of rock but there is something I just can't explain about his music, there are many millions of views of his music in YouTube now I wonder if he will go viral because I know if people here knew about him it would be massive. His music is absolutely amazing and legendary. I can't understand anything he says (can't speak Russian) but I love it, and it's making me want to learn.   My question is   How popular is kino now in russia?  bars, clubs still play his music?  Also side question do you know about any other bands that are similar, same style? Would love to know.

1oph0ajc	So I (25F-ethnically Persian) recently moved to Moscow for my master’s degree, and although i’m not new to the dating scene, I’ve been facing difficulty with dating in Russia. Important notes are that I don’t speak any Russian. So far I’ve been using Bumble and Tinder (but mostly Bumble). I’m average looking, and noticeably fit.  Generally, my difficulty has been that conversations fade out. Personally, I try to be engaging, and I’m an expressive person in general. I’ve matched with a lot of people with whom I have things in common, yet conversations have gone nowhere.   So this made me wonder. What is the average sentiment on dating immigrants? & what is the sentiment on dating people who don’t speak your language? Is there something I should be wary about? Some etiquettes I should follow? Cause there are bold cultural differences between where I’m from and Russia, and I’m starting to think maybe i’m doing something wrong!	1642961219.0	sazovb	/r/AskARussian/comments/sazovb/problems_dating_in_russia/	Problems dating in Russia
ah1vew4g	Hi, I'm from Greece and the media and most people here have good feelings for Russia and Russian people. Russia is always portrayed as a brotherly country.  After spending some time on this subreddit, I read on posts that Europe has treated and still treats Russian people in a bad way, for example the ones living in European countries now. Can you say more examples? Because honestly I want to know more sides of this, since I always thought that, because Greece thinks of Russia in a good way, it would be the same in the rest of Europe as well for some reason, it was just an impression I hadn't thought much about. (I don't put the whole of Europe in the same category, I just wanted to include all European countries.)

gizu5o34	Hey everyone - I am planning a trip to Russia to visit my grandma this summer. I was born in Moscow, but have lived in the US my whole life. That being said, I still speak, read, and write in Russian fluently at a college level. I haven't been back to visit since I was in my late teens. Mostly because of being scared that I would get drafted since I am a dual citizen. My grandma is getting old and I really want to go visit her, but I was just on the US Travel Advisory website and the warning is at a level 4. AKA avoid all travel to Russia. [Here is the link](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html). Obviously, there is the huge issue of a potential war in Ukraine, but has anyone traveled to the US from Russia recently? If so, what was that experience like? If you're in Russia, do you think it's safe to travel there right now coming from America?   TL;DR: I really want to go see my grandma in Russia and am not sure if it's safe to do so given the current political climate.	1643008827.0	sbgay6	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbgay6/travel_to_russia_from_america/	Travel to Russia from America

1zviqa	Seems that they simply chose to surrender to local nationalisms and simply move to Russia, instead of grouping themselves into strong organizations both demographically and territorially in order to preserve their rights in those countries and maybe even link up with Russia.  Kazahstan - In 1992 Russian population was **equal** to Kazakh, and comprised most of the country's intellectual elite. How they simply gave in to Kazakhisation and dropped down to a minority of 18% is beyond me.  Estonia and Latvia - Russians made up 1/3 of population in those tiny countries, part of which was territorially grouped (and in Estonia's case, linked with Russian border) yet they allowed all the de-russification policies since then, instead of becoming important factors in those countries.  Ukraine - situation for Russians was much better than today percentage-wise, yet nearly half of ethnic Russians actually voted for independence!	1644017008.0	skrnkx	/r/AskARussian/comments/skrnkx/why_were_ethnic_russians_in_postsoviet_republics/	Why were ethnic Russians in post-Soviet republics so passive in 1992 and later, even though they made huge chunsk of population?

I have seen all manner of people lie their asses off to get in and once they are in basic training, it shows. At least two guys I met were self-admitted felons who frankly should have been in prison.  What about the Russian Army?
