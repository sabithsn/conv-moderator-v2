z9bon	Hi, I'm not russian, and I was reading somewhere that russians, especially university students in big cities, usually take noopept as a supplement to help with their studies.  &#x200B;  I was wondering if this is true, and if you have taken / have any friends that are taking it, or if it's true that up to 50% of students take it.	1642631247.0	s82gx9	/r/russia/comments/s82gx9/hi_question_about_noopept_use_in_russia/	Hi, question about noopept use in Russia

India is unfortunately unaware and leaning west. What would be something we can do to counter this propaganda?
q2eoay7	A decent post was just posted here from a German, that I had very similar feelings about.   He was talking about his media and his countries relations with yourselves and as a Brit I feel exactly the same and just embarrassed really.   The media is absolutely terrible here too, it's mostly anti Russia propaganda, But I hope you know there's more brits like me who know it's bullshit, and feel the same, and don't want to go war with Russia, or you guys at all.   The media just make the most noise but they don't speak for the real people here.( Yes there's alot of brainwashed who follow the media without question) , but luckily at the moment they are not the majority!   Obviously we do support NATO in a sense, but that doesn't mean they are right in what they are doing regarding your country at the moment.   I've asked everyone I know, family, friends, strangers there is alot of conversation about it here.   I can tell you - we are embarrassed about recent actions by NATO. We think they should leave neighbouring countries to Russia the fuck alone. And certainly stay out of it. Its absolutely right to criticise NATO for their expansionist policies in the last years.   We can't even defend our own border from rubber dinghies, yet we send anti tank missile launchers to Ukraine????   the number of people waking upto this shit is only growing though.   It saddens me because Russia and UK have alot of shared history, and I'd love for our countries to go back to better relations.   Our allegiances helped to finally defeat Napoleon and later Hitler. Outside of conflict, across the centuries we shared technology, medicine and culture. During the 18th Century Russia and Britain were deeply tied. Between 1704 to 1854, from age of Peter the Great through Catherine the Great and well into the 19th Century the British were to be found as admirals, generals, surgeons, and architects at the highest level of the Russian Court. The father of the Russian Navy ‚Äì one Samuel Greig ‚Äì was born in Inverkeithing in Fife.  I also like Ukrainian people and you guys also have shared history. This is all a shame and a complete mess now. It's not Russian citizen's fault, UK citizen's fault, or Ukraine citizen's fault.   I hope there is no conflict, and I know Putin is not a Saint, I'm not saying I support him or not. But I look at facts and actions only.   And from what I've seen, and I've followed it very closely - Putin has tried all he can to avoid it through fair diplomatic means. This has been going on for years now, And it just hasn't worked, but its not actually his fault though. It is NATO, US, just completely unreasonable, at EVERY TURN.   Not even willing to go halfway or anything, so what is he expected to do? His duty is with his civilization first. (And that's something everyone I speak to here in England respects about him by the way) = at least he seems to put his country first. Like all REAL leaders should do.  Did USA let cuba build missiles there ? No Lol.   Absolute joke!   So yeah just wanna say cheers from the UK. Don't worry about our media here, because most of us see through the war mongering sensationalist bullshit!	1642978658.0	sb6hf8	/r/russia/comments/sb6hf8/also_sick_about_ukrussia_relation/	Also Sick about UK/Russia relation

rr1ry	Hello!  To preface, I'm an antique buyer who is interested in warship items.  I've  been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I  stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through  Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like  Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to  Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I  can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.

h42vuo95	With all due respect I would like to let you know that I joined this group in January this year. Just a week after creating my Reddit account. I made a post or two describing something or someplace of your country I love. But recently for the last few days I have been pelted with literally a Katyusha barrage of hate speech on my DMs. I got people calling me "weak" and "pathetic" whenever they ask me my nationality and I say "German". On behalf of all those fellow Germans or Europeans like me who are feeling ashamed of yourself in the face of an impending war I would like to devote my note of confession. First of all I would like to introduce myself. The name is Marko Graovak and I come from Tuskanac near Zagreb in Croatia üá≠üá∑. For the last three years I have been studying International Relations at Freie Universitaat Berlin and working a part time job in Germany üá©üá™. For the last few weeks we are hearing NATO ‚ûï and especially America üá∫üá∏ screaming at Russia üá∑üá∫ to keep their hands off Ukraine üá∫üá¶ because Washington DC thinks that a war is approaching. Various countries in the European Union notably France üá´üá∑, Poland üáµüá±, Estonia üá™üá™, Denmark üá©üá∞ and Turkey üáπüá∑ have expressed support and are giving everything they can to help Ukrainians fight back against a Russian invasion. The problem however comes with Germany üá©üá™.  Germans seem quite reluctant to fight a war that involves the USA üá∫üá∏ and Russia üá∑üá∫. However this country is doing everything it can to make sure a major war does not actually break out. The Americans and the French have been sending tons of military aid in the form of small scale weapons (assault rifles, bazookas and pistols) and mini explosives (eg grenades). Moreover they have massed all their jets on strategic airports in Ukraine üá∫üá¶. Almost all countries in Europe are providing some support or the other. But Germany üá©üá™ is the one to be insulted the most. The cause? The Federal Republic has the biggest economy in the European Union üá™üá∫ but is helping Ukrainians with nothing more than helmets and hospitals. This beautiful little country is accused of cowardice and even "encouraging Russians". My fellow Germans are being branded as "traitors" (because of reluctance to fight) and "greedy" (because of purchasing Russian gas). But these Internet Gladiators on major social media like Twitter and Reddit are expressing as much hate speech as they can and as much as they can. They do not seem to actually care about the trauma Germany üá©üá™ and the other somewhat neutral countries (including Croatia üá≠üá∑) are going through these days.  The problem lies somewhere else. Fighting two World Wars in 1914 and 1939 have tarnished the reputation of one of the oldest countries of the world. Germany üá©üá™ is pained but Croatia üá≠üá∑ is no less either. Germans are branded as "Nazis" whenever they try to be patriotic. And us Croats are always getting labelled as "Ustase". When Berlin refused to send guns and ammo to help Kiev my fellow Germans are being accused of another "Molotov Ribbentrop Pact" to tear Europe üá™üá∫ apart. In the Balkans my fellow Croats are recently accused of another "Pavelic Stoyadinovic Pact". Let me tell you the truth. Whatever happened from 1932 to 1990 has left our nations frustrated. Nazism until 1945 and Communism until 1990 have left us distrustful towards the outside world. We Europeans are always finding ourselves in the middle of two Great Powers wrestling each other to gain "spheres of influence". On social media the American trolls want to defeat and if possible exterminate Russia üá∑üá∫ as a whole. The Russian trolls on the other hand have set their sights to create a new Soviet Union and if possible destroy America üá∫üá∏ and subject the entire Western civilization under their Orthodox Church. No one actually seems to care about what us Europeans want.  The reluctance to fight a war between two superpowers means we are now getting called as "p*ssies" by online trolls. The European countries closely allied to Germany üá©üá™ (for example Croatia üá≠üá∑, Serbia üá∑üá∏, Bosnia üáßüá¶, Kosovo üáΩüá∞, Slovakia üá∏üá∞, Albania üá¶üá± and Turkey üáπüá∑) are trying to adopt a policy like Switzerland üá®üá≠ where we can benefit by all honest means. Unfortunately there are Americans as well as Russians who are calling us "weak" and "pathetic" for our attempt to stay neutral. Even some in Britain üá¨üáß are starting to call us "pathetic" and saying that our diplomacy will never reach the Swiss or Nordic standard. The fact is that we do not think we are psychologically ready to fight either. The purpose of the European Union üá™üá∫ is to become a humanitarian superpower of the 21st Century and if possible beyond. We have been fighting several wars until the 1990s and now we are vowing for peace. The world is growing increasingly multipolar. Washington DC and Moscow are not the only ones we have. Now we have Berlin, Zagreb, Beijing, Tokyo, Warsaw, Belgrade, Paris, Istanbul and God knows how many others are rising up. In this brave new world we should be seeking common ground instead of conflict.  To all those who are weaponizing social media to tear Europe üá™üá∫ apart I would like to come with an end note. We do not want to keep fighting useless wars. We do not want to be someone else's puppets. We have the right to create our own European Army and none of you worthless trolls are entitled to insult us. When wars happen outside European mainland it is Europe üá™üá∫ who has to take refugees. America üá∫üá∏ and Russia üá∑üá∫ never take any. When talks of post war recovery comes it is Europe üá™üá∫ who has to provide the hard cash first of all. Americans and Russians do not give support so easily. In an increasingly multipolar world we Europeans are still being pitted against one another in an "us vs them" strategy by two big and powerful nations refusing to make peace. A war between Russia üá∑üá∫ and Ukraine üá∫üá¶ can not be held in the midst of such screaming. Remember the time in 2017 when Donald J Trump and Kim Jong Un were screaming at each other for an impending nuclear war between USA üá∫üá∏ and North Korea üá∞üáµ? That war never happened. Similarly today in 2022 we find Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin screaming at each other for an impending war between USA üá∫üá∏ and Russia üá∑üá∫. And I do not think there will be any war this time either. The foreign policy in superpowers with unlimited military strength (like Washington DC or Moscow or Pyongyang or Tokyo) has been designed in a way where screaming is equal to deterrence. They invade a country suddenly when no one seems to pay attention. When the Russian army invaded Crimea in 2014 the whole world was cheering for the downfall of Viktor Yanukovyc while no one seemed to care about the "little green men". By the time Crimea was gone it was too late. When radical elements from Israel üáÆüá± after 1967 started building illegal settlements in the West Bank (present day Palestine üáµüá∏) everyone was still drunk with the results of the Six Day War. By the time when illegal settlements came to light it was too late. So those of my fellow Europeans (Germans, Croats, Ukrainians, Slovaks, Finns, Swedes, Turks, Bulgarians and others) who are feeling tensed about the upcoming war: Just let Washington DC and Moscow scream at each other. You really do not have to waste your precious time and energy and resources behind a war that is quite unlikely to happen. And if there are people sticking labels like "p*ssy" or "pathetic" or "Fascist" or "traitor" or "greedy" up your butts please let them do their work. When they see the war did not actually happen they will start ranting about their own misfortunes. Stay strong Europe üá™üá∫!	1643457884.0	sfgtea	/r/russia/comments/sfgtea/a_hard_to_swallow_pill_for_all_trigger_happy/	A "HARD TO SWALLOW PILL" FOR ALL TRIGGER HAPPY INDIVIDUALS AND TROLLS ONLINE

a20c0hgj	Hi,  Can someone share a link to some serious background information / context about the Ukraine tensions told from a russian or just not western perspective.   As per my understanding there has been some serious involvement from the West to frame the current Ukraine government. I have even heard about nazi sympathies. But any western story is all about how aggressive Putin is..   Thanks in advance.	1643475424.0	sfm95q	/r/russia/comments/sfm95q/ukraine/	Ukraine

j4dy8s8k	Greetings,   21 years old, male, from Serbia. Just finished his airline transport pilots license, currently waititfor Corona to loosen up and for airlines to start hiring again.   There is literally not a single thing in this world that I want more than to live in Russia. I've been in love with the country and people from Russia ever since I was a kid. I always make a joke with my mother, I aske her: "Mom, why didn't you give bith to me in Russia?" and her response is usually: "Next time I will!". Russian women are absolutely beautiful, I would love to get married to a Russian woman one day. Russian brutalism and buildings are not ugly to me, I find it very interesting. Russian history, Soviet history, WW2, WW1, Russian revolution I've read about all of it, watched hundreds of hours of YouTube videos on thise subjects. I feel like Serbs and Russians are very close in culture, way of life, way of thinking, social values, struggles, wars, inner politic problems, in everything.  Sorry for longer post, sending much love to all Russians and I hope that I'll soon live there!	1643549050.0	sg9403	/r/russia/comments/sg9403/there_is_nothing_that_i_want_more_than_to_move_to/	There is nothing that I want more than to move to Russia.

hoj6gdz7	So basically in 1999, my  dad who has Russian citizenship moved from Russia where he was living to the US. He worked with a Russian guy whom he met before in a logistical oil company which did business in Russia. Business was good until 2015, when oil started losing value. And when the pandemic hit the business nearly lost all its value. He tried to find work for other logistic jobs in the US but nobody wants to hire him because he‚Äôs too old, he‚Äôs in his late 50‚Äôs, and oil is also dead and not a lot of logistical jobs are hiring.  If he moves to Russia, will he find good work there? He was 30 years experience as an engineer in freezing/cryogenics and also in the logistical area. He can‚Äôt find any work in the US and he needs to make money. Will he find good work in Russia?  –ò—Ç–∞–∫, –≤ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–º –≤ 1999 –≥–æ–¥—É –º–æ–π –æ—Ç–µ—Ü-–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ö, –∏–º–µ—é—â–∏–π —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –ø–µ—Ä–µ–µ—Ö–∞–ª –∏–∑ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –≥–¥–µ –æ–Ω –∂–∏–ª, –≤ –°–®–ê. –û–Ω —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª —Å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–º –ø–∞—Ä–Ω–µ–º, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞–ª —Ä–∞–Ω—å—à–µ, –≤ –ª–æ–≥–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –Ω–µ—Ñ—Ç—è–Ω–æ–π –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –≤–µ–ª–∞ –±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. –ë–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å —à–µ–ª —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –¥–æ 2015 –≥–æ–¥–∞, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Ñ—Ç—å –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—è—Ç—å –≤ —Ü–µ–Ω–µ. –ê –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–∑–∏–ª–∞—Å—å –ø–∞–Ω–¥–µ–º–∏—è, –±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å –ø–æ—á—Ç–∏ –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä—è–ª –≤—Å—é —Å–≤–æ—é —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –û–Ω –ø—ã—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É –Ω–∞ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è—Ö –≤ —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ –ª–æ–≥–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –≤ –°–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –®—Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ö, –Ω–æ –Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—á–µ—Ç –µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω —Å–ª–∏—à–∫–æ–º —Å—Ç–∞—Ä, –µ–º—É –∑–∞ 50, –∞ –Ω–µ—Ñ—Ç—å —Ç–æ–∂–µ –º–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–∞, –∏ –Ω–µ —Ç–∞–∫ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ª—é–¥–µ–π –Ω–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É –≤ —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ –ª–æ–≥–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏.  –ï—Å–ª–∏ –æ–Ω –ø–µ—Ä–µ–µ–¥–µ—Ç –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é, –Ω–∞–π–¥–µ—Ç –ª–∏ –æ–Ω —Ç–∞–º —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à—É—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É?   –£ –Ω–µ–≥–æ –±—ã–ª 30-–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–π –æ–ø—ã—Ç —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–æ–º –≤ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∑–∞–º–æ—Ä–∞–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è / –∫—Ä–∏–æ–≥–µ–Ω–∏–∫–∏, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –≤ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ª–æ–≥–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏. –û–Ω –Ω–µ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É –≤ –°–®–ê, –∏ –µ–º—É –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å –¥–µ–Ω—å–≥–∏. –ù–∞–π–¥–µ—Ç –ª–∏ –æ–Ω —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à—É—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏?	1643562861.0	sgdrbw	/r/russia/comments/sgdrbw/will_my_dad_who_works_in_the_oil_industry_make/	Will my dad who works in the oil industry make more money in Russia if he moves there?

hzehpba6	I have a story I want to share with all of you. So please bear with me if this will be a long post.  A dysfunctional sect foster family adopted me from the U.S. because my birth mom was only 17 years old, and she couldn't take care of me. Was I mad at her? No, I couldn't imagine myself as a mother who was part of a lost generation to a young group of teenagers during the collapse of the USSR. To hell with politics sometimes, right?   My history of living in the U.S. is almost as horrible as anyone can imagine, so I ran away when I was 15. I later got a full scholarship to university and graduated. Until recently, I finally had the finances that allowed me to travel. But, of course, I always wanted to go back to Russia for one reason - to find my mother and let her know that I was all right and that if she ever needed my help, I would readily provide it. Some people told me that I had to move on with my life. I didn't believe that principle because no mother and child should ever be separated. And that I had this primal wound, and I always wondered where my personality traits came from. For this reason, I had to come back with my elementary level of Russian.   However, when I arrived in a small town nine hours southeast of Moscow, I was born. According to the adoption papers, I was supposed to navigate the address where she lived. But, instead, I happened to walk up to my great-grandfather, who lived there alone now. He was about 94 years old and in great shape. He understood my situation and gave me a phone number that led directly to my mother's sister. For some reason, I wondered why he didn't have my mother's phone number in the first place, but he told me to find out for myself.  I immediately contacted my mother's sister and told her about myself. She, of course, was shocked and confirmed that we would meet the following day.   This was not what I wanted to hear, but unfortunately, my mother disappeared without any trace. According to my aunt and my mother's other sister, most likely, she had been abducted. Even better, I never knew I had a younger brother who is five years younger than me and looks a lot like me! Long story short, when my mother disappeared, my aunt jumped in adopting him. He is such a polite teenager. This makes me so happy, and gains mad respect for my aunt. You may ask why my aunt didn't adopt me from the beginning. Understand, she was also just a teenager.   I got along very well with the whole family, and my brother and I have similar personalities, which just struck me.   That being said, if any of you are adoptees, I would advise everyone to reunite with their families because you never know. Maybe they are waiting for you. My aunt knew about me, and technically she always wondered if we would ever meet again, and we did finally after twenty-two years.   Now we all have peace of mind and are happy from there. I finally have a family that I always wanted to have. Both of my aunts have beautiful young daughters, and they are intelligent for their young age. Even better is that my appearance is very similar to my mother's, unlike my brother's. So my aunts are relieved as if they have finally seen my mother in many years. They told me they were finally at peace in their souls.   Lastly, Russia is truly a great place with infinitely generous neighbors. I would absolutely go back when things calmed down to be near my family again.

93mpzjun	Hello everyone, I would like to have some suggestions from you for my Russian language teacher's birthday gift, but since I'm Mexican I know cultural differences could mess up things. She is in her late 20's, a master's student, single(I think),  from Borzya but she's living in Peter.  I had been taking classes twice a week with her since 2020.  From my narrow perspective, I was thinking of gifting the best tequila or mezcal from here but I don't like to enforce my culture. I was thinking of an Ozon's gift card or even a money bonus. I really want to stay neutral and not cause any trouble, I would like to show my appreciation for the relationship without overwhelming her.  &#x200B;  I really appreciate any help you can provide.	1643751777.0	si6igx	/r/russia/comments/si6igx/nice_gift_for_a_russian_teacher/	Nice gift for a Russian teacher

93mpzjun	Hello everyone, I would like to have some suggestions from you for my Russian language teacher's birthday gift, but since I'm Mexican I know cultural differences could mess up things. She is in her late 20's, a master's student, single(I think),  from Borzya but she's living in Peter.  I had been taking classes twice a week with her since 2020.  From my narrow perspective, I was thinking of gifting the best tequila or mezcal from here but I don't like to enforce my culture. I was thinking of an Ozon's gift card or even a money bonus. I really want to stay neutral and not cause any trouble, I would like to show my appreciation for the relationship without overwhelming her.  &#x200B;  I really appreciate any help you can provide.	1643751777.0	si6igx	/r/russia/comments/si6igx/nice_gift_for_a_russian_teacher/	Nice gift for a Russian teacher
