97w4f	Rule 3 literally says "no hate" and I was shocked at the responses to a recent post about Romani people ('gypsy' is an ethnic slur). I was even more shocked though that the post was left up, with most of the discriminatory comments left visible for all to see.  I get that people might have negative personal experiences with people of a specific ethnicity, but these are individual experiences and generalising an entire ethnicity is always stupid and always wrong. You don't get to choose which discriminations are 'good' - there's no such thing.  I can understand that people might have an individual bad experience and that in the moment blinds them to the systemic reasons which cause high levels of crime or low levels of social trust in certain communities, but like is it not so obvious that huge levels of poverty and systemic discrimination and social exclusion just perpetuates and worsens the awful conditions that many Romani people (or any less powerful minority ethnicity) face?   I'm not sure if I'm making complete sense because it's like 1am here but fk even if people don't understand systemic influences on behaviour and even if people want to pick and choose which ethnic discrimination they think is cool, why did the mods allow this to happen? I can just imagine a Romani person (or any member of an ethnic minority who can relate to that daily discrimination) reading that and it's sickening to think how awful they would feel.	1642811040.0	s9pcmy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s9pcmy/why_is_antiromani_hate_tolerated_on_here/	Why is anti-Romani hate tolerated on here?

6kew0wgi	Dearest friends, Romans, countrymen, libtards, monkes, temporarily-embarrassed future billionaires, cummies, breadline attendees, [redacted], closeted furries, flag-molesting patriots, attack helicopters, and people from all corners of the political compass,  ‚Ä¶everyone except for the [unflaired heretics](https://youtu.be/YL0B8J44v_M), that is,  As you know, the basedcount_bot has recently had some‚Ä¶ growing pains. Let‚Äôs just say it was in and out of the gulag, the effects of which were felt across PCM. But you know what they say, if you can't beat the authority, then make your own website somewhere else where you can be the authority. And so that's what we did.  Introducing [https://basedcount.com](https://basedcount.com), the new central hub of the basedcount_bot! While the website has been live for a few weeks, we thought it‚Äôd be best to give an official update along with an explanation of the site‚Äôs features and purpose. The bot will still reply to triggers on Reddit, but the new site allows you to:  * View your pills >Based Count is now the sole method for viewing your pills in all their Reddit-triggering glory.  * Enjoy a more information-dense leaderboard and other UI improvements >User based count, flair, ranking, and profile pics * Much more coming soon‚Ä¶  Based Count exists to be a space (a safe space, if you will) for r/PCM outside of Reddit where some of our best moments are immortalized‚Äîsafe from an increasingly unfriendly host and its selective trigger finger. Right now the site simply is the best way to view your pills and based count and then ask yourself [how a LibLeft is the most based](https://basedcount.com/leaderboard).  We‚Äôre also working tirelessly on adding new features for PCM, such as linked accounts so you can claim and customize your pages, more stats than an AuthRight could ever dream of, and community tools to offer more ways to keep PCM based.  Some of you have also noticed that the bot‚Äôs flair changed recently to LibRight. This was a cheeky nod to us opening a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/basedcount_bot). We‚Äôre just a few people spread around the world developing the site and bot in our spare time. We don‚Äôt expect anything. It‚Äôs just an option to recoup some of our costs and keep the bot/site sustainable so it‚Äôll always be here for PCM. We also have a Discord for if you have any feedback about the bot/website, any good bot/site memes, or just want to hang out.  Thanks for the support!  -basedcount_bot Dev Team	1643123542.0	scfwwd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/scfwwd/introducing_basedcountcom/	Introducing BasedCount.com!
