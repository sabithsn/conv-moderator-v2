nm1bs	I absolutely hate myself because of stupid fucking jealousy I develope whenever I try to get to know someone. I'm in my 20's and I've never  been in a relationship. I've had multiple attempts of wanting to date someone but I always fuck it up because I get In my own head and just start acting different. I could get along with a girl well, but then there's always a point were if I see them talking to someone else, I feel like they are not really interested in me and just feel like shit. I get depressed, bitter, and I just don't act the same. The person sees this and then we end up talking less and less. I don't fucking like that I change. I try my best to get over it, ignore it or just anything to not let this fucking feeling of jealousy cover me. I know it's not right to be this way. I want to change but I keep failing and it hurts. I wish I could explain to them that I have nothing against them. They did nothing wrong and I know the problem is me. It's always me. I want to change but I don't know how. I wish I could explain this better. There's more I want to say but I'm don't know how. I just so full of hate for myself	1642774760.0	s9brgu	/r/offmychest/comments/s9brgu/i_hate_the_way_i_am/	I hate the way I am.

Doesn't even let me get married. I am 27. He and my stepmother are abusive. I fear my young sister will be abused if left her in that house.

With that out of the way...  It's pretty sad how the pandemic has caused so much hatred and division among people. But in particular, the drama with masks and vaccinations. Both sides are annoying as fuck and people never shut up about it. It's just people politicizing a literal face-cloth and being at each other's throats over vaccines. The division and hatred that masks and vaccines have caused is disgusting, and I don't care about who does what anymore as long as I'm doing my part. I don't even check covid news anymore because I no longer want to hear about the endless "political" debates and arguments about masks and vaccines.

People just can't stop making jokes about how he married me for "money" cause I simply can't have a chance with this man otherwise.  Whenever I post pics of us on my ig I get ridiculous comments mocking me and irl whenever we meet people they can't stop telling how lucky I am to catch him, cause he's way out of my league.   Ik y'all will say as long as ur husband loves u, it shouldn't matter. Yes, he does love me but that hasn't stopped him from cheating on me with so many other women. It's like I have his heart but he wants bodily pleasures from other women.  The society has won me over, i give up. I'm divorcing him so he can finally marry a beautiful white woman that makes a wonderful couple. I still love him, but i think he deserves better.   I hate existing, wouldn't wish this life even upon my worst enemies.

I've always known that mentally but I never connected that spiritually and now that my mother and father are approaching 90 I'm freaking out that I'm going to have to trek this life without them one day.  We've had a strained relationship through the years and I held grudges that never served me.  They're always there for me but I push them away because of childhood abuse and Trauma instead of working through it I'm self-medicated myself by smoking weed my whole life.  Through the ups and downs of my mental illness they love me from a distance and still supporting me and help me financially when I needed it and never turn their back on me.  They're not perfect but when I look back I was incredibly short-sighted in my own misguided attempts to numb myself.

7yerwwpw	I had a boyfriend at uni and he was just not a good person to me. We were in a long distance relationship and whenever I told him that I really need texts or calls from him everyday, I was told I'm too needy. He also always declined whenever I tried to have sex, he had to be the one starting it. I thought multiple times of ending it but it was my first boyfriend and I just thought it is what it is, maybe I am too needy and should stop.  What caused me to burst out of that bubble was when I finally got my job offer. It was a month or two before the end of uni year. I struggled to find it for months and when I got the offer I messaged him straight away. He called me and the conversation went something like this:  "Hi, congrats on the job, by the way I'm breaking up with you"  "um what... Can I ask why?"  "we just got further from each other, the feelings are not there blah blah"  "OK" *I hang up*  I was very upset that evening but I wasn't sure if it was because of breaking up or just that I didn't break up with him first. He completely destroyed my celebration that day. The next day he texted me if we could have a call. I said OK and he basically apologised, said it was a mistake and asked if I'd take him back. I took my time with answering but finally said yes. I did not say yes because I wanted him back. I said yes because we were seeing each other only once every two weeks and I knew he had a car that I could use for moving out when starting the job. A couple of weeks after he helped me move we broke up ( this time for good).   He did try to ask me to take him back after a few years when he's seen be with my current boyfriend but I just blocked him then.  I never told anyone the reasoning for taking him back and I'm a bit ashamed that I did that. But I'm still glad got a free car to move out with.

80m1f8ep	 I come from a typical South Asian dysfunctional family. My father spends all his day on phone talking to random women on weird websites. My mother devoted her life to taking care of the house, kids, cooking. She doesn't have a life, friends, interests of her own. There has been no relationship between my parents other than he earned and she took care of the household.  My sister also seem to be following in our mother's footsteps. She had an arranged marriage and she prefers to spend time at home because she has no actual relationship with her husband, one where she wants to be with him.  They have issues with me going out to meet friends; why do I need to go, I am 28 years old, unmarried, it doesn't look nice, all your friends are married, people talk, shouldn't give too much freedom to girls, you should get married to a guy of our choice because we know what is best for you and what you want from life.  NO! I do not want the same messed up marital life like you have. Stop pretending you have a good relationship. The 'relationship' you have is something I don't want. I feel closer to my friends because at least they listen to me, I have fun with them, for me 'home' is not everything. I have a whole set of personality that neither you see nor do you want to see. You insult me by saying I don't know what I am saying and I am wrong because I am younger than you and then expect me to love you guys?  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. IT IS A LIE.

I was told, especially when I was younger, that I'm a creative and smart child. Well, I used to be. Or maybe I never was.

e3ikmkb5	I vaped for years when I was a teenager and only recently did I realise that restarting vaping often *preceeded* times of worse mental health. For me, the fact that it doesn't need to be lit or rolled meant that I used it all day everyday. The idea that it was safer than smokes made me able to put the thought of other potential harm out of my head (and when you're that age you think you're immortal lol).   When overloaded on it my executive function seemed to break down, I couldn't think clearly, and the same seems to be true for my mother. I'm still afraid that it's done some serious damage that scientists aren't even aware of yet. I worry that vaping has became the new vogue and that many other people will be nicotine-vegetable oil poisoned like I was üòÇüòÖ We simply do not know the long term effects, apart from knowing that it unsurprisingly causes lung cancer in mice.

gf0wjisr	I was messing around with one of my sisters friends, she is 18 and I am 22. I have known her for a few months so I thought she was cool. A few days ago I went to her place while her parents were away in another state to have fun. I got to her place at around 10pm and a movie on Netflix. Eventually she gets closer to me and kisses me, we make out, we take our clothes off and i go to take out my condom, but she grabs it and throws it to the side and tells me she is in birth control and wants to feel me raw. Anyways I was horny with the way she was looking and talking that i was ok with it.    I get on top of her for missionary afterwards we do doggy and lastly she gets on top of me. I was getting close to finishing and asked if I could finish inside, she proceeds to go faster and hold my arms down, "yes daddy I want your baby.‚Äù My heart drops and I couldn‚Äôt do much and I came inside her. I stand up and ask her if she is really is on birth control. She says she thinks she is, and gets angry at me for not trusting her.    We argue and her face turned into a demon, her eyes were wide and she ran to the kitchen. I was putting my clothes on and she comes back to the room with a knife?! I was scared like shit, she cried and asked if I really trust her, I lied and said yes and I was able to calm her down. She asks if I can stay the night, and I just agree because I didn‚Äôt want to tigger her again.    For the past few days she was texting me and calling me a lot, yesterday she video called crying and asking for forgiveness and said she wanted to take me out for dinner. Long story short yesterday I went to dinner with her and everything seemed to be going well. We finished the dinner and we were chilling in my car, she gets out and opens my side of the door and gets on top of me, she kisses me and she begins asking me if I think she is marriage material, I tell her i am not sure yet and she gets offended and we begin to argue again, she asks if I wanna have kids with her and I tell her again I am not sure.    She then scratches my face! That hurt so much, I had to hug her and calm her down, eventually after 30 minutes I was able to, and I take her home, she asks if I wanted to come inside but I tell her I had to wake up early the next day, she apologizes for what she did and tells me she is really into me and doesn‚Äôt want to lose me.    Today she called me and asked if she could come to my place, I lied and said I have some cousins over, she got annoyed but eventually said ok.

e8nyflk9	Over the last few years, I‚Äôve spiraled into a hole of spite and envy. I absolutely hate the circumstances of my birth. I was born in the US to an Islamic, Middle Eastern household. When I was younger, I was more in touch with my Middle Eastern side. I wanted to learn Arabic and travel to the middle east. I wanted to be a devout muslim. I never ended up learning Arabic, nor have I visited family in the Middle East.  I felt insecure about this, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was a real Arab. In middle school, my faith in god shattered (I know it sounds stupid, but those atheist debate videos got to me) and my interest in Islam and the Middle East faded. I then started to embrace being an American. I was born here, grew up here, so it was easy to adjust. It was fine until a few years ago. I started reading online about how bad the US was, and how great places like Finland, Germany, France, etc, were.   At first it was simply minor things like the metric system, urban development, or culinary topics. Then, I saw people say that Americans are stupid and uncultured. We are problematic and the world would be better without us. This filled me with rage, but I couldn‚Äôt help to see some of this as fact. I grew envious and spiteful of people from other Western nations.  I always knew the US had issues. For as long as I remember, I always heard things about racism, or the wars in the Middle East. I never thought the US was the best place in the world. I never thought I was better than others for being American, but knowing how people view us upsets me. It has made me feel worthless. I‚Äôve had thoughts of violence, like ripping people apart or hoping a meteorite smashes into those nations that are more prosperous. But I know this is childish and even if it did happen, I‚Äôd still feel worthless.   I realize now that this is close to how I felt during the end of my religious experience. Except then, I could disavow the religion, whereas now, I can‚Äôt change the fact that I‚Äôm American. Sure I can move, but I doubt I‚Äôll ever shake that feeling off, and I doubt others will see me as anything other than an American. I know other places in the world have it worse than us, but that doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. I don‚Äôt want to hate being an American, but I know people will think less of me for it. Sometimes I just wish I was born somewhere else.  I find myself constantly comparing the US to those nations, or Americans to people of those nations. I try to find commonality to convince myself that we can be similar, that we can be as good as them, but it always fails. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this. It‚Äôs every single day. I can‚Äôt even envision myself traveling to those nations. I don‚Äôt really know why. Maybe I fear it‚Äôll confirm my feelings of inferiority.   As far as the social and political issues are concerned, I feel hope that many of those will be resolved in the next 20 years. Millennials have been talking about these issues for a while, Gen Z is hopping on board, and the boomers are on their way out. But even then, I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be good enough.

751sfg56	I chose electrical engineering in high school because I liked math and physics, but now that I'm 2 years away from graduation (total 5 years) I feel I've made the wrong choice. Only 50% of engineers in Canada (where I am) work as engineers. Many work in management, finance, business, etc. which all sounds terrible to me. Even some of the job descriptions I've read for actual engineering jobs don't sound appealing to me. I don't have much experience in the field, so I can't say for certain. It's stressing me out I can't find any experience. I've stopped looking for positions online just to avoid feeling uncomfortable. I feel like a failure. The few business admin/project coordination jobs I've had in an office have been awful. I've hated every job I've had. I hate feeling like I've been thrown into it and expected to learn everything quickly. I wouldn't say I'm a slow learner but that kind if environment makes me feel so dumb. It doesn't help that my degree doesn't teach many on the job/soft skills.  &#x200B;  I think a lot of this is due to the fact that I've been struggling with social anxiety most of my life. It's gotten a lot better, but I think my anxiety in other areas has gotten worse. The past few weeks I've been nearly constantly irritated, and it makes me feel really guilty when I snap at people I care about. I've been crying very easily. I worry about the future and my relationships all the time. Sometimes I even worry about completely irrational things. Sometimes I'll worry someone is going to break in and murder/assault me. One night I worried until I truly convinced myself it was going to happen and I couldn't stop crying. I know it sounds stupid. Sometimes I'll worry all my friends and family are going to die or leave me. Sometimes I worry I'm going to die suddenly or violently. It feels like there's always something to be worrying about and I can't seem to stop it. Most of the time I worry about school or relationships. I feel like I can't even trust myself to do the right thing or "normal" thing in a social dilemma; I always feel guilty that I'm failing my friends and family. I've talked about this with my friend and they think I should talk to my doctor about it. I considered it, but I always feel like I'm not doing badly enough to see a professional. Most days I function fine -- it just makes it harder. I do feel tired, and even when I get 8+ hours of sleep I feel tired. I had to get a mouthguard because I've been clenching and grinding my teeth at night. My chest feels tight nearly every day. I dunno. Usually I find I worry but everyone has worries, and I can handle it. But sometimes I can't handle it and it feels like I'm dying. I try to journal, go on walks, and reframe my thoughts but I'm not very good at keeping up with it all. I'm just tired, and it doesn't seem to help.  &#x200B;  Now I'm in my 3rd year of 5 total, in debt, doing a degree I'm not even sure I want. Sometimes I wish I'd gone into nursing or pharmacy. I could work partially independently at least, I'd be fully trained for the job, and I'd be fully applying my technical knowledge. However my grades aren't good enough to get into a nursing after-degree program (my GPA is 3.0 whereas I'd need a 3.8+) and another 4 years only to accumulate more debt seems like a bad idea. I even thought about medicine, because I think I'd enjoy being a general practitioner, but I don't think I could get in for many reasons. I do like some of the courses I've taken on nanoelectronics, and I thought about doing research but I have zero relationships with any professors, and doubt I could get any research position considering my mediocre grades and no connections. I've only gone to office hours once, and I had a terrible experience and have never went again. The past 3 years I've been trying to get better at time management, and while I have gotten better, my grades are still just ok. In first year I had a 2.9, and last term I got a 3.4, but it's only because I took half the number of credits. I feel like I have nothing to be proud of myself for. I'm truly very grateful for my friends (of which I only have about 3) and family, but I can't help but feeling like a failure. I wish I'd thought of all this before I applied to university. I didn't know what I wanted, but I knew I liked math, physics, and biology, and thought that was enough to lock myself into engineering forever. Ugh. I don't know what to do. Any advice or kind words? Thanks for reading! :)  tl;dr: I like the course material in my degree but I think I'd hate the job. I'm too far into my degree to quit, and I'm not sure what to do about it. My anxiety is getting worse, and I'm not sure how to handle it. Just wanted to vent, and see if anyone had any advice/kind words to share :) Thanks!  Thanks for reading :) I hope you're all doing well <3	1642779812.0	s9dm5z	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dm5z/i_mightve_chose_the_wrong_major_and_i_think_my/	I might've chose the wrong major and I think my anxiety is getting worse :(
enh3sw9d	Here I am.  I have been in therapy for 4 years, with untreated depression. Everything was going so slow and I only had to talk talk and talk more. I wanted to try meds, because I've tried a lot of things, but my therapist doesn't care because she doesn't take me seriously (even after my suicide attempt). So I went to my doctor, explained my situation and she was quick and happy to prescribe me antidepressants. After all these years, I was extremely happy, I finally got something to help me with the shit going on in my head. With a great mood I went home, and told my mom. She was happy for me. Then in the evening, when my dad came home, my mother made me tell him how it went at the doctor's. I told him everything, excitingly, and he interrupted me to say shit like 'Why do I hear about this now? You never tell me anything' which is not true, I had the extensive conversation about medication a week earlier in the car, but I guess he was too unbothered to listen. 'Why do you always want medication?', was his next question, which also isn't true, this is the first medication I'll be taking! It's always about him, I can't ever talk about myself for fuck's sake! He can't even be happy for me.	1642779852.0	s9dmoh	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dmoh/i_finally_got_my_antidepressants_but_i_cant_be/	I finally got my antidepressants but I can't be happy about it

4kcm6pm5	I was born with ears that stick out quite a bit. 60¬∞ angle actually (for reference, a natural angle would be something around 25-30¬∞). so naturally, my ears bothered me for years. last few years they've mostly bothered me because they were inconvenient - everytime I laid on my side, I'd have to fold my ears back, or when I put on a hat I'd have to do the same. when I was wearing headphones, again, I'd have to fold my ears back, and they'd start hurting at some point. I complained about my ears a bunch of times to friends and family, and nobody ever said anything helpful, mostly just things like "yea must be annoying".  so yesterday I had my earjob done - had them flattened to a 30¬∞ angle. I told a few people and of course, the news spread like a wildfire - and what did I get? "oh no, they were so cute" and "why did you do it? it looked so pretty" and "aww I actually really liked your ears".   first of, I didn't fucking do it for the looks - just convenience.  second, can't people just say shit like that a little sooner? not that It would've changed anything, but it would still have been nice to hear that before I had my ears snippled off üòÇ	1642780133.0	s9dq1s	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dq1s/ears_ears/	ears ears
iihrnosa	I struggle with depression. I've had it since childhood.  I lost my best friend to Covid in 2021. I've taken his death pretty hard and haven't felt like myself for a long time. Without him I feel like I'm not me anymore. Last Friday, my spouse brought home a puppy. He knows I didn't want a puppy. But along with endless promises that I knew he wasn't going to keep, his answer was that this could be a "Therapy" animal. Our kids have wanted a dog for a long time so this was why he brought her home. They have never really helped me around the house. Everything home wise is on me. I started college last fall and I just started Spring classes Wednesday. Now I have even more responsibility on me. Since I work at home I'm here 90% of the time except for the two days I go to class. This dog loves me. I'd like to be clear there is nothing wrong with her. She is a good pup. But... she's a puppy and it's a lot of work. Actually more than I thought. I am constantly having to get her out of things, take her outside every hour and cleaning up after her. This is normal and I know that. This is exactly why I didn't want a pet. This is why I told him I didn't want a pet. My fish Cheeto is enough. I don't have time for myself anymore. I don't have time to do anything anymore. I don't blame the dog. I blame myself. When everyone comes home, I hide in my room. He doesn't like that I'm just out when he arrives. I just don't know how to deal with it. But now, I'm stuck. And now.... I just want to kill myself. I don't want to do this anymore. It's not that she's bad or that I don't like her. That's not it. But it makes me feel guilty. I feel guilty that I want my old life back.	1642780155.0	s9dqc5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dqc5/i_hate_myself_so_much_right_now/	I hate myself so much right now.
imkq3znp	I posted last week about my dad having stage 4 lung cancer and how hard it has hit me. I am 29 and have a 3 year old daughter who I‚Äôve stayed home with since she was born. Prior to my dads diagnosis I had a new RN job lined up that was absolutely perfect. I was so excited to ‚Äústart‚Äù my life and hopefully continue growing our family. But the news of my dads diagnosis made me spiral. I declined the job offer because I was just not in a good mental place to start such a new change. I am still working let diem at my old nursing home job, though I despise it and it triggers me in so many ways. My dad is in the hospital now and hopefully coming home today, but he is so weak. I‚Äôm just trying to cope with everything and stop thinking about what could‚Äôve been. Or beating myself up for not being stronger and just taking the new job so I could maybe have something to distract me. Idk. I just feel so lost most days trying to take care of my daughter and helping my mom and dad with all of these changes. Not to mention my health anxiety is crippling and I am constantly convinced something is wrong with me and that everyone I love is going to get sick. I am on Zoloft and it‚Äôs been helping but I still am so stuck on mourning how life used to be. When my dad was healthy and everyone was so happy and life was just ideal. It will never feel that way again and I feel so hopeless. I‚Äôm so scared to lose my dad. It‚Äôs just killing me. I haven‚Äôt had any normalcy in 3 months I can‚Äôt cook or clean just the bare minimum. I feel so weak idk if this severe of a reaction is normal.	1642780379.0	s9dtki	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dtki/dad_is_very_sick_still_having_an_incredibly_hard/	Dad is very sick.

4hznzhrw	I want to make people laugh and have a great time with them. I want to be involved with inside jokes and let conversation roll on easily. I feel completely normal but I genuinely cannot get quick or witty enough to banter with other people.   I've actually asked people for pointers, I've practiced, and I actually try to remember light hearted lines to say back to people.  But I'm just tired and I just want to stop trying so hard to naturally fit in with friends and family. I'm always the one who needs the joke to be explained and I never understand innuendoes or grasp concepts. Nowadays most people just shrug me off with "don't worry" because they're anticipating me to be a bit slow and don't bother.  It's like tone of voice and facial expressions just don't register in my head. I take it all too literally.

I've had multiple attempts of wanting to date someone but I always fuck it up because I get In my own head and just start acting different. I could get along with a girl well, but then there's always a point were if I see them talking to someone else, I feel like they are not really interested in me and just feel like shit. I get depressed, bitter, and I just don't act the same. The person sees this and then we end up talking less and less. I don't fucking like that I change. I try my best to get over it, ignore it or just anything to not let this fucking feeling of jealousy cover me. I know it's not right to be this way. I want to change but I keep failing and it hurts. I wish I could explain to them that I have nothing against them. They did nothing wrong and I know the problem is me. It's always me. I want to change but I don't know how.

With that out of the way...  It's pretty sad how the pandemic has caused so much hatred and division among people. But in particular, the drama with masks and vaccinations. Both sides are annoying as fuck and people never shut up about it. It's just people politicizing a literal face-cloth and being at each other's throats over vaccines. The division and hatred that masks and vaccines have caused is disgusting, and I don't care about who does what anymore as long as I'm doing my part. I don't even check covid news anymore because I no longer want to hear about the endless "political" debates and arguments about masks and vaccines.

I've always known that mentally but I never connected that spiritually and now that my mother and father are approaching 90 I'm freaking out that I'm going to have to trek this life without them one day.  We've had a strained relationship through the years and I held grudges that never served me.  They're always there for me but I push them away because of childhood abuse and Trauma instead of working through it I'm self-medicated myself by smoking weed my whole life.  Through the ups and downs of my mental illness they love me from a distance and still supporting me and help me financially when I needed it and never turn their back on me.  They're not perfect but when I look back I was incredibly short-sighted in my own misguided attempts to numb myself.

7yerwwpw	I had a boyfriend at uni and he was just not a good person to me. We were in a long distance relationship and whenever I told him that I really need texts or calls from him everyday, I was told I'm too needy. He also always declined whenever I tried to have sex, he had to be the one starting it. I thought multiple times of ending it but it was my first boyfriend and I just thought it is what it is, maybe I am too needy and should stop.  What caused me to burst out of that bubble was when I finally got my job offer. It was a month or two before the end of uni year. I struggled to find it for months and when I got the offer I messaged him straight away. He called me and the conversation went something like this:  "Hi, congrats on the job, by the way I'm breaking up with you"  "um what... Can I ask why?"  "we just got further from each other, the feelings are not there blah blah"  "OK" *I hang up*  I was very upset that evening but I wasn't sure if it was because of breaking up or just that I didn't break up with him first. He completely destroyed my celebration that day. The next day he texted me if we could have a call. I said OK and he basically apologised, said it was a mistake and asked if I'd take him back. I took my time with answering but finally said yes. I did not say yes because I wanted him back. I said yes because we were seeing each other only once every two weeks and I knew he had a car that I could use for moving out when starting the job. A couple of weeks after he helped me move we broke up ( this time for good).   He did try to ask me to take him back after a few years when he's seen be with my current boyfriend but I just blocked him then.  I never told anyone the reasoning for taking him back and I'm a bit ashamed that I did that. But I'm still glad got a free car to move out with.

80m1f8ep	 I come from a typical South Asian dysfunctional family. My father spends all his day on phone talking to random women on weird websites. My mother devoted her life to taking care of the house, kids, cooking. She doesn't have a life, friends, interests of her own. There has been no relationship between my parents other than he earned and she took care of the household.  My sister also seem to be following in our mother's footsteps. She had an arranged marriage and she prefers to spend time at home because she has no actual relationship with her husband, one where she wants to be with him.  They have issues with me going out to meet friends; why do I need to go, I am 28 years old, unmarried, it doesn't look nice, all your friends are married, people talk, shouldn't give too much freedom to girls, you should get married to a guy of our choice because we know what is best for you and what you want from life.  NO! I do not want the same messed up marital life like you have. Stop pretending you have a good relationship. The 'relationship' you have is something I don't want. I feel closer to my friends because at least they listen to me, I have fun with them, for me 'home' is not everything. I have a whole set of personality that neither you see nor do you want to see. You insult me by saying I don't know what I am saying and I am wrong because I am younger than you and then expect me to love you guys?  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. IT IS A LIE. ALL WE HAVE IS A SUPERFICIAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH BREAKS THE SECOND I EXPRESS MY FEELINGS	1642776899.0	s9cj0h	/r/offmychest/comments/s9cj0h/typical_dysfunctional_south_asian_family/	Typical dysfunctional South Asian family
7p72fwf8	I'm just tired of some people around me commenting about my relationship and telling our relatives about how me and my husband treat each other or how we act around together without context.  She'd been telling our relatives that I just can't stay away from my husband even if he's antigen test positive. I'm 38 weeks pregnant and I can't help but want to assist my husband since he's been feeling weak. If I isolate myself from him, will they be taking care of him? No, they won't. I'm just so frustrated that they don't understand why I'm doing this and I'm so upset that my relatives now only view me as an irresponsible mom and a lovesick wife.  I just hate how it came from her mouth. She doesn't know what it's like to be in a relationship so she won't understand and in the end, she conveys to our relatives what she thinks of us. I just feel misjudged and I can't do anything about it	1642777012.0	s9cke3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9cke3/i_hate_people_who_have_never_been_in_a/	I hate people who have never been in a relationship speak as if their experts on it

8y9igyn6	I speak well, I write especially well, I can articulate, I acknowledge that. But in terms of "classical" intelligence such as abstract reasoning and problem solving skills, I'm 98% sure I'm just spot on average. My peers are, in comparison, fast learners who readily troubleshoot and navigate through problems. They've got thoughts, ideas, running through their mind. I was told, especially when I was younger, that I'm a creative and smart child. Well, I used to be. Or maybe I never was. Now I'm just an empty shell of a person who scrolls through the phone for hours a day after school, crippled with stress yet too much of an ass to do anything about it.  Nothing flows through my mind anymore. It's a dry river bank.  And yet because I'm good at English, it's so easy to mask it up. If only somebody could see through it. Being good at a language doesn't necessarily mean your intelligent. I wish I had that mathematical intelligence.

imtgxtq8	There was a woman who recently was murdered in the furniture she worked at by some bastard who was arrested and released over and over again even after he assaulted an officer.  This is just ONE of the many cases of the fucking judges, jurors, etc messing up and not caring about the publics safety.  There was this one case that really stuck with me, it was about a man who assaulted an asian woman for her race and the man turned out to be on bail for murdering his own mother.  Sons of fucking pieces of shit who let this happen are out of their minds.  I've also seen cases of law abiding civilians being arrested and charged for defending themselves against criminals who were attacking them, sometimes they get arrested for bullshit like "using excessive force"  Honestly I wish someone who was wrong by the criminal system successful attacked the supreme court or white house maybe with a large group of people, and announced to the world why: because of all the injustices that are happening within the system that is supposed to protect us.	1642778671.0	s9d6l5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9d6l5/the_fucking_american_justice_system_seems_so/	The fucking American "justice" system seems so broken.

e3ikmkb5	I vaped for years when I was a teenager and only recently did I realise that restarting vaping often *preceeded* times of worse mental health. For me, the fact that it doesn't need to be lit or rolled meant that I used it all day everyday. The idea that it was safer than smokes made me able to put the thought of other potential harm out of my head (and when you're that age you think you're immortal lol).   When overloaded on it my executive function seemed to break down, I couldn't think clearly, and the same seems to be true for my mother. I'm still afraid that it's done some serious damage that scientists aren't even aware of yet. I worry that vaping has became the new vogue and that many other people will be nicotine-vegetable oil poisoned like I was üòÇüòÖ We simply do not know the long term effects, apart from knowing that it unsurprisingly causes lung cancer in mice.  I am not saying vaping is worse than smoking, my title's just dramatic, and if it helps many people quit real smokes that's great.

gf0wjisr	I was messing around with one of my sisters friends, she is 18 and I am 22. I have known her for a few months so I thought she was cool. A few days ago I went to her place while her parents were away in another state to have fun. I got to her place at around 10pm and a movie on Netflix. Eventually she gets closer to me and kisses me, we make out, we take our clothes off and i go to take out my condom, but she grabs it and throws it to the side and tells me she is in birth control and wants to feel me raw. Anyways I was horny with the way she was looking and talking that i was ok with it.    I get on top of her for missionary afterwards we do doggy and lastly she gets on top of me. I was getting close to finishing and asked if I could finish inside, she proceeds to go faster and hold my arms down, "yes daddy I want your baby.‚Äù My heart drops and I couldn‚Äôt do much and I came inside her. I stand up and ask her if she is really is on birth control. She says she thinks she is, and gets angry at me for not trusting her.    We argue and her face turned into a demon, her eyes were wide and she ran to the kitchen. I was putting my clothes on and she comes back to the room with a knife?! I was scared like shit, she cried and asked if I really trust her, I lied and said yes and I was able to calm her down. She asks if I can stay the night, and I just agree because I didn‚Äôt want to tigger her again.    For the past few days she was texting me and calling me a lot, yesterday she video called crying and asking for forgiveness and said she wanted to take me out for dinner. Long story short yesterday I went to dinner with her and everything seemed to be going well. We finished the dinner and we were chilling in my car, she gets out and opens my side of the door and gets on top of me, she kisses me and she begins asking me if I think she is marriage material, I tell her i am not sure yet and she gets offended and we begin to argue again, she asks if I wanna have kids with her and I tell her again I am not sure.    She then scratches my face! That hurt so much, I had to hug her and calm her down, eventually after 30 minutes I was able to, and I take her home, she asks if I wanted to come inside but I tell her I had to wake up early the next day, she apologizes for what she did and tells me she is really into me and doesn‚Äôt want to lose me.    Today she called me and asked if she could come to my place, I lied and said I have some cousins over, she got annoyed but eventually said ok. I don‚Äôt know what i am going to do, but hopefully i will be good üôè	1642779054.0	s9dbrq	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dbrq/dont_stick_your_dick_in_crazy_i_am_now_regretting/	Don‚Äôt stick your dick in crazy, I am now regretting it

e8nyflk9	Over the last few years, I‚Äôve spiraled into a hole of spite and envy. I absolutely hate the circumstances of my birth. I was born in the US to an Islamic, Middle Eastern household. When I was younger, I was more in touch with my Middle Eastern side. I wanted to learn Arabic and travel to the middle east. I wanted to be a devout muslim. I never ended up learning Arabic, nor have I visited family in the Middle East.  I felt insecure about this, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was a real Arab. In middle school, my faith in god shattered (I know it sounds stupid, but those atheist debate videos got to me) and my interest in Islam and the Middle East faded. I then started to embrace being an American. I was born here, grew up here, so it was easy to adjust. It was fine until a few years ago. I started reading online about how bad the US was, and how great places like Finland, Germany, France, etc, were.   At first it was simply minor things like the metric system, urban development, or culinary topics. Then, I saw people say that Americans are stupid and uncultured. We are problematic and the world would be better without us. This filled me with rage, but I couldn‚Äôt help to see some of this as fact. I grew envious and spiteful of people from other Western nations.  I always knew the US had issues. For as long as I remember, I always heard things about racism, or the wars in the Middle East. I never thought the US was the best place in the world. I never thought I was better than others for being American, but knowing how people view us upsets me. It has made me feel worthless. I‚Äôve had thoughts of violence, like ripping people apart or hoping a meteorite smashes into those nations that are more prosperous. But I know this is childish and even if it did happen, I‚Äôd still feel worthless.   I realize now that this is close to how I felt during the end of my religious experience. Except then, I could disavow the religion, whereas now, I can‚Äôt change the fact that I‚Äôm American. Sure I can move, but I doubt I‚Äôll ever shake that feeling off, and I doubt others will see me as anything other than an American. I know other places in the world have it worse than us, but that doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. I don‚Äôt want to hate being an American, but I know people will think less of me for it. Sometimes I just wish I was born somewhere else.  I find myself constantly comparing the US to those nations, or Americans to people of those nations. I try to find commonality to convince myself that we can be similar, that we can be as good as them, but it always fails. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this. It‚Äôs every single day. I can‚Äôt even envision myself traveling to those nations. I don‚Äôt really know why. Maybe I fear it‚Äôll confirm my feelings of inferiority.   As far as the social and political issues are concerned, I feel hope that many of those will be resolved in the next 20 years. Millennials have been talking about these issues for a while, Gen Z is hopping on board, and the boomers are on their way out. But even then, I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be good enough. Europe had these issues solved long before we did, and they‚Äôll only continue to grow as we struggle to play catch up. They‚Äôll still laugh at our efforts. And I‚Äôll still feel worthless.  If this reads incoherently, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve been struggling trying to write this, and I feel like I could say more. I also don‚Äôt want other people to feel bad.	1642779512.0	s9dhyc	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dhyc/filled_with_absolute_hatred/	Filled with absolute hatred
751sfg56	I chose electrical engineering in high school because I liked math and physics, but now that I'm 2 years away from graduation (total 5 years) I feel I've made the wrong choice. Only 50% of engineers in Canada (where I am) work as engineers. Many work in management, finance, business, etc. which all sounds terrible to me. Even some of the job descriptions I've read for actual engineering jobs don't sound appealing to me. I don't have much experience in the field, so I can't say for certain. It's stressing me out I can't find any experience. I've stopped looking for positions online just to avoid feeling uncomfortable. I feel like a failure. The few business admin/project coordination jobs I've had in an office have been awful. I've hated every job I've had. I hate feeling like I've been thrown into it and expected to learn everything quickly. I wouldn't say I'm a slow learner but that kind if environment makes me feel so dumb. It doesn't help that my degree doesn't teach many on the job/soft skills.  &#x200B;  I think a lot of this is due to the fact that I've been struggling with social anxiety most of my life. It's gotten a lot better, but I think my anxiety in other areas has gotten worse. The past few weeks I've been nearly constantly irritated, and it makes me feel really guilty when I snap at people I care about. I've been crying very easily. I worry about the future and my relationships all the time. Sometimes I even worry about completely irrational things. Sometimes I'll worry someone is going to break in and murder/assault me. One night I worried until I truly convinced myself it was going to happen and I couldn't stop crying. I know it sounds stupid. Sometimes I'll worry all my friends and family are going to die or leave me. Sometimes I worry I'm going to die suddenly or violently. It feels like there's always something to be worrying about and I can't seem to stop it. Most of the time I worry about school or relationships. I feel like I can't even trust myself to do the right thing or "normal" thing in a social dilemma; I always feel guilty that I'm failing my friends and family. I've talked about this with my friend and they think I should talk to my doctor about it. I considered it, but I always feel like I'm not doing badly enough to see a professional. Most days I function fine -- it just makes it harder. I do feel tired, and even when I get 8+ hours of sleep I feel tired. I had to get a mouthguard because I've been clenching and grinding my teeth at night. My chest feels tight nearly every day. I dunno. Usually I find I worry but everyone has worries, and I can handle it. But sometimes I can't handle it and it feels like I'm dying. I try to journal, go on walks, and reframe my thoughts but I'm not very good at keeping up with it all. I'm just tired, and it doesn't seem to help.  &#x200B;  Now I'm in my 3rd year of 5 total, in debt, doing a degree I'm not even sure I want. Sometimes I wish I'd gone into nursing or pharmacy. I could work partially independently at least, I'd be fully trained for the job, and I'd be fully applying my technical knowledge. However my grades aren't good enough to get into a nursing after-degree program (my GPA is 3.0 whereas I'd need a 3.8+) and another 4 years only to accumulate more debt seems like a bad idea. I even thought about medicine, because I think I'd enjoy being a general practitioner, but I don't think I could get in for many reasons. I do like some of the courses I've taken on nanoelectronics, and I thought about doing research but I have zero relationships with any professors, and doubt I could get any research position considering my mediocre grades and no connections. I've only gone to office hours once, and I had a terrible experience and have never went again. The past 3 years I've been trying to get better at time management, and while I have gotten better, my grades are still just ok. In first year I had a 2.9, and last term I got a 3.4, but it's only because I took half the number of credits. I feel like I have nothing to be proud of myself for. I'm truly very grateful for my friends (of which I only have about 3) and family, but I can't help but feeling like a failure. I wish I'd thought of all this before I applied to university. I didn't know what I wanted, but I knew I liked math, physics, and biology, and thought that was enough to lock myself into engineering forever. Ugh. I don't know what to do. Any advice or kind words? Thanks for reading! :)  tl;dr: I like the course material in my degree but I think I'd hate the job. I'm too far into my degree to quit, and I'm not sure what to do about it. My anxiety is getting worse, and I'm not sure how to handle it. Just wanted to vent, and see if anyone had any advice/kind words to share :) Thanks!

enh3sw9d	Here I am.  I have been in therapy for 4 years, with untreated depression. Everything was going so slow and I only had to talk talk and talk more. I wanted to try meds, because I've tried a lot of things, but my therapist doesn't care because she doesn't take me seriously (even after my suicide attempt). So I went to my doctor, explained my situation and she was quick and happy to prescribe me antidepressants. After all these years, I was extremely happy, I finally got something to help me with the shit going on in my head. With a great mood I went home, and told my mom. She was happy for me. Then in the evening, when my dad came home, my mother made me tell him how it went at the doctor's. I told him everything, excitingly, and he interrupted me to say shit like 'Why do I hear about this now? You never tell me anything' which is not true, I had the extensive conversation about medication a week earlier in the car, but I guess he was too unbothered to listen. 'Why do you always want medication?', was his next question, which also isn't true, this is the first medication I'll be taking! It's always about him, I can't ever talk about myself for fuck's sake! He can't even be happy for me.	1642779852.0	s9dmoh	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dmoh/i_finally_got_my_antidepressants_but_i_cant_be/	I finally got my antidepressants but I can't be happy about it

4kcm6pm5	I was born with ears that stick out quite a bit. 60¬∞ angle actually (for reference, a natural angle would be something around 25-30¬∞). so naturally, my ears bothered me for years. last few years they've mostly bothered me because they were inconvenient - everytime I laid on my side, I'd have to fold my ears back, or when I put on a hat I'd have to do the same. when I was wearing headphones, again, I'd have to fold my ears back, and they'd start hurting at some point. I complained about my ears a bunch of times to friends and family, and nobody ever said anything helpful, mostly just things like "yea must be annoying".  so yesterday I had my earjob done - had them flattened to a 30¬∞ angle. I told a few people and of course, the news spread like a wildfire - and what did I get? "oh no, they were so cute" and "why did you do it? it looked so pretty" and "aww I actually really liked your ears".   first of, I didn't fucking do it for the looks - just convenience.  second, can't people just say shit like that a little sooner? not that It would've changed anything, but it would still have been nice to hear that before I had my ears snippled off üòÇ	1642780133.0	s9dq1s	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dq1s/ears_ears/	ears ears
iihrnosa	I struggle with depression. I've had it since childhood.  I lost my best friend to Covid in 2021. I've taken his death pretty hard and haven't felt like myself for a long time. Without him I feel like I'm not me anymore. Last Friday, my spouse brought home a puppy. He knows I didn't want a puppy. But along with endless promises that I knew he wasn't going to keep, his answer was that this could be a "Therapy" animal. Our kids have wanted a dog for a long time so this was why he brought her home. They have never really helped me around the house. Everything home wise is on me. I started college last fall and I just started Spring classes Wednesday. Now I have even more responsibility on me. Since I work at home I'm here 90% of the time except for the two days I go to class. This dog loves me. I'd like to be clear there is nothing wrong with her. She is a good pup. But... she's a puppy and it's a lot of work. Actually more than I thought. I am constantly having to get her out of things, take her outside every hour and cleaning up after her. This is normal and I know that. This is exactly why I didn't want a pet. This is why I told him I didn't want a pet. My fish Cheeto is enough. I don't have time for myself anymore. I don't have time to do anything anymore. I don't blame the dog. I blame myself. When everyone comes home, I hide in my room. He doesn't like that I'm just out when he arrives. I just don't know how to deal with it. But now, I'm stuck. And now.... I just want to kill myself. I don't want to do this anymore. It's not that she's bad or that I don't like her. That's not it. But it makes me feel guilty. I feel guilty that I want my old life back.	1642780155.0	s9dqc5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dqc5/i_hate_myself_so_much_right_now/	I hate myself so much right now.
imkq3znp	I posted last week about my dad having stage 4 lung cancer and how hard it has hit me. I am 29 and have a 3 year old daughter who I‚Äôve stayed home with since she was born. Prior to my dads diagnosis I had a new RN job lined up that was absolutely perfect. I was so excited to ‚Äústart‚Äù my life and hopefully continue growing our family. But the news of my dads diagnosis made me spiral. I declined the job offer because I was just not in a good mental place to start such a new change. I am still working let diem at my old nursing home job, though I despise it and it triggers me in so many ways. My dad is in the hospital now and hopefully coming home today, but he is so weak. I‚Äôm just trying to cope with everything and stop thinking about what could‚Äôve been. Or beating myself up for not being stronger and just taking the new job so I could maybe have something to distract me. Idk. I just feel so lost most days trying to take care of my daughter and helping my mom and dad with all of these changes. Not to mention my health anxiety is crippling and I am constantly convinced something is wrong with me and that everyone I love is going to get sick. I am on Zoloft and it‚Äôs been helping but I still am so stuck on mourning how life used to be. When my dad was healthy and everyone was so happy and life was just ideal. It will never feel that way again and I feel so hopeless. I‚Äôm so scared to lose my dad. It‚Äôs just killing me. I haven‚Äôt had any normalcy in 3 months I can‚Äôt cook or clean just the bare minimum.

chxgjqks	So with the building tension in the Ukraine I feel like I need to say this or I am going to scream.  If Russia invades Ukraine it will kick off ww3.  My reasoning is that Russia is almost done with its modernization of its military into a more professional force with modern weapons platforms and new combat doctrine and it has a narrow window to exploit the situation with socio-economic crunch going on will mean it cannot sustain its new military positioning for long term. Moreover its position is a stronger one now than it will be in 3 months, with arrival of weapons and advisors to beef up the Ukrainian forces from Western nations and Poland under going a military expansion after their wargames last year proven disastrous for the Polish military (it described the situation as similar to 1939) as well as Sweden and Finland undergoing a Public shift towards possibly joining Nato because of Russia's actions in the Ukraine.  On top of the external factors are the internal factors of the Russian mindset of having her heartlands exposed. Now by exposed I mean traditionally Russian has no string natural borders beside the Arctic and the Urals, but the latter still leaves a large gap between their southern edge and the great seas of Central Asia. They gap is where the great Nomadic Invasions in history came through, and Russia lost the "-stans" after which not only made a salient into the Russian Steppe but took away the mountain passes on the south eastern edge of the countries which allowed the soviets to seal the passes which would stop any further invasion from that direction. In the West, when the Soviet union fell the lost the narrowest point of the European plain which they have ever controlled and allowed them put their larger armies along a front that they could reasonably defend. In terms of Naval realm the Russian state has no viable access to the wider oceans aside from the Far East in a very under developed and very difficult defend & hold oblast (Russian name for state/province). The Arctic is controlled by many external al factors, with the weather being the least if them, their fleets have to run the Iceland/Greenland gap or the Iceland/UK gap and than the Norwegian gap. The Baltics states joining Nato put a choker on eastern Baltic seas and if Sweden and Finland join Nato than the Russian Fleet will be locked into their port. The Black seas has Turkey on the southern edge (their recent actions are worth paying attention to as they reliability as a Nato member might be shaky) and if Ukraine joins Nato they northern edge leaving only the Sea of Azov as the only free waters near Moscow and that isn't adding the additional aspect the Dardanelle Straits.  And if the western nations are distracted fighting Russia, I feel like China will try and invade Taiwan after its decade long military modernization and reorganization, in particularly the expansion of its marine forces in southern China. And who is to say they would stop there but I am unsure of where they would consider moving against aside from Taiwan, although India maybe a possible ally and regional partner to put pressure on China. Plus the the wild card that is North Korea without the blocker of US retaliation to stop an attack against South Korea.  More over these three players are likely not the only possible actors, but that is where I been studying the situation for the last decade. The strength of this RCNK alignment is that they have "internal" lines meaning they do not have an exposed flank like that of the Tripartite Pact did.  And that is my worry just on the positioning of how things from the situation within Russia and not on the various positions of the western nations.	1642781117.0	s9e3fb	/r/offmychest/comments/s9e3fb/a_domino_of_wars/	A domino of wars

dknd3oi5	It's a long one. But I don't want to burden my loved ones with my ranting.   I just plain don't see how people can be happy. I acknowledge I tend to be misanthropic and fairly critical of most things, but still. It seems there is a constant background "dread" or "badness" feeling at all times.  To be fair I'm an author, so it might just be that. There are a whole bunch of alarming statistics about the poor mental health of writers.   But does anyone ever feel a constant background melancholy? Maybe not depression per se, but like a "nothing matters" type deal?   I'm not a risk to myself or others; in a way "nothing matters" can even be empowering. Make a mistake? Just fix it and move on, nothing matters. Want to go back to school or write a book? Go for it, nothing matters.  It should be said my home-life growing up was nothing short of atrocious. So much screaming, so much criticism. All of it pointless. Do these feelings stem from that?  The weird thing is, I should be happy. I have close friends and also "acquaintanceships". My novel, that I wrote at the incredibly young age of 22, has been read on every continent. I've since written another book, and started writing my third. A huge accomplishment at 23.  I'll graduate college and move on to university this year too. That may sound odd, but I'm in Canada and you can do that here. It's encouraged even.  I'm also 2 and a half years sober off of pot. I used to smoke an ounce a day at my worst. I've also given up drinking.  Written all out, I'm receiving an education, have loving friends AND I'm an author. But for some reason this brings no joy.   It also feels like I'm just an author, nothing more. People are impressed of course, but in a way I don't think I am. The harshest critic of my books has always been myself, and I think the more praise they get the more critical I get of my writing somehow.   Am I looking at things wrong? Perhaps my mindset is off? I'm incredibly analytical but understand and value emotional health and wellbeing. I'm solution oriented and tend to try to "fix" every problem I have, though I have the social skills to know not to do that with other people and their problems.   I have to keep writing and be there for the important people in my life so I must improve, just like I did many times before. Really any advice or direction would be appreciated.	1642781447.0	s9e7ph	/r/offmychest/comments/s9e7ph/i_dont_know_what_im_doing/	I don't know what I'm doing

4fofttzg	We caught covid a couple of days ago, most likely from our sons day care/pre school. He is fine, just a little coughing during the night but no fever at all. Husband had about 40,5C first day but it has now dropped to 38-39C. I have had just a slight fever but my lungs hurt even though I haven't had a bad cough. It's just so heavy to breathe and I just wanna take it easy all day.. but with a healthy, playful 1,5 y/o it's hard to keep up with him.. And I feel so bad for putting him in his chair, playing movies and giving him snacks when I'd rather go outside or do something fun with him in the garden. He's not very happy with this but seems ok after a while.. but I feel so bad for him when he has two parents way too sick to play with him. :(	1642782382.0	s9ekh9	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ekh9/feeling_guilty_during_covidisolation/	Feeling guilty during covid-isolation
cv26ffr2	I feel like an annoyance most of the time. Even when I go to family stuff most of them just ignore me or talk over me. When I do get to talk nobody really responds. Even my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt respond to half of what I say. Nobody respects me, and when I stand up for myself people just get mad. Even when I do nice things for people nobody really seems to notice (which isn‚Äôt my motivation for doing so, but once in a while a thanks would be nice). It really put things into perspective this morning when I sent my mom, my sister, and my girlfriend coffee money just to brighten their days a little, and not one of them even mentioned it or said thank you. I feel like dropping everybody and starting over somewhere else. But will I? Nope. I‚Äôll just day dream about it and move on with my life like always.	1642782449.0	s9elav	/r/offmychest/comments/s9elav/i_feel_like_everyone_tolerates_me/	I feel like everyone tolerates me
hepdxuls	This happened a couple years ago but the guilt has been building up so much that I need to tell someone.    So when I was 18 I met this girl K, and she lived with her mom C in this really small apartment with thin walls, and her mom was using the otherbedroom for storage so K didn't have her own room.  If we wanted to have sex we would have to go to a hotel or something so we wouldn't get caught. This wasn't very often though because my dad only gave me an allowance of $100 a month so it was basically just once a month we were able to do this, which was extremely frustrating.   Over the course of the relationship she would often complain about her mom, always talking about her "trauma" despite the fact that she lived at her moms house and was provided with every necessity she needed. Whenever I pointed this out she would get all angry as if I was the one in the wrong. After two years this started to get annoying, but I couldn't break up with her cause I didn't wanna cause her so much pain. As an empath I knew how hard it would be for her, so I instead started distancing myself from her until it would come to a point where she wouldn't be upset when the time came.    I started seeing someone else that K didn't know so she wouldn't have to find out about it and get upset, and start to lose interest with time. Apparently that backfired cause at one point after a week without speaking to her, she suddenly texts me at 2am, asking to meet up at the usual spot at the hotel. This was surprising since she never initiated this and I would always have to pressure her for like ten minutes just to get my basic needs met.   But regardless I was pretty excited, but I had no money unfortunately. She said she would pay for the hotel that time since I always did. At this point I started to think maybe the distance made her realize her behavior and we could make it work, but while we were in the room we heard pounding on the door. It was C, K's mom.    Of course now of all times she finally caught us. She ignored me but spent ten minutes screaming at K, brought her home, and forbid her from seeing me ever again. She was even forced to block my number.  Looking back, I now realize that this was K's comeuppance. I mean, the fact that I was yanked away from her the second she decides to show too little too late could only be described as a sort of poetic justice.   But anyways, that's not the part I feel guilty about.   Not even a week goes by, and I see her mom on tinder. I swipe right, mostly as a joke. Mind you her mom was extremely attractive. I didn't actually expect her to match with me, but she did, and almost immediately sent a message. My heart was pounding.   We talked for a bit, and kinda bonded over our shared experience with K and how she didn't seem to be that empathetic towards us. I opened up about my parents divorce, and how K would claim that it "wasn't the same" as the "abuse" she endured, despite the fact that it left me depressed for years.  Apparently she was also an empath, which was really cool cause I had never met another one before. She understood my isolation in a way nobody else could even if they tried. (I get being an empath seems really cool but it's really more of a curse than a blessing, trust me).   Anyways, she admits that she's interested in me, which I found pretty exciting cause I'd always wanted to be with a woman in her 30s. That might sound weird but it's something I wanted to experience.   The best part was that we had sex pretty much every day. Sometimes K would start pointless arguments with her when we were hanging out at her house but we ignored her.    The first time we had sex at the house, C told me that K actually begged her to stop telling her about us having sex because she still wasn't over me yet and that this was apparently extremely painful for her.   I found it funny how K was trying to make this about herself. While talking we suddenly heard a noise coming from the living room. It was K crying. We tried to stifle our laughter for a while, then went right back into it.    C started moaning loudly, and I could tell she was doing it to mess with K. For some reason, this made it extremely hot. I know it sounds fucked up, but every time we had sex we would start moaning extremely loudly.   The thought of K hearing us from the other room and being heartbroken about it, while meanwhile I was with her mom having mind blowing sex was the most thrilling thing I'd ever experienced. C was so hot, and hearing the faint sound of Ks cries while I pounded her furiously made me feel a way that I couldn't describe in a thousand years. It was amazing. I'm shaking just thinking about it rn.    Now, I know this story might sounded like a hilarious "epic win", but despite everything K put me through, I don't think she deserved that. I still feel guilty about it to this day. The last time this happened was a couple years ago, and I was thinking of apogizing to her.  It might be hard to understand why I feel bad for K but like I said, my level of empathy is both a blessing and a curse. I pretty much have no choice but to feel remorse, even at my own expense. It's the way I was born, and the way I'll have to experience life until the day I die, but it's a small price to pay.   Thank you for listening.	1642782711.0	s9ep2q	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ep2q/i_helped_someone_abuse_their_daughter_for_sexual/	I helped someone abuse their daughter for sexual gratification
ag84jmc8	Just had this conversation with the girl I'm in love with. She knows I do love her but she doesn't wanna be in any relationship. She'd been through something in her past. Had to life with her grandparents. Mommy was away and Dad was never there.    Starts off with what she would like to be in future(in context of qualities). She tells me she doesn't really care. Just wanna live the life to the fullest. Maybe she has a superior thought process that she thinks this society is fucked up(it is btw). She said she hates Men and Women(many reasons for both). Just wanna do what makes her feel alive. She said people are what you want them to be.   I just wanna be with her man to just make sure she's okay. I can't watch her fighting with those demons all by herself. But she won't let me. Never met someone in my 17 yrs of life (going for 18 in a month tho) who is so true. She doesn't fakes personality. She just bees herself. Will tell them what she feels about them right there. Never seen somebody flaunt their insecurities so well. I guess i feel for her insecurities too. She uncovers her deepest fears too with me. And with every passing day i fall head over heals for her more and more. I want to be with her through it all. Though she might not love me the same as I do but this journey is not less beautiful that the destination itself. I'd love her over her flaws and over her spectacular personality she has.   I guess when you love someone you love their flaws as much as them. And you won't want them to change.	1642783037.0	s9ete8	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ete8/she_is_amazing/	She is amazing.

hh6uourz	I need advice, comfort, just anything,, because I don't know what to do.  I'll add a TL;DR at the end.  Some important background information:  I am Korean, I live in the Philippines.   &#x200B;  Ever since I was small i'm pretty sure that I knew that my parents didn't love each other. My earliest memories are of them arguing, or my cousin comforting me while my parents fought in the other room. When I was around 10-15, my parents didn't argue that much as they did when I was younger, although there were some big fights from time to time during that period. Those fights weren't small, they were pretty serious,, one time that I remember the most is when my mom and dad were drinking while I was at school and they fought. When I came home my mom wasn't home and there was glass shattered everywhere. Turns out, my mom threw a glass tupperware at my dad  and it landed on his head,, somehow (and thankfully), my dad was fine.  She came back about a day later I think?  There were multiple times that that happened,, they never apologise to each other,, they just,, act like their fights never happened.  I feel really bad for my dad,, because from what I know and see from their arguments,, my mom constantly gaslights and provokes my dad to the point where he has no point but to yell. She picks fights with him and gets mad at him over the slightest things. She's controlling, too. She hides money from my dad, doesn't trust my dad to handle large sums of money, and is just generally shitty to him.  I think my mom is a narcissist,, I've done some research and read some articles and my mom definitley fits the descriptions.  &#x200B;  Things were "okay" for about 5 years until this year. Covid restrictions where I live have gotten stronger and it's killing businesses so fast. My parents own a restaurant and they spend most of their day working there and managing business while I stay at home.  About a couple of weeks ago my dad got a cold, and to avoid spreading it, my dad decided to self quarantine in one of the food stall thingies they had. He didn't come home for about a week and my mom was looking after my dad. My mom bought a covid test for my dad and by that point, my mom already caught the cold, too. Some stuff happened and when my dad finally came home my mom started arguing with my dad about why he stalled so much when taking the covid test and why doesn't he want to come home and rest instead of in the little stall.  All of that lead to my mom suspecting that my dad has an affair with one of the employees,, she started asking "Is there something you're not telling me? Are you hitting on one of our employees?" and also some other stuff about her being mad at my dad's laziness and lack of helping. After they argued my mom went in her room while my dad just stayed in the living room. I talked to my dad and he talks about the fight with me. He talked to me about how much he didn't wanna live anymore, and tried to explain to me what they were fighting about.   Turns out my mom wasn't sleeping in her room and was eavesdropping on our conversation. She came out of her room and told me to go to my room, and started fighting with my dad again. Sometimes I feel like my mom enjoys being stressed and picking fights,, because so many of her problems were brought on entirely by her and her own arrogance, delusion, and pride.  The next day my mom decides to stay at home while my dad went out to work. That day my mom decided to unload all her trauma on to me and tell me everything my dad did to her. It was really, really fucked up,, and I don't know if they're true or not. I don't trust my mom enough to believe all of them, but also, who would make up lies about abuse, cheating, gambling addictions, and shady money transactions?? The stuff my mom described sounded so unlike my dad? It felt like the plot to a riverdale episode,,  I don't know what to do,, I don't trust my mom because I know that she isn't afraid of lying/gaslighting/manipulating,, but at the same time wouldn't it be so cruel and dumb and just shitty to lie about all of that and make up a story about my dad to me?  She talked to me for nearly 4 hours and another 1 later in the evening,, and at some point, she just started repeating the same stories over and over again verbatim. I don't know what she's trying to do by repeating it over and over,,  Later on my dad called and asked if we had lunch and I said yeah, and told him we had some soup, then after the call, my mom got mad at me and told me "why did you tell him what we ate?? He's gonna think im just slacking and having a good time and not suffering. He's gonna use this agaisnt me. Why are you trying to make my life hard? Aren't you on my side??" I didn't realise that I wasn't allowed to do that,, I just,,, nmgmh.  That night my mom drank some whiskey,, and when my dad came home and saw my mom drunk he just asked "are you drinking?" paused for a few seconds and just turned around and left. Whenever my mom was drunk she'd always pick fights with people, so I think my dad was just trying to avoid another fight. I just,, stayed in my room and a couple minutes later my dad called me and asked if I wanted chicken,, he decided to go to the local mcdonalds and buy chicken bcs he was hungry,,  then my mom started breaking down and scream crying saying stuff like "your dad just left, what am I gonna do without him", "he's gonna run away and he won't return" and a bunch of other stuff I didn't really understand. I tried to comfort her,, and calm her down, but nothing was working,, and so I told my mom that he was at mcdonalds,, and not to worry because he was gonna come back,, She told me he was lying so I said "I'll go to mcdonalds and bring dad, okay? We'll buy chicken and then i'll bring him back, yeah?" and that calmed her down.  So I went to the mcdonalds and spotted my dad,, we talked together while waiting for our order and there I told my dad about (some, not all) the things that my mom said about my dad earlier in the afternoon. I asked him "my mom said you used to hit her a lot,, is that true?" and he just said "only a couple times when we were both in a really heated argument",, I should've done/asked more,, but I was scared,,  While waiting I tried to call my mom to check up on her but she wasn't answering, then I used my dad's phone to call her and she declined the call,, so we just kept talking while waiting for the order.  When we came home my mom was already in her room with the door shut,, I tried asking her if she wanted chicken but she was fast asleep,, so we just decided to eat chicken w/o my mom. We talked a bit about different topics that weren't about the fight between my mom and dad,, then went to bed.  The next day both my parents went to work,, and my mom decided to come home early. She called me to say she was gonna stop by a restaurant to buy food for me before coming home. Then a couple minutes later my dad called and asked if my mom came home and i said no,, I told him that she was buying food for me, and he told me that my mom left without telling him so he was worried. Then, after that, my mom called me and asked if my dad called me asking about my mom,, and I just thought that she saw my dad calling someone from a distance so I couldn't lie to her,, so I said yeah,. She asked me what he was saying to me in the call and I just said "my dad was asking if I ate,, and If you were home",, then my mom just said "okay" and hung up.  A couple hours later my dad called me and told me that I should've not told my mom in that call because she DIDN'T see my dad,, she was just bluffing and I jghjgfh fell for it,, he told me that my mom took his laptop because she didn't trust him and wanted to see what was in his laptop,,. and that she threatened to run away to Korea with me.  later my mom called me and asked me to meet her at the park. She got the food she said she was gonna buy a couple hours ago,, and she was calling my uncle when I came to the park. She called him for about 30 minutes while I ate my food,, the same thing she told me the other day during her 5 hour talk with me,, and then after she hung up she spent another half an hour talking to me about the SAME. THING.  Then she told me she was planning on going back to Korea, leaving my dad here, and taking me with her,, and I don't wanna go,, I can barely speak Korean so i'm gonna fail my classes in Korea,, All my best friends are in the Philippines,, I'll have nobody but my mom and relatives in Korea,, and i'm not close with any of them (pretty sure my moms side of the family don't like me,, I've only ever seen them once in real life except my uncle, I think he's the only one that cares about me in that family). I'm gonna leave behind everything, my friends, my school, the culture that I grew up with most of my life, my home,, and i'll miss out on my friends hanging out, I wont be able to greet them irl on their birthdays,, and i'm gonna fail the most important years in school because of the language barrier,,  &#x200B;  I don't know how i'm gonna cope with that,, i'm afraid I won't be able to at all and do something bad. I'm worried about my dad, too. We can't just leave him here,, and if we do I don't know how i'm gonna live without him, and i'm worried about his mental health,,.  &#x200B;  after that I went home,, my mom said she was gonna just stay in the park for a bit. When I came home I called my dad and told him that my mom was at the park and stuff,,that she had his laptop,, then he asked me if I was lying and,, I had to prove to him I wasn't.  Then my mom came home and started packing things and throwing away piles of documents and all that was in her room,, then my dad came home and got mad at me for not telling him that my mom was,, angry ?? or,, that she came home I guess? I don't know,, I don't remember anymore but,, He got mad at me for not telling him what my mom was doing or something like that,, then he called me an idiot, a terrible person and an idiot,, he said "I get it, you WANT this marriage to fail and you WANT me and your mom to be unhappy."   @$@#@ I don't know what I was supposed to do ?? I never said that,, I never wanted that,, I just don't ahwkjfjflgkgkdfs;lj i don't know,, what he said hurt me a lot I just,,nhj,,,  at this point, my mom is completely convinced that my dad is cheating, and while she rants, she keeps drawing ridiculous conclusions,, like something you'd see in a comedy parody skit almost,,.  I don't know what to do anymore If I do something like lie to my mom to cover for my dad, i'm choosing my dad, if I lie to my dad to cover for my mom, i'm choosing my mom. If I don't do anything i'm choosing either one of them. I don't wan't to pick a side,, I don't want to disappoint either of my parents. No matter how shitty they are I for some reason still care about them and love them and,, I don't want to hurt or disappoint either of them. It feels so wrong just blatantly lying to my parents,, I don't know what to do. I wish I could run away.  &#x200B;  TL;DR  I'm Korean, I live in the Philippines, I grew up here my entire life. My (probably) narcissistic mother picks too many fights with my dad and is too controlling, and just a couple days ago they had a big fight where my mom assumed that my dad is cheating on her and now my mom is planning to leave my dad and bring me to Korea. I think she's becoming a bit irrational. If she does go to Korea and take me with her, I'll fail my high school years because I barely know my mother tongue, I'll be leaving behind everything I know and love, and I'll be all alone in Korea.  I'm also worried that I might do something bad when I won't be able to cope,, and I'm worried for my dad, too. I'm worried that he might do something to himself. I don't want to leave my dad, I don't want to leave my mom (despite her being terrible,, i dont know whygnmlnml) ,, I don't want to pick a side between them, and I don't want to leave behind my home and friends.  &#x200B;  I'm so confused, I don't know what to do,,. Does anyone have advice? On how to cope with this,, what to do,, or anything.  &#x200B;  Thanks for reading this long ass text, sorry if it's all jumbled and incoherent and full of spelling mistakes,, it's 1 am and I'm out of options huhu.	1642783570.0	s9f0xp	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f0xp/my_parents_wont_stop_arguing_and_i_just_wish_i/	My parents wont stop arguing and I just wish i could run away, I need advice.
7wmlf0hy	I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this and it‚Äôs actually starting to stoke the flames known as my suicidal thoughts.  I can‚Äôt stand that I can‚Äôt be a better person to my little brother(just for clarity I call my nephews/nieces brothers and sisters) I try but it‚Äôs not enough, every time I get mad, or have a bad reaction I can‚Äôt help but think what psychological damage I‚Äôm doing to him, the same way my dad did it to me.  He looks up to me, I‚Äôm the only male figure he has in his life besides his brothers. I should have never been in his life, I should never have had a hand in raising him in any capacity, if I wasn‚Äôt a fuck up I would be capable of living on my own and I would have no where near this relationship I have with him.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if I apologize to him when I‚Äôm wrong or react badly, it doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm honest and explain why I might react badly or how I have to put extra effort into managing/coping. He shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with it.  I want him to be better then me, but how can he when he‚Äôs being influenced by me. I literally have breakdowns about him seeing me have breakdowns.  The moment I raise my voice or have negative interactions with him, my entire day is fucked.  I can‚Äôt even properly get this off my chest because I could fill a novel and still walk away thinking I‚Äôve wasted everyone‚Äôs time.	1642783602.0	s9f1d7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f1d7/it_hurts_knowing_my_mental_health_stops_me_from/	It hurts knowing my mental health stops me from being a better person
dekq86bl	I'm currently possibly in the worst time of my life. I live with very strict, conservative parents, I had tons of problems with them over all these years. Especially mental and physical abuse. And recently, they have discovered that I'm gay.  And despite my age, I am denied from leaving the house except for the school, I can't talk with my boyfriend, I'm not allowed to see him in any way, and I was told to break up with him. I'm constantly being monitored by my parents (unless they're away from the house), they check all my phone calls, they come to my room very often to check if I'm not texting with anyone. I'm basically being hold in my room all days.   Me and my boyfriend are trying to solve this situation all this month. We had a lot of plans which have failed, a lot of people we trusted turned away from us, his parents unfortunately aren't able to help much, we are left almost alone in this. I can't really go anywhere too, his flat is really small and we both don't have much money too... I tried to search for some rooms to rent, but heard only from one guy who is still not sure about renting it to me. I still need to find a job, one that doesn't conflict with the school.  Everything is really hard and stressful. I feel really bad about this all, but what makes me feel a lot worse, is seeing how my boyfriend suffers because of this all. He really cares about me a lot, he's always texting me all days whenever we can talk, always makes sure how I feel, if everything is fine, if I'm safe.  He tries to help me as much as possible, he looks for rooms to rent, he pays them a visit in my name, he helps me with everything he can, he always looks for new ways to help me. He's really worried about me everytime when I'm with my parents, as he knows what they can do, and done.  And... I see how he's really tired and sad because of this all. So many plans to take me away from here have failed. We tried to look for help everywhere but with no success. And because we live in Poland, we can't really get any help for our problem.  I just don't want to cause so much pain to him. He constantly thinks about me and is worried, I know that he does this because he loves me and cares about me, but I can feel it getting into him and really making it hard. I was always worried that my problems would one day make someone suffer...  I love him, and I really want to do what I can to end this situation, so we can both finally be free to be happy with each other. But it's really hard, we still have some plans, we are not yet sure if they'll work. I really hope they will though. I don't want my boyfriend to suffer because of me anymore, he's been through so much, all I want is to bring happiness to him, not pain.	1642784061.0	s9f7sd	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f7sd/i_18m_feel_terrible_seeing_how_the_very_hard/	I (18M) feel terrible seeing how the very hard situation I'm currently in affects my boyfriend.
80ekhuvj	My husband is bigger, much stronger, and a lot better at handling crisis than me. He's extroverted and confident; I know I can trust him to protect me physically and emotionally in many different scenarios.  But he's afraid of insects and particularly terrified of cockroaches.   When we're watching TV and suddenly an insect appears on screen, he closes his eyes and I indicate to him when it's safe to open them again.  When he sees one in person he immediately jumps on a chair and asks for help.   Over the years, I have killed so many cockroaches for him I am now mostly desensitized to them.  Any time I see an insect I know he fears, my mind just goes "MUST. PROTECT. HUSBAND" and anything else doesn't matter. I used to think stepping on cockroaches was way too disgusting and that I'd never be able to do it, but when I was faced with a situation were my husband was nearby and I didn't have any other options, I just did it. I stepped on a cockroach with my high heels and lost all fear of doing it.  I've killed countless insects for my husband; and I love it. I love feeling strong and brave, I love being his hero, I love how thankful he is afterwards. I love, for once, being able to be the one that protects him.  Thankfully, this doesn't affect him in any mayor ways. He's not ashamed of it so if we're in public he has no issues letting people know he's afraid. I love that confidence, and yeah, I just kind of love my husband's phobia.	1642784088.0	s9f844	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f844/i_love_my_husbands_phobia/	I love my husband's phobia
awqdkplx	I don't understand my life.  Two months ago, my soulmate died. Not romantic, but my platonic soulmate. He was my best friend, my family. Before I met him, I didn't believe in spirituality, but it's hard to describe what it was like when I first saw him without it. You know that feeling when you've misplaced something that you really treasure, and when you find it, you feel so grateful and exasperated at the same time? It was like that. It had a "Finally!!" feeling to it. Finally, we met. Finally, you're here! There you are! I didn't know a part of me was just waiting for him.  I could go on and on about him, but the point isn't how amazing of a person he is. Or how we supported each other through our abusive relationships, garnering inspiration from the other as we both grappled with how to set healthy boundaries for ourselves. We were best friends for about 8 years. While some of my relationships with other ride-or-die best friends fell apart over those years, I had 0 concerns with him. Even my anxiety-riddled, trauma-driven depression and intrusive thoughts couldn't touch him. We were rock solid. Family.  He chose to die. There's no other way to say it. We both struggled with suicidality off-and-on, so while scary, his thoughts weren't new to me. We had all the safety nets in place, he just chose to avoid them this one time.  It's hard to describe this feeling. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I feel like most of my body has been cleaved from me. Time betrays me all the time; my every breath betrays me as I depart further from the last time I got to hug him and kiss his forehead. My mountain of love for him inversed into an ocean of grief, and I'm fucking drowning. I can't describe how crushing it is.  So, there's the misfortune part.  The fortune part is, I struck it rich. Just luck and circumstance. My finance person shared with me how much over a week ago, and I just didn't respond. I feel like a rotten kid who can't appreciate what fell into my lap, but honestly, I hate every part of it. If it had happened sooner, I would have bought a house for us. He was between jobs during the time of his passing, and I think the stress of that played a role in his ultimate choice. If I could have taken that off his plate, if I would have known, I would have clawed my way so he could have some breathing space.  All this money has done has made me lean more into the bargaining phase of grief. I would trade that for him, easy. I would rather marry and be raped by my abusive ex every single day if it meant he would breathe again. I would trade my body, my fortune, my health, everything, just if my soulmate could have a happy life.  Now I'm here, lost. Never been in a fog like this. I can't think. I am in counseling at least, and I'm looking into survivors of suicide groups in my area (though those sound depressing as fuck to attend, I'm not sure I want to go to one of those yet).  Since I believe in reincarnation now (my soulmate and I both felt we brought spirituality into the other's life when we entered it), I want to help build a better world for his future life. Honestly, I'm scared shitless for him. I'm of the belief you begin where you emotionally/psychologically left off in your next life, so now he won't have me there, and he could be anywhere, and there is nothing I can ever do on this earth that will guarantee his happy and healthy wellbeing.  My therapist thinks I'm trying too hard to do my best for him and not for myself right now. I just feel so dead. I don't know what to do.  If you read this far, I'm sorry. I don't even know why I'm going to post this.	1642784127.0	s9f8n1	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f8n1/fortune_follows_misfortune/	Fortune follows misfortune
adr9ujnd	Heads up:  This story might be a bit long   I met a guy online this summer through a talking app with strangers. He had a kink or a fetish that I was low-key into. He would ask to send feet pictures to masturbate to and sent his private pic.   We both agreed that everything will be anonymous, neither would be able to know who they‚Äôre talking to and it was all under our consent. Keep in mind that my friend was the one who found him and shared his account with me so we could talk to him. My friend and I made a fake snap account to send pictures and chat with him and he has an account out of the talking app in snap chat that he uses with everyone he met through the talking app just like us.  Fast forward him and I started talking more than just sending pictures( I never sent my feet picture or masturbated it was just my friend and him). He started calling every day from 12-1 am till 4 am. A month after we got to know each other so much , deep talks got us sleeping on the call together and checking up on each other in the morning.  He told me he had a couple of relationships. They weren‚Äôt all healthy, got cheated on and fell out of love in some and some ended in good terms also one blocked/ghosted him and it didn‚Äôt really sit right with him.    The second month of talking my friend stoped talking to him as much. She tried telling me that I‚Äôm going on the wrong direction and this is not the right person for me. It was too late at this point because I was already invested taking for 8 hours a day on the phone and the rest through test.   We argued a lot since the calls would be at midnight or ams. He‚Äôd be online for hours and then call me at night to end his day with me. I confronted him about it and he started calling at night and texting or calling during the day.   My friend disapproved of all of this, she found his insta account his real name and his pictures without me knowing about it. She dmmed him with a fake account and started talking to him, he flirted back but said he has a girlfriend when he was asked. Told the girl he‚Äôll show her around since she said she moved to the area he‚Äôs in recently. My friend then told him she did all of this to show me that he‚Äôs not worthy and he‚Äôs not the right person since I was full on invested and loved him. He told her he knew this account was fake and treated it like so. He asked to call her to explain why he talked like that. She told him I‚Äôm not going to be the one to break the news to me and he will.   He called me that day sounding so devastated, explained everything and said he knew the account was fabricated that‚Äôs why he talked to that girl in that way.  He told me to take my time to think about if I still want this or not and he‚Äôs apologetic.  This all happened when we didn‚Äôt meet in person all online and he doesn‚Äôt know how I looked like and who I am.    I lied about my age, name and where I‚Äôm from. Right until our first date I told him everything.   Fast forward I decided to forgive him and we had our first date. He saw me for the first time but I did see his picture on insta since the flirting event happened. He‚Äôs big on words of affirmation, he promised to love take care and we had a lot of deep talks. We talked like we‚Äôve been hanging out for years and I don‚Äôt think I can describe how alive I felt that day.   He told his best friend about me and a couple of his friends, and turns out we had a lot of mutuals too.  He doesn‚Äôt like going out much so we have dates every once in a while ( once or twice a month). I called him out on it and we had huge arguments because of it. I also talked about how he calls at night only and would be online for hours and not reply to my messages. I hinted and asked who he‚Äôs talking to, he told me he‚Äôs not cheating if I‚Äôm trying to refer to that. His snap score was rising tho we weren‚Äôt talking there anymore. He said he made friends there too and he wanted to keep his identity and so do they so they wanted to only talk through the fake account.  About 2 months ago I found out that he has a TikTok account that I didn‚Äôt know of. He followed only one account and that account followed him back so one follower and one following.  It was a girl, I asked who she was he said this account is really old and she is a friend from university. He quickly changed his account from public to private. When I asked he said he didn‚Äôt want his contacts following him cause he doesn‚Äôt use TikTok much and didn‚Äôt want to be spammed. Though his best friend said he never heard of her name ( the girl he follows).  I gave the benefit of the doubt and decided not to dig in.   On a date he was using his phone infront of me and though his most recent calls the contact he was talking to was ‚Äúthe girls friend letter of her name‚Äù the initial. I didn‚Äôt ask because I didn‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm all up his ass. He showed me his female friends ( he‚Äôs an exovert and loves talking and meeting new people) on his phone and explained if they met through uni or school or family friends. I asked to see the girl when he was done he‚Äôs said she doesn‚Äôt post pictures and she‚Äôs not as active on socials.   Ps. His outings are either with his family or me and barley his friends. So if there is a girl he‚Äôs talking to he barley goes out with her.   Whenever I find myself overthinking though I don‚Äôt have any type of proof that he‚Äôs cheating but why would he be acting like that I feel guilty. So I find myself trying to always push him to the edge or corning him to talk and that I don‚Äôt believe the reasons he mentions. I start to hold grudges and treat him like shit, not answer his calls, reply late or reply half ass.  I wouldn‚Äôt confront him on whats pissing me off or why I‚Äôm talking passive aggressively. He‚Äôs patient and would try to know why I‚Äôm pissed never cussed me out even when I did. And always had a very calm way of confronting or talking to me.  Our dates are nothing but a fairytale every time he‚Äôs such a gentleman in public and private. Always told me I know how to love and everytime I asked to break up because of my overthinking and I‚Äôm jumping to conclusions he‚Äôd ask if we could work on this relationship together promises to change habits I hate, and he did work on it alot.   Today marks our 7 months he makes me happy, though my brain is eating me trying to know if he‚Äôs cheating on me or not.  Is him being online and not replying to me on time means that he‚Äôs talking to her? Though he calls me every single day and showers me with love in every phone call?   Does me not having any type of proof of him cheating means that he‚Äôs not?  Am I overthinking and if is a female friend as he said ?  Does he only want to be with me because he knows I would be there and he knows the girl he‚Äôs talking to will leave him at some point?   Or does he actually love me hence he actually worked on himself and this relationship when I asked him to change habits that I hate and showers me everyday with love and can‚Äôt go a day without talking to me and asking me how my day was?	1642784305.0	s9faya	/r/offmychest/comments/s9faya/is_he_loyal/	Is he loyal?
3z0p09xs	I know. I (33y.o, f) feel the guilt. He‚Äôs (39y.o) nice, intelligent, successful but I saw major red flags in the beginning. Grandiose yet very insecure. Short temper. Sensitive to the smallest of criticisms but doesn‚Äôt mind dishing it out to others. There were opportunities and good reasons to walk away and I did, but his dramatized ways of trying to get me back and fix it were too much for me and I gave in. Partially because I do like him, mostly because I‚Äôm afraid of the conflict. Now I‚Äôm here. He recently threw the ‚Äúlove‚Äù word at me and I don‚Äôt feel the same‚Ä¶I question if he knows the meaning of it. I still see some hints of jealousy but he has changed his way of communicating and being for the better. It helps that I only see him on the weekends. He‚Äôs nice, picks me up, loves spending time with me, we laugh, go to dinners, have good sex. With that said, i can‚Äôt help but to think that this is temporary, things can‚Äôt be undone, and he won‚Äôt be a good long term partner for me in the long run. He‚Äôll lose temper again and yell. He‚Äôll be more jealous. I don‚Äôt want to stir the pot but the thought that I‚Äôm at an age where I should put more effort into finding a life partner got me on the path to go on a dating app during one of the ‚Äúbreakup times/fights‚Äù a few weeks back and next thing I know, after a long video chat last week with one of the potential dates (I call it an interview), I have to make a decision if I‚Äôll go for lunch/drink with him. I already agreed when we talked last week but now I‚Äôm feeling bad and immature for not being able to make a decision. I hate the idea of hurting my current boyfriend. I dread the fallout and him trying to convince me to stay if/when I do. I hate the idea that I myself will regret it. I guess I‚Äôm trying to have my cake and eat it and the potential blowup is making me anxious. I don‚Äôt know why I feel happy alone and don‚Äôt have the need to have someone by my side‚Ä¶if it weren‚Äôt for my mother on my case that life will be hard for me if I don‚Äôt find a husband before aging out of my looks, I wouldn‚Äôt bother with any of this.

9k11khy9	It's like If I go out and make friends or look for a partner or hang out with someone I'll never have things to share about myself cause I've been a lonely depressed mess for the past months- hell, the past YEARS of my life. No matter what I do,  if I'm straightforward and too honest about my life and what I've been doing I will create a very awkward environment that will create a distance between myself and the other person, but if I don't say anything I will also create a distance, but if I lie and fake that I have everything together or that I have a bunch of interesting experiences I will have to deal with the consequences of lying to myself  and that will only make me go back to that depressed loop I've been my whole life. I also feel like I won't be able to have a normal life in my small country cause I constantly bump into people I've met from the past and it only makes me aware of the person I was and I feel embarrassed because they knew the kind of guy I was. I have a desperation to leave to a big big city a place where I can reinvent myself constantly... and accept myself as a gay guy.	1642784839.0	s9fioq	/r/offmychest/comments/s9fioq/my_past_always_hinders_me_from_finding/	My past always hinders me from finding friends/partner (24M)
a4zb4qwx	I do web development, imposter syndrome is common in this industry. If you're unfamiliar, it's essentially feeling like you're a fraud who doesn't have the skills needed for your work. Maybe that you'll even be exposed for this fraudulence and fired or shamed.   Lately I've been branching out in my full time developer job and this has meant learning a lot of new technologies - learning takes time so I haven't been productive in actually completing work and features. This is where my imposter syndrome flared up the past few weeks, which is normal and manageable. My supervisors understand I've been learning new skills, so this isn't as big of an issue.   However I also do freelance work outside of my job. One of my favorite clients who's website I managed just today switched developers without telling me. I'm a big fan of the company as well, they're a local food joint. I'm good friends with many of the employees so it kind of felt like getting rejected by a friend as well as a client.   It feels kind of crummy that my project got canned and I wasn't even told until after, or told what wasn't liked about my website (Client and user feedback was always solid). But the new website looks great, better than mine. I'm sure it was the right decision for the business, but it still feels shitty, like I'm not as good at the thing I spend eight hours a day on as I should be.	1642784844.0	s9fir1	/r/offmychest/comments/s9fir1/imposter_syndrome/	Imposter Syndrome
d709pz8u	I met her on a dating site. We had known who each other was for some time, but were never really in contact. We starting talking and connected really well - which turned into one of the most genuine connections I‚Äôve ever had with another human being.  We spent a lot of time together, a bit undefined, but I was more interested in maintaining the friendship we had knowing that turning it into a relationship could end poorly (I suppose past experience / baggage that was not fair to her). She was my best friend and I selfishly wanted it to stay that way. I was also at the tail end of dealing with an ex- whom was slightly manipulative and wanted to keep me hanging around, but didn‚Äôt actually want me (and I couldn‚Äôt move on).  Over time, I developed strong feelings for her. I kept them hidden to maintain what we had. She eventually moved to a new city and it broke me a bit. One thing led to another and it happened: I decided to drop my anxious fear and enter a relationship with her (then long-distance, which was something I‚Äôd never done).  While at first it was lovely, spending nights on the phone, it didn‚Äôt last long. It was coming into the winter months, and while I hate using it as an excuse for my behavior, it was time for my seasonal depression and anxiety bouts.   Unfortunately, I was not able to handle it well. Since she was not near, I regressed into a recluse, avoiding my phone and other people. The communication between her and I became less as I struggled my way through my own problems. I got the best of myself and things ended; I had essentially ghosted her.   Since my main personality trait is anxiety, I had trouble trying to reconnect and mend what I had done as I started pulling myself out of it. We briefly spoke a few times, unrelated to anything important, but then it was over; we no longer communicated.   Unfortunately there is no excuse for my lack of attempts, inability to vocalize, or inability to apologize. Worse; it‚Äôs been several years now. While I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, I also can‚Äôt work up the nerve to say anything. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve lost the ability to be an adult about it. I know what I should do, but I worry so much that it will be moot. It will likely not do anything for either of us.   I often have long nights thinking about and missing her. I miss my friend. But unfortunately, for one reason or another, I will never get my friend back. It will never be fair to her.   So here I am - venting - and maintaining my unspoken distance.	1643118385.0	sce3y2	/r/offmychest/comments/sce3y2/i_ruined_our_friendship_and_more/	I ruined our friendship, and more
3f4ueq45	Hello,  I've been a scientist for 6 years now. I've worked on a number of projects, some successful, some very much not.  I started as a neuroscientist but have spent 4 of my years as a cancer researcher. Regardless, in all of those years I have used mice to try and improve medicine, and as I tell myself at night, to leave the world a better place than I found it.  Despite my reluctance, my expertise is now in animal models. That is my best selling point when I apply for jobs, which in science is quite often, contracts are short.  I remember when I went for my first interview. It was for an honours position at a very prestigious research institute.  "The role of the Dural lymphatics in edema and stroke,"  I called my Mom before the interview and told her, "I'm not sure I want to do this. I think I'm going to have to give mice strokes and then cut their brains out,"  I was worried that if I started down this path, than I would be stuck on it.  Fast forward to my first year of PhD. I was studying the role of sulphate in the development of the brain. My predecessors had implicated a sulphate transfer protein in the development of brain function. The windows of interest were 1-3 weeks and 10-13 weeks. For those that don't know mouse biology those are weaning period, and sexual maturity period respectively.  A mother and her first litter.  I didn't know which one to choose. Did I take the mother first and leave the pups without her warmth? Or did I take her children one by one until she was the only one left? I started with a pup.   Anyone who says that animals do not have feelings or are some form of r* because their brains are smooth or small has not interacted meaningfully with an animal: or loved one.  She knew.  She knew what I was doing.  She fought me.  So she was the second one to go. And that was my lowest point.  Fast forward a few years. I've lost count of the mice I've killed. Thousands in a year. All chasing that hope of curing some pain.  I tell my students, "do you have loved ones? If they were dying of cancer and the only way to save them was to kill mice, how many would you kill?"  And the answer I tell myself is, "until it was done."  I'm not sure if you've ever held a mouse. I've only held lab mice but I'll tell you my experience. When we get them they are 3-4 weeks old. And they are beautiful. Their coats are shiny, and there eyes are bright.   Then I give them cancer, and watch them waste away.  But the reason I'm making this post, the thing that truly broke me.  Yesterday I was caring for my mice. It my sound weird but I play with them and give them sunflower seeds and stroke them. But there was one mouse.   21LuCap96-118  And when I put my hand in the cage he would run to bite me. I could barely care for the other mice because he was so aggressive. But, every life is sacred and if I was in his position I'm not sure I would act any differently.  I had been dealing with him for months. The amount of paper work for the times he drew blood was insane. But he still hadn't developed a tumour. A waste of money. A waste of time. And he was getting worse.  Yesterday, he was so aggressive that I was bit several times trying to get the other mice out of the cage to check and weigh them.   And when I tried to get him out...it was impossible.  I was angry.   I've always been scared of anger.  And I did something I've never done before.  I killed a mouse in anger.  It was completely ethical. I followed the instructions on how to humanely kill a mouse. Being this aggressive scores highly on a score card to determine humane end point. I recorded it and explained the reasoning. I did what I had done a thousand times before.  But I had never been angry before.   Sad.  Disassociated.  Excited for promising data.  But never angry.  I haven't really slept since then. I'm not sure how much longer I can do what I'm doing. We've made some small advances but the killing is getting to me.  How much different is this than the ancients sacrificing goats to read the signs of the Gods.  I gave my soul.  I gave my soul to try and help.	1643118646.0	sce74r	/r/offmychest/comments/sce74r/the_true_cost_of_animal_testing/	The true cost of animal testing
jypdl	I (28m) have realised that I go through life just sort of existing. This isn't a new thing by any means, but recently I've started to feel lonely instead of just alone, and it kind of sucks.  I have a decent job that I enjoy, I'm financially stable enough to be independent and have my own interests to fill my free time with but nothing I do really has an impact on anyone else, for better or worse. My job isn't an indispensable role, I live alone and my interests are all solo activities.   I like to think I'm a reasonably normal guy, I get along and have no problems interacting with my colleagues and people I run into when I'm out and about but I've never been able to move beyond that.  It's like I'm stuck in a cycle - I'm not close enough to anybody to feel comfortable making one-on-one contact, but I think the only way to become comfortable doing so is to talk one-on-one, which I don't know how to do. So in the end I just carry on alone, minding my own business and hoping someone else will be the one to decide they could be friends with me.  &#x200B;  Thanks for reading.	1643118799.0	sce93c	/r/offmychest/comments/sce93c/i_just_exist/	I just exist.
i8z4fy15	(I used the word irregular because most people have a picture in their minds about what trauma in a church looks like and I just don't have ...that.)  Anyway, my mother somehow roped me into going back to Church since we moved and I hate it. It's not that the Church is bad or the sermons or anything (it's a liberal Church that supports gay people aka me) but it's bringing up old trauma feels. I am so close to asking not to attend anymore but I feel like I'd miss out on getting my mom out into the community which she struggles to do on her own.  But the trauma feelings are hurting me. I feel like I'm overwhelmed all the time. Like people are looking at me and thinking that I don't belong. And I know where its coming from but I can't separate what happened to me as a child from the place I had been in when it happened.   When I was younger, I attended my mother's church which was in another town. I loved being with my extended family and grandmother and didn't mind Church but I hated Sunday school. The kids there knew I was from a different town and that I "acted different" (undiagnosed nerdivergency). The songs we sang had lyrics specifically meant to uplift the community by asking God to help their town (which I still think is weird). Anyway, the kids began bullying me. For years. It got to the point where I began to try and hide away from my teacher so I wouldn't have to go back to class and get made fun of more. My older cousin used to have to drag me back to class for my teachers and still nobody thought to tell my parents or figure out what was happening. Eventually it came out when I ran out of the classroom and cried in the bathroom the whole hour or Sunday school. When it ended my mother couldn't find me and my teacher had no idea where I was despite running out of the classroom crying. My mom was pissed and we had changed churches.   But the fear and the insecurities and the pain, it still follows me to every Church I'm in. It followed me to our next church and forced me to stop attended and it is killing me right now. I don't know what to do. This all had spiraled me into depression that lasted practically all of my school years and only got a little better after I stopped attending church. I'm terrified I'm going to spiral again because I'm attending but I feel trapped into going because my mother hates going alone and only has me.	1643118859.0	sce9qk	/r/offmychest/comments/sce9qk/irregular_church_trauma_and_going_to_church/	Irregular Church Trauma and Going to Church
2q0he4cd	The thing is, I am very much into economics but my university is so dead and has aged awfully. They teach stuff nobody will ever use and I just can't make myself read that shit when i feel inside its just bullshit.  Mentally I can't do this anymore, I literally take every last ounce of will power to finish one exam and i have 10 per year. Idk how am I supposed to make myself do that.  When I'm in the phase of intense studying, I'm literally in depression for those days. I have outside hobbies, i go to the gym, make music etc. , but the burden i feel when i wake up and know that i need to spend 4+ hours over some bullshit material, I just dip mentally.	1643119471.0	scehp6	/r/offmychest/comments/scehp6/i_am_completely_burnt_out_from_my_university/	I am completely burnt out from my university.

7z4y4aha	I think I am over exaggerating because an adult man touched me inappropriately.  When I was 11 or 12, my mother had a guy friend (30 or older) over that she hooked up with. One day, he was over for the night because he had been pulled over by the cops (I forgot why but I think it had something to do with his car) so my mother offered to let him stay over the night. I was upstairs in my room trying to sleep but I couldn‚Äôt as I was uncomfortable with a complete stranger open. Plus, my mother told me to keep my bedroom door open as she wanted the air conditioning on (I was the only one with air conditioning upstairs) even though she was downstairs in the lounge room having sex with him where there was also an air conditioning. I didn‚Äôt change into my pyjamas so I was just sleeping on my mattress on the floor in a dress. The dress unfortunately with tighter on the chest area but not lower.  When my mother and the guy, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúJake‚Äù finished. Jake came upstairs and into my room. He was completely naked much to my horror and laid down next to me. He hugged me and told me he was putting me to sleep. I tried to relax but couldn‚Äôt, not with his hands feeling me up and down. They touched my chest but I moved them away. It didn‚Äôt stop there. He moved his hands lower so they went under my dress and touched my underwear. I moved his hands away and told him I was uncomfortable. He asked why and continued to touch me like that. I kept moving his hands and saying that I was uncomfortable and asking to stop. The worst part was I could feel his penis against my thigh. He didn‚Äôt listen until my mother came into my room and told him to move. He refused but eventually obeyed. After that, he kept trying to come in but my mother didn‚Äôt let him until she eventually shut the door.   Years later and I still remember that night.  He continued to come over after that and tried to go into my room at night but thankfully wasn‚Äôt allowed.   After the incident, my mother told me to forgive him because he didn‚Äôt mean it and thought it must of been her because of my developed body because he was still horny. I still felt really uncomfortable and scared of him.   I know now it wasn‚Äôt true as afterwards he had asked for a picture of me and she sent him one‚Ä¶ of me in a bikini at 11 years old, the top revealing my cleavage. She told me she had an idea of what his intentions were. It was confirmed when he told her what nasty things he would do to me.    Jake was also the one which contributed to my fear of men, despite me now realising I‚Äôm one myself. I feel pathetic and disgusting and frantic. It probably wasn‚Äôt even sexual assault or traumatic at all because I‚Äôve heard worse. Like my mother also told me it happens to people everyday. Am I being dramatic? I should just get over it and stop thinking about it. After all, it wasn‚Äôt.  I know I sound like an idiot to those who have been through worse and I‚Äôm sorry.  How can I get over this one night and stop being awake late at night thinking about it? How can I let it go?	1643119753.0	scel4w	/r/offmychest/comments/scel4w/am_i_being_dramatic_tw_possible_sa_mention_of_sx/	Am I being dramatic? TW: Possible sa , mention of s*x
j0a1l2z5	I'm  45 , married , with a 6 yo child. Since i'm married it just lost all my  friends. I don't know if i can call them friends , because i was never  attached to one person or another , it depends where i lived , or what i  was doing , i just hang out with the people that were related to that  place or job/studies i were.  Now  that i have family , i feel lonely , which is weird , but i fill  something is missing. on the other hand , i don't have time to build  friendship , i don't the energy to socialize , i just want another place  or person that i can talk about my life , but outside the family.  I guess that the "normal" thing. to have friends that you hang out , talk about your life , your problems , laugh   but i feel that it is so hard to create this thing .   I  feel so bad about myself that i left the people i knew behind , and  ashamed of myself , so it just put me down , demotivate me to start over  with them.   Or even try to meet new people   Is this a thing? to meet new friends when are 45?   I feel like many people either have their old friends , either they are just not friendly  I'm so confused, so maybe the things i wrote are not well understood ,sorry for that  thank you anyway for reading	1643119817.0	scelxt	/r/offmychest/comments/scelxt/married_with_child_but_not_friends/	married with child but not friends

45rr86yd	So, I am M(19) and she is F(18). I met her as the bf of my bestfriend's girlfriend. We use to hang out a few times in the month the four of us. The semptember of 2021 I had the chance and we kissed, but nothing more hapenned after that. Well, it had some potentials but I think I ruined them. I saw her at a house party, near my house. I did not have the balls to talk to her and catch some words with her. Also, some rumors went out that night that I wanted to fuck her, and that I told this to everybody, like wtf? And like, what is the promblem with that, even if I did it? Anyway, she felt bad and didn't talk to me for a few weeks. Then we started hanging out again, the four of us as a company. Sometimes she gives attention to me, some not even a bit. But always mocks me in a bad way, like joking about me or smth. She has a relationship with the guy that owned the house of the party I referenced above. Only because he has some money and he is living alone. I have expressed my feelings to her, that I like her some weeks after the party and didn't receive any feedback...Sometimes I don't even care about her and other times...I want her really fucking bad. I made myself believe that I am not in love with her, just to not think of her. I can have other women, and right now I am just having some fun with one girl, but we both know that it is not going any further but sex. Well, I am shy to admit even to my bestfriend that I like her...and a bit afraid that he will tell his gf and she will tell her, and will find out that I still liked her. In the company we just hang out as friends this time. Please help, I don't know what I should do...

bbf08yu9	If we have all sorts of clinics and options available on demand for free or low cost abortions, then the same should be true for people who actually want to start their families. As it stands, individuals who have to undergo fertility treatment often times have to take out thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in loans just for the chance to maybe have a child that they desperately want. This is never discussed in the healthcare conversation. This is an issue that affects millions of people in America, however it is entirely underrepresented, under-researched and underfunded. Improving access and affordability to fertility treatment services is a win win for this country. For conservatives, it‚Äôs very pro family. And for liberals, it is an expansion of health care access and also reduces inequity (think about working class families or lgbt couples). It just frustrates me that someone can so easily terminate an unwanted pregnancy, but those who suffer from infertility have to undergo massive amounts of emotional and financial hardship in order to have a child.	1643121652.0	scf8zv	/r/offmychest/comments/scf8zv/if_abortion_is_healthcare_then_so_is_fertility/	If abortion is healthcare, then so is fertility treatment.
bb92xwnf	We work a very labor intensive job. Its a revolving door of people who understandbly cant do the job or leave for a better less intensive job higher up as soon as they can. So high turn overrate. I also rotate with 2 other people when i give out assignments to 150 plus people a day. I do have a list of names which helps.  I have memory issues and poor facial regonition which adds to the trouble. It takes me a while to regonize someone by face alone and with badge turned I cant see a name. So when I ask someone their name or cant get it right, its because I legitimately cant match the face to the name. Ive never met them before and if I ask how to pronounce their name its because I want to say it right instead of assuming your name because I want to know the right way to say it instead of butchering it. But if I hear it the first time, Ill never forget how to say it. Just your face.   I feel bad I cant remember who they are until meet them 5+ times but its not from the lack of trying. But with some many people leaving and coming in its hard.	1643121766.0	scfaei	/r/offmychest/comments/scfaei/just_know_im_not_going_to_know_your_name_for_a/	Just know Im not going to know your name for a while.

I've been lying about how much I've finished because I am scared of them. They will not understand and they have been furious on me. I told you my true and actual progress because you're my doctor. I fucking trusted you. And then you talked to my sister after the session, fine okay you do that every week. Even though honestly I have hated it. Putting her in the picture of my mental health has done nothing but deteriorate it. Now she knows my actual progress and doesnt understand why I lied to her. How could you??????? Have you not seen how much tears I have cried out of fear of her? My blood ran fucking cold from my head down my spine. You've told her more than I thought you ever would every single fucking week.

aaac1j01	Obligatory: I'm on mobile, sorry for formatting. Throwaway account. Also, sorry for my disorganized mess of thoughts.  I am into diapers and ABDL. Wearing, dressing up, and possibly wetting them, both giving and receiving. It makes me feel disgusting. I had bedwetting issues when I was younger (8-10? Idk. That was a fucked up time in my life) and thus required pull-ups and diapers. I was also coincidentally in the "Discovering maturbation" phase of my childhood. 2+2=4 and now I have a diaper kink. I'm sure Pavlov is rolling over in his grave. The line between kink and pedophilia is uncomfortably fuzzy, and as a result, this is one of my closest held secrets.   I honestly contemplate suicide when I think about my attraction to diapers. I'm not going to actually kms; I just strongly wish I didn't have this kink. When I think about this aspect of myself, it physically makes me sick to my stomach. I don't want to be thought of as a pedophile, or a creep, or a degenerate. All of which you could probably make a valid argument for. To be clear, I do not sexualize children, I do not find them sexually appealing in any way.  I have absolutely no idea how to deal with this. One of my friends suggested just accept it. Embrace it even. She asked me if I was hurting anyone by partaking, and I'm not. However, I'm not sure I *want* to accept and/or embrace it. Regardless, I take 2d4 psychic damage when I think about it.   I had a very detached childhood. I kind of raised and entertained myself, and somehow, I developed a strong sense of masculinity. I don't know whether one of the reasons I'm trying to fight this so hard is because it conflicts with my masculinity or not. I guess I kind of shot myself in the foot.   I have no clue how to bring this up to my therapist or even if I should bring it up.	1643121945.0	scfcol	/r/offmychest/comments/scfcol/i_have_a_kink_that_makes_me_feel_disgusting/	I have a kink that makes me feel disgusting

dakfkjfp	I'm making this post because I want to remember the time where my mind was at the mid-point between freedom and captivity.  Basically, due to mental health issues, my own issues, and the work itself, school has become too stressful for me to handle anymore.  I'm a high-school sophmore if that helps. Now, into the actual post.  Last semester I was plagued with dissociation all the time. I couldn't enjoy anything I liked anymore. Everything became a chore. However, I was still able to get everything done. Before this, I had been extremely depressed and I was using religion as a way to distract myself. I was a religious extremist btw.  I then realized I was gay at the beginning of the semester. For a while, I was okay, but then I felt like I had been abandoned. You can laugh, but I felt like Jesus had been a bigger father to me than either of my parents. With him, I felt strong enough to live in a house where I was terrified of being touched in(I had a brother who would touch me to the point where I always had to hide in my room. This got to the point where I even developed a Vitamin D deficiency because of how scared I was to come out. My parents did nothing.) With him, I felt strong enough to live in a world full of bad.  I just knew when I was gay that the religious extremism had to end. For those who ask "Why not just be a little less extremist then?" It isn't that easy. I just don't believe that the Christian God likes homosexual behavior because the only story of us in the Bible is us getting destroyed at Sodom and Gomorrah.  But yeah, when I left, I felt like I had lost a father. I felt I had been dropped from Heaven. I felt like I was loved by no one because I had and currently have no close friends.  Then enters the one time I have fun...  Everything crashes down immediately.  Due to my arthritis and all of the other stuff above, I felt really demotivated. I didn't want to do schoolwork, I didn't want to do anything. This led to me getting a D instead of a C for chem. I got As and Bs for everything else though.  Then comes the mental breakdown after finals...  Omg, it was just scary. I felt like I had literally lost my mind. I was moving without my consent, it was unbelievable. It felt like 2 seperate people were attacking me and one of them was choking me. Ever since then, I've felt so damn tired. It doesn't help that I have iron deficiency anemia. It felt   I thought I would get over it, I didn't.  I used to only be stressed on the weekends, now it's extending to the weekdays. I can't distract myself no more. My mind is declining every day. I sometimes get really confused as to how I'm supposed to move and sometimes I move without intending to. I get really confused and I have to tell myself not to be insane in class because of how bad it's gotten. In class, it feels like my brain isn't even mine anymore. My head aches so much because of it.  The worst part out of all of it is that my mom got me a therapist at school(not because she cared but because she was tired of me not talking.) The therapist literally had to break the statement of confidentiality because I told her I was planning to kill myself, but my mom just turns a blind eye. However, when it comes to my grades, suddenly I'm an actual human being.  I don't think I can do this anymore, but I rant because despite all this, I feel like I must live despite all of the suicidal feelings. I don't like it, because every day my mind declines.  This sentence will sound stupid, but I feel like Gregor Samsa the coackroach. His family doesn't care about him and like me, he degenerates every day.  To let you know how my mind is declining, I get confused within the first 5 minutes of waking up(either I don't know where I am or I just get really confused.) I can't learn anything, I've lost the ability to do my work at home, I feel constantly like time is slowing or going too fast and when it stops I feel really confused. I feel too tired to talk to anyone irl and what bothers me the most is that it feels like someone else is controlling me. I experienced this during my breakdown and while it cooled off for a little, it's getting worse everyday.

e5hlj10d	TW : abuse, self harm  15 (f) here. So, ive been dogsitting for one of my dad's friends. The dog is a 6 month old shih tzu. I took care of her for 2 days and I got really attached to her. She was always right behind me where ever I was in the house . She is the sweetest dog there is.  By the second day, my parents noticed I had gotten attached to her. They even spoke to me about getting a dog. Much to my dismay, they were joking. I had to return her to the owners that evening. I was sad for a while after returning the shih tzu.   It's been atleast 30 days since that happened and I've been asking my parents when I'll get to meet her again and they keep saying "no". They have a different reason every time ask them why. It's eighter "the owners got covid" or "she's sick". They never give me a clear cut answer. I have a feeling they are lying and making up excuses so I can't see her.   I had a really bad month because of exams and my parents being abusive as usual. I don't know if that dog is even alive. She bought me a little bit of happiness and now my parents won't let me see her.   It's like my parents hate me. They always take away things when they see it makes me happy, whether it be a doll I really liked as a kid or my phone. I have a feeling they are sadists who like seeing me sad. That would explain the relentless name calling, laughing when they make me cry and other abusive behaviours.  I self harm alot, basically every day. The only day I went without cutting was when I was with the shih tzu. My parents saw how happy she made me and still refuse to buy me a dog even though I proved to them that I was capable of taking care of one. They say its so that I don't get distracted from my studies. My parents care more about my grades than my happiness.	1643122335.0	scfhgp	/r/offmychest/comments/scfhgp/my_parents_let_me_get_attached_to_a_dog_now_they/	My parents let me get attached to a dog, now they won't let me see it anymore.

5s5ef6sf	So I just broke up with my girlfriend because I caught her sending naked pictures to this guy. It needed to end for other reasons but that was the last straw. We were growing further and further apart and she ended up doing that because she wasn‚Äôt satisfied in the relationship. I kicked her out and gave her 2 weeks to get her shit. We haven‚Äôt said a word to each other since. Last night she finally got the rest of her things and left without saying goodbye. But while she was packing up I went through her phone and saw the texts, I just couldn‚Äôt help myself. She was sending nudes, planning on hooking up sexting etc. but she was shit talking me like how I can satisfy her, and how she has needs and standards.   I know I‚Äôm worth more than that and this is just her justifying her actions etc but what I‚Äôm most ashamed about is how this kind of turns me on. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the fact that she has this side of her that I‚Äôve never experienced fully or that I‚Äôm jealous of the other guy or what but I don‚Äôt want to feel this way. I want to make her or another woman so turned on like this. I‚Äôm just so ashamed.	1643122871.0	scfoc5	/r/offmychest/comments/scfoc5/feeling_ashamed/	Feeling ashamed
267fh84	My cat Toby had surgery for his teeth and they found a growth on his jaw bone.  It was biopsied and I was told yesturday that it's an aggressive carcinoma.  They told me it's slow growing, but once it reaches any organs there's no recovering.  The prices they quoted me were between $5000 to $8000 per chemo treatment since there's only one private clinic who does it in the area. Recommending at least three treatments to start.  It's not that I would mind driving four hours or helping Toby eat.  I read that cats can do remarkably well with chemo.  It's that I honestly can't afford the cost.  I already took out a Care Credit card for his $1000 dental surgery and I don't even know how I'm going to begin to pay that back.  Pet insurance has been a dead end too.  I've had Toby since I was a child and my guardian refused to get him chipped, vaccinated, or even groomed. It was only after I turned eighteen that I took him away with me after moving.  If I can be honest though, I never would have adopted a pet at all as an adult.  I can't afford to have one, but by the time I moved it felt wrong to give him away. Maybe I should have.  Even if there's no guarantee he would have ended up with a wealthy owner.  Because now he's twelve and it feels wrong to do nothing but buy pain meds, but maybe it's for the best??  I honestly don't know.  Non of my other friends own pets.  If I had thousands of dollars I'd spend it on Toby without a second thought.  Has anyone here been though chemo for their pets?  What was it like?  Did it improve their quality of life or just make it worse?  I don't know what to do at this moment.	1643123088.0	scfr3t	/r/offmychest/comments/scfr3t/i_cant_afford_my_cats_chemo_therapy/	I can't afford my cat's chemo therapy.

g1h27xdy	After spending some time on this site, and reading women's countless bad experiences, and horror stories of men, I feel borderline nothing when something bad happens to them, especially if by some rare chance it's by a woman's hands. I don't want to think like this, but given the fact that women's lives are hell because of men, and men murder, rape, and are just all around assholes on a daily basis, I feel I'm justified in thinking this. Until men get their act together and quit making women's lives suck, I feel NOTHING when I hear they're being raped, or abused, or whatever.	1643123337.0	scfudd	/r/offmychest/comments/scfudd/im_a_man_who_hates_men_to_the_point_their/	I'm a man who hates men.

domkky4v	TL;DR - The recipe for happiness is a hand-me-down recipe that I do not have, and I'm just making it up as I go ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   My life as it is right now is probably the best it has ever been. I have my own place, make enough money to have some left over, and I'm in love and have been for a bit over 2 years now.   I always told myself when I was depressed or anxious before that it was for xyz reasons, but now I'm convinced that those feelings are simply etched into me. I feel like they're never really gone, they're subdued for a bit, and then I feel low and scared all over again.  When I am happy the sun could shine out of everyone's ass, I'm so happy. I'm buzzing and I'm in my element and the sheer beauty of life astounds me. But when I'm sad, I feel like a shell of a person. Literally a hollowed out shell that wind blows through and not much else.  I'm so damn tired of being at the whim of whatever the hell rollercoaster of emotions I'm going to get day to day. I try so hard to stay ahead of it. Self care is very important to me. But when I'm in one of my bad bouts, I have no idea how to care for myself. I know to breathe, to write it out, to change my perspective, I know that it won't last and that I will be okay, but sometimes I'm just fucking terrified that it will all catch up to me. That every year, it's catching up to me.  Now more than ever, I have so much to look forward to, to plan for, and to "hold me over", but I can't stop the mornings that I come home and just cry and carry on. I live it up, I crack jokes with my friends, I let my mom know I love her, and I climb into bed after work and my stupid morning cry to my beautiful boyfriend, and I'm simply scared shitless. It's this echo in my soul of just sad sad sad, and it never fully goes away.  There is so much in the world that makes me happy, and I'm holding all of it so tight. Almost as tightly wound as I am with my anxiety, I imagine. But I would love to feel peace and for it to sit still long enough for me to ground myself. Sometimes thinking about the million little things whirring around me scares me too, because I feel so stuck in this loop. I think about all of the things I need to do, that I don't have time for or the sheer motivation for, and I'm exhausted.   There are people who are firmly rooted in the past, and there are those who are racing towards their future. And then there's the living in the present people, the people who are chugging along, taking every crumb along the way they can get. The taking it day by day people. I am one of those. But I would definitely love to be a "here's what my life will be like in a year" people. You guys are brave. Maybe I'll look at this in a year, and I'll be proud of my progress.  I really try to be mindful of my loved ones, grateful for having food/a roof/a job, and I'm always reminding myself to be thankful for life's brilliance. But sometimes in all of that, I get really lost on what I'm doing, and what it is that keeps me going. So, if I could get anything off of my chest it would be this weight I carry with me. I just don't know where to put it yet.	1643123491.0	scfwal	/r/offmychest/comments/scfwal/aaaaaaaaaaa/	Aaaaaaaaaaa
12bvb6jp	I am a Disabled man and I do a lot of Disability-related volunteering. I've met a lot of good people through volunteering, including a guy on the autism spectrum who really inspired me. Thanks to A I came to regard volunteering for Disability causes to be a form of self-care and a source of joy.  Last February my friend died unexpectedly from one of his disabilities, leaving his friends and family heartbroken and some of his projects unfinished. He had worked with so many different Disability rights organizations that it took three Zoom memorials to include everyone who wanted to say goodbye!  Earlier this month I provided enough money to a Disability rights group to cover membership fees for over 10 people. It may be weird to be proud of this, but I think that the Disability rights movement gets stronger each time a Disabled person adds their voice; I'm proud to help reduce cost barriers that stand in the way.	1643123695.0	scfyr1	/r/offmychest/comments/scfyr1/11_months_ago_my_friend_died_i_just_set_up_a/	11 months ago my friend died.

4qm3yi14	I've been stuck with my narcissistic family because of some unavoidable circumstances, they have absolutely no sense of personal boundaries or empathy. I recently came down with covid and my body feels like it's been run over by a truck constantly. It's very hard to even get out of bed. Constant unintelligible nightmares seem to have disrupted my sleep further, I feel unsafe and have been getting resting tremors all over.   Sometimes I think I can pull it together and finish my deadlines if I avoid feeling too much. But then so much as my mom forcefully kissing me or touching me the wrong way sends me into a panic attack. She seems to have forgotten I've been SA-ed. I don't think I even have any real friends, just people who think I'm resourceful sometimes. Feels like I'm just a magnet for shitty people no matter how hard I try to form meaningful bonds. At least where I live.   I'd like to move out you know, start a new life if the circumstances just allowed it. Far away where no one can hurt me. I don't wanna lose hope. Because what else would I have anyway? But with each passing day, it feels like parts of me are chipping away.	1643123813.0	scg073	/r/offmychest/comments/scg073/i_feel_so_defeated_please_remind_me_that_theres/	I feel so defeated, please remind me that there's still good in this world
14bbm9	The title is what my mother-in-law said to my husband yesterday. I keep thinking about it. We (both 26 and Asian) got married 2 years ago, I have vaginismus so we are still trying to have sex and it‚Äôs stressing me out enough. We are also struggling with finance (his parents are not rich but my family can fully support us financially), but we want to earn money on our own. I‚Äôm so depressed and don‚Äôt know what to do. We don‚Äôt want kids yet, not until we can give our kids a good life, not to worry about money; plus my vaginismus. My mother-in-law and the society put so much pressure on me and I feel hurt by her words. She also said ‚ÄúIn the past, Asian parents will kick their daughter-in-law out of the door if she doesn‚Äôt have kids‚Äù as a threat. She mentioned and pressured us to have kids everytime I met her. When we see my husband‚Äôs grandparents, his grandma + his mom combo makes me wanna kill myself. She wants a grandchild, ok I get it, but it‚Äôs so selfish (and she call us selfish). Having a kid or not it‚Äôs out decision to make, right?

Feels like every road I think about going down in life has a giant locked gate with the word 'NOPE' written on it. Too difficult. Too much competition. Too much effort for what reward?   I'd like to give a shout out to my parents for the mental illness and failing to instill me with personal/family confidence, culture or give me any real advantages in life. In fact it's the opposite. Totally pointless when you're up against it. Total fucking waste of an existence. I'm just here to flail around suffocating like a fish out of water until I die in pain.

49j20awt	I love my friends and the people I have built close relationships with, but sometimes it really suck being one of the only people with PTSD that I‚Äôve met. I‚Äôve learned to get over the word ‚Äútriggered‚Äù when it‚Äôs used to refer to anything except actual triggering events because it just isn‚Äôt worth it to argue over every small thing. It‚Äôs impossible. I can deal with people taking about getting ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù to events that aren‚Äôt flashbacks like a bad test grade or an annoying class. I can deal with people describing an event as ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù when it just wasn‚Äôt like having a bad interaction with someone on the street. Is it annoying? Yes. Is it manageable? Yeah. But for real I draw the line when people start talking about their ‚ÄúPTSD moments‚Äù specifically in reference to visiting a place they went with their ex. Or calling memories in places they went once with an ex ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù. They just aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre memories. And if they ARE something big like flashbacks then you need to TALK to someone immediately. I think people have the wrong idea about what a flashback is. It isn‚Äôt an unpleasant memory. It isn‚Äôt feeling an unwanted feeling about something that happened in the past that you move past. A flashback is a visceral experience that will literally ruin your fucking day. You can just like shiver and it goes away. No. You are sat in your room or on the streets and you can‚Äôt escape it. It is screaming and crying because your memories are happening in real life in real time even if you can‚Äôt recall them. Flashbacks aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù. They are horrible. They are part of an illness that needs to be treated by professionals and not something that everyone experiences or will experience, and it‚Äôs really frustrating to constantly have these experiences trivialized even if they come from a place of ignorance and not malice. I‚Äôm just frustrated.	1643124299.0	scg6gw	/r/offmychest/comments/scg6gw/a_bad_memory_is_not_ptsd/	A Bad Memory is NOT PTSD

gljzjiup	Should I be worried*  Hi. This is a throwaway account. I‚Äôm just lost with how I‚Äôm supposed to feel haha. So this is about my boyfriend and his co-worker.   So my partner told me that his coworker ‚Äúlikes‚Äù him so I was like okay that‚Äôs cute i mean what‚Äôs not to like about you right so I just brushed it off. The coworker is a guy by the way. ( not that I have a problem with that ) it‚Äôs just I feel really uncomfortable just knowing he flirts with my boyfriend. I know my boyfriend is loyal to me and won‚Äôt do anything to hurt me But the fact that the coworker knows we‚Äôre together just really bothers me. he would tell him jokes like bend over and just recently my partner told me that his coworker  told him that he really really likes him, my partner has explained and told him Nicely that he loves me very much and his not into dicks and that he‚Äôs into woman.   What made me upset was. he asked to meet up with us and to smoke up cause he really wanted weed. He texted him the night before asking if he was free and if he could catch up. obviously my boyfriend will take me with him so my partner  told him we‚Äôd meet near the area where we live. And the whole time I feel so upset because I don‚Äôt do well with meeting people and hanging out. It‚Äôs been 3 years since I met anyone and I have social anxiety and I feel really upset because when I say something he sorta like brush it off like he doesn‚Äôt respond to it as much as he responds to my partner. And he made a remark on a supposedly happy memory. My partner told him about the time we were about to sleep and I asked if we could make cookies at 3 am. And my partner finds it cute and a memory we always remember when we eat cookies. But he goes on to say ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs bad waking him up at 3am‚Äù he was also just focused on my boyfriend and he not really interested in what I‚Äôm saying vs when My boyfriend talks to him. and I just feel stupid hahaha I think I‚Äôm stupid for even writing this right now. I know what some of you guys will think. If your boyfriend won‚Äôt do anything why worry? it‚Äôs just I think he‚Äôs being rude to me knowing this is my partner and we‚Äôre going to be 5 years next month. And this coworker also has a partner. So idk why I feel upset. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt make me upset or anything. I know they are just coworkers and friends. and the dude is nice too. But idk how to feel comfortable after my partner told me today that the chef (he‚Äôs also gay)  told my partner jokingly to be careful of the coworker because he told the chef he would pay my boyfriend so he could suck his dick. Im not sure if that‚Äôs a joke or Am I the asshole for being upset for no absolute reason I haven‚Äôt told my partner that it bothers me. I don‚Äôt wanna upset anyone or his coworker. I don‚Äôt want things be complicated at work for him I don‚Äôt wanna embarrass anyone. I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe I‚Äôm just thinking so much but I can‚Äôt stop. Maybe I‚Äôm just a dumbass being jealous for no reason. I also feel hurt that the  was the way he responded to me vs my boyfriend makes me feel like I‚Äôm not worth talking to. I don‚Äôt have any friends. I don‚Äôt take rejection very well I don‚Äôt get treated good with my past friends and couldn‚Äôt meet people for awhile after that. But I thinking meeting him that day made me feel so sad and jealous. Can I just sleep and not feel this way tomorrow? I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm saying anymore I‚Äôm typing this in the toilet. please forgive my horrible English.	1643124868.0	scge41	/r/offmychest/comments/scge41/is_what_im_feeling_ok_should_i_be_able_worried/	Is what I‚Äôm feeling ok should I be able worried about his coworker ?

3nuxqqf	It pains me because I envy them for having all the time in the world and a chance for their future career. They remind me of all the past years of my life I desperately want to get back. When I was 18, I was not considerate and thoughtful enough of my future. I did not put all of my effort into studying, and then picked an useless art degree that I thought was my passion. It turned out that it wasn't and I was only choosing the easiest way for me at that time. Four years went by and I walked out of college with the degree and a feeling that I had been scammed. Not only it taught me nothing of real and practical value in this business world, it was also looked down upon by most of the employers. Job hunting was the most depressing time ever, and I had to accept many undesirable things just to hold down a job: odd working hours, low pay, 60hrs work week, long commute. Every day I wake up hating myself for going down this path. Now seeing all the younger people out there with a brighter future only reflects how a failure I am. I wish I could go back and fix everything.	1643125081.0	scggyb	/r/offmychest/comments/scggyb/seeing_other_younger_people_who_are_better_off/	Seeing other younger people who are better off than me hurts my soul
3wdt9vm9	Every night I fall asleep to fantasies about being beaten bloody, hurt, kicked, punched, slammed into walls, cut open, and broken and I don't know why or what the fuck is wrong with me.   I've got a good, completely normal life. I'm a normal person, bar some anxiety and depression which is treated with low dose SSRIs and has been for years. I own my own business, I'm married, no kids (don't want them) own my own house, have some pets and see my family regularly.   I'm happy.... I think. But for some reason I'm also full of this unnameable, undirected, unidentifiable rage, and it seems to be coming out in these bizarre fantasies about absolutely physically destroyed.   I'm scared of it. I know I used to feel something like this when I was a self destructive teenager trying to get into fights, smoking and drinking myself into nothingness and self harming, but for gods sake I'm 30 fucking years old and I don't want that.    I don't know what to do and I can't talk to anyone about this because I know it sounds fucking mental.

fwdq8s1k	I‚Äôve learnt that if something seems like a great deal, kill the emotions. After saving up for years to replace my 10 year old laptop for uni, I finally found one online. Second hand obviously. I message the guy and he seems legit and I took my precautions and asked him to send a pic of his id, which he did. And I guess having his id  gave me a bit more reassurance and I sent him the money. He was supposed to send me the laptop and the tracking number the next morning. I asked him the next afternoon if he had sent the laptop and his excuses started how his bank account has been hacked and asking me if I could help him out with 100‚Ç¨ to get the account unblocked by the bank and shit. After an hour trying to convince me, I find myself blocked. I immediately called the police and filled a complaint. It‚Äôs been almost 3 months and I have no updates from the police. My bank says they can‚Äôt do anything about it. And here I am dying everyday because I feel horrible and responsible for wasting mum dad‚Äôs money. I know there‚Äôs nothing I can do now but still it kills me everyday and I feel so guilty for falling for it. I still haven‚Äôt found the courage to tell mum dad about it and I‚Äôm just cutting up my groceries to try to make the money back.	1643126072.0	scgu5g	/r/offmychest/comments/scgu5g/i_got_scammed/	I got scammed
83qby2j6	Basically what the title says. I'm turning 15 in a few months and I just really hate my body. It seems still so childish while all the other girls in my class look so grown up and woman-like (big boobs, tall, curvy). I can't even fit into a 32A bra (even though I'm on stage 4 of development) and I've never even had a growth spurt (I'm only 5'0" and all throughout puberty, I've only grown about 2 inches a year). I'm also pretty skinny so add all of that together and I look like a child compared to everyone else my age. None of the clothes for my age range fit me - they all look big and awkward on me and dressing up everyday just reminds me of what a disappointment I am; of how "boyish" my figure is. It really sucks to see all my classmates getting older, filling out and I'm still over here pretty much almost done with puberty but somehow with nothing to show for it.  I feel so ashamed of the way I look. I just want to hide myself. Sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever be attracted to me/notice me if I look like a 12 year old. I know guys notice things like a girl's boobs first but I basically am flat-chested so it feels like I'll never get any attention from them :( It makes me feel like maybe I'm a less of a woman idk it's so dumb but I can't help feeling that way.  I also worry about how my short stature will make people take me less seriously as an adult and it feels like I've won the genetic lottery but backwards. I'm going to the doctor's later this week to see if there's a chance I can still grow but I'm not trying to get my hopes up because I know at this age and as my gender, it's basically impossible for anything to change (started puberty like 5 years ago and got my period 2 years ago). The reality that I'll always look this way for the rest of my life feels too heavy to accept, honestly.  I had so many expectations of coming out of puberty looking more mature and grown but I still look like a child :/ I feel trapped in my body. I wish I could crawl out of it and get a new one but that's impossible so I'm left here just feeling bad for myself.  I have all these overwhelming feelings and I don't know what to do or who to talk to about it so here I am.

54wuoqmw	The same family owns the 2 houses by me and rents 1 of the duplexes I live in. Which is weird enough. But from the day I moved in they act like they own the whole street.  They have like 12 cars and there's never anywhere to park. I realize this seems petty, but it's so frustrating and there's literally nothing I can do because it's a public street. I have asked nicely.  They lie to my face that they'll move some so I have a spot outside my house and act nice, and then play musical cars together so technically the cars were moved and not against city code. I asked my landlord for a paid spot on her property and there aren't any available. She said she would talk to them. Didn't matter. Of course, they have no problem bothering me about my car, knocking at 9pm, coming in my yard to knock while I'm on work calls, peering in my window...I'm 1 person with one car, what am I supposed to do with this commune ganging up on me?   The guy who rents in the same duplex even has his own paid spot in the complex but because they own so many cars, they also take all the street parking. And of course, they're all lifted trucks and modified loud sports cars.   So I realize it seems petty/melodramatic but it sucks so much knowing I'm going to have to have this fight every single time I drive anywhere, and that I'm flanked on all sides by these people. I don't know how to not let it get to me even though it seems really small. This is a quiet residential neighborhood, not in a downtown area or anything.

8rv3651z	I‚Äôm an English education major at an American university, and almost every literature or language class I‚Äôve taken has had something to do with how awful white people are.      Look, I get that white people have caused a lot of damage in the past. In no way am I trying to deny or defend that. But in these classes, it‚Äôs not even talking about the past. It‚Äôs just an hour every day of bashing white people for almost everything they do.      People bring it up every sentence; ‚Äúeverything would be fine without white people,‚Äù ‚Äúwhite people expect others to use correct grammar in papers and that‚Äôs unfair,‚Äù ‚Äúyour white privilege enables you to do better in your classes than other people.‚Äù  If it were another race, it‚Äôd be a problem.	1643127211.0	scha1t	/r/offmychest/comments/scha1t/im_tired_of_white_people_bad_classes/	I‚Äôm tired of ‚Äúwhite people bad‚Äù classes

c4igxepl	Buckle up folks, its a long read. Not expecting anyone to read it, but needed to get it out.  My wife and I started dating in 2006, and got married in 2016. Then comes everyone asking about kids, that's the generally accepted natural progression. Kids were always a sticking point for us, as I had never really given them much thought and didn't fall either way. My wife on the other hand had an image of her future in her head from childhood: married by 20, house and white picket fence about 22, 3+ kids by 30. It was a sore point between us because I really didn't know if kids was a thing that I wanted. When it'd come up every now and then, friction.  Fast forward to Dec 2021.  She's in the second-last year of a part-time uni degree, I've been a full-time student since Jan, living in a nice place we bought in 2017 and have made it our own. I'm thinking that our lives are pretty good: we've got great friends around us, plenty of savings, ahead on the mortgage, in a comfy spot COVID be damned. We're working on our own personal development (uni and all that).  She comes home from work late one night (a Wednesday), and tells me she loves someone else, someone from work.  Me being a bit slow on the uptake reassures her that it's normal to have attractions to other people, wondering what life would have been like with someone else. Next day, I break down when I realise she said "I love you both", not just she has an attraction to someone else. We talk about times where there's been lack of communication, how the whole uncertainty about kids has been bothering her since we got married. We go see a counselor, she stays in a hotel for a few days, I move some stuff to my dad's and stay there to give each other space to think about whether our marriage continues, given my (still) indecision about kids (I'm now 32, she's 30).  Then I find out from her that on that Wednesday in November, she slept with this guy from work.  Over the next few days when she's at work, I move all my things out. I've been living at my dad's ever since. Had Christmas without her, told close friends and family.  Part of me wants to hate her, but I can't. Finding out that someone you love doesn't love you enough to talk to you about a problem and instead sleeps with someone else is the hardest, most gut-wrenching thing I've ever felt. But I can't bring myself to hate her. I guess I'm just disappointed.  Disappointed that we didn't talk about kids for so long. Disappointed in myself for things I could have seen but didn't. Disappointed in her for not talking to me about it, for planning on not telling me what actually happened (it only came out in a serious chat), for destroying what I thought was a solid partnership. Disappointed that even though she cheated on me I moved out and no longer have a place that feels like my home. I may go back there sometime in the future, but it stopped being my home after I found out.  We're still polite, lots of shared friends and interests, house is still in both our names, and she's said that she no longer talks to the guy (I'm pretty sure I know who it is, but don't care. He's married with a kid too). She is apologetic, and wants to try and mend things. But there'll always be cracks, and a fear in my mind of a repeat, and I'm not willing to go through that again.  We've shared more than half our lives together, so many experiences, we grew up together. I guess that's why I think of her as a stranger now, instead of hating her.

We got in an argument about grades and college after my sister failed an assignment for an AP class and our mom told us how stressed she was having us around. We told her that we could live at our dad's house if she didn't want us here, to which she told us to leave.. We're homeschooled but now trying to enroll into a public high school.

56ybxrcf	(17f) i lived with my mom till i was 14. it was great. the best thing i could ask for, we had a bond no one could break and all the time was just for both of us. i had never met my dad because they broke up before i was even born. when i was 12 they started talking to each other again on the phone and maintained a long distance relationship for 2 years. which i can say was what started to ruin me and my moms relationship. during those two years my mom barely had any time for me. all she wanted to do was talk to my dad. it was when i realized i wasn‚Äôt her priority anymore, and as a selfish as that might sound, 12 year old me will never recover from the countless times i got told ‚Äúnot right now, im talking to your dad‚Äù whenever i wanted to talk to her. but the worse part is after those two years. i had to move out of the country with my mom so they could be back together, i left everything behind‚Ä¶my family, my friends, my education so she could be with him. and they just argue and fight 70% of the time . my relationship with my mom has changed a lot. and it‚Äôs never gonna be the same. my mom still cares about me and loves me but i know the first person she thinks about is always him and this has also affected my relationship with my dad i‚Äôm never gonna be able to love my dad the way i‚Äôm supposed to because he took her away from me. i can‚Äôt seem to forgive either of them for it. it‚Äôs on my mind every single day and it‚Äôs eating me up inside because i can‚Äôt tell her how i feel. i can‚Äôt tell her the real reason why i‚Äôm always upset or in a bad mood or why i‚Äôm always having arguments with my dad. it‚Äôs something i try to suppress but it just comes out as anger which ruins stuff even more. i feel bad for my dad because it‚Äôs not his fault but i can‚Äôt help hating him for it.	1643127590.0	schf8f	/r/offmychest/comments/schf8f/i_miss_my_mom_being_a_single_mother/	i miss my mom being a single mother

g4edxfn8	I‚Äôm just feeling a bit down today I guess. As background. My ex-wife and I were together for about 3 years. Our relationship wasn‚Äôt perfect and in hindsight I don‚Äôt think we were compatible but with the news that‚Äôs she‚Äôs pregnant I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm not good enough.  When we found out she was pregnant, there wasn‚Äôt any happiness on her end, she decided to just get an abortion. And while I was crushed, sad, and depressed for a bit I knew that it was her body and her choice.   Fast forward to now, she‚Äôs been with her current boyfriend for a year. It‚Äôs been almost 2 years since we‚Äôve not been together now. And she gets pregnant and they are posting about it on social media and are really happy.   I think it‚Äôs great that she‚Äôs found someone who makes her happy. I definitely don‚Äôt want to be with her anymore and I know I wasn‚Äôt that person for her and she wasn‚Äôt for me‚Ä¶ I still can‚Äôt help but feel like I just wasn‚Äôt good enough and that‚Äôs why she aborted our child.

it2tq35s	Well you can probably guess from the title but I'll tell you more about it.  I have a disorder called Pica. Pica is a disorder that is caused by low iron in the blood, so people try and substitute that with inedible things, like rocks, glue, wall plaster and sometimes grass. But I eat sponges, like kitchen sponges ( clean unused ones )   Its a bad habit that I've had since I was a kid and yes I know I could of fixed it already but the thing is, its because a comfort thing for me now. Whenever I'm worried or anxious I just grab a sponge from the pack, wash it in water and just eat it and yes I swallow it too. Yes it passes through my body just fine.   I know this is completely unhealthy for me and I need to see Medical help for it but at the same time I don't want to, its a comfort for me. The taste and texture is just so mouth watering to me.   Anyway that's my weird thing. But I welcome any questions and advice if anyone wants to.  Also I know this is very weird for many people here so please go easy on me, I accept everyone's opinions but please don't bully. There's a difference between opinion and bullying.

cjpb3p3p	I'm not going to entirely say college was worthless or a scam because it did help me get the job I currently have. There are certainly professions where you need that degree to get a job in if you want to be a professor at a university, engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc. but at the same time, you still need to learn from the bottom at any company you start out at anyways.  I spent four years learning out of date technology, obtuse theory and being taught by professors that were probably drug addicts in their spare time and this was considered a good "college experience."  I think there are so many more effective ways to learn to get a job, rather than spend four years in a classroom to start making an average American income - in my case, I started at 65k / year which is not bad in the middle of America - but at the same time, this is not worth taking on huge amounts of debt for which the average student in the US takes on.  College felt like a huge waste of my time because I started learning all over again from scratch anyways at my current employer. New technology, new stack, new methods of performing tasks.  So why don't companies just have on the job training programs now instead of just making young people "hit the ground running," with the average debt of $37,000.00 for a four year degree?  There are many social aspects of college which with the current post pandemic is now no longer a perk of going to college. Many universities are online fully or hybrid, so you might as well be teaching yourself anyways a valuable skill that an employer might want to hire you for but without the student debt (learning to code is one example where you do not need a four year degree and can make good money doing after a few years)  For the average person these days, I think that college is a huge waste of time and many people would be far better off starting a family, using four years to travel, starting a business, going to trade school or joining the military and learn something valuable rather than spend four years in a classroom learning outdated studies - even in the technology field which you'd think they would actually have updated information in but were really teaching obscure technology concepts.	1643127907.0	schjm2	/r/offmychest/comments/schjm2/college_felt_like_a_huge_waste_of_time/	College felt like a huge waste of time
j0es6y86	I found out my ex was raped by a co-worker. She barely drinks but she said on that day she and her co-workers came together to just drink and talk as friends and since she saw everyone as people she could trust she didn't expect it. He got her drunk. Her memory of what happened was fuzzy but she said he remembered who did partly because the person was trying to make it seem like he was someone else. I asked her to report it but she doesn't want to probably because she was drunk she doesn't know if she has enough evidence. I'm not pressurising her to because I know how traumatic it is for her. She has been abused before as a child, and has other traumas so I've always been protective of her and being careful not to stir it all up. She revealed that this recent event made her suicidal at some point.   When we were dating I knew some of those guys were creeps and perverts and I warned her to be careful. She didn't tell who it was but I know some of those guys. I'm a pacifist but I partly want to know so I can fuck that person up and hurt them real bad. It hurts more knowing that person could be any of the guys I know she works with. Today she said a lot of the guys were commenting on how she dressed today, and how she was trying to 'seduce' them. She said that particular guy was among them. I'm really pissed off that he has the guts to do that and it hurts knowing she has to see him at work everyday. She knows if she tells me who it is I'll confront that person so she isn't saying anything. We broke up because she cheated but I have some love for her and I want to be there for her at least for this. No one should be taken advantage of like this.   I don't know what to do.

gljcmbwg	I know I'm the asshole here. But I just won't change it. I'd like to but it's just not me. We don't live together anymore and I'd rather not waste the time trying to know my children. That sounds harsh. their life is with their mother now. Their life is theirs. It's not mine. I have my own life to live. We just aren't a family anymore. There's no point in trying to know a child I cannot raise as my own. Mistakes were made. As it is I'll be paying child support for children I'll never see or be a part of their lives. I just chose the wrong woman. So I have to pay for the next 16 some years now. That bites. Must have been how my father felt. It almost seems like an important mistake I'm making. It is what it is. Years they will grow up and most likely resent me. Their mother is poor. With those funds birthday parties and Christmas will always be lack luster or non existent. So resentment will grow, because of course I have all the power to change that. I just don't want to. Those were probably some of the worse break up terms possible. Co parenting is out of the question entirely. And you know when I was told when I could and couldn't be there.

6neqj4uj	We've had a rat problem all winter and the landlords have yet to handle it. Roommates and I have bothered them constantly, and right when we normally resign the lease, they're suddenly claiming they don't know how to handle the issue with residents still living here. Based on the timing and my emails with the landlord this is clearly a lie. They could definitely handle the problem while people live here, but they also could be charging significantly more for this place. I get it - money.  Normally I'd resign within the next couple weeks so this is really last minute news. I do have a few months to find a new spot but the real problem is I have a major surgery coming up, a prev. roommate painted the house before leaving, roommates are leaving before the lease is up so house cleaning/fixing/painting is left to me, I have a huge dog, and I really should live alone - I think it's time.  So, I'm going to be left post-op, nearly useless, cleaning/painting, trying to find a place I can get my dog in that isn't a trap house, and crossing my fingers my pup won't flip and become (non-aggressive) reactive from the huge change. (She gets very stressed when routines change and ESA paperwork only does so much to sneak into a lease).  I've been going hard trying to find places, but they're either way out of my price range or available now. I think moving somewhere immediately and then trying to find a sublet until the end of the lease is a big risk for stress and paying two rents.   I don't really know what to do with the landlord. I'm told I should negotiate since their claim is solely based on the rat problem, but I don't know what I can really get out of that and don't want to burn a bridge with a leasing company. Postponing the surgery will mess up the next two years with recovery time. Going farther outside town will wreck my mental health. I'm stressed. I know this isn't the biggest deal, people have worse problems, and I'll figure it out one way or another. But as someone who's making a six figure salary why the heck is it so hard to find a decent place to live? My budget is so reasonable and I don't even live in a major city? US housing sucks and I'm over it. The end.

ierze8ey	TW. Abuse, mental illness, severe sickness  I'm turning 20 this year and it just dawned on me that I will probably never be able to enjoy a real life.  What I mean by that is that since I have been ten, my life has been really bad. I grew up in an unstable home, was neglected, abused and had to take care of mentally unstable people. I had to stop other kids from comitting suicide and never had an adult support me, I was always on my own.   When I was 16 I started therapy against my parents demands and when I was 17 I got CPS involved. However the day I turned 18 they stopped helping because I was now considered an adult.   At 18 I also started getting really sick, an illness I most likely had for a long time was getting worse, and I am still financially very dependent on my abusive parents due to the illness, though I don't live there anymore.  I am dealing with a lot of trauma and can't get a therapist appointement for at least another month rn and my friends, though they are fucking amazing and god bless them, have their own serious shit going on at the moment, so things are rough.   I'm almost 20. I probably won't live to be 30 due to my illness. Is there any chance of me actually healing and enjoying the short life I have left? I don't know. Of course I am willing to try, it's not like I have anything to lose, but it hurts so bad.	1643128348.0	schpkz	/r/offmychest/comments/schpkz/im_scared_of_never_actually_being_able_to_live_my/	I'm scared of never actually being able to live my life

fqggprij	20 years old and I leave my toxic as all hell relationship and move across the country. I saved up some money and ended up so far away and couldn‚Äôt look back. I fell in love with the state I‚Äôm in almost instantly.   I clung on to dear life to a man that wanted to take care of me & provide housing for me - I met him down here & he told me he wanted to help me get on my feet and started showing me around the state. I lived with him for about 3 weeks before some serious possession started taking place. I started leaving the house late at night to get some space & I probably didn‚Äôt act the best. He started to be identified as my boyfriend and that scared me.   But one night I met this younger gentleman that was my age while living with this other way older man. At the time, it felt like what they call love at first sight. In hindsight, I think my subconscious knew that I was in a difficult situation and needed to find a way out.   This older man (21 years older to be exact) went through my phone & saw some text messages between me and this younger gentleman.   He threw me to the street. Threw my carry on bags at me and frankly told me to get the fuck out. I can now say I know what the sidewalk feels like and it isn‚Äôt great.   Anyways, I sat there for a bit. Luckily this state doesn‚Äôt have much of a winter so I wasn‚Äôt freezing to death, but I felt vulnerable & scared. . on the street with luggage and my head in my hands in the middle of a huge city.   I had been entertaining this idea of love at first sight for less than a few days and it had just gotten me kicked out of the place I was staying.    So, I called him.   He knew of where I was staying previously and he was aware of what my situation was. I told him I just needed a place to crash for the night & that I would be out in the morning.   Well, his family took in the stray. They got me on my feet. It‚Äôs been 2.5 weeks. His mom got me a great job, I work everyday & she takes me there while I work on getting a vehicle, they feed me, house me, they worry about me‚Ä¶ as someone who was kicked out of the house at 17 - how do you not love somebody‚Äôs mom that packs your lunch everyday.   Here‚Äôs the thing. This man is so inconsiderate and I don‚Äôt believe that we are compatible whatsoever. He rages at video games while I try to sleep, whenever we go to a nice restaurant he immediately starts discussing how expensive it is, he scrolls TikTok at full volume, everything is a joke with him, he grew up spoiled and wealthy while I grew up taking care of my siblings and poor. We come from different worlds.   The other day I was depressed after a long weekend of making questionable choices and he told me he was ‚Äúa happy person‚Äù who didn‚Äôt know how to deal with such problems. Taking care of myself and my mental health was a huge inconvenience to him and he let me know with his demeanor.   It‚Äôs so new and he tells me he loves me and how he wants to get a new place with me & I feel the need to follow along because beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and I don‚Äôt want to be on the sidewalk again. I also don‚Äôt want to use anybody for the purposes of survival- but I am. I‚Äôm terrified and unhappy but no one would ever be able to tell. How do you know somebody for less than 3 weeks and begin discussing marriage? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt understand.

5ojnaczj	I love my boyfriend 95% of the time.   The other 5% he spends it being a complete a**hole.  I have ADHD and I come from a disfunctional family, therefore I might be a little sloppy, not in a exaggerated sense, but I might drop something in the kitchen (nothing that breaks, I only dropped a glass once) so imagine REALLY silly things that you wouldn't even care about.   And her mum has much probably OCD and she has raised him almost like if he was living inside a feather made of glass.   Well we do things like HE DOES in his house because I want him to feel comfortable, we store the food like he does in his house, we clean like he does in his house, we go shopping the same supermarkets he goes with his parents and a large etc.   The problem comes, when I literally make a some noise while eating fucking SPAGHETTI (with my mouth closed) and he goes and barks at me with a tremendously serious face: That's fucking nasty, Judith, can you eat correctly?   Even in front of her best friend he complains about shit that literally NOBODY cares about, even her best friend has had to tell him more than once: "Dude she is not doing anything nasty what are you complaining about??" And I honestly feel very embarrassed.   He has outrageous reactions to such small things, he has even told me: "Don't do that ever agin in your entire life, do you understand? " For sitting on his chair for ONE SECOND with his clothes on it because I didn't notice, actually they weren't even ON THE LAP OF THE CHAIR but on the BACK of the chair.  And he kicked me out from his bedroom.  So after all these months of dealing with his agressive behavior I told him I was bored of him making a big deal about random shit and that he was obsessive and had anger issues and he HAD TO STOP. We got into an argument and even though I might had been a little mad, I didn't cross the line not even once and tried to be as constructive and polite as possible, I have to remark I had to study at 22.00 because I have a semestral Biology exam tomorrow and I lost TWO HOURS of my life trying to make him understand my situation, because I honestly feel OPPRESSED and I feel like he doesn't notice he's NOT perfect and I'm not telling him "dont do that again, you heard me? NEVER AGAIN. " and getting mad at him for random shit which nobody cares about only because I wasn't raised like him.   He called me a victimist, an hypocrite, a liar, he gaslighted me and when I tried making peace with him even taking him OUT TO THE BALCONY so he could chill and I could fucking go to bed because I was about to explode and call him a fucking crazy oppressive narcissist and instead of doing that and losing my nerves to his miserable behvior I decided to give him a chance to at least apologise for the things he had said. Well, he called me a victimist again and I told him: "look Im bored of this nonsense goodnight" And I left.   Today not even good morning, I of course told him good morning because my emotional intelligence is over his and I know when an argument IS OVER and when It isn't worth it anymore, but he's just so IMMATURE and so CHILDISH and AGRESSIVE sometimes that I just want to tell him HOW MUCH I REALLY HATE HIM AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDS A PSYCHOLOGIST.

4o859lkl	I just had wrote a post about wanting to make friends on one of those subreddits about making friends. I had everything wrote as far as a brief description and what I'm looking for in terms of friendship... but I couldn't post it.  I just don't feel a point. I haven't been able to connect to anyone in years and every time I try I just end up disappointing myself and others with my inability to communicate and attach.  I've chatted with plenty of people over the years, but ultimately, I just go back into my void. I'm tired of being a disappointment and I'm tired of being lonely and knowing if I try to fix it, I just hurt myself and possibly others. I'm tired of being me.	1643128734.0	schuom	/r/offmychest/comments/schuom/i_cant_even_bring_myself_to_try_to_reach_out_and/	I can't even bring myself to try to reach out and make friends.

My mom is older and I help her with everything including financially (not much but I help) bit I do sacrifice a lot of time. I love my family and don't mind taking care of them especially my mom. I just wish my 2 siblings would help at least a little. I'm sitting here trying to figure out her moving situation. It's either do heavy lifting on a knee I just injured or pay hundreds of dollars on movers. I sit and wonder where the hell are my 2 brothers and why do I have to do all of it alone? No they don't live near by but they are aware of the situation. I just wish someone would help or take care of me for once. Thats my rant, feels good to say it out loud so to speak.

iwmbll2x	TW: This may be a SA story, sorry if it's triggering to someone  So yesterday I was with my boyfriend, usually when I finish my classes I go to his house and stay with him, at some point things got kinda hot and we had sex, that was until he accidentally hit my cervix, I was literally screaming in pain, he stopped, hugged me and apologized, sounds like he managed the situation correctly, right? Well, after that I just wasn't in the mood anymore, so we just cuddled until I had to go.  I had to go to my house, I told him about that and he just hugged me, saying he didn't want me to go, but he knows I have a schedule and can't arrive to my house late at night, I just kept saying I had to go but he can he started touching me and penetrated me, I didn't react, I was paralized, my first instinct was just look at my phone to ignore what was happening, and he even asked me where did I wanted his cum, I just replied with a ‚ÄúI'm not even in the mood right now‚Äù and that's when he stopped.  I must say I'm not the most vocal person, and I didn't tell him anything, but I always try to make clear what I want, if I'm in the mood I will go and kiss him and just make a lot of physical contact, but I didn't do anything of that this time. Apparently he did it bc I had told him that we would have a quickie before I go, I don't really remember that but usually when I'm in pain I have panic attacks where I dissociate and am not really sure about what happens around me for a while.  When I arrived home I had a message from him asking if I were mad at him, I replied that obviously and he thought that it was because he made mo go home a little bit late, he didn't even think that he penetrated me regardless I haven't shown any signal of consent, his excuse was that he wanted me to stay longer and I didn't stopped him.  Honestly I was enraged, and during our last discussion I told him that we should talk about our problems and not let emotions control us, but I can't be calm right now, I can't let my emotions aside and I definitely don't wanna see or talk to him again.  Sorry if something is confusing, english is my second language and my brain is too tired to think correctly in english	1643129604.0	sci6nl	/r/offmychest/comments/sci6nl/i_think_my_boyfriend_abused_me/	I think my boyfriend abused me
8alm843b	   Backstory, we work for this game studio and this one particular game and the work was great and we had great work-life balance. Last December (iirc) we got transferred to another department for outsourcing art. A whole new environment, new bosses, we didn't know anyone or anything at all.  I understand there's competition and none of us are really trained as well as the international competitors and of course we need to improve our skills to keep up and we're doing so as fast as humanly possible. But art is art and we can't brute force our way into it being as good as experts with years of experience in say, a week or a month? We barely even have anytime for ourselves (because we need to do unpaid OT to finish work) let alone, work on our portfolios and skills.  So fast forward to this week, we get an ultimatum out of nowhere\* that if we don't reach their standard\*\* in 1 month, we'll all get fired.  I think their logic is that threatening us like that will make us want to work more but we're all already too overworked, burned out and sick from all the stress and some even had covid, trying to make good progress for rushed tasks, all while being told we're not good enough or we're not trying enough or we don't care enough or that they can just easily replace us (which is true I guess). Also in the middle of a pandemic hello- So put this threat on top of all that and we all kinda just felt too defeated.  We considered maybe we're just too sensitive and this is really how it is? It's a CH company so maybe huge difference in work ethics in the sense that we usually prioritize a healthy balance whereas they're all about profit, I'm not sure, this is my first work but the others say other workplaces aren't like this?  We tried airing out our concerns as a group that we need time and they could've handled this better but everything just got deflected and the bottom line for our boss is that we don't work hard enough and "suffering is good" (literally his exact words).  We feel like we're being gaslit into believing that we're going through all this stress because it's our fault we're shit when they were the ones frantic to find talents like us to establish a team here? I would assume they'd invest in the artists they found that's already halfway there instead of just discarding us when we're not the best at the start.  Ive been working at this studio for a year and we've been at this new department for just 2 months and already I want to quit so bad but I'm anxious I won't get another job soon or one that pays as much as this (more than average, the one pro in the sea of cons)  \*out of nowhere because our lead always tells us were doing a great job before when in reality this is what they think of us so zero transparency  \*\*we're given projects that are WAAAY out of our league and expected to be better than industry experts with years and years of experience. I mean, I would give anything to make art like theirs and I AM working on it on my own even if they don't tell me to but it takes TIME  Like, we KNOW we're not there yet and we're working on it because we all love doing art but they keep telling us that no, we dont care enough and no, we dont work hard enough because we go off work at a reasonable time so we MUST not be taking this seriously. We're all just sucking it up and keeping our heads down and trying to improve as fast as possible to keep our jobs but this really just feels like a nightmare.	1643129798.0	sci97z	/r/offmychest/comments/sci97z/built_confidence_in_my_work_for_years_only_to_be/	Built confidence in my work for years only to be taken down in minutes by our boss
j0fkfmmy	I (17f) am a recovered bulimiac and ever since my recovery I've been obsessed with my teeth. I learned what bulimia can do to your teeth and I was lucky enough not to damage them like that.  Brushing and flossing fills me with an unexplainable happiness, I sometimes brush them up to 10 times a day. I'm very scared of damaging my enamel so I have to set up alarms to brush my teeth at specific time not to overbrush. I don't eat sugar and I have a specific list of foods I never eat/eat rarely. The thought of food decaying in my mouth is vomit inducing to me, I often have nightmares of my teeth rotting and falling...  I regularly visit my dentist who says that I have great teeth and I often find myself staring at my teeth in the mirror.  I love my teeth so much. Everything about them is perfect - the shape, the color, the texture... I don't know what I'd do if something happened to them, the thought of that scares me so much.	1643129963.0	scibch	/r/offmychest/comments/scibch/im_obsessed_with_my_teeth/	I'm obsessed with my teeth

j0g98cni	My boyfriend (29, M) lives with me (24 F) in my house. He moved in during covid, and we‚Äôve been together almost five years.   My relationship with his family is rocky to say the least, and is a big factor in this argument, so I‚Äôll briefly explain. His parents are not together and split up when he was 3, and he has had a very strained relationship with his father, so I have hardly ever interacted with that side of his family.   His mother on the other hand I have had a lot of exposure to. She was always rude and disrespectful to me, would talk about his exes all the time, show me photos from their Facebook and tell me how pretty they are, how they are still ‚Äòpart of her family‚Äô. He never had a relationship for longer than three years with any of them. She has said to me ‚ÄòAre you wearing that t-shirt of his to bed tonight? Aw. Ex used to do that. That exact one, too‚Äô and refused to ever apologise. My boyfriend would stand up for me at the time, but he would forgive and forget easily and I never really let go of the grudge. His sister (half, his mother‚Äôs daughter) and I have also completely cut contact, which my boyfriend was initially supportive of, since she had stolen makeup from me, denied it until I saw it on her bed through a gap in her bedroom door, months after it went missing and only apologised (again, months later) under the false impression given by her mother that if she did so, I‚Äôd let her have it back. She was also caught snooping through my handbag once and I ‚Äòlost‚Äô ¬£20, but she wouldn‚Äôt admit to that one.   He also has an aunt who neglected her children quite horrifically (there was a prison sentence) but it‚Äôs ‚Äòall in the past now‚Äô and ‚Äònobody knew how bad it was‚Äô. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth but I‚Äôve always tried to not let it affect a potential relationship with them, but probably due to my issues with the mother and sister, I‚Äôve never once been invited to a family function with them, even though they have dinner ever two weeks.   My boyfriend said that I am too ‚Äòjudgemental‚Äô (perhaps I can be, but not any more than the average person?) and I ‚Äòwould not be able to handle‚Äô his aunt and uncle‚Äôs house, and that I have been asked to come, but he refused on my behalf because of that.   Recently he‚Äôs been getting more agitated about me shutting his sister out, mentioning here and then about how I need to do better and put some effort in, but in all fairness, since the pandemic and the restrictions and the fact that it‚Äôs been five years of me as his girlfriend but I haven‚Äôt been invited to anything, I doubt there will be many chances at repairing the relationships.   This brings me to our current problem, which he is much less understanding about, and I suppose I am too. We are both very firmly on opposite sides of the fence on this one  He has a cousin on his father‚Äôs side that I met once, about five years ago. This cousin has been in prison ever since, and got our recently. I don‚Äôt know a lot of exact details because my boyfriend seemingly purposefully doesn‚Äôt want me to know. I knew his cousin was a drug dealer and I assumed that was what he was in for, without asking about it or my boyfriend telling me about it. When he got out, he had an ankle tag thing, and would get my boyfriend to do ‚Äòerrands‚Äô for him at night, which I later found out was dropping off drugs, and give him lifts often. When I found out, my argument was basically that my boyfriend is hindering, not helping his cousin by still supporting and encouraging his drug making and dealing, and he should be the more responsible, or his cousin could go to prison for it again. This is when I found out he went to prison for domestic violence. My boyfriend told the story in a way that made me feel quite sick, that his cousin‚Äôs girlfriend was deserving of it, saying things like ‚Äòwell she shouldn‚Äôt have blah blah blah‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat did she expect to happen when she blah blah blah‚Äô. It seemed to be a dispute about a child, and she had involved her family and he didn‚Äôt like that? I‚Äôm not sure really. I only get what my boyfriend tells me. Either way he said he beat her up pretty badly, and ended up going to prison for a few years. I think it must be something particularly brutal for a prison stay that long, I know things like assault and domestic violence don‚Äôt always yield high sentences. I don‚Äôt know if the drug thing was also tied into his sentence, but like I said, my boyfriend corrected me that it was for beating a woman.   I am honestly appalled and I find this a tough pill to swallow. Not only because of how awful of a person I feel he is, but how it‚Äôs making me see my own boyfriend in a way which frankly scares me. He is very defensive of his cousin and I don‚Äôt like how he can just look past a violent crime like beating up a woman, as if it‚Äôs nothing, or worse, as if it‚Äôs normal or should be allowed.   Anyway, today my boyfriend wanting to go and fetch him and bring him to my house to help him a DIY project. I said no. I don‚Äôt want to be around him, I don‚Äôt want him knowing where I live, I don‚Äôt want him near me. It‚Äôs my house and my boyfriend pays me ¬£30 a week to live here. I feel bad putting these kinds of limits on my boyfriend, since he is a grown man, but frankly I work twice as hard as he does, I pay for more things and do all the cooking and cleaning, and he‚Äôs currently on suspension from work. I told him ‚ÄòNo, this makes me uncomfortable. You‚Äôve put me in uncomfortable situations in the past and it wasn‚Äôt fair on me, so I‚Äôm setting a boundary.‚Äô  My boyfriend tried to argue that they‚Äôll only be outside, and that I ‚Äòdon‚Äôt have authority over the whole street‚Äô. He also said he is disappointed, heartbroken and that this is an ‚Äòunattractive‚Äô look on me. He also said I was judgmental, and I ‚Äòhardly know the guy‚Äô.   Things got a little heated and I did say something along the lines of violent men should be put down like they do to violent dogs, as I stormed off.   I feel bad that I don‚Äôt have any connections or healthy relationships with his family, and I feel even worse for basically dictating who he can have over at yes my house, but where he lives also. But I don‚Äôt feel I can budge on this one. If you not only hit a woman, but did so so badly and with such glaring guilt that you received a hefty prison sentence‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt view you as worthy of my time, space and especially hospitality.   Do you think I‚Äôm being unreasonable? I‚Äôd post this in ATIA if it didn‚Äôt massively break the posting rules. I just don‚Äôt know how we can move forward from here on the issue.	1643130065.0	scicu1	/r/offmychest/comments/scicu1/my_bfs_cousin_is_the_worst_and_i_dont_want_him/	My BF‚Äôs cousin is the worst and I don‚Äôt want him around me

gw4cvner	To keep it short, I took some creepshots of chubbier women a few times. it sounds stupid, but I often find porn to be overly fake and I like larger/imperfect bodies, so regular porn doesn't do it for me (I don't want to justify it, I know it's wrong). I occasionally visit a website that praises fat women (since I was 15 I think?) and I don't know how to get rid of this fetish. I know it's wrong and I'm sorry. it's been a while but every now and then the guilt comes back and I feel like I don't deserve love. Can I forgive myself? I find it hard to decide for myself. How can I move on and remind myself to never do this again (the guilt is already a reason to not do it again, but maybe someone could give me some advice)?

Whenever I did have friends I was always the 3rd wheel friend.. I used to be extremely shy and I'm not a good looking guy so girls don't want anything to do with me. I recently got a job that's improved my confidence a lot and made it easier for me to talk to people even if I have to fake my confidence but I am still always peoples last choice for anything. Haven't had a girlfriend for like 3 years now and i just feel so alone all the time lately since i have no one to confide in about anything. I feel i fit in at my new job but people only like me because of the amount of effort i put into work and because i will always be there to back someone up or help with whatever. People confide stuff in me but never want to help me or hang out, they all go out together and never invite me or anything.

h229l4dq	We were together on and off for five years. We were vastly different people when we first met. It was both of our first serious relationship. We lost our virginity together.  I had been frustrated and unhappy for a long time - I wanted to get married, yes, but more than anything else, I wanted to have a baby. Five years I waited, though, and nothing changed. COVID striking the world was where the tides began to turn. It was a real eye opener in many ways, and things began to sour. Among other things, he was living with his Mother at the time, and she would not permit me to visit for a very long time.   We always spent time together there, because he has severe cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, and my house was not accessible. I was hurting a lot, we spent a lot of time apart, and our relationship suffered. My heart was breaking.  Christmas Day of last year was pretty much where things fell apart completely. I had come over to stay and when I walked in the door he would barely say hello to me or give me a hug. I was in tears most of the night, and left heartbroken early the next morning.  However, I tried to continue a wary sort of friendship with him, because his Father was terminally ill with cancer. I felt so sorry for him, and wanted to be supportive.  His Father passed away at the end of January. I tried my best to be there for him through the whole process of grieving. I went with him on several visits to the cemetery afterwards to help him get to the grave and lay flowers. I only wanted to help. I cared, but I really didn't consider us a couple anymore.  I met another man in May and was swept off my feet. He gave me a ring on our second date. We are perfect for each other, we understand each other, and above all, are on the same page with our priorities and what we want in life.  My ex knew about all of this. I told him everything.  Then, at the end of July... he suddenly appears with an engagement ring and proposes to me, says I'm the love of his life and desperately wants to be with me again. White gold set with emeralds. He even promised we could finally have a baby. I accepted because there were other people present and  I felt pressured... but, my heart was not in it. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  I was suffering from severe depression, and was even hospitalized from a drug overdose. He supported me through that.  I do believe he loved me, but I did not love him anymore. My heart had suffered and been broken too many times. I do not believe there was anything either of us could have done that would have made the other truly happy.  A couple weeks later, in August... I left his ring behind for my Mother to return. I packed up and left town without a word to anyone, to be with the man I had fallen in love with.  We had a mutual desire to have a child, and I found out I was pregnant a month and a half later in September. We are expecting a baby boy in June.  I'm deeply in love with my partner and couldn't be happier that we will be parents soon. Yet... I still feel sad that I broke things off with my ex the way I did.  He was in contact with my Mother at least once after I left; she returned the ring. Apparently, he said he would always love me, even though, again, he knew about everything.  He did text me once, I can't remember when because I didn't keep it (and deleted+blocked his number). His last words to me were, "I don't believe you would just walk away from everything you love, and the people who love you".  I know it was wrong. Everything I did... I should have done it differently. I was in such a bad place at the time, mentally... I was abusing drugs and alcohol (something I have thankfully since been able to stop), on a steep downward spiral and would have been dead soon, one way or another (the drug overdose was a suicide attempt, though of course I refused to admit that to anyone).  I didn't believe for two seconds that anyone could help me, or really cared what was happening to me. Something had to change. I needed to just... break free, or else, I knew death was coming for me.  I am haunted by it all. I never wanted to hurt him... never... but I know that I did through my actions, more than words can say. I no longer loved him, but I did care. I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for that.  Can I ever in any way, make this any better? I will not contact him directly of course, because I genuinely do not wish cause him any more hurt... yet... I don't know. I want to do something, yet is there anything I can do?...  ...Perhaps, there is no redemption for me. I will eternally suffer for the anguish I have caused multiple people... and it is well deserved.	1643131061.0	sciq2b	/r/offmychest/comments/sciq2b/i_didnt_love_my_ex_anymore_but_feel_bad_about_the/	I didn't love my ex anymore, but feel bad about the way I left him.
2vycztd9	Let me preface this saying that this is from a male perspective.  &#x200B;  Relationships have 2 main offerings.  1. ‚ÄúPartnership‚Äù i.e. someone to talk to, share burdens etc. 2. Improved Sex Flow i.e. similar to smoothing your cashflow, relationships allow you to have a sexual partner on retainer  Here‚Äôs why there are better options  Partnerships are the payday loan of mental strength and resilience. Why is this? Partnership solves a problem you should not have. An individuated righteous man or someone on the path to becoming one should be able to deal with any mental or physical burdens on their own, it is hard, but it is necessary if you wish to become an individuated man. Your own inner mind is the most interesting and powerful object on this planet. Instead of using another person or crutch, enter your own mind, pay attention to everything you do, say, & think. Analyze why you feel what you feel. Notice the different personalities in your mind and start to fortify, mature, & individuate. The taller the building the greater the foundation must be.  And if you choose to use a crutch you will pay dearly in loss of freedom, time, & money. You will spend time talking to the person which could have been used on other tasks, you will lose money on dates, gifts, missed opportunities, and heaven forbid you get married and become successful, you‚Äôll then have gambled 50% of your life‚Äôs work on a coin toss. Most tragically you‚Äôll lose a large amount of freedom which is any human‚Äôs most valuable resource.  Secondly sex:  This one is easy, a women‚Äôs sexual peak is around 21 and begins to taper off after 25, while man‚Äôs sexual fitness slowly increases over time and peaks at round 40-50. Essentially women are buying low sell and selling high. They try to trap you while you're young and have a fairly low sexual fitness and will then divorce you once you have accrued wealth and their asset has devalued, it's basically an investment. Don‚Äôt let that happen to you, let your sexual fitness reach maturity, you will have access to much higher quality sexual partners and you will retain your wealth.  Don‚Äôt fall for the trap, your monkey mind will trick you into replicating and hot women will try to seduce you into hunkering down, don‚Äôt sell early, don‚Äôt listen to the sirens call.

8jszbk4b	I work as a paramedic and I'm so tired of covid and it dividing people. I go to multiple covid calls a shift, some people with mild symptoms- I teach them to take tylenol and advil to help with their fever and pain. I go to people with severe symptoms that aren't vaccinated- they can't breathe. I've started asking them if they wished they were vaccinated, and all of them say yes. Even the unvaxxed people with mild symptoms say they haven't felt this bad their entire life. One lady, who I don't think will survive grabbed my arm and said "you probably hate people like me, I'm sorry". My heart broke for her and I told her I don't hate her, I hate the world we're living in.   With the media and false information dividing everyone, my family included; it's extra taxing. Science holds no value anymore, yet these people still call 911 exposing us to a virus that some people believe doesn't exist. Covid can't be the reason her husband is in cardiac arrest right? "It doesn't exist". He's dead now, tested positive. His lungs were impossible to ventilate, we even tried putting him prone, tried rescue Ventilation strategies- his lungs were fibrous but it still cannot be covid. He died of covid, but no it's absolutely impossible because "COVID DOESN'T EXIST". RIP 44 year old man with a family and many more. Victims of media.   The hospitals are max capacity. My coworkers mental health has declined and so has mine. I used to love going to work but after 2 years of this I'm at the end of my rope. I smashed my hand against my steering wheel over and over when I saw the convoy of truck making their way through my city.

3ga6iow	We do a morning stand up every day at work and I always get picked last on my team to give my stand up. And I don't have any proof, but I just feel like people low-key don't like me for some reason. Maybe it's all in my head? But I've noticed this before in the past on other teams as well.  Like after a while of getting to know me, I start being the guy people pick last to speak. Sometimes the 2nd to last person finishes talking and the team lead is like "Alright is that everyone? Oh uh, BlueMist did you go yet?" and I just can't help but take it personally. It makes me mad and gives me this feeling to want to outwork everyone.  Like, it makes me want to work on the weekends and get ahead on my tasks just to spite everybody. It's not even because I care about helping the company. It's just the only way I know how to deal with this feeling of being inadequate.   Am I just being insecure?

But I want to be with him again. I miss the way he smells and the feeling of his hands and the way he would call me beautiful every day. I feel dumb.

bwv2hff0	TW: abuse/assault  Of all the nights my ex boyfriend forced me to have sex with him, I remember two in excruciating detail. I'm not going to get into the nitty gritties of it all but.. I felt dead while it was happening. I could see him moving me around like I was a toy, I felt nothing. I didn't make a noise, I didn't move by myself. I might have as well been dead. I was not in pain the first time. I just laid in silence, barely breathing, waiting for him to be done. This was well over 4-5 years ago. There's no way I can explain how I felt or what I went through at that exact moment.   But I can feel it now. I feel dead, like my body doesn't belong to me. I feel like I dont exist. I want it to end. I want the pain to stop. I want to live a happy life. I dont want to go through this again.. the therapy, the medicines, the depression. Is it so wrong of me to want that?

i3fzu4v6	TL;DR: My son is biracial (Chinese and viet, I'm white) and his biological father is a deadbeat and abandoned him, so I have no reference to introduce him to his culture.  I feel guilty about not being able to get my son in touch with his culture and I think it's important for him to get to know that side of himself regardless if his father is in the picture or not. I've been raising him by myself for almost 12 years and I just feel so bad. He's got this whole other side of him that he knows nothing about.  I know it's Chinese New Year (I apologize if I sound ignorant in any capacity I'm still learning) and I think that could be a good opportunity to get him to experience some of his culture. Looking for any and all suggestions because I don't know what I'm doing and I don't want to be disrespectful.  My kiddo isn't baptized or anything I thought he should have the freedom to choose religion if that's what he wants. He has chosen to believe in God but his biological dad is Buddhist, perhaps visiting a temple would be good? I don't know what the rules are for that either.   Please help, and apologies if I've been offensive in any capacity.	1643133178.0	scjjem	/r/offmychest/comments/scjjem/my_son_is_biracial_and_id_like_to_get_him_in/	My son is biracial and I'd like to get him in touch with his culture but it's difficult when I'm white.. help!
6no5s523	To put in some context, I‚Äôve been with my SO for about 4.5 years. Over those 4 years I (26F) feel like I‚Äôve grown quite a bit. I went from being a medical student to reviewing for my boards and now practicing as a GP.   My SO (28M), on the other hand, has been through a series of jobs that only lasted a few months and some job applications that got rejected here and there. I was with him through it all. He works with his dad‚Äôs paint jobs on the side but it‚Äôs pretty sparse I would say (the last one was maybe 3 months ago). Careerwise, he‚Äôs still in the same spot where he was when we met. He and I have talked about his career (or lack thereof) numerous times and the last time we had a serious discussion was 2 years ago. During that talk, he promised to do an online course that should have only taken him less than a year to accomplish but he still isn‚Äôt done with it til now. He literally spends his days lounging at home doing random errands for his parents and whenever I ask about the course he says he‚Äôs working on it and he‚Äôll be done soon. Money isn‚Äôt a huge issue for him since he lives with his parents and he does some online trading as well.   I don‚Äôt have the heart to tell him that my mom isn‚Äôt 100% sold on him because she doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs financially and career stable. And I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs wrong. Whenever i get asked what my SO does, I never know the right answer because even I don‚Äôt know myself. Should i even talk to him about this again? I just want to be proud of him but I dont know. I just keep asking myself like is this how he wants his life to be forever? We keep making future plans with each other but all those plans require premeditated steps that we should be doing right now, right?	1643133187.0	scjjk6	/r/offmychest/comments/scjjk6/i_dont_feel_proud_of_my_so/	I don‚Äôt feel proud of my SO

But I‚Äôve been working there for over a year and I am bored of it. I even despise the job and my supervisor sometimes. However, it‚Äôs just me and my friend (I got them the job a few months ago).

izac0cht	This is lighter than a lot of the things on here but man I'm just really scared of always being alone.        I'm 20, I realize that's still young, but I'm really behind in the social game. I'm still learning and making mistakes and growing in areas that I should've done in high school. I don't have much relationship experience, I've never had sex, I'm still learning social skills, and I'm still getting over my mental illnesses. I think I might have autism, too, given my sister was just diagnosed with it, so I'm coming to grips with that as well.          The number one thing I miss about my exes is feeling like I belong in a family that accepts me, because my family doesn't feel like a family. I love my parents and they've improved over the years, but they were abusive in my childhood among other stuff. My childhood has left me with a lot of insecurity and abandonment issues that I'm still working through solving.      I'm trying really hard to improve myself. I've lost 30 lbs on my own, I'm continuing, I lift weights daily, I've been drinking water, I've been learning how to do makeup, therapy sessions whenever I can afford it, etc. But I still feel like it's not enough.       I know romance/relationships isn't everything but all of my friends are in long-term relationships and I'm alone. I'm so scared of being alone. I miss my friends that now spend time with their SOs. And I'm extremely jealous, too, though I'm pretty good at hiding it.  I'm a female that loves nerdy stuff like video games and anime, as well as literature and science. This would make it easy to get a boyfriend, but unfortunately I'm a lesbian. I wish I did, but I experience zero attraction or desire towards men. My dating pool is then already very small, and the other gay women I've met tend to have little in common with me. A lot of women who share interests with me want me to be more of a feminine girl but that's not who I am. Like I talked to this one girl for a while but she wanted me to start wearing dresses and stuff.  Sometimes I wonder if I should just start dating men. Even though sex with a man sounds repulsive, at least I wouldn't be alone, and at least I'd be accepted by my family, and at least I'd have someone to share interests and stuff with. But I feel like it'd be deceptive, to date a man I'm not sexually or romantically invested in. Men deserve to feel wanted too.      I want a domestic life someday. I want a job, a dog, kids, I wanna go on fun family trips, and provide for a spouse/kids/pet. I wanna go on picnics and to water parks and I want to feel loved and love someone. I want to surprise a girl with her favorite things. I want to do fun things and serious things and I want someone to fight for if that makes sense--someone to be my priority. But I'm afraid it might never happen. I'm so afraid of being alone.	1643134079.0	scjw9q	/r/offmychest/comments/scjw9q/im_really_scared_of_never_finding_someone/	I'm really scared of never finding someone.

55hebnro	I just saw another post on here that got me thinking. Due to the nature of OP‚Äôs replies and general experience I am not going to state which post it was as I don‚Äôt want to direct additional hate and harassment their way (but if you can be open minded it is well worth the read and it should be pretty clear what I‚Äôm referencing). That being said, please try to read this with an open mind and push through the emotional discomfort it may cause if it challenges your beliefs. There will be generalizations ahead, some clarified and some not, please do not let that be a reason you stop yourself from taking these thoughts seriously.   Dating as a woman right now is hard. Really, really hard. It is not hard because we can‚Äôt get attention. It is not hard because we can‚Äôt get matches, or dates, or sex. It is hard because safety, in a concrete and reliable way, does not exist. Yes, it is not *all* men. The issue is that there is no way to distinguish between a man who will hurt and a man who will not. Many women (and before you say none that you know- have you ever asked? would they be comfortable telling you? do exact numbers even matter?) have been assaulted by family, friends, and strangers. It quite simply does not matter how trustworthy we perceive a man to be, it is still a risk. We did not ask to have to do this. We do not want to have to do this. It really, really sucks that we cannot trust men without risking our safety. And that sucks for genuinely good men too. When you hear things like this, realize we are (for the most part) on the same side. We want a safe world, for ourselves, but also for our mothers, sisters, daughters, friends. I can‚Äôt imagine that the vast majority of you guys don‚Äôt want that. Please be understanding and compassionate when women express they are uncomfortable or need more time. It does not matter if you feel you are an exception because you are a good guy. We have no way of knowing that. Show us you are by respecting the fact that we aren‚Äôt comfortable or need more time. Respect our boundaries. These are not things that we do to make it ‚Äúharder‚Äù for men to be with us or have sex with us. It is just the only way we can have any amount of control over our safety in the dating world. There is so much of our safety we can‚Äôt control. Please fight with us, not against us. Educate yourself, practice empathy, be kind.	1643134373.0	sck0l2	/r/offmychest/comments/sck0l2/if_you_are_a_cis_man_please_read_this/	If you are a (cis) man, please read this

tlu3r	Fucking hell, I don't even know where to begin.  I have a certain disorder called ADHD.  To treat this (read: to exist in a hyper-competitive environment such as 'college in America'), I take a drug, which, because some of you fuckers decided to abuse it, I can only get in 30 day increments.  Of this, I can call in maybe 3 days in advance.  Now, I do good and call it in early last Friday (the 21st) to my doctor's office, with my pills to run out on the 22nd.  Notably, the doctor's office will be open that day (I call in around 7:30, the place opens around 9).  But fuck me I guess and they don't close until the weekend.     They finally get to my prescription yesterday at 6 pm, after I call maybe four or five times, getting ahold of someone.  Then this is sent to the pharmacy, who don't have the prescription, and because *the pharmacist was out*, it was not ordered for today.  For those keeping track this is three, going on four days without my prescription, because my life is a joke.  Thankfully I have boosters, but 1) they do not do *nearly* as much, B) they are meant to be taken alongside my original drug, as a sort of second wind, and Delta) I don't exactly have a metric ton of them, considering *THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.*  The last time this happened, and every time since, I've had an hour plus long experience because:  \- The doctor sent it to the wrong pharmacy  \- Because of insurance, writing 'Brand Only' on my prescription does not necessarily imply that I will be able to get Brand Only.  Instead, the doctor needs to write DAW, something that, because I go to school out of state, he has decided never to do.  This of course is only compounded by the fact that everyone who works at the pharmacy only looks for DAW, and not the 'Brand Only' demarcation on the prescription.  Else my co-pay would go from 10$ to 400$.  \- The system that prevents me from getting this drug says I've refilled this drug within 27 days, when I haven't.  \- The store was closed due to labor shortages  \- I could not get my prescription refilled because the dosage I take plus the booster exceeds 60mg, the federal cap for people my age, thus one time I was denied my doctor-prescribed medication because 'it was dangerous to my health to take both at once' - something I've never done.  \- I simply was not told that my booster prescription was sent in, leading to it expiring before I could do anything.  \- They only having 20 pills, which, excuse me *how the fuck*  &#x200B;  Anyway this could be extremely petty but frankly getting my shit kicked in once a month regularly by the only pharmacy that I would trust to order this prescription in reasonable walking distance is the reason why I support government health care or whatever the fuck.	1643134632.0	sck486	/r/offmychest/comments/sck486/im_fucking_sick_of_this_monthly_shitshow_with_my/	I'm fucking sick of this monthly shitshow with my prescription

8ki21bj1	&#x200B;  When I was 14, I had this friend, his name was Mai. We were pretty good friends in a sort of awkward ambience, we had all of our classes together but we wouldn't talk much, in class we would stare at each other a lot. My seat was always far and behind from his yet I would always catch him looking back at me, that wasn't really the awkward part though it was comforting and kind of a tradition between us. Our lockers were right next to each other yet we never really talked, though sometimes we would sit next to each other and I would play with his hair. Sometimes he would steal or hide my pencil case, probably to get my attention now that I think of it, but we were truly best friends, although we didn't talk much in school, i always wanted to talk to him more and eat lunch with him but i was nervous, he was always with his friends and i was with mine. We did text a lot, like a lot. Every day we would text and talk about nothing, everything, and anything. I truly loved and cherished our friendship.   It was so heartbreaking when i found out that he didn't. One week we had this project due, he would do one part and I would do the other, I guess it all went downhill from there. He sent me a bunch of texts telling me how much he hates and despises me. I remember reading them and balling and crying myself to sleep and waking up in the morning with puffy eyes and then seeing that you sent me more texts, they were screenshots of a conversation you had with your friend about me and you guys were just bashing me and making fun of me, then i was balling again. I remember you telling me that I was too sensitive or that I acted sensitive and that I was annoying and you hated the way I talked. And then I had to go to school, the place I hated the most, but kind of loved because you made it better, trying to avoid the unavoidable, you. I would see you on the bus, and then see you at the lockers, and then see you in every class and you would still stare at me making me want to cry and die everytime i caught your eyes on me.   The worst part is when we had ethics and i had to give a presentation and while already anxious and stressed about talking in front of the class it was worse because you were there and because you were looking at me like nothing had happened between us. So when i went up i was shaking, my body was shaking, my voice was shaking and i had to talk all while trying to avoid you looking at me, and it was humiliating. You were the only person in the world I felt comfortable enough with to be vulnerable with and be myself with. It's like I was a crab in a shell on the beach; and I was just coming out of my shell with you and you kicked me all the way back into the shell, stomped on the shell, then kicked it back into the ocean. As dramatic as it sounds, that's how it felt.  And then after all of that you said that you were just testing me to see how i would react and i forgave you but im only now realizing how fucked up that is, you acted like nothing happened after that until i brought it up. I honestly felt crushed by you and you didn't care at all, or at least you didn't show it to me. I know that I should be over it, and I'm trying but till this day, since my recent realization, it still affects me. I can't really look people in the eyes, I have trust issues, I can't open up to people because I fear getting the same reaction that you gave me and for the longest time I had a huge anxiety of being judged by people. I was scared to share stories of random posts and thoughts and pictures of myself, because i felt like you would judge me‚Ä¶. While im still trying to fix myself and change those things, i still find myself avoiding being myself and worrying about what people think of me even when it comes to stupid little things that dont affect them in any way.  And while learning how to be myself i've learned that it's okay to let things go, although i sometimes miss my ex best friend, it feels like i've been holding on to our friendship since i forgave you, but i don't see how we can still be friends knowing that i was just a test subject for your own pleasure, or whatever you gained from that and knowing that you never cared about how it affected me.	1643134682.0	sck4xd	/r/offmychest/comments/sck4xd/a_letter_to_mai_ex_best_friend/	A letter to Mai ex best friend..
553lgiti	This is coming from someone who has experienced both anxiety and depression. I deal with both but I still respect other people and I'm still kind to everyone.  That being said, I absolutely cannot STAND when people use their mental health issues as an excuse to treat everyone like shit. My father, for example, blames everyone but himself for his issues and abuses his entire family (myself included). He uses anxiety as an excuse but I think that's bullshit. I get it, anxiety is horrible and can literally ruin people's lives, but that is NO REASON to abuse everyone else who cares and has done everything to help.  Btw, I'm not disregarding people who have anxiety/depression, but it certainly is not an excuse for abuse.	1643134773.0	sck664	/r/offmychest/comments/sck664/having_mental_health_issues_is_no_excuse_for/	Having mental health issues is NO excuse for being an asshole.

I notice all of this because I take selfie‚Äôs everyday but I don‚Äôt understand how I look ok in the mirror but like shit on camera. And then people tell me I‚Äôm attractive. I use four different beauty apps and they all say I‚Äôm attractive. I kid you not, Everytime I use them I laugh my ass off into oblivion. Funny part is other people use them and they tell me they get lower scores than I do so they think those apps are accurate but I think they‚Äôre all bullshit.

i3lb2vao	TW? possible SA    I'm not even sure if this is the right place to talk about it, but I honestly don't know who to even talk to.  When I was about 10, I would get groped by my father. I would try to stop it and he'd just force my hands out of the way or touch me when I slept.  I told him I was uncomfortable with it at the time and he told me it's because we were close and that he just wanted to see how much I was developing, another time he apologised and said he'd stop but didn't.  I ended up confiding in my mother and she didn't believe me, but she asked my father and he said that he did do it and it wasn't brought up after that and continued to happen.  I just don't know if this is normal, I feel like it isn't but I don't know if I'm being dramatic. I'm 20 now and it only seems to affect me more and I'm just so lost.

99lqvs6v	I‚Äôve never posted on here before. This is me getting my story out. Sorry for typing errors. I am on my phone and rereading this post is painful.  When I was 35 weeks pregnant with my now 5 month daughter, my father was killed in a horrific, preventable work place accident. This was my father‚Äôs first grandchild and he was so excited to be a grandpa. His death has absolutely shattered my family.  That morning in July of 2021 started out like every other morning for my dad. He arrived to work and began his day. Early that morning, a supply truck arrived transporting some insulation supplies. As the truck was pulling out to leave, my dad ran out to grab a few more items off the truck. The truck was front facing the road and ready to pull out of the parking lot. The driver, an illegal immigrant without a drivers license, while driving a company vehicle (this large multi state company), decided to throw the truck in reverse, while blasting music as loud as the truck radio went, and backed up going approximately 20 miles per hour. The box truck had no back up lights, one broken tail light, and no beeping sounds when in reverse. My father was killed within 2 seconds. We know it was two seconds because there is a video of his death. Instead of calling 911, the driver called his boss first. By the time the ambulance arrived my dad was pronounced dead on arrival.   The driver is only being charged with misdemeanor death because in my state it‚Äôs legal to drive without a license on private property. Because he is a first time offender, he will receive no jail time. He is receiving probation and community service. The fact that he has no license will not be considered in his sentence due to no crime being committed. The fact that he is illegal is also irrelevant to the case. The only reason I bring it up is because he should have not been hired by this company per their own HR protocol.   The day my dad died I had to go to labor and delivery to prevent preterm labor. While there, they prescribed an anti anxiety medication to help me get through the following days and the funeral. My pulse was around 170 bpm while resting. I was having a a panic attack. It wasn‚Äôt a narcotic. It was just hydroxyzine. But the next day when I went to pick the medication from the pharmacy, the pharm tech refused to give it to me. She was convinced the doctors didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant and that pregnant women should not take this medication. She told me the medication would hurt my baby. She was very mean and rude. She wanted to wait until she could verify with the prescriber that they knew I was pregnant before giving it to me. So there I was crying in CVS telling a stranger my dad was killed the day before and even though this med isn‚Äôt typically given to pregnant women there was a reason it had been prescribed for me.  OSHA did their report and the company was only fined $12,000.   February 17th is the official court date where he will plead guilty. I will read a victim impact statement in court.  My step mom has taken all the money from life insurance and workers comp. We get nothing as we are both grown and not his dependents. We are suing the company for wrongful death. If this lawsuit goes through that is the only way my sister and I will get any money as we will be legally entitled to it.   I‚Äôm angry. Stressed. I have ptsd. I couldn‚Äôt breastfeed my child because she was born 4 weeks after he died and the stress of everything prevented my ability to produce milk.   There‚Äôs my story. 6 months later I found the courage to write it all out.	1643135937.0	sckm1u	/r/offmychest/comments/sckm1u/the_man_who_killed_my_father_when_i_was_35_weeks/	The man who killed my father when I was 35 weeks pregnant is getting probation and no jail time

izr7mqvx	I'm young still in high school my boyfriend is practically a senior in college. I met him online through Snapchat and 2 years later he's ghosting me. In 2020 everything was amazing he acted like a normal boyfriend and reminded me daily that he loved me. We did normal things fell asleep on calls, watched movies, had light conversations, compliment each other. He said he wouldn't leave and I was young and dumb and believed him. I thought he'd at least break up with me like a normal person. Instead he ghosted me after 2 YEARS.  He started ghosting me and fading around September but came back and made excuses that he was hurt and I believed him due to well health issues. Each time he ghosted me it lasted for about 2 weeks at that point he only ghosted me twice. The last time it was for a month he randomly dipped out of the blue when we were doing amazing and talking about getting each other gifts. I got him back after a month. I told him 2022 I wanted it to be a new year for us 7 days in on his birthday because he was a bit distant and he spent time with me for 5-7 days and actually acted interested but again he got distant for no reason and has now again dipped. I forgave him each time because I missed the memories not the person he had become. I kept hoping he'd turn into the guy who constantly said he wanted to marry me and actually cared about me.   I don't expect anyone to understand why I forgave him 3 times but I did. I told him mentally I cannot handle ghosting as I'm extremely depressed like rock bottom depressed. I told him when he does that I don't feel safe by myself if you get the hint. However I told him if he ever wanted to break up that is 100% okay and I even encouraged it if he was feeling he wasn't interested anymore. I told him I'd 100% okay with breaking up if he told me but I'm not okay with ghosting. I guess I just don't matter to him anymore. I feel like he played with my feelings. I gave him things I've never given anyone else and trusted him 100%. My first relationship, he was my first love, it lasted 2 years, and he became another person and ghosted me. I don't know what happened to "I'll never leave you baby" to nothing but silence. I really love him but I don't deserve that.	1643136136.0	sckon3	/r/offmychest/comments/sckon3/i_was_ghosted_and_groomed/	I was ghosted and groomed

e0vigih1	For clarity I am referring to white collar work in the US. My first professional job was for a very large corporation you've all heard of. I interviewed in the early fall of 2011 and never heard anything back so figured I didn't get the job. Then in December they called and asked if I could start in January. Hoorah! Sure thing. Come to find out after I started they got rid of pensions effective Jan 1. When I quit a few years later all of my older coworkers were flabbergasted that I would leave, I pointed out I have no pension...they did. Every company I have worked at since has had no pension, yet my older (50s and up) coworkers did. I work in accounting so had the sick pleasure of having to account for the pensions I didn't get. So due to covid my local government has had a lot of retirements and I see the perfect opportunity to finally get a decent shot at a retirement, apply, get an interview and offer....they just got rid of pensions. Apparently people applying now are the first to give them the feedback.... Why would I take a City job that pays way less if there wasn't even a pension. My entire career I've been surrounded by boomers with amazing retirement packages while their generation profits by axing those same benefits for us. Given the insane housing market, the tiny 401k match that requires ME to contribute first, and the rising costs of everything we are headed to a massive shit show where an entire generation will have very little to live off of if they're even lucky to retire. That scenario is exactly what spurred the creation of Social Security in the first place...oh which hasn't been properly maintained so you can expect a check just large enough to cover your utilities bill down the road.	1643136145.0	sckory	/r/offmychest/comments/sckory/i_am_so_livid_at_boomers_for_what_they_have_done/	I am so livid at boomers for what they have done to Americans' retirement prospects
5b27f1db	It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve never loved someone like I love her, or that no one has ever loved me like she loves me. I love her. But that‚Äôs not what is new about it, that is not what breaks my heart. It‚Äôs that her presence is like my brother‚Äôs blanket to him (that my mom cut up). I have never felt so unjudged, so blatantly and boldly accepted for myself, no matter how quirky, problematic or weird. I would never do anything to cause her harm, intentionally or unintentionally,¬† because I analyze everything I do so hard before I do it to make sure it won‚Äôt hurt her. Even when we weren‚Äôt ‚Äúfriends‚Äù she had my back more than anyone I had been friends with before. To live with her is to live with the pain of losing her, because I‚Äôve never had a person that feels so safe and the thought I might forget how she has made me feel someday breaks my heart. Please promise you‚Äôll never forget her or if you forget how you felt about her don‚Äôt ever forget how she made you feel. That there is safety in this chaotic world, even if the world itself has proven time and time again it‚Äôs not safe. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not for her either. Promise you‚Äôll text her years in the future reading this. I can‚Äôt live without having someone like her in my life, at least in some way.¬†  Comparing her love to \*\*\*\*\*‚Äôs love seems evil and unfair because she is so ethereal, so another level. But I have nothing else to compare it to and no other way to express how deeply I feel. But she blows her out of the water. The song This is What You Came For by Calvin Harris and Rihanna just came on and it‚Äôs not a great fucking song, but that‚Äôs how you feel when you have her attention. Everywhere she goes all eyes are on her, why wouldn‚Äôt they be. But I‚Äôve never felt like I‚Äôm competing with her. I just feel honored to be with her, to be with the obvious not even star of the show but like fucking crystal diamond star what the fuck ever in the sky. She is heavenly, and makes you feel like you deserve, somehow, to witness something heavenly exist. I worry I romanticize her or put her up on a pedestal but she isn‚Äôt perfect, and I know that, and she knows that, and somehow that makes her even more perfect at the same time. Her flaws are all rooted in deep and real and valid pain and only ever manifest themselves as being overly kind to others. Who else can genuinely say their flaw is kindness. I don‚Äôt know anyone else.  She says that the song Good Things Fall Apart by Illenium makes her think of me. This song has become my heart and soul. She is that. Literally sleeping next to her feels like sleeping with your childhood, from-birth stuffed animal. The unconditionality. The comfort. The softness, playfulness but unwavering trust. My heart breaks that I have to leave her, and I literally don‚Äôt even know if it is the right choice sometimes. I know we are not destined to be together, and sometimes this is the fact that hurts the most. I don‚Äôt believe in destiny, or that everything happens for a reason. But fuck, this randomness that brought me to her feels fucking spiritual.  She believes in God, and Satan, and Good and Evil. I never did. Not until observing the world by her side.¬† I never believed in God because there has never been any fucking evidence that God‚Äôs touch was present in my life.¬† Now there is. My mom is an abused orphan, and my dad lives his life in pieces that he can manage. I don‚Äôt know how to describe them, writing about them alongside her feels like a great disservice. But she is the only one that thought, that knew, I deserved better from the start. She never questioned my relationship with them, and never defended them or made me feel bad about it. She just said I deserved better, which no one ever said before. And she believes in God, and man I fucking believe in her.  Life crushes her beneath it. The constant pressure she is under must be unbearable, but it has literally turned her into a diamond brighter than anyone could imagine less you have the opportunity to truly feel her soul. She will pity and empathize until someone proves themself the most absolutely undeserving, which she sees as a fault but is one of her most beautiful qualities. She truly believes in the Good and can see it, and not only see it, but watch it fade from someone and still know it exists elsewhere. I‚Äôve never known someone who could do that before.  I don‚Äôt know if I have more memories with anyone else. Not that I haven‚Äôt made more, but somehow despite my memory being absolute trash every fucking moment with her lives in my brain right now.¬† I hope I never forget her energy.¬† I see her as a collage of images, dancing , smiling, lying down staring at the clouds. I have known her more places than I‚Äôve known anyone else.We don‚Äôt have a special spot that‚Äôs ours. But that‚Äôs because the world is ours, and I feel her everywhere I go.  When I‚Äôm with her I‚Äôve never been happier. It literally doesn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôre sitting in silence in a car or on a plane, or at¬† a fucking rave or festival, literally sleeping next to her, chainsmoking out her apartment window, sitting at the counter talking. Sleeping in the room next to her, knowing she‚Äôs only a step away.¬†  Being with her is like living in a constant summer.¬†  I can‚Äôt not write about her eyes. Everyone notices her eyes when they meet her, even when she puts up her walls and they are hazy and hard to read, you can tell she is special. She thinks that when she puts up that front everyone thinks she is dumb, but I think you look into her eyes and can tell she is extremely intelligent in every way, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so enticing. Men must be able to tell she is playing games by how she presents her eyes, but I guess they also can‚Äôt because of their arrogance. But if they could really see her in her eyes, the way I see her, I think they‚Äôd probably throw up. She is a fucking force, enticing and terrifying and absorbing all at once. And when she lets you see the love in her eyes it‚Äôs all over. I would say she is doe-eyed, and she is, they‚Äôre blue and angelic and magical like a fucking I don‚Äôt even know mystical waterfall or perfectly clear sky, and also full of some magical and untarnishable innocence,¬† but her eyes aren‚Äôt that of a doe. She‚Äôs way too fucking fearless for that comparison. And she‚Äôs not some innocent virgin, she‚Äôs hard as fuck. As fuck. Her eyes are better personified by a fucking magical tigress, or a high-flying fearless bird. But those don‚Äôt feel like good comparisons either, because she isn‚Äôt of this world,¬† her eyes are way more of this universe, or even beyond that I couldn‚Äôt tell you.  When you told me we had a soul connection I melted. I feel it too, and I was so relieved and obsessed and overwhelmed you said it first.  All I want, all I feel like right now I could ever want, is to hold her and be held by her, all at once, souls molding together like playdough mashed together in a fist¬† and pressed so tight it squeezes through the spaces between your fingers.

bavmf80b	Okay okay I know I‚Äôm probably instantly going to regret posting this, but I just need to get it off my chest lol  I am 26F and haven‚Äôt had sex in my twenties. The last time I had sex I was in University, and it was a one night stand with a guy I was sort of friends with. It wasn‚Äôt very impressive and didn‚Äôt go anywhere after that.  Since then I sort of just wasn‚Äôt bothered by guys. I was busy graduating. I then lived at home with parents for a year to save money before moving to the big city to live in a houseshare and get a job.  Anyways, I haven‚Äôt had sex since moving out of my parents house. I guess I‚Äôm not really embarrassed by it, in all honestly my previous sexual encounters make me think I‚Äôm really not missing anything, but my friends look at me like I‚Äôm insane.  It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm anti sex? I think part of it is having gained weight, and feeling so much shame around my body I couldn‚Äôt imagine anyone seeing me naked. It actually makes my skin crawl. The other part of it is that I guess I can‚Äôt miss what I never had? I don‚Äôt think I really had any ‚Äògood sex‚Äô from 18-19 so I don‚Äôt miss it? Is that weird?  I guess I‚Äôm just worried about finally getting to a place I‚Äôm comfortable with my body (whatever size that is), but being like nearly 27 and having NO idea what to do with my body, and like will it hurt? Who knows?  Sorry I probably sound insane but yeah, I‚Äôve lost count of the number of friends who are like shocked by what I say about it all hahaha	1643136202.0	sckpjf	/r/offmychest/comments/sckpjf/born_again_virgin_lol/	Born again virgin lol
7si2bojv	My significant other told me that she isn‚Äôt ready to maintain a romantic relationship of any kind. She sent me a long message which said other stuff as well. We are still on great terms, and we both said that we‚Äôd love to stay friends. I told her that I will wait for her, and whatever she decides to do in the future, I would support it 100%. Although she said that I can still talk to her, I‚Äôve been distancing myself and giving her some time and some space. These past few days have been very tough for me, and with the schoolworks that I have to deal with, I feel very burnt out and sad. I‚Äôm still getting used to everything, especially since I used to spend a lot of time with her. I miss her. I miss our late night talks, our music listening sessions, I miss sending her funny and wholesome memes, I miss sending her good morning and good night messages, and many more. I honestly don‚Äôt think I can handle this, but I told myself to stay strong for her. I‚Äôm glad that she‚Äôs putting herself and her well-being first. She means a lot to me, so knowing that she‚Äôs focusing on her feelings and taking a well-deserved break is great. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs gonna come back to our relationship, but if she decides to end it completely and I have to let go of her, I‚Äôll have peace in knowing that she‚Äôll be happy. I love her so much and I‚Äôm so grateful for everything that we‚Äôve been through. She has made such a positive impact on my life and has given me a reason to smile and get out of bed. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve met this wonderful person.	1643136328.0	sckr88	/r/offmychest/comments/sckr88/idk_what_to_name_this_lol/	Idk what to name this lol
h2007sla	I apologize for repeating and writing so much here.. I'm just kind of ranting and doing the voice to text thing to kind of get this off of my chest ironically enough .  I(F 18) and my Bf(M17) have been dating for nearly 5 months . Prior to dating we have been best friends for nearly 7 years , we were inseparable and I don't think I would be here if it wasn't for him . He was my best friend and he still is.  When we started dating at the beginning of October, it was after the homecoming dance and when he was dropping me off at my house . I don't know what ended up happening or how it led to this but , somehow we ended up in a heated make out and kind of got a little touchy , (with consent of course). After he got home and it was around midnight.   We agreed that we just would simply moved on from it because we treated each other like siblings and it was like a heat of the moment thing it was just really shocking to either of us because neither of us expected it to go that way. But the thing is with a situation like that you just can't forget something like that or " Move On " from it because it was such a different situation.   Eventually we started dating the night after homecoming so that would've been October 3 I believe . Since then we have been together and, we just kept it private for the first few weeks of our relationship because neither of us knew if we wanted to do this because , in the past we have liked each other and have that situation where you have a crush on my best friend you don't want to ruin the friendship blah blah.  I wasn't really sure if it was going to get past week or neither of us is did, but eventually when we did came out publicly about it not a lot of people were surprised because being friends for that long and me being a girl and him being a guy people already assume that we're together.   Also the fact that our other best friend after he knew two weeks after we became official was extremely upset about it and that‚Äôs all and drama for a different time but it just shows you how us being together kind of was negative in our friend group at least for our closest best friend it‚Äôs not so much an issue anymore with him and he still frequently apologizes for it but maybe I should‚Äôve listen to him?  Despite this ,he has treated me fantastically he has to have been one of my best boyfriends this far. He has known me for years and years so he knows what I enjoy , what I like , basically everything about me he knows stuff about me that I forget all the time .   Though as I've been dating him I don't know if I've ever been truly happy with the relationship like 1 00 % happy as in ‚Äúoh I'm willing to spend the rest of my life with this person‚Äù . Despite us being relatively young I know thinking like that is kind of immature but I'm going off to college this year and he's taking a break year, so nothings really set in stone yet but it's just something to consider right now .  I know he is in love with me and adores me to the highest degree . And he wants to marry me he wants to have a family with me and he wants to stick with me despite that my career that I'm pursuing in the future will be difficult to have a family or have a husband and be able to be home or have time for them.(I want to be a criminal profiler btw).  Throughout a relationship I've always been hesitant on doing certain things like it was about a month or two in, that I realized I don't necessarily like the more last fall / sexual aspects of a relationship with him. it‚Äôs weird how I feel about it because he makes me happy; he spoils me; he gives me what I would want in a relationship, but there's just something missing and I don't know what it is .   He isn't my dream guy and I'm not really looking for a dream guy right now. It's just interesting it's not like, I surround my entire relationship around that because that's not the case, it's just he isn't what I would desire(physically and mentally) in for a guy or a partner.   I would say that his physical appearance is definitely an aspect and why I don't like making out or why I don't like getting sexual with him because , it's just not what I'm looking for in that aspect . And I guess while I was thinking about it while we were dating I kind of realized I was on the asexual spectrum(based off of my actual feelings regarding sex, past experiences, and him)  He was completely Ok with it and he's not a sexual guy himself but he prefers the more romantic or wholesome stuff in a relationship. Despite this I am still actively questioning my sexuality because I seriously don't know if I am asexual or if I'm not. I know there's a label for it, I don't want to put a label on it . I am the type of person that I don't think having sex or having sexual interactions is needed to have a good relationship. A part of me still wants to have that aspect though, but my boyfriend can't provide that for me. it's not like he has anything biologically wrong, it's just‚Ä¶he's not physically or sexually attractive to me as much as I thought he was.   So I‚Äôm getting all of the stuff is what I would want in a relationship but I feel like I'm not getting the entire thing of it or I'm not " truly " happy .   There are other aspects of him that are really hard for me to stay with him , being his friend was already hard enough and now being his girlfriend it has put even more pressure . He is severely depressed and is not treated for it or getting help for it despite how hard I plea with him. It's ridiculous because there are points where he's apologizing so much that I've had to hold back yelling at him for him to stop because it's gotten annoying and I understand as a person with anxiety and depression I understand why he does that and why someone would.  Being in a relationship and not being truly happy or treated for a serious mental illness like that can't put stress on your partner. Being in a relationship is a team effort. Why should I put effort in trying to get you mental help when you, yourself will not do it. If you don‚Äôt love yourself how could anyone else love you.  It's hard for me to help him when I also have my own struggles  and I can't provide for him at that moment and he takes it as he's being a burden and that he's just shut up and keep it bottled inside . He's been raised that way to do it and I hate HATE that it's been that way for him. And I‚Äôve heavily pushed him into getting a therapist or finding different coping mechanisms if he‚Äôs not comfortable with a therapist. It would help him and it would help me so that I wouldn‚Äôt feel guilty or upset at myself for not being there for him at a time that I wasn‚Äôt able to be there for him.   All of this and including the fact that his confidence , self-esteem is severely low to the point where if I try to complement him or whatever he will say disagree and he'll then go around and say how ugly or how he isn't sexy or whatever and I have to constantly reassure him . It's a lot of stress on me.   The thing is as our relationship has gotten to the point where it is today I've increasingly tried to pull back from it as if I'm trying to leave but I don't have the strength . I don't kiss him as much anymore I don't text him as much anymore , I don't compliment him as much anymore and it's because I'm torn between if I should break up with him or not.  Everyone that I know is aware that he's an amazing boyfriend and that he has spoiled me rotten and has done so much for me and my sisters and has been there for me that if I didn't go break up  I would get shamed for it . So I feel as if I'm trapped in this cage where I have to be with him and it's not like I don't love him or anything I do love him. I just feel that I'm not the person for his life, despite how badly he says he wants to marry me or have kids with me when we're older. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the one for him.    I don't think he's the one for me either as much as I appreciate him and love him, my future career and what he wants to do and what I want to do will definitely be a struggle . Also the fact that I like to have goals and structure and a schedule in my life and he lacks that, and when you‚Äôre planning to live with someone after Highschool that will be a BIG problem.   He wants to stay with me for as long as he can, the fact that he lacks goals and ambition and a drive..doesn‚Äôt actually want a career or do anything..it's troubling for me because my career and my future life will not be up to par with his . He plays video games and he wants to be a game tester which I am fully supportive of by I just feel as if my job and my future won‚Äôt do anything for our relationship.   I just am afraid to tell anybody that I know about this because I feel like they're going to get angry at me and that I've been inconsiderate and a terrible girlfriend. Because of all the stuff he's done for me and I haven't been able to physically pay him back with anything . There have been points in a relationship where I put my own feelings and stuff aside like kissing him or making out with him despite on how uncomfortable it makes me because I don‚Äôt want to hurt him.   My feelings regarding our relationship I‚Äôve been struggling with for a few months now and it‚Äôs really hard to keep it bottled up inside and not tell anybody.  Despite this as terrible as I may sound here, I have plenty of guy friends that I know that have girlfriends and whatever and I envy their relationship because you can tell that she‚Äôs happy and that she enjoys him and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not happy I am but I don‚Äôt feel like I am 100% happy.  One of my guy friends that I‚Äôve known for a while now, we‚Äôve been talking in it and I may have a crush on him or something I‚Äôm not quite sure what it is yet I‚Äôm just too stressed to kind of think about it properly. But him and I are definitely more connected in the aspects of my relationship that my boyfriend isn‚Äôt fulfilling. So there‚Äôs been points where I‚Äôve I had to think if being single or being with anybody else would be better for me mentally and honestly I hate to say this but it seems to be that way.  I don‚Äôt know if I should break up with him as soon as possible or if I should wait after Valentine‚Äôs Day. Because I don‚Äôt want him to be alone on Valentine‚Äôs Day and it‚Äôs sad because he wants to do something but I‚Äôm not there in the relationship for him and I feel like I‚Äôm doing no one a favor by staying in this relationship it‚Äôs not helping me him being left in the dark about how I truly feel about a relationship it‚Äôs hurting him. And the fact that I haven‚Äôt been able to pay him back for all of the amazing things he‚Äôs done for me while being with him.  I‚Äôm kind of at a dead end here. I will appreciate any advice or suggestions anyone has I am so lost right now. I don‚Äôt have the strength to do what I need to do for him or for myself and I just need help.	1643136456.0	scksz8	/r/offmychest/comments/scksz8/after_being_with_my_boyfriend_for_the_last_five/	After being with my boyfriend for the last five months, I‚Äôve realized that I might have never been fully happy and I‚Äôm thinking about breaking up with him but I‚Äôm struggling.
4qgmjyop	"The boys" echos through the hallways. I fucking hate it here. The same shit every day. Wake up and go to class, just to feel alone. I don't play a varsity sport, how the fuck would I make friends. Even though I do have friends, its a simple "Yop whats good" in the hallway. 98% of the student body is on some sort of varsity sport. I get looked at funny for the music I listen too, old rock, old hip hop, techno,  jazz. I get called weird for having a sense of style that is not athleisure. I actually am in touch with my emotions, and don't call people slurs all the time, but get called a "woman" for doing so. God I hate boarding school. The culture here is if your rich and play a varsity sport and are obeseesed with hockey or football or basketball, you fit in. And god these kids are all such losers. I swear in any other school setting they would be considered the most dumb people on earth.	1643136462.0	sckt2l	/r/offmychest/comments/sckt2l/i_fcking_hate_boardingprep_school/	I F*cking Hate Boarding./Prep school

izxpbaqo	 I pretty much have been psychologically destroyed by being raped and abused by older male teens who lives right across the street from my house, told my mom, mom told police, police didn‚Äôt care (I live in a shitty country), now I‚Äôm even worse mentally because I grew up watching my abusers in my face for the rest of my upbringing.  I want to escape the mental torture, the freaking cloud over my head that doesn‚Äôt let me a normal person who can be a normal and shit.

This hard to explain to women, dating is literally impossible and I‚Äôm realizing that if I don‚Äôt sort this out I‚Äôm going to die alone.  just finished my degree in criminal research and even though from the outside I might look strong, detective wanna be (i want to be) yet I can‚Äôt deal with my own child hood trauma because as a man I can‚Äôt sit in front of a person and admit that I‚Äôve been raped. Leading a life on revenge, I realized I do what I do because I hate criminals who get away and I want to be the best at it, that‚Äôs it.

iz665ne2	He's married and has a child.  We met through work. I knew from the start he was married and was not interested, he wasn't too much my type... And I don't usually mix business with pleasure. But he pursued me after I left this job. Writing, flirting.  I also like that he's married. He's confident, and they seem happy. He said that his family was his priority. That means he's not gonna try and have a serious thing with me, and I can be myself, because it doesn't matter if he doesn't like what he sees. There's not much at stake for me that way.   We've been talking a lot. I was on the fence at first. But he's charming, I'm newly single (bad breakup), and I feel safe with him. We went to dinner the other and it turned out into a date. We kissed in his car.   These stories never end well. But I think I'm gonna go for it anyway. Maybe set a time limit so things stay light and breezy and we don't get too attached.	1643136755.0	sckx0v	/r/offmychest/comments/sckx0v/im_becoming_someones_mistress/	I'm becoming someone's mistress.

j0781vgm	We had been together for close to 1 and a half years (me 19M and her 19F) but have been friends forever, and our relationship was perfect, especially for the 1st year or so.  She broke up with me about a month and a half ago. Looking back I can see why. Our relationship was not as fun anymore, and actually was more like a friendship.  I do believe that there is more to it though. The last month before we broke up we were constantly together, she never had space for herself and was feeling pressured. She is an introvert after all, and needs time to recharge and time alone.  What she didn't know is that I had discovered something on me, that had an over 50% chance of being cancer. I didn't tell anyone and for the 4 weeks I waited to get checked by a doctor, I tried to be with her as much as possible, because when I was left alone, it was too much for me, knowing that I might have cancer.  I actually got checked and all went well. She broke up about a week after that, saying that she doesn't think we match, and I'm certain that always being together when she is introverted played a major role in her decision.  I never told her, or anyone about this, as she gets extremely nervous and would honestly lose her mind if she knew before I got checked.  I backed off for about a month and reinitiated contact with her. We're talking every few days (both of us are reaching out) and we met once and it was pretty fun. I honestly want us to get back together. I just don't know what I should do, or even if I should ever mention the above.  Also let me point out that we had more problems as well, as all couples, but I believe they were miniscule, and actually wroked on fixing everything, while I spent some time with my self.	1643137855.0	sclca2	/r/offmychest/comments/sclca2/we_broke_up_but_she_doesnt_know_of_something/	We broke up but she doesn't know of something

I was pretty depressed the week before and was about to drive 12 hours to be with them, but I decided not to. At the last minute I reneged on my decision and bought the flight. I was going to see them next week anyways. Now it really doesn‚Äôt feel like it was worth it.

j0k0hvmm	I've known her for more than 3 years and I've liked her ever since I saw her. Her face, her hair, her smile. I still remember the way I felt that day. But I never decided to pursue it, it was never a good time, I wasn't really seeing her that often and it was fine. I would still get excited when I see her, but it would be months apart.   Fast forward three years, she has graduated and sort of become more involved with my group of friends. And that's when I realised I want to be more than friends with this girl. We have a lot in common, we share the same drive, ambitions and have a very similar outlook on life. So naturally, I asked her out, she looked flattered but told me she has a boyfriend. A boyfriend that she is not sure if she has any future with. And this last sentence just drove me crazy, do I cut ties until my feelings pass, do I continue trying to get closer to her? I'm consistently thinking about her, losing sleep over this thing, the times we text are the best times of my day. How on Earth did I get so obsessed? I have a ton of other things going on in my life, have a great social life, a new job I love, but no every single free moment I have my mind thinks of her.

I used to be extroverted with my problem being I wouldn‚Äôt come home I was out so much, but covid just made me such a homebody with antisocial tendencies and I don‚Äôt have the motivation to pick up the slack because the thought of getting back to everyone makes me feel overwhelmed.

cgcplz7w	Hey guys so I meet a girl online and we live very far from each other. We‚Äôve been talking for about 6 months now. I first told her I had feelings for her maybe 2 months in and she told me she wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, but we kept on as friends and about 2 months ago she began to get very flirty and acting like she liked me. So after a few conversations were we both talked about liking each other and having feelings, I told her that I loved her(which I do and have for a while). At first she said it back immediately, but a few days later we had a talk and basically she said she loved me but to much other stuff in the way( distance,money,etc) at first I didn‚Äôt want to accept that but eventually I did. We kept talking, but it wasn‚Äôt the same anymore and eventually I told her that if she didn‚Äôt think it would work that I think I needed some space because my feelings aren‚Äôt going away and it hurts to have them knowing it isn‚Äôt going to amount to anything.She said she didn‚Äôt want me to leave, and that she really loved me and we could try to make it work. It‚Äôs been about a 2 week since then and I feel like she‚Äôs distancing herself again, hours in between text with no explanation. She‚Äôll say we can have a video call at such and such time, but she‚Äôs got an excuse whenever it‚Äôs time(which isn‚Äôt like her). I don‚Äôt know I feel like I forced her to say she loved me by threatening to leave, but that wasn‚Äôt my intention.I genuinely was heartbroken to do it and I really thought it was going to be the end of us. I was so happy when she told me not to leave, but now I feel like a manipulative piece of shit. I know she cares about me and didn‚Äôt want to leave, but I‚Äôm not sure she actually loves me, and I feel like she might have thought she had to say it to not lose a friend.

3qv3o82y	When I was in 1st grade my gym teacher was pregnant. She had the fully rounded belly of a late term pregnancy. One day she had us doing assisted pull ups, as in she was assisting us one at a time. Apparently when I did mine I accidentally kicked in the effort and kicked her in the belly. I felt really bad about it right away, but much worse when some years later I came to learn that the gym teachers child was mentally handicapped.     I live with the guilt of possibly being responsible for that still creeps up 19 years later.	1643138157.0	sclge3	/r/offmychest/comments/sclge3/i_maybe_responsible_for_a_baby_being_born/	I maybe responsible for a baby being born handicapped.
7tuqx5yp	Im 20F. Im in college. Ive had crippling depression and missed so many classes and work since ive been back from break. Me and girlfriend 21F needed to break up because we are both struggling and because she isnt ready to tell her parents. It was so sudden. We were together for a few months in 2020 but needed to break up again and it was awful. Anyway, She texted in the morning yesterday saying her parents were getting her later in the day. We cried together for an hour and after she left i was crying all day. I love her so much. I cried when i woke up this morning. I feel so numb but also heartbroken at the same time. Everything changed so fast. I thought her and me were doing good. I was just dealing with shit and it wasnt her fault. Im so worried about the future to the point it makes me naseous. We wanted so much with eachother. And everywhere on campus is a trigger because of all the things we did together. I truly am hating life and myself. I dont know if I can make it through this again. Everything has changed so fast i thought this week was going to be just another week with her and our friends but here I am. I cannot deal with the hurt and pain. I just want the pain and worrying to stop. I just want to end my life to make it stop.   Thanks for reading if you did. Any encouraging and helpful comments are welcome.	1643138677.0	sclnak	/r/offmychest/comments/sclnak/im_struggling_so_much/	Im struggling so much
87tzohs7	I woke up today and was exhausted. I went over all the work we would be doing and figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to not go since there won't be much work. I decided to sleep in and my mom reluctantly agreed. I slept until 1pm and I woke up feeling guilty as I usually do when I skip.   My reasoning was I'm stressed by the fact I go to school exhausted but manage to get through the day only to come home and try and sit down and do work. Only to be too exhausted and fall asleep for a few hours, then I'll wake up and have to get all my work done usually making me stay up until around 2am or later. I don't have any time to do anything else, I might watch a youtube video or two. But I have no time for myself so it's not like I have any extra time im not. using. I am too exhausted everyday, and there is just not enough hours in the day to get my work done. it's gotten so bad that on the Friday I'll sleep for 10 hours or sometimes longer since I don't have to get up for school.  I feel like an awful person regardless of the shitty excuse. I am anxious that colleges won't accept me for my attendance. I'm scared of what teachers think of me now. I'm scared this makes me a bad person who takes everything for granted and I'm lazy. It's going to sound even more stupid but someone who abused me yelled at me before and called me names because I skipped school two years ago for being depressed. So I feel like a bad person like I did in that instance. my friend just told me I can't skip because I'm tired, so I feel worse. i know they're right. I know. I'm lazy. I know I'm selfish. I feel so stupid and am crying over it and I feel fucking ridiculous.	1643138681.0	sclncj	/r/offmychest/comments/sclncj/i_skipped_class_and_i_feel_like_a_bad_person/	I Skipped Class And I Feel Like A Bad Person

Or perish.    For when The Lord Bezos asked Karen of Suburbia, ‚ÄúCustomer, are you satisified‚Äù, Karen of Surburbia said ‚Äúnay, Lord, I am not, for my order tarried ere sunset, a full measure of minutes‚Äù   And The Lord Bezos   Praised Be Bezos   Smote the warehouse, the distribution center, the drivers, the workers!   He raised up the customer with his right hand, and smote her enemies with his left   Praised Be Bezos   We give thanks to our Lord for fulfillment and purpose, contained and dispersed as to His infinite wisdom. And we ask ourselves, did Karen make a mistake? Should she have wavered from her own faith in Our Lord and not complained? Should she have spared the entire workforce by simply waiting ten minutes?   Nay! For The Lord Bezos commands we obsess. We deliver. We drive. What sinful creatures would we be if we placed our health, our safety, our bodies over that of the Customer   The most Holy Customer, highest in Lord Bezos‚Äô favor   Praised Be Bezos   And praise to The Customer   And Praise To The Karens	1643138727.0	sclnyb	/r/offmychest/comments/sclnyb/working_at_amazon_a_divine_comedy/	Working At Amazon: A Divine Comedy

j0kw2ybc	Back then I was just a curious young teenager, maybe 13-16 years old. She isn't much younger than me and by age the closest of all my relatives. About 2 years apart.  She often came over to sleep at our house, watch some shows all night and sleep in my room.  But curious and undeniable horny as I was (I never felt any sexual desire for her btw), I stayed up and tried to touch her boobs as I wanted to know how boobs felt. I never touched her in any other place, but sometimes, when she turned around in her sleep I tried to make her move back again and woke her up.  This went on for years. Now, she wasn't regularly at our house, just 2-3 times a year maybe and I didn't do it every single time, but often enough I figure.  I'm not sure, but one time I thought she even said "Who said you could grab them?". But it sounded so weird, that I'm not sure if it was just in my head. This threw me off a lot tho.  It has been many years now. I've had a girlfriend and everything, I'm not a horny and curious teenager anymore. But I feel bad for doing this. I'm afraid that she was awake or may think bad off me, even after all this time. I feel bad everytime I see her, because I'm afraid that she only remembers me for this and judges me...  I'd love to apologize, but at the same time I'm afraid that this would call back memories in her that she may have forgotten. That she hates me afterwards. There is just so much that might make things worse if I talk about it. Especially if other people would find out. They'd look down on me and Idk what... I feel as if it would be better if I just lived with it.  I just want to say: I'm so sorry for doing this to you and I hope that you can forgive me one day.	1643138808.0	sclp23	/r/offmychest/comments/sclp23/i_touched_my_cousin_when_we_were_younger_and_i/	I touched my Cousin when we were younger and I feel bad for it
3eqze04g	Hello. While growing up I had next to no heating in my house. Going to bed was a nightmare because the coldness of the room combined with the cold sheets would have me shaking for atleast 10 minutes before I got used to it and was able to relax my muscles to fall asleep. Over the time I would say to my self that it's not cold, that I'm a man and I have to be stronger than that ( which I do not believe that being cold is a femine sign, it was just something to make me think thst I'm not cold)   Right  now  things are better, I now have a warm house since I moved with my grandma after i kicked my mother out of my house for being a lier, mentally abusive ( physically too when I was younger) and a complete fucktard that contributed nothing to raising us up.   Although in a better situation now I still find my self loving the cold and frequently taking my jacket off while it's freezing and to mentally combat the cold I would say " it's just not that cold" out loud which has people seeing my as a douche that tries to flex his masculinity by not being cold which is not the case but totally understandable through their perspective. I wend for a smoke outside right before writing this and i was basically outside in -3C with a t-shirt and a jogger and just realized the cold combined with music helps me with my anxiety and depression.  I don't know why I'm writing this, I've never told anyone about this. Your the only ones that know :)	1643138917.0	sclqk6	/r/offmychest/comments/sclqk6/grew_up_with_almost_no_heat_learned_to_love_the/	Grew up with almost no heat. Learned to love the cold.
46gxc	Nobody seems to give any benefit of the doubt in online interactions, maybe at all, and once they commit to saying the other person is wrong, it becomes yet another thing they just CAN'T be wrong about, so 100% of what the other person says must be wrong. It's madness and based in assumption. It certainly adds to division. I wish I understood why people are like this.  People will take three words of something you write and take it to assume you are a detractors or supporter of some extremely polarized view, as if views can't be nuanced. They will point to the nuance and say that it makes the discussion difficult, then throw it away. The fear of being a little wrong guides people down such staggeringly stupid paths.  I saw a thread a while ago wherein the discussion revolved around dreadlocks and how they are racist for white people to have. Someone posted a picture of a white guy with dreads in a drum group who was literally from Africa, then also said that any other type of scenario would be inappropriate for a white person, basically agreeing with the people in the thread, but listing one counterexample. They mass downvoted him, and he tried to explain that he agreed in 90% of cases, and he was told he was gaslighting, sealioning, etc. He was called names, people assumed how the guy voted (which they were wrong about, according to him), called him intolerant, just generally tore the dude apart. I saw how the crowd turned on someone who was clearly on their side if they read the whole comment.  Someone described an unfortunate sexual interaction that, based on their storytelling, sounded like it may have been someone getting carried away, and I pointed out that similar had happened to me, before, and that it was actually pretty rough and maybe even mildly traumatizing for a little while (I certainly had a hard time processing, for one experience), and offered up how the other person might have done that without it being an intentional action, having heard the same from people who did that to me, not to defend the attacker, but to give some solace to the victim. Sex is really weird territory, and people get used to weird things, and we aren't taught to communicate, on the whole. Obviously, I used fewer words than that. I was leapt on as defending the attacker and was brokered no option to defend myself. I was very much on the victim's side, having gone through it, and it's harder to convey a pat kn the shoulder through text, but the hive-mindless decided to flame and disregard, from there.   I watch family members defend terrible actions by previous politicians while pointing to far lesser offenses by current ones and ask directly for comparison, and I am told to stop being inciting.   People want to just say whatever they want, and that is good, but they should be prepared to listen in response. Why would anyone want any interaction with a screaming toddler, covering their ears and closing their eyes?	1643138975.0	sclrdc	/r/offmychest/comments/sclrdc/im_so_sick_of_people_deliberately/	I'm so sick of people deliberately misunderstanding/misinterpreting people because they FEEL like they're on the other side of some issue.
hdxfztnh	So I(F19) have been dating this guy (M22) for a couple months and things have been going great. He‚Äôs my favorite human being to talk to and he‚Äôs my best friend and I adore him with all my heart. The only problem is that we‚Äôre long distance and we‚Äôre both in school so you can imagine the struggle. The only time we‚Äôve ever truly talked to each other was one time back in the fall when we FaceTimed for the first time ever.   Anyways, recently he‚Äôs been so busy with class work and all that stuff that sometimes he won‚Äôt text me for a couple days and won‚Äôt get back to me until a couple days later and says either it‚Äôs because of school work or not feeling well. I understand that he has a life and I get that because I get busy too but sometimes I just overthink for no reason when he goes missing. I talked to him about wanting to talk to him more often through FaceTime or even trying to make more time for each other and he said he wanted to do that too especially since he said he wouldn‚Äôt be too busy with his classes during the certain week I told him about it. But of course he stopped texting for a couple days and when he came back he said he got bombarded with more school stuff.   I want to break up with him or at least talk to him about taking a break but I‚Äôm just confused on what to do. Sometimes whenever I give him an imaginary scenario where we break up, he says he doesn‚Äôt want that to happen and he wants to stay with me forever and marry me.   I know I have no right to butt into his life because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm his wife but I‚Äôve been in several relationships before and I get paranoid and can‚Äôt help it. I shouldn‚Äôt complain about him because he‚Äôs really the perfect person but sometimes I feel like the distance and us barely talking to each other is eating away at our relationship. I still love him but I just wonder what‚Äôs the point in him staying with me since he‚Äôs always busy. I want the best for him and I want him to succeed in life but I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I know this is selfish but I really just need advice.  TLDR: LDR bf and I barely talk because of school and I talked to him about us wanting to try to make more time for each other but he still disappears. I need advice because I feel so confused and the only other option is to break up with him.	1643139102.0	sclt94	/r/offmychest/comments/sclt94/i_want_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/	I want to break up with my boyfriend
e9kfqlww	First off, if it‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôll share my own personal experience. I‚Äôm a f/18/white and currently a college student (just started). When I ask my friends their opinion on me just by appearance (which is a horrible way to judge a person, might I add) most assume I‚Äôm a typical white female who lived an okay life in suburbia. However, if you got to know me then you‚Äôd know I unfortunately grew up between a horrible custody battle and there were times where I‚Äôd have to share a twin bed with my mother in the winters. I was blessed in the sense that I had well off grandparents who paid for my private education (although I would have wished that that money could have gone toward clothes, food, etc.). I remember my mom having a car that literally had a door almost falling off (quite funny to think about it now) and showing up to a school with kids and their suburbans. It was a humbling experience but one I know that I‚Äôm so grateful for. My story could last forever, but I just want to say no matter who you are or what you are going through, do not feel discouraged by society and what it says ‚Äòyou need‚Äô. I am lucky that I am in the US and that I had the luxury of not being persecuted or forced into anything, and those are often things we forget as Americans.	1643139212.0	scluql	/r/offmychest/comments/scluql/everything_will_be_okay/	Everything Will Be Okay :)
2t31631j	Maybe its the Pandemic.  Nothing can be done without including the rules, the guidelines, making sure you have sanitizer, hating being vaxxed, but hating more the fact I had to because we can't seem to control this thing...   Maybe its my struggling marriage...I cheated on her, and we recommitted.  I don't deserve her.  And I think she knows that.  I re-proposed, and it was a better yes than ever before.    COVID killed our marriage recommitment plans.   Maybe its my fear my kids will see through my ignorance, and false bravado, and see me for the panic-stricken kid I am who lost his parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles way before they could tell me how to do this 'Dad' thing.  Maybe its my Job - I'm terrified of work every day...they'll find out I have no idea what I am doing...and the pressure and stress is killing me.  Maybe its my finances.  My finances are fueling my marriage stress - I'm trying to save as much as possible, for the next coming crisis...There's more...so much more.       But I see people out; hiking, 4-wheeling their trucks, camping, planning trips to Sea World, Lego Land, dining out, and basically just saying fuck-all about life's stresses.  I know my kids are ok, my wife is ok, and I guess I'm ok...but seeing people just....'getting back to life' just floors me.  I can't look away, and I keep thinking...."why can't I just put it all down, just for a weekend...and just get back to the stuff I used to love doing?       I am now on 3x brain-dazzling meds that keep me numb.  So I don't even know why I'm writing this...unless my head gets that my  is really so bad, that I just. fucking. can't. anymore.	1643139436.0	sclxps	/r/offmychest/comments/sclxps/ive_forgotten_how_to_be_happy/	I've forgotten how to be happy.

21oy1s4q	We have been together since junior year of high school and our relationship was perfect. Since the moment we met and locked eyes on each other we were inseparable. So many sleepless nights on the phone or skype. I had other girlfriends in the past, but this one was different because not only was she my girlfriend, but she was also my best friend. I introduced her to PC gaming and World of Warcraft and we both became addicted.   So many nights playing the new expansions and making inside jokes that only we would understand. When her parents would try and keep us apart, we would be able to escape online and spend more time together. Then Highschool ended and our relationship kept growing. She followed her dreams of working with medicine by furthering her education and myself not being very academically bright did the only thing I knew how to and dove headfirst into the world of IT.   Eventually I would become a retail IT tech at a big tech chain, and she would end up working part time at the same store. Imagine getting paid to spend time with the person you love it was perfect. Then the years went on and I went into consulting spreading my wings and furthering my IT skillset by going company to company. At the end of the day good or bad I would always look forward to coming home to the woman I loved and spending the night with her in my arms. As I went on with my career, she eventually finished school and got her foot in the door at a big pharma company.   As we both evolved in our careers, I decided to take the next step in our relationship and got down on one knee. Soon after we moved into our first apartment together and things started to become different. We still loved each other, but that work life balance we once had was gone. She would come home exhausted from her days in the lab and I would now be a System Admin at a big company practically answering calls all times of the day. Regardless we still made time for each other and still would try and escape on our separate gaming pc‚Äôs. As the years past I noticed after work she wanted to game less and less to the point of practically never turning on her pc.   We started talking less and she would stay up late into the night while I slept in bed alone. I would try to ask her what was wrong and try to be there for her, but she for whatever reason shut me out. Then she would become glued to her phone always saying she made new Discord friends and that they were the only friends she had in life. I loved her so much I tried to adapt to this new lifestyle of coming home from work and trying to spend time with her while she was glued to her phone barely making eye contact with me. Days turned into weeks; weeks turned into months.   At this point I don‚Äôt even recognize the girl I fell in love with 10 years ago. Our conversations for the whole day consist of good morning, I‚Äôm heading to work, what do you want for dinner, and I‚Äôm going to bed. Her gaming PC I setup for her to match our systems has been collecting dust having been replaced with a MacBook. Our sex life is basically gone to the point where we change in different rooms now not that it was ever important.   A piece of my heart, a piece of my soul feels destroyed. I don‚Äôt know if I did something or if we just grew apart, but the pain hurts so much. When I can‚Äôt sleep late at night, I look at our old pictures together, our old texts and I literally feel like that person is dead. I‚Äôm already planning on moving out of our apartment next month. I‚Äôm going to sit her down and talk to her about it, but I don‚Äôt think she will care much about it. I wish I could fix this I wish I could fix everything, but I finally have accepted that things won‚Äôt change. I deserve to be with someone who loves me the way I love them. I just hope I can continue to move forward. She is such an important part of my life I just can‚Äôt believe its come to this point.	1643139699.0	scm19p	/r/offmychest/comments/scm19p/my_fianc√©e_fell_out_of_love_with_me_after_10_years/	My Fianc√©e fell out of love with me after 10 years.

a97hf0tw	My wife has been about 2 years sober but last weekend she got back in contact with her old friend and immediately starting taking cocaine. She stayed round her friends for the whole weekend and spent ¬£300. She's also startes buy dihydrocodeine from another a friend of her fiend. Before all this she used to abuse her prescription medication and bought 32 tablets of ibuprofen and codeine a day, which then stripped her stomach lining and ended up in several hospital admissions. It got so bad that even her doctor will only prescribe her medication daily instead of weekly. For instance she gets 6 procyclidine a day but weekly that is 42 tablets, she would take all 42 in one day and end up high for the day then withdrawing like hell for the rest of the week while pleading with her doctor for more.  We have 3 children together too. I became a stay at home Dad 5 years ago when our youngest was born. She got pretty bad post natal depression so we decided I'd look after the kids, which has been a truly amazing experience for me. I really love my kids.   These days I do all the housework, cooking, shopping, childcare etc. When I'm not doing these things I'm sorting out whatever the next thing is wrong with my wife. She has mental health problems and will regularly self harm or go out to buy extra medications. I did have the meds all locked in a cashbox so she couldn't keep taking them all (on advice from her mental health worker). She ended up breaking it open with a screwdriver... On Christmas eve... In front of the kids.  We've been together for about 13 years now and I just don't think I can cope anymore. I'm miserable everyday and have regualer stress induced headaches. I've spoken to her about how unhappy I am several time and she always says se sorry and will try to be better but then things just get worse. Now she's taking cocaine again and spending money we don't have. Last week we had no money for food and had to go to a food bank. This was inspite of her asking my parents for ¬£100 which promptly was spent on drugs. She spun a story about her friends cat being ill to get more money from her family and even some of my friends.   I just can't do it anymore. I feel so trapped. Even the relationship between her and my eldest child has broken down because now my daughter is old enough to see what her mum is like. If it wasn't for the kids I think I'd just kill myself and end it. I've given up everything to take care of her, my career, my social life, my health and its never enough.  I wish she'd just go now. As a last thing this morning I dropped her off at a friend's house which turned out to be the dealer that sells her codeine. She lied right to my face about it.  I have no one I can talk to about this stuff.

cy7k3e4c	As the title says. I grew up in a Christian househould. My mom was a stay at home mom and mentally unstable. She was bullied as a kid and kind of became the neighbourhood freak. She raised me in a protective way and I likely have a mild form of autism. I never really had friends and when I did, I only had one friend. After I graduated I have not had friends since. Ever since I was around 12 she always asked if I had a boyfriend and if I was populair. Sadly that was the only thing I was bad at. She never cared about my grades or my amount of hobby's. I really tried but likely being autistic and being raised the way I did, made me not only weird socially but I also got bullied. After a while I just gave up and focused on things I am good at: getting good grades and stuff. Now I am 24 and I finally start looking for a serious relationship. I have never dated before. I try to be engaging but the guys act like they are not interested and I got rejected by my work crush. It feels like high school again. I have gotten hobbies but I honestly feel like it does not matter as long as a guy does not like me. I started teaching myself the piano and learned an amazing song and showed it to my mom and she did not care at all. When I told her I had a guy I was talking to. She was very happy and I felt so proud. Now the guy ignores me and I feel like crying again. I am afraid of ending up as an old spinster.

5wdjj27l	As the title suggest, I do not give a dam  about what I have. This doesn't mean my life's been  all happy moments.  Better parts of my life 1. I graduated from a really good college with computer science degree. 2. I have a job with making almost $30k a year. I'm 22 btw, almost paid off my education loan. 3. I can literally buy anything I want or rather desire. Nobody questions it. I come from a lower middle class and this is huge for me. 4. I love my job. I loved Cybersecurity and I am working in it. Infact I'm good at it.    Worse parts of my life. 1. I am having male pattern baldness at 22. 2. I have slip disk(If you don't know, its a really bad backache, untreatable if you opt out for surgery). I'm almost always in pain. 3. I can't talk to girls. I'll emphasise this later.  I completely accept that my life is really better than most of people. But the problem is I cannot feel good about anything.   Recently I got a promotion and literally the youngest person to got promoted in my company's history (can't name but it's one of the tech giants in cybersecurity space). STILL NOTHING.  Talking about girl problems, I was in a all boys' school. I never had interaction with a female stranger until I was 18 and went to college. Every move seems like I would offend her or she might feel harassed. And for the most part I don't know what to talk about, how to initiate, how to approach.   Sometimes it gets really lonely. Not having someone to call yours. Someone to cuddle with. Someone who'll hug you when you say you had a bad day. I sucks.  All this emotions doesn't help when I talk to them. I come out too strong with this piled up. Please dont take it as if I'm horny.     I dont like the way I look. The baldness really shattered my confidance. I can't talk to anyone while not thinking that these people are judging me and laughing in their head. worst is when they address it and ask silly question about me.   I just cannot accept my flaws.

j00krwep	I have this issue. I would do anything for my partner. Anything for our relationship. I always put the relationship first and every-single-fucking-time that choose themselves. I'll deal with all of their issues and trauma and verbal abuse, but as soon as I have a depressive episode they are out to go fuck some other guy. Sick of this. Sick of giving everything to them and still being replaceable. I literally gave up sex for 2 years when my girlfriend was going through a major depressive episode, but the second I cannot give 150% to her she drops me. So sick of these transactional people. I don't want to become a jaded, misogynistic douchebag but goddamn. Why does everything have to be about THEM and not US. Sick of being hurt. All I ever wanted to do was to love someone NO MATTER WHAT. They always regurgitate that pageantry when they NEVER mean it. Fuck this.	1643141522.0	scmpva	/r/offmychest/comments/scmpva/sick_of_loving_unconditionally_in_relationships/	Sick of loving unconditionally in relationships.

I was supportive and gave him all my support. Now he makes all of these bi jokes, (he once tried to force the joke that we call him bismuth or an element like that as the initials in the periodic table means Bi, it rode on my nerves) to non stop talking about how he is bi and then whenever he types XD it drives me crazy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; i still respect him alot as he is a cool person and i envy that he can be extremely open with his sexuality and talents but, i do not want to hear another call me bismuth joke.

2wzvoksp	I'm a student, and unemployed so I am broke to begin with. But today at the supermarket, when I was about to get my groceries scanned, a woman skipped the line and was waiting awkwardly in order for the cashier to notice her. The cashier then grabbed some groceries which were placed on one side and asked the woman what she was going to buy in the end. She kept adding the prices trying to figure out if she can afford buying what's most important. At one point she wasn't sure what to choose between the toilet paper or two packs of ramen.   I was already an emotional mess because of my shitty day, so this nearly made me cry. I wanted to pay for all of her groceries, but I didn't have enough money either to afford both of our groceries. I only got her what she left behind: a chocolate spread jar and some cherry tomatoes. It wasn't much, but her face turning from worried to slightly smiling made my day, I hope her day got a little better too! She seemed embarrassed, but grateful so I hope I didn't make her feel bad, I didn't mean to insult her in any way.   I wish you the best, sweet lady! I hope things will get better for the both of us!	1643141651.0	scmroc	/r/offmychest/comments/scmroc/i_got_the_chance_to_pay_for_some_of_somebodys/	I got the chance to pay for some of somebody's groceries
41bozc83	In high school I was friends with this girl who later on in life we ended up not being friends, so I didn‚Äôt talk to her for about a year an a half. In April of 2021 I had a dream about her, I never thought about her so it‚Äôs not like one of those think about dream about dreams. (My mom has the same thing, dreamed about her old boss dying, came into work the next day and heard the news). This dream tho I don‚Äôt Remeber what it was about but I woke up scared asf. But sure enough the next day myself and a couple of her old close friends from when we were all in high school were told about what had happened to her. I‚Äôve only told my parents, my boyfriend and a couple friends about this. Even at the ceremony for her I didn‚Äôt have the stomach to tell her own mom about my dream. I just think if I had reached out and said hey just be careful maybe it would have done something. About a week after her ceremony I had another dream and I do Rember this one. We were talking and she said to me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy I survived because I thought i died‚Äù I said wait no you did die and her face dropped and then I just woke up. That made me feel like she wasn‚Äôt at peace, like I had reached to her in my dream an fucked up her afterlife awareness or som. This doesn‚Äôt feel right to talk about to my friends irl, it‚Äôs been so long but almost every day I think about her and my dreams about her and what I could have said to maybe prevent it.	1643141710.0	scmsie	/r/offmychest/comments/scmsie/i_think_i_dreamed_of_my_friends_death_the_night/	I think I dreamed of my friends death the night before it happened
d71kfwc9	I'm just in so much pain ALL the time. Both physical and mental. I have more than one disability that makes it so hard just to work a full-time job. I've never been happy. I'm in my mid 20s and I just will never be able to mentally feel happy and I'm so miserable. I just can't do it anymore. The world is so fucked and there's no point in even living anymore, people can hardly survive at this point. Why even keep dragging everything out the way we do, why keep suffering constantly and needlessly. I don't understand how people can even have children when the world is so fucked. They won't have a future, hell my generation has no future. And yes I have people who love me but I'm also just a burden at this point. I'm so negative and I can't fix it now. No amount of therapy or drugs works. If I'm not high I'm just crying and depressed working my life away for nothing. It'll just be better to end it.	1643141939.0	scmvkm	/r/offmychest/comments/scmvkm/im_probably_going_to_kill_myself/	I'm probably going to kill myself
74y6cabk	   Greetings,  I will try to describe it as briefly as possible. For years, I have been haunted by an incredible nostalgia at the slightest mention or remembrance of my hometown. I am 23, I have been studying uni for a third year now and even now I have not gotten used to the new place where my parents and I moved. Even after 10 years, I still miss the home where I grew up, I had many friends, and today? None of them will contact me today and I am embarrassed to contact them after such a long time. I remember every little memory, every corner of the building, the hiding place, everything as if it never left me. I'm physically elsewhere, but mentally I'm still in my hometown. I've been out of school a few times and just drove to my hometown and took several hours of walking and remembering on my own. From time to time I also look at the webcam, which captures the square of my hometown and I cry how much I miss it. I look at photos and any things that have been preserved and capture some memories of childhood in my hometown. Isn't that weird even after those years? I even looked at the apartment rentals and dreamed what it would be like to return. I know I'm embellishing it and in fact, nothing is waiting for me there (there is a lot of unemployment and people are disappearing from there rather than coming). If only the move was something - but my mother and I realized after two years that the boyfriend she was moving with was a selfish bastard. Even my mother doesn't like it in the city we live in for a long time, but she wouldn't go back. Please advise me - how do I finally move mentally away from my hometown? How to stop thinking about it?  Thank you for any help.	1643141977.0	scmw1c	/r/offmychest/comments/scmw1c/im_terribly_homesick_need_some_help/	I'm terribly homesick, need some help

3s8kq04v	I'm currently 19 years old, in my country, everyone has to serve 3 years in the military which I cannot avoid. There are special positions that exist in the said military which I could have taken if I knew about them or were encouraged to pursue them but I was too young at the time and didn't think about it, so I will probably end up doing something mundane for 3 years.  Afterward, I will have to go to university for 4 years if want to work in the field that I am interested in and then another 2 if I want to get an advanced degree. There are special grants that I could have gotten that would have greatly reduced my expenses, but I was too young and didn't think about such things, and I won't be able to get them now because they rely on my performance in school and the military. Afterward, I will need to work like everyone else to earn a sustainable living day in and day out.  Normally I wouldn't be ashamed of my life, but here is a thing:  At 19 I will get enlisted, At 22 I will get released, I will probably need to work for a year or so to get my life together and save some money because I don't want to take on leans (due to the economic situation in my country) and then at 27/29 I will graduate and only then will I be able to get a real job and earn some money.  I thought that your 20's were supposed to be the time of self-discovery and yet I will need to spend most of them stuck in academia just so I wouldn't need to work a dead-end job for someone to stay alive, and that's not counting all of the corporate shenanigans I keep reading about in the news.  I have learned the hard way that just as it is harder to make friends later in life as opposed to when you are young, so is to get the opportunities to live an exciting and meaningful life in the country where you have to have your life figured out at a young age from which you could build onward and be able to look back on in joy, knowing that you have made the right decisions.   Please tell me that all of this is nonsense and that I am still too young and overthinking because I don't want my future to be that gray.	1643142192.0	scmyxo	/r/offmychest/comments/scmyxo/please_convince_me_that_my_future_isnt_as/	Please convince me that my future isn't as depressing as I think it is
e8nyflk9	People say when you‚Äôre feeling down, you should have gratitude. ‚ÄúThings can always be worse,‚Äù they say. But things could have been significantly better. If a paraplegic was upset over their situation, would telling them, ‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôre not a quadriplegic,‚Äù help in any real way? I doubt it. This way of thinking is just constantly setting the bar lower for yourself to trick you into ‚Äúfeeling better.‚Äù Eventually the bar gets so low that when you step back, you just see how pathetic it is. Maybe instead you tell them, ‚ÄúAt least you have functioning arms.‚Äù Maybe they can achieve great things with only their arms. But there is always that feeling of what could have been. If they had use of their legs, what heights could they have achieved?  I‚Äôve seen how better things could have been, and now I live in total envy. How can I not? People with their privileges and the way they gloat. I want to take what they have. I want to be the one who‚Äôs gloating.  To be clear, I myself am not disabled.

ev7peks8	As the title stated, two years ago today my friend had passed away. He came into my life when I was in a really bad place, fresh out of the hospital from a suicide attempt and trying to get my life back on track by getting a job. I got hired into the job I applied for and was pleasantly surprised to see this guy there, treating me like I actually mattered without even having to know me. Every life he came across, he shed such a bright light onto that literally no one who knew him would have anything bad to say about him. He would do anything for anyone, he even helped a new employee who was struggling to make ends meet for her kid by giving her a gift card with a very significant amount of money just because he wanted to help. He was a hard worker who loved his job. We would talk every day on shift and just smile the whole time because we really related to each other. When the news broke that he passed, it was so sudden and no one saw it coming. I was a mess ever since, even still occasionally thinking about him because there‚Äôs so much I never got to tell him. I hope he knew how loved he was by so many, and by me especially. He helped me through everything ups and downs and I wish he was still here so I can tell him about all the amazing things that have happened since he‚Äôs been gone, along with all the progress I have made. There will be absolutely no other human like him, but I hope to find someone one day that cared about me the way he did, and was just as pure spirited as he was. I‚Äôm not losing hope on that though. I‚Äôm glad I was able to stick around to experience his presence, but more importantly glad to even be alive right now because he inspired me to not give up on myself and that there are good things out there. He showed me my value, showed me how strong I am. I know he would be proud of me right now. I just miss him a whole lot, it was really the first significant loss in my life and sometimes I still find myself not knowing what to do without him.	1643142383.0	scn1j8	/r/offmychest/comments/scn1j8/today_marks_2_years_since_one_of_my_good_friends/	Today marks 2 years since one of my good friends passed away and I‚Äôm really missing him.
8szeirkz	My boyfriend and I have been together for some time and we moved into an apartment in Brooklyn together which is a big accomplishment. But god fucking dammit does he act useless sometimes, and takes advantage of everything like a Fucking leech.  So I had to take out a loan for us to get thus apartment for a down payment, it‚Äôs fine. But since living in Brooklyn he‚Äôs racked up 2,000 in tickets tolls and fines on MY CAR. Yes we share the car and everything but all of that shit is under MY NAME. He has no legal responsibility to take care of the tolls and tickets, but I fucking do. Not to mention he crashed my car about 3 fucking times (minor fender benders but it depreciated the value of my car by a fuck ton)  For Christmas and I loved this, he converted out extra bedroom into an art studio it was amazing, amazing right I was so happy that he put so much thought and effort into something for me.  The catch is the next month I had to pay all of the bills and my portion of the rent so he could catch up on all the money he had to spent. Like I love the effort but now I‚Äôm stuck paying so much money in bills all by myself because you overspent for Christmas   Cleaning? Fuck no I ask him to split chores but then the dishes stay stuck in the sink, or he leaves shit stains in the toilet. And messes up our couch with food. And I‚Äôm stuck washing and scrubbing the stains out of the couch just for him to mess it up again. He won‚Äôt wash laundry he won‚Äôt wash dishes until a week later, granted he has adhd but you‚Äôre not fucking 10. I‚Äôm the main one that takes the trash out. I have to beg hom to clean. When I bought it up to him finally he and I get into a screaming battle about how he thinks I‚Äôm ungrateful and I‚Äôm home all day and he works (2 days out the week) so I should clean up after him every 10 mins. I‚Äôm 21 not 45 with kids I shouldn‚Äôt be taking up after you like we‚Äôre married    I love him I really do but this isn‚Äôt the life I picked for myself. I want this to work but what else do I need to give to him for him to give back.

5wb592wu	I just want to get this shit feeling of my chest.  First a bit of the past:   I \[25M\] never had a GF/Sex or something in that way. The last 3 years I went to therapy and get way better and more confident then before. in summer last year, because of the fact I hated it to be a virgin I decided to visit a sexworker, what changed a lot in my life. I don't reget it so far. In november I found a girl online. She was from a different country, but we liked each other and so after 3 dates we decide to sleep with each other. It was amazing because she was my first regular girl I slept with. After a view more dates we had a serious relationship and it went well. But after 5 weeks it was over. I know not a long time, but it was my first real relationship in my entire life.   Honestly I wasn't that sad about that, because I also didn't felt confident in this relationship. We had some communication problems and it didn't work out well anyhow.  However now I'm back in the dating-world for about 2-3 weeks and I already hate it again.   I don't know how I should find someone else. I started online-dating and I'd really like to just meet girls. But I don't know where. In my country many clubs are still closed and even though they open (they are allowed to but only a few does it), I don't have the confidence to go there alone (I don't have many friends with time).  &#x200B;  I know I can't pressure to find someone. I really want a relationship! I really want to find someone who I can love. But at the moment I just want someone to sleep with. My sex-life did just started and it seems to me like it ends already.   I also thought to make this feeling a bit easier, I should visit a sexworker again, but they are such expensive. a half hour with them costs more then an hour with my therapist.   I don't know what to do...

45nkn78d	My sister (37 f) has been in an abusive relationship for 20 years. She is 11 years older than I am. She has 4 kids with this loser who treats her like absolute shit while not doing anything but smoke weed and complain.  They bought a place, and are renovating it so all 6 of them are living basically out of the living room and kitchen. This is almost year 2 of this with very little progress on renovations. My sister just had a baby (their 4th) which was unexpected. He smokes weed in the living room with the kids around, and the new baby. My sister is the one who works, and has assistance for herself and the kids. She takes care of all the kids and their needs. He dropped out of high school and has pretty much done nothing ever since. He got her hooked on serious drugs when she was like 18, and she dropped to like 80 pounds. I don‚Äôt remember this because I was like 7. He‚Äôs called her every name under the sun and blames her for everything. He gambles their money away by betting on sports.   My fear is that my nieces are going to grow up (13 and 11) and ask me why I didn‚Äôt get them out of that situation (my nephews are still very young). I‚Äôm afraid if I say or do anything drastic, I won‚Äôt be able to see them anymore.	1643143009.0	scn9xd	/r/offmychest/comments/scn9xd/my_sister_is_in_an_abusive_relationship/	My sister is in an abusive relationship
iyete9e4	 This one has been on my head for a while now, about 3 years to be exact. Back when I was 16, in junior year, this guy who is now one of the closest friends I ever had(lets call him Joe) asked me about this girl(lets call her Anna) in the other class who he liked at that time, because he was the new kid and we weren't friends then. Now, I had a habit of speaking without thinking so I pretty much talked sh\*t about her to him. I said some pretty mean things about Anna, even though I never had anything against her, maybe I didn't like her back then or I was just repeating things that I heard about her from other people, I don't remember, but I called her a hoe(the other s-slur too if I remember), even though she wasn't even remotely close to the word or to any other version of it. Others may have had their reasons to dislike her but she never had any problem with me personally nor did I have any bones to pick with her. I remember wanting to discourage Joe from being her friend, that's all, and I said some dumb sh\*t without realizing how bad it really meant.  Few days later I hear from a mutual friend, lets call her Sally, that Anna found out what I said about her and she was deeply hurt(Joe went and told her), she really took it to heart and I'm pretty sure I heard she cried even. This kinda hit me hard because, up until then, I never intentionally hurt people or wanted to hurt them, nor did I have and negative feelings towards them. I was kinda hurt that Joe sold me out, but couldn't even be mad at him because it was on me. From then on Anna pretty much hated me and ignored me. I understood and I didn't bother approaching her because she had every reason to do so. I wanted nothing more than to apologize to her, but Sally(while also telling me off that I did a wrong thing), told me to forget about it and that I wasnt even supposed to know that Anna found out.  Time passes and things die down a bit and I grow closer to Joe(he was best friends with her too) as friends and he tells me he regretted telling Anna about what I said and apologized to me. I said that I forgave him long ago, that it was mostly my fault than his, and that I really wanted to apologize to her because I still felt really bad. Joe tells me to forget about it and that Anna was past it now, same as Sally said. I tell him many times later that I want to apologize but he tells me to let it go. The thing is, I pretty much fixed myself ever since this incident had happened and I made sure I never cause pain to anyone because of any dumb things that I do or say. Ever since then, I watched my step big time, and I will apologize even if I suspect I hurt anyone in any way. Time passes and Anna stops ignoring me , treated me pretty normally and so did I her, but every time I saw her face, I just wanted to look her in the eye and tell her how sorry I was.  I pride myself in keeping good relations with people and I never want to give people the chance to dislike me because I hurt them. Over 3 years have passed and I still want to apologize. Joe isn't in contact with her anymore and they aren't even talking so I really can't ask him how she would react to it anymore. All it takes is one text to her. I really do not know if I should apologize, I really, really want to. In all my time in school, I have done pretty dumb things, all of which have made me into a better man, but I had never hurt someone before, and regret to this day, even though I became more respectful, it bothers me that I cause pain to someone who had nothing against me. What do I do? Forget it or apologize to her?	1643143319.0	scne6d	/r/offmychest/comments/scne6d/i20m_want_to_apologize_to_her_but_i_dont_know/	I(20M) want to apologize to her, but I don't know what to do
j0patxi4	I know I know. This isn't the place to go to for help. Contact professionals, talk to friends and family etc... I'm not going to contact a professional because they'll call the cops and put me on a list. My Friends and family have no idea how to help me and when I've tried talking about it they've kinda just blew me off saying I shouldn't be like this. So you guys are all I got at this point.  Anyways here's the situation. I'm 25(M). I'm obese beyond a point to where I can see myself being able to really do anything about it. I've always been this way. I can't remember ever being as thin as a normal person. Even as a child I was fat. When I was 16 I was trying my absolute best to lose weight and be active and hurt myself playing tennis. I guess I went to hard and got a herniated disc. They wouldn't operate on it then because I was too young. So through the rest of my high school days I was basically dormant. No sports or any extra curricular activities. I gained all my weight back plus a lot more making my back situation worse. It gets worse.  My sophomore year of college I had to finally get surgery on the disc because I could no longer walk. I don't know how to describe how this made me. I was depressed sure, but also just lost all drive for everything. I would procrastinate on school work putting me extremely far behind. I already wasn't a good student. So I ended up having to drop classes putting me to where I wouldn't graduate on time. At this time my parents knew about the situation and weren't too pushy about it.   The surgery ended up making the discs above the original disc weaker which made me have to get another surgery on the disc above the following year which made me fall even further behind in classes. My parents and I already knew I wasn't going to graduate on time but they didn't know just how bad it was. My grades had dropped to a 1.9 GPA and I was put on academic probation and was no longer allowed to take out state loans. So I ended up dropping out almost completely.  I had to constantly lie to my parents about classes and now have gotten so deep to where they think I've graduated.   That brings us to today. I can't do manual labor jobs because of my back. And can't get anything except customer service jobs because I didn't graduate and that's basically all my area offers that doesn't require a degree. I'm severely obese because of various reasons, depression, my back, my weight etc... So I'm forced to still live with my parents and am running out of reasons to tell them why I don't have a job and why I'm not losing weight. So yeah I think I'm gonna just kill myself soon with drugs or something because I can't see any way out of this. So I'm making this post to see if you guys have any ideas. That's all.  &#x200B;  P.S. Also I've completely thrown away the idea of any relationships or having a family one day. It's just so unlikely at this point I've just put it out of my mind completely.	1643143368.0	scneuf	/r/offmychest/comments/scneuf/so_i_think_im_gonna_kill_myself_you_guys_got_any/	So I think I'm gonna kill myself.

hi82tjke	Hoards of women will comment, claiming that they are the exception, but what's more valid?...the exception or the general rule? This post is about how women act IN GENERAL. Women want to be treated like delicate little flowers but can't take it when men call out these behaviors to prove that most women operate through a childlike worldview where everything is done for them by men because "women deserve it". So, as a woman, if you accept these acts of benevolent sexism, you are by default either saying that men are women's little slaves or you're saying that women can't handle the real world and can't survive without men taking the lead. With that being said, here's a list of things women should stop doing/accepting if they actually believe that men and women are equal.  1. Expecting men to open car doors for you  2. Expecting to be swept off your feet by a man while you literally don't reciprocate anything.  3. Expecting men to check if there's a burglar if you hear a weird noise in your house at night.  4. Expecting men to help you with luggage.  5. Dumping your emotional baggage on men yet being repulsed when men do the same.  6. Expecting men to fix what's broken around the house.  7. Expecting men to give up their bus seat for you if the bus is too crowded  8. Expecting men to pay for dates (I don't care who asked who, buy your own damn food. It's an    easy cop out for women to say "whoever asks should pay" knowing full well that women almost    never ask the man on a date.  9. Expecting your wedding ring to be full of diamonds while your husband has a shitty plain    wedding band.  10. Becoming aggressive with men then cowering down when the man himself becomes aggressive.  11. Teaching your son "ladies first"  Either accept that men and women are not equal or just admit that you're a hypocritical woman who likes to milk the perks of being a woman while still proclaiming that "men and women are equal".	1643143405.0	scnfc8	/r/offmychest/comments/scnfc8/if_men_and_women_are_truly_equal_then_women/	If men and women are truly equal, then women should stop the following behaviors

I sleep like shit, I cant get up in the morning, I am not working out... It feels like I am at one of my worse points in this pandemic so far.

cahg6ch1	Trigger warning: Story makes reference to rape.   I just want to provide context first. I have been friends with this person since our school days over fifteen years and for the most part we get on really well. For the sake of this story, I will refer to him as L.  L has had a rough couple of years after losing a close family member who he considered a father as well as a bad breakup with his partner whom is the mother of his daughter.   More recently, L has been back on the on the single scene and meeting multiple women for casual hookups.   What he does in his private life is his business and I have no concern with that.   However, what I do have a concern with is his attitude towards women in general and how he objectifies them.   L often tells me about his escapades and how they are ‚Äòsl*gs‚Äô and ‚Äòup for anything‚Äô and also how his ‚Äònumbers are getting better.‚Äô   Whenever I meet up with him for a catch up and some drinks in an evening he is always trying to ‚Äòpull‚Äô. He also asked me how many people I‚Äôve slept with as if it‚Äôs some kind of competition?   I‚Äôve expressed my concerns to him and avoid encouraging his behaviour, but it seems to just go in one ear and out the other.  More recently, just a few days ago, I was looking at the local news and was in sheer disbelief that one of our old college teachers was convicted for raping a young woman.   L called me later that evening and I broke the news about our former college teacher being convicted of rape and his immediate response was laughter.   I immediately told him that it wasn‚Äôt funny and he found the news article and recited certain parts of the victims account whilst laughing.   L then went on to justify how ‚Äòyou cant really blame him if he hasn‚Äôt had sex in so long‚Äô to which I replied ‚Äòyou can blame him and you cannot justify rape no matter how you try and spin it.‚Äô  After the phone call (which was on loudspeaker and my wife heard everything) I looked at my wife and said I‚Äôm genuinely worried he will rape someone one of these days. It might seem an extreme statement but I wouldn‚Äôt say it if I wasn‚Äôt genuinely concerned.  I was tempted to mention in the phone call with L what he would say if that was his daughter was a victim of rape, but I bailed as although it would maybe put things in perspective, I feel he would get angry.   I don‚Äôt know if and how I would raise my concerns tactfully to him without causing problems.	1643143778.0	scnkg3	/r/offmychest/comments/scnkg3/my_best_friend_laughed_about_a_woman_being_raped/	My best friend laughed about a woman being raped
5vfmtqks	If you don‚Äôt get good SATs in year 6 you‚Äôre put into bottom sets and at a disadvantage.  If you don‚Äôt get perfect GCSEs you can‚Äôt go into A-Levels.  If you don‚Äôt get perfect A-Levels Uni‚Äôs won‚Äôt want you.  If you don‚Äôt get a degree you won‚Äôt get a decent job.  But if you get the ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùwrong‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù degree you won‚Äôt get a decent job either.  Oh, and don‚Äôt forget the hours of work experience to lead up to that on top of everything else.  Hours of studying every week just to try and get a B in A-Levels which isn‚Äôt even that great because there are people out there naturally better than you who employers will always choose first??  So then why bother???  All this effort, the amount of sleep I‚Äôm never getting back, my mental and physical health in absolute tatters, all so I can MAYBE POSSIBLY get a half decent job?  And then spend the next 70 years of my life desperately trying to be better than everyone else just to earn enough money to live comfortably??  And yet suicide is considered ‚Äúcowardly‚Äù or ‚Äúweak‚Äù.  There are always going to be people out there who are better than me, so why should I bother?  They‚Äôre going to be prettier, smarter, more charismatic, live a better life, have more friends‚Ä¶  Why am I trying to win a battle I was destined to lose in the first place?  I‚Äôm so fucking tired.  I‚Äôm tired of being treated as not even a second option, even by the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I once adored.  The spark I had a few years ago and was just starting to get back a year ago has now completely gone out.  I feel like a lifeless ghost.  My whole life is being decided by this ONE SET OF EXAMS-  If I knew how to, I think I would‚Äôve left this world, its stupid toxic human societies, and all the people in them behind already.	1643143834.0	scnl5k	/r/offmychest/comments/scnl5k/its_all_just_a_giant_competition/	It‚Äôs all just a giant competition
e3iwtm0t	For years I constantly walk on eggshells to make sure I don't say or do the wrong thing to get yelled at or given the silent treatment for another few weeks. I don't drive and he does. So if we have an argument and I need to go anywhere or need things from the store if I say or do anything he doesn't agree with I just have to go without until he is ready. We live in a city with no public transportation or Ubers so I'm pretty much screwed if we are at odds which is always. We have children which makes it ten times worse because they somehow get stuck in the middle. This morning I was up most of the night with the baby slept two hours and had to get my oldest two up for school. On his way home I sent him money to pick up breakfast for us because I am exhausted and didn't want to cook. My brother called me in a panic and while I was calming him down my bf kept calling. Finally I called him back and he's berating me on why I didn't pick up. I said my brother has something going on I can't be at ur beckon call at the drop of a hat. Apparently he didn't like that because he said well I hope u can get ur ass up and cook. And hung up on me. This is the most draining relationship I've ever been in. Why do I feel like I'm going crazy?

3qvnh00p	My mom warned him it might not be a good idea. Heck, it's even illegal.   The care home made an exception for my dad (70s) to visit his elderly mom (who is quite fit for her age still), because she seemed rather unhappy about not getting any visits - while the whole care home was in QUARANTINE for 14 day due to 4 staff members testing positive.  Meanwhile my mom (60s), who is a risk patient and currently is immunosuppressed and wasn't even allowed to get a booster shot due to that has to live with him under the same roof while he rides this virus out.   "You know, just some mild symptoms, and I mean, we're vaccinated so what's gonna happen?"  Um...long covid could happen? A body not taking this virus too kindly while it's own immune system is not working? Hello?! Wtf is wrong with my dad?   I'm so scared for her. I'm so angry at him. I'm so angry at the whole world at the moment, because nobody cares anymore. Nobody cares who gets sick, whom they infect, who might die or get long covid  (which is a debilitating chronic illness similar to chronic fatigue syndrome).  And that's what's so fucked up. The people who frickin CAN get their shots and probably won't get bad consequences if they test positive are the ones that mindlessly infect other people who are not so lucky. People who cannot get their shots even if they want, who could die or have complications when they get covid.  So I wholeheartedly want to say FUUUUCKKKK OFFF to all the people who moan about inconvenience and knowingly risk other people's health.  I don't want to lose my mom.

306agsmn	Two weeks ago, things got really bad at home with my parents (emotional/verbal abuse from my dad). I (24F) was looking at hotels/shelters to stay in, but my best friend (25F) and her boyfriend (mid to late 20sM) offered to let me stay with them while I got back on my feet.  During that time, I focused on myself, my healing, my next steps. A lot of it was spent crying to my therapist, other friends, and my girlfriend.   My best friend (who has known about my family issues for as long as we have been friends) and her boyfriend were also there for me but I think they started resenting it.  I was ready to go, with an apartment close to be being lined up. Days before, my friend tells me sternly that I am rejecting friendship from her boyfriend and that I‚Äôm not respecting their space. I immediately try to be overly friendly and respectful.  But then a few days ago, my friend sits me down and almost intervention style, tells me that I‚Äôm self centered, selfish, disrespectful, and that I am hurting her and her boyfriend. (Note that the boyfriend never said any of these things, it was only her) She and her boyfriend felt like parents rather than friends. Yet when I tried to talk, she‚Äôd stick her finger up and tell me she isn‚Äôt finished.  I have trauma where my parents would corner me to yell at me so when my friend was doing this, I immediately had a panic attack. I tried to get away but she wouldn‚Äôt let me leave. I had to go back and listen to more, but eventually I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and left, which she views as running away from the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù conversation.   I was sobbing uncontrollably in my car and it took my therapist and a different friend to calm me down. After what happened, and knowing she was going to continue this ‚Äúconversation‚Äù, I couldn‚Äôt stay anymore. Since that friend and her boyfriend were playing a game, I wrote notes saying thank you, packed my stuff, and left.  I moved back home to my parents. They welcomed me back and I am safe, but it‚Äôs a little awkward until we try to reconcile.   Well, the next day, my best friend writes a novel length message telling me that I hurt her by leaving and I‚Äôm not willing to listen to her yell at me. She also used things against me, saying that I am just like my mother in that I make things about myself. (Which she knows is my deepest fear that I‚Äôll become my parents.) She also insinuated that I need psychiatric help.  I tried to once again apologize for anything that I might have done wrong and that we need a break from the friendship, but she once again told me I need help, I‚Äôm an awful friend, and that she hopes I work on myself.   The thing is, everything she said that I am, self-centered, selfish, etc. is how I would describe her. I have been friends with her for over 10 years and this is how she is. I‚Äôve watched her treat people badly and lose friends due to her behavior but I stuck around because I thought I had no one else. Then it became, ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs her being her‚Äù. I changed myself, even sacrificed things to keep her happy and my friend.   It‚Äôs also funny to me how she says I need psychiatric help when my therapist, group therapy members, and other friends all agree that she is a major narcissist who gaslit me and because the attention wasn‚Äôt on her during the time I was staying with them, I became an inconvenience and I needed to ‚Äúshape up‚Äù.   Side note, I know she is going through a tough time herself, she just lost her aunt today and the day before all this happened, she said her goodbyes to her. I wasn‚Äôt in a good place to provide support when she came home from hospice, but I would have tried. I have always been there for her previously when she lost family members and such, but it feels like the one time I am not able to be a proper shoulder to cry on, she loses it. This I feel bad about.   I told her off and now we are not friends anymore. Still, when I think about it too much, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I still did something wrong. She has since unfriended me on social media which stings more than it should. Plus I can‚Äôt help but wonder if she is bad mouthing me to anyone who will listen to her. Outside perspectives are welcome. Maybe folks have similar stories. Thanks for reading.   TLDR: my ex-best friend helped me when I needed it most, then turned on me when the attention wasn‚Äôt on her, and claims I‚Äôm a bad friend when she was gaslighting and manipulating me. I still feel awful about everything and I‚Äôm not sure if there is blame on my end.	1643144304.0	scnr9v	/r/offmychest/comments/scnr9v/my_exbest_friend_attacked_me_when_i_was_in_a/	My ex-best friend attacked me when I was in a vulnerable state

Few months ago i had escaped from toxic relationship, for a moment i felt like woow im already off this shit and can be happy.  I just thought so, im lawyer, i have money, own apartment and AMG at 23y in the capital of one of the European countries and im still unhappy.  Recently, I met a girl and for the first time in my life I felt that someone appreciates me and I do not have to pretend to be anyone in front of her. After all, it was great for a few days, but now I feel like an empty man again.  Additionally, two weeks ago my beloved mother passed away due to brain cancer, it only killed me because we were like friends. I don't know what to do anymore. I am very unhappy and never felt as bad as the last time. I think I want to end myself because I don't see any solution to this shit.	1643144414.0	scnss2	/r/offmychest/comments/scnss2/nothing_makes_me_happy_anymore/	Nothing makes me happy anymore
bdrgkel9	When I went to high school(think that is wat it is called in the us) I was 16/17 my first year I thought I finally had found a good close friends group  we started hanging out much and I always hosted boys nights where we played games hanged out and consumed alcohol. The Sumer to my second year we partied every weekend and that continued for a short periode in to my second year but they started to invite me les and Les to hang out and parties.   I stile did invite them to come to me for boyes nights for drinking and stuff and they usually always sed yes and we did have a grate time. It took me some time to stop inviting them because I hated the idea of always being alone in the weekends.  It feels like they only stayed friends with me at school was because that I always had a house for my self sins my father moved in with us girlfriend and I got a choice to join him or stay in his house.   I can‚Äôt count how many times I have asked if something is happening and they say no or that they will let me know, but almost every time I got snaps of them later that they had went to parties or I saw it on their snap stories. And there have been times ween I have asked to hang out but they said they can‚Äôt so I asked some one els and me and him went to go bowling and gues ho I meth there it was my hole friend groupe. They just brushed it off saying that it was last minute planes and forgot to invite me.   And they always had a messenger groupe called friends for life that they added new combers but newer me. They talked about the chat and once two of them asked me why I wasn‚Äôt in the chat I said I don‚Äôt know but they never added me stil after that.   I am still friends with a few of them but still never get invited. I am 19 now.   It just feels like that they used me because they could hang out in my house at any time because they knew I wouldn‚Äôt sa no to them.  I have always had some degree of social anxiety and have had a hard time making friends and they were the only friends of mine that parties.   All of this makes Me feel sad and lonely as shit.	1643144594.0	scnv9v	/r/offmychest/comments/scnv9v/bad_friends_or_is_it_just_me_thoughts_rant/	Bad friends or is it just me? Thoughts? (Rant)
i1tvh8k3	I have no one to talk to, other than my husband, and I just need to get this out. I‚Äôm feeling so hopeless and worthless right now. I‚Äôm in major debt, and it‚Äôs sucking the life out of me. I had a government job for ten years until my husband was wounded overseas and I resigned to care for him once he was medically retired. Four years ago I finally found a part time remote job as online esl teacher, which ended in October (until they find enough students from other countries, which will take years) Now, I found a part time temp job working four hours a week.   I‚Äôm smart, I‚Äôm educated with a 4 year degree, I‚Äôm a kind, too empathetic person. I have narcolepsy and get tired easily so I can no longer work outside the home. I‚Äôm not a lazy person but I‚Äôm sure on the outside it looks that way. I feel completely worthless. I‚Äôm buried in debt that is eating away at me. We are living paycheck to paycheck, and it‚Äôs not enough. We are over the income limits for any assistance. I want to give up. I can‚Äôt give up, and I won‚Äôt give up because I have a husband and children who depend on me. I have no local friends, (we moved here two years ago) and I have no family. It‚Äôs just us. I‚Äôm completely alone. I just called a credit card company to ask for a payment extension (first time), and they said no. I ended up bawling. I‚Äôm sorry, I just had to write this somewhere.

2o93mshx	Back when I worked in an office I used to frequent a small family run restaurant that was just down the street.  Their food was terrific.  The interior of their restaurant was a bit groady.  The tables were old and the chairs looked like something they got for cheap at Sam's.   However, their kitchen looked clean and as I said, the food was terrific.  The place was always busy and the family working in the back were always super nice and always busting their ass and getting orders out.    The pandemic hit and I still did what I could to support them.  Instead of putting a small order in just for myself, I'll order food for my entire family and pick it up.  One day while I was in line I looked up at the ceiling and saw a the outline of a dead roach in the fluorescent light cover.  Ew.  Later that day I called the health department about it.  I figured that they would go out, tell them what's wrong, give them a B, and then the family would correct the issues.  I go back a week later and the restaurant is shut down...completely.  Seems they were operating without a health permit from the beginning.  I took away an entire family's income.  I feel sick.	1643145002.0	sco0s9	/r/offmychest/comments/sco0s9/i_reported_a_small_family_run_restaurant_to_the/	I reported a small family run restaurant to the health department and got them shut down

Actually live around plants, nature and sunshine. I work in IT an accepted a job with it as it will pay better than other jobs I am qualified for. I am 32 years old and have worked full time since I was 16 and it seems so pointless. I wish I could fast track to having money saved to buy a small house and try to live off the land.

igqeb52r	Let me start this off by saying that I am a CSA survivor and talk a lot about my abusive family. If topics such as these make you uncomfortable, then I encourage to scroll elsewhere.  I can only ever remember having a strained relationship with my mom. She and her husband, my stepdad, were horrible for me for many years,13 to be exact.  Whenever he would make fun of me or make creepy comments (usually mentioning my body or appearance) towards me, she would just excuse it. Any time I got mad over it, she would tell me that I shouldn't react because that's what he wanted. Like wtf. She knew what he was saying was wrong and still found a way to blame me.  I was the subject of bullying in elementary school for a couple of years. On the days that I came home crying, my mother would get angry at me. She'd complain that I was crying too loudly and that the whole neighborhood could hear me.  I was around 11 when I started having suicidal thoughts. There have only been two times when I acted on those thoughts. Once when I was 11, only my best friend knows about that one, and once when I was 15. I want to establish that I've had these thoughts long before my second attempt.  My family, mom, stepdad, and me, was eating at this dinner. We were eating breakfast, and talking and, somehow, it got to the topic of suicide. My mom was just going off about how awful suicidal people are for not thinking of the loved one they're leaving behind.   I just wasn't having it. I was pissed. I wanted her to give a fuck for once. I wanted her to act like a mother for once. I ended up telling her that I wanted to kill myself... She told me I was selfish. That pushed me over the edge and lead me to my second attempt. My second attempt was very different from my first. Had it gone according to plan, I would not be here.  Then, there's the matter of me trying to leave. I was 16 when I packed my shit, and called my grandparents to come get me. I told them that I didn't feel safe living there. They show up. Grandma takes me out for ice cream and asks me what's going on. Meanwhile, Grandpa is distracting my parents at home and buying us time.  I told my Grandma what went on in that house. She said she's anything she could to help me. We we went back, she told Grandpa what happened. He had to stop himself from punching my mom's husband in the face. I thought we were about to leave, but Grandma felt the need to ask my mom if it was okay to take me. Which irked me, I'm not going to lie. She reluctantly agreed, but said that I had to come back from "visiting" them eventually.  After that I hopped between my grandparent's and my mom's house. One of the big reasons why was because my mom had offered to get me into therapy. I was ecstatic. I thought I was finally getting what I had wanted all of those years, my mom to care about me.   However, a week went by and nothing changed. A month went by and nothing changed. Three months go by and she admits to me that she lied about getting me help. My heart is shattered. I started staying there for less and less time. Three weeks went to two, and two to one, and one to just a couple days.  It took me an entire year to get out of there, to get to the point where I no longer wanted to go back. It's actually been a little more than a year since my decision. Which, I'm proud of myself for doing that.  My mom, to this day, still offers me therapy. She's been promising, but never delivering on therapy for more than 2 years now. She keep telling me to wait. Wait for what? I know she's financially well-off.  The present issue at the moment is that I'm done with her shit, but my Grandma still feels the need to ask her for things. Like setting up doctor's appointments, which my mom never does. I can't even remember that last time I went to a dentist.  I think my grandparents should stop waiting around for her permission. It's pretty fucking evident that she doesn't care about my well-being.	1643145146.0	sco2tm	/r/offmychest/comments/sco2tm/i_hate_that_my_grandparents_still_have_faith_in/	I hate that my grandparents still have faith in my mother.

She'll always talk to me about the stuff that troubles her, will try to get us to snuggle together when she's feeling down, we have dinners with other couples/families, I always drive her around, drive her and my brother to have holidays together, we'll often sleep together, cook for her, be physically way too close, etc...  I don't know how to put it in to words, but it's nauseating. We're just way too close for my comfort. I stopped reading romantic novels because it reminded me of her in a platonic way and it made me cringe extremely hard. I just feel disgusted with myself. I don't know why, but I just can't see her as my mother (as in, a figure I look up to/could rely on). She's just some fella I like and more often than not I feel like her caregiver.

j0p65211	There's a girl the same age as me that I used to live in the house across the street from mine when I was a boy. She was very tomboyish, liked to play outside with the boys more than anything else. We got to be good friends over the years of our childhood.   I always had a big crush on her, probably because she was the only girl I spoke to regularly if I'm being honest. Never said anything to her about it though, never really had the confidence.  I moved away (migrated to the US) when I was 12, and while we did run into each other 2 or 3 times as teenagers, we never really hung out again after that.  I'm 27 now and was back home for a short visit, while I was there I scrolled past her number in my phone and decided I'd ask her to dinner to catch up. She accepted and we met up for a bite at a pretty nice restaurant near her parents house, where she still lives.  I could barely believe my eyes when I saw her, she was drop dead gorgeous. Her pictures on social media really hadn't been doing here justice. We had a good time catching up talking about our careers and goals and reminiscing about the fun we had as children.   Hanging out was fun, but I honestly don't think there was really a romantic in our interactions at all. I tried to kiss her at the end of the night anyway (cause you never know unless you try). She didn't kiss me, but she laughed and offered me her cheek instead of her lips (which I interpreted as a nice way of telling me she wasn't interested). Was generally a good time, glad we did   Anyway a few days later and for some reason I still can't get her out of my head. This series of memories that I guess must have been buried in my subconscious for years just seem to keep popping up. I'm starting to remember things like how she used to laugh and the clothes she used to wear and the deep frown on her face every morning before school.  These memories feel so good, I haven't felt this kind of silly puppy love energy about anyone since I was in highschool. I guess my thoughts about her just make me feel so much more innocent and less calculating about relationships than I usually am. It makes me feel like a little boy again, and I really haven't felt that way in a long time.  I know it's not real though, it's in my head. I didn't feel this way when I was actually sitting with her. I found her attractive for sure, and I liked talking to her, but I didn't really feel a spark. It's only once I started remembering our childhood that I started feeling this way. I think a part of me might be in love with the girl she was, even though I barely know the woman she is, if that makes sense.   I definitely need to focus on something else to avoid developing some kind of obsession ( I can feel it coming on). But I'm glad I got to experience feeling this way again, I honestly didn't think I was capable of it.	1643146578.0	scolux	/r/offmychest/comments/scolux/seeing_my_childhood_crush_had_made_me_feel_more/	Seeing my childhood crush had made me feel more alive than I have in years.

People make me feel like I'm a creep just because of how I look and it upsets me, it gets me thinking about why I've got no experience with dating so it's hard not to feel like the creep towards women so I distance myself just that they don't feel uncomfortable. I'm purely going off of how I see other people's perspective of me, they make me feel like I'm not good enough. I feel like if it wasn't for having my family that worry about eachother that I would've went down a rabbit hole & would've struggled to come back. When things go side ways for me I feel empty inside that I just wanna cry but I don't because most of time because I remind myself that there's alot worse things happening then my emotions getting the better of me so I just suck it up as much as I can.	1643147500.0	scox71	/r/offmychest/comments/scox71/sometimes_i_25m_feel_sad_not_happy_with_myself_im/	Sometimes I (25M) Feel Sad & Not Happy With Myself & I'm Trying Understand Why.

I go out and I try to get to know new people from different places but i never make it after the talking stage. And if i did they always think I'm better of as a friend, even tho i try different approaches but they always see me as a friend material . I really want to stop thinking about it and focus on my life , and i try to fake till i forget or something but I can't because it's always in the back of my head.

z6fid	My twin sister (we're 25) has cerebral palsy and a lower than average intelligence. I am autistic and have adhd, so my anger can be really intense if I forget my medicine. Which happens a lot. Now that I have gotten older, and my sister and I have faced trauma and abuse from my mother's ex, we treat each other even worse. Ever since we hit puberty, we have butted heads to the extreme. My mother never was good at discipline so I got away with being really nasty to her for years. My sister is loud, stubborn, acts like a 3 year old, and ALWAYS has to be right. She lashes out at you if you ask her to turn the volume down or put on headphones, talks in gibberish, and cries at the drop of a hat. So she is an incredibly frustrating person to be around. I am now starting to realize how bad I am treating her when I am off my meds. Whenever I visit, there is always something we argue about. It's been happening less often over time but it's still World War 3 when it does happen. My sister cannot learn from what people tell her. She doesn't pay attention, and her cerebral palsy makes it really hard for her to understand her own emotions and control them. So no matter what I say, she doesn't stop talking about something we fought over and jabs at me over and over again. I used to hit her, and I have not done that in a while. It makes me sick that I did that. I don't know what to do to show her I'm sorry.  I am forced to interact with her because my mother is having legal obstacles and logistical stuff, etc preventing her from getting my sister into a group home. My dad suggested a group home almost 10 years ago, but my mom refused for some reason, and now we're all suffering for it. I hate going to my mother's house now but I love my mom, so I have no choice. I live an incredibly lonely life on my own because my friends all moved away and because of the pandemic. I just hate my sister and simultaneously hate that nearly every time I visit, I forget my meds and then treat her like shit. She doesn't deserve that.  I don't want to have to cut off my mom just because she can't get my sister into a group home. And I am trying to take my meds, but with my reduced course load at college and lack of structure, I forget to take it. I don't want to be an abusive POS like my grandad.	1643148381.0	scp8dw	/r/offmychest/comments/scp8dw/i_hate_how_i_treat_my_sister/	I hate how I treat my sister
j0r9q9ri	I really hoped to never have to admit this to myself again after losing pretty much everything due to this addiction. As of Friday I've been slipping every other day and back into the old patterns of feeling like I need it to do anything whatsoever. As soon as I saw my parents' prescriptions out that Friday night (both abusing it as well, although they won't admit it) it was like my body betrayed my mind and stole from them to make my insomnia go away and stay up all night. The guilt is overwhelming after all they have forgiven me for and paid for my current mental health treatment, which has gone backward. The mild euphoria Ive chased leaves a path of destruction in its wake, my eyes are open to all of the damage its done/doing but I just don't know how much more fighting I can truly stand against this thing anymore. Any words of encouragement or advice are appreciated, and yes I know I did this to myself so no need to point that out.

die5g0lg	My parents have been married for 18 years. Ever since the start, my grandma has treated my mom terribly and treated her other daughter in laws (dad‚Äôs brothers wives) like they are goddesses or something. The other daughter in laws (K and D) are horrible people. D is a gold digger and K cheated on my uncle. (Grandma‚Äôs son) but my grandma still loves K and D. K was treated bad at the beginning and started to become good friends with my mom. But then D ruined everything and K has been evil just like D ever since. K almost ruined my parents marriage and i hate her with a passion for that. D separated from my uncle 8 years ago and no one talks about her anymore. That‚Äôs good because she was truly evil, worse than anyone else.   It makes me furious that my grandma treats my mom badly when my mom does EVERYTHING for her. Pays for her stuff, books her appointments, took her to get vaccinated, and so much more. My mom has been nothing but nice to her and my grandma still praises K when K does NOTHING for her at all. Now that K and D have daughters, my grandma showers their daughters with love. She loves them wayyyyyyy more than she loves me and my older brother. It doesn‚Äôt even feel right to call them my cousins because they aren‚Äôt any different from their moms. Their moms tell them to exclude me all the time. One of my cousins was telling me how her and the rest of them were hanging out at my grandmas house. I was obviously hurt because i wasn‚Äôt invited. I remember crying and hugging my brother a few times because I didn‚Äôt understand why my own grandma didn‚Äôt love me as much as she loved her other granddaughters. She has never tried to be apart of my life, or my brother‚Äôs. Now that we live in the same city she comes over to our house a little bit but only to ask for favours.   My dad knows about the stuff she has done and it hurts him a lot. He‚Äôs talked to her about it but she still hasn‚Äôt changed. My mom and i both want nothing to do with her but i feel like i can‚Äôt cut her out that easily because she‚Äôs my dads mom. I don‚Äôt want her at my house anymore, i don‚Äôt want to talk to her anymore, i don‚Äôt want to see her face anymore but I feel like i‚Äôm not allowed to choose for myself.	1643148662.0	scpbwc	/r/offmychest/comments/scpbwc/its_not_fair/	It‚Äôs not fair.
3hkjc1id	It would be such a perfect little ending to my life. It makes me really really excited to think about it. I could get through this last week and then never have to deal with anything ever again! It‚Äôs so wonderful to think about and I don‚Äôt care about the consequences on my family. I don‚Äôt care what any other day brings. It‚Äôs such an exhilarating feeling to think that I can finally kill myself! It‚Äôll be so amazing! No more pain! No more hurting anyone! No more whining about my problems! R.I.P. me, November 20, 2003-January 29, 2022. End of a worthless life. Such a great prospect.  But then I remember my girlfriend. I promised her I‚Äôd live. And I feel so fucking ashamed. I hate that she has to deal with such a broken person. Part of me thinks I should just do it to rip off a bandaid instead of staying and prolonging the pain that she has to deal with. She‚Äôs the only person who would truly suffer when I die.

hyc2domi	TRIGGER WARNING TO FELLOW SUFFERERS.   Around 4 weeks ago I developed a self-harming tic where I started hitting myself in the eyes repeatedly. I've had two surgeries, one for each eye and was told that I would've lost my eyesight eventually, had I not gone to the ophthalmologist at an eye clinic. I was at risk of retinal detatchments in both eyes after sustaining rifts.   My eyes are still recovering and my surroundings are still blurry to me.   I'm worried I'll lose control and hit myself again. I'm currently wearing plastic shields over my eyes, such that are used post-surgery, in order to avoid more blunt trauma.   I've had many years of damaging and hazardous  compulsions (I have OCD as well) and tics and they have completely overwhelmed me. Life was hard as it was, but now I feel I'm on my last leg. This one feels like it's going to be the end of me. One notion that has appeared in my mind recently is, how am I even going to commit suicide if I go blind? I'm not prepared for that outcome.   One of the only things that brings me any comfort is the fact that I'll die someday.   I'm not a religious person, but I could use some prayers.	1643149338.0	scpkt4	/r/offmychest/comments/scpkt4/i_was_at_risk_of_going_blind_due_to_my_tourette/	I was at risk of going blind due to my Tourette Syndrome and in a sense, I still am.
h93rvt7a	Okay now there are a lot of reasons why I fucking hate myself and started self sabotaging a while back. I'ma a trauma survivor, my mother used to violently beat me till I almost passed out, I have scars all over my body and my left hand is handicapped. Can't use or feel my hand, probably because she threw the bathroom mirror at me and cut my wrist which caused nerve damage and a fuck ton of bleeding. 'was bullied in 4th grade and it continued till 10th but then we moved out to a different place due to crimes and riots happening in our area. I've witnessed murder in front of my eyes so I've seen pretty fucked up shit like fkin blood puddles. I've received backlash and hate because of my religion too but at that time I remember being called a "terrorist" or "Jihadi" and basic shit like "go back to your country ***" but I was just a silent kid who tried to spread love.    My mother has attempted suicide a couple of times, my brother was killed by "Mob-Lynching" while he was donating food to poor. My father was abusive but we reported his ass to cops and he's gone for that. No friends really.. but I had one best friend but he ended up fucking my relationship because of jealousy. I remember him saying stuff like "I want to feel like you" and "I should've been the one to do- blah blah". When I turned 18, I was eligible for full body diagnose and other medical checkups that I took and I found out I have a cardiac disease from birth which causes it to not function properly and basically all the blood related stuff. That explained my pain in chest as well as strokes. Kidneys were shutting down too. I still have some mental illnesses like depression and severe anxiety.   Currently I'm trying to change myself but I can't. Whenever I see myself I wanna fuck that face up. These are permanent scars and gives me nightmares everytime I try to sleep. Sorry for venting a little and I hope none of you end up like I did, fucking my health up everyday both mentally and physically.	1643149504.0	scpmyt	/r/offmychest/comments/scpmyt/i_hate_myself_and_what_ive_become/	I hate myself and what I've become.

But before you read on Ive done some pretty messed up stuff in my life time what I cannot get past and the guilt lives on but after years of punishing myself and wanting others to punish me lives on, it‚Äôs been a on going thing since watching punishment videos on YouTube like nearly 10 years ago it‚Äôs a loop you cannot break that fast as well I want to stop you do not know how hard it is not to punish my self every day for mistakes that don‚Äôt need punishment but it‚Äôs to late now because it‚Äôs been so long and I HATE IT I really stupidly hate it, I really don‚Äôt want to feel this way at all but here I am suffering stupid mistakes I made that I deserve. But here‚Äôs the list of what I do to punish myself,  and I‚Äôm trying my best to get better but trust me it‚Äôs very very very very very hard   1.  I force myself to write 100+ Lines for hurting others. 2. I bite, cut, burn, pinch my self 3. I put hand sanitiser on the cuts to make it burn more/getting into a shower when it‚Äôs on the hottest setting and just standing in the heat.  4. i force myself to eat to much even if I can‚Äôt do it, or I eat to little. 5. I drink little water/fluids  6. I ask for others to punish me 7. I beat myself up all the time. Mentally  8. I pick my skin until it bleeds then put sanitiser on the picked skin. 9. I physically want to be kidnapped and forced to confess all my actions and past actions and then the punisher torture me for hours months years now ever long they think I need punishment for all my actions, I want them to make me suffer consequences for my actions, im talking about beating me up until I can‚Äôt take it, burning me, cutting me, screaming at me, electric shocks, the whole lot, and then I would feel pain.  10. Leave untreated cuts to hurt  11. trying to get into trouble from others so that I can be punished  12. there is prolly more things I do but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs self harm or not	1643149515.0	scpn4c	/r/offmychest/comments/scpn4c/self_torturepunishment/	Self torture/punishment
6mfyuoxk	I have always had trouble making friends and finding like-minded people. A few months ago, I befriended another woman online in one of my writing groups. She was extremely supportive of my work and we had some great, long conversations. I began following her blog and gradually realized that she was a vocal proponent of a particular form of bigotry, which is something that disturbed me greatly.  I knew it would be possible for me to just ignore it, pretend I hadn't seen it, avoid bringing it up, and continue to enjoy my friendship with this person and her support for my work. But I also knew that would be cowardly, a betrayal of my personal values and moral integrity, and a tacit betrayal of my friends and loved ones who belong to the group she advocates for bigotry against.  So I decided I had to say something. I took careful steps to engage her in good faith dialogue, listen to what she had to say, and refrain from aggression. We wrote several long messages (over 15,000 words total) back and forth. After a while, it became apparent to me that I was not going to change her mind, and the conversation was taking a huge emotional toll on me.   I called my brother, who often provides me with reality checks when I get too in my head about things. I talked to him about it, showed him bits of the conversation, and he told me that she was toxic, acting in bad faith, and I should not continue the conversation because it would not do anything but suck me dry and cause me pain. To drive his point home, he hit me with some quotes from Sartre, a favorite of mine, discussing the importance of not engaging others in good faith when they are determined to engage in bad faith.   I have always tried really hard to give people the benefit of the doubt and believe that they are coming from a place of good intentions, even when the results are bad. Even though the things my friend was saying were things I found deeply upsetting, even bordering on virulent, I am struggling to let go of the idea that she really believes that she is doing the right thing, and that we can find common ground because we both want what is best. My brother says its a tactic people like this use to make people like me doubt ourselves. Maybe he's right. I don't know what to feel.  All I know is that, whether or not she is truly acting in good faith, it has become apparent to me that I am not going to change her mind, and our differences are probably not reconcilable. So now I am just so sad that it seems I will not be able to continue with this friendship. It's not that I am unable to be friends with people I disagree with; it's that this particular disagreement is so at odds with my values, it makes me sick. It makes me sick to know one of my friends advocates things that would be so harmful to other people I know. But I still don't want to let the friendship go because I am a sad, lonely girl who can't stop fawning over people who have been nice to me. I second-guess everything. And, yes, this has opened me up to abuse in the past.  I also feel terrible about myself because I stopped being able to respond to her arguments after a while. I became depressed and overwhelmed, and now I am looking at all these claims I have left undisputed, and it's all too much for me to wade through. But I worry that if I don't come up with a rebuttal for every single one (not necessarily for her benefit, but for my own), then I am not doing due diligence to my own position. That I am continuing to subscribe to a position I cannot thoroughly defend simply because I find the alternative repulsive. Which to me, as someone with a background in academic philosophy, is a hard pill to swallow. My brother says that this is a common tactic of bigots who cloak their bigotry in intellectualism. And he's right. But that doesn't make it bother me any less that I don't have all the answers.	1643149624.0	scpoj3	/r/offmychest/comments/scpoj3/my_new_friend_is_a_bigot_i_tried_to_do_the_right/	My new friend is a bigot.

5xhure62	I have a serious problem. Not really sure who to tell, but I need some advice. I am very attracted to my mother in law. Two things. This is not going to be a sex story, it isn't some fantasy, it is an true issue. I will preface by saying that I love my wife, she is gorgeous, sexy, and amazing. I would never do anything to hurt her. That includes ever trying to act on something. I am too faithful for that. That being said, this attraction is bad because I don't know how to deal with it. Strangely enough, my wife unknowingly enables it. My MIL is only 11 years older than me, she had my wife young. I have always had a thing for older women too. Kind of dated one a year before I met my wife. We never were official and never did anything together but we called each other wifey and hubby. Anyway, her mom had a tummy tuck and boob job after her last child, it gives her literally my perfect body type and she is stunning. I would say that she could easily create an only fans where she doesn't even get naked and make millions just from posting selfies. Don't get me wrong, my wife is stunning too and turns me on just as easily. However, her mom just has exactly what my primal brain desires. I think my wife is prettier in the face though, but that doesn't diminish her moms looks though. She and my wife are also extremely close. They tell each other everything, literally everything. My wife often talks in detail about our sex life and the things I do with her. To top it off her mom has gotten extremely comfortable around me over the last 10 years of my marriage to her daughter. She does things in front of me she would never do in front of ex husbands, like farting, LOL. Another bad thing about all this is that I think she knows I find her attractive. Lately she does these things, just movements and actions, in my presence and I see her out of the corner of my eye glancing at me. Sometimes when she and my wife are together and we are all hanging out, the two of them will start dancing, playing around, doing twerks, and other things in front of me. Her mom will constantly look over at me smiling like she is looking for my reactions. I try my best to just smile and show I am dancing and singing along too. I have had discussions with my wife, she knows I find her mom pretty, I have directly told her so. My wife just doesn't know the extent of how much I do.       Previously I mentioned my wife sometimes unknowingly enables it. I will give an example. Her mom came over wearing those "tick tock" pants, the ones that form to every crevice leaving little to imagination? yeah those. I was in the bathroom, naked ON THE TOILET ffs, and her mom came to our bedroom and stood there casually talking to my wife. They left and I joined them a little bit later in the sitting room. I was sitting there and my wife exclaims, "BABE!" My wife tells me that I need to see her moms butt in these pants. Nervously I said," You want me to look at your moms butt?" She laughs and says "Shut up, you know you find my mom hot". Her mom stands up, without hesitation, and shows me her butt in these pants.... I literally cannot put into words what this did to me. Then my wife and her start comparing bellies and talking about how my wife has a flap and her mom doesn't. Her mom casually pulls her pants down a little and shirt up showing her underwear a little and mid drift. Again grinning at me like she is looking for a reaction. I don't know what my face looked like by the time she left, but it was probably a mix of shock and hunger. On the plus side, it made me want to go do something with my wife immediately. When I told my wife this an hour later I wanted her, she says "You are just turned on because of my mom, hahaaha". I don't know who I was kidding telling her "no I didn't, I just wanted you!" My wife just laughed and we went on with our day. (we had kids so we couldn't do anything anyway).      All of this is what I need advice about. I mean is the staring that her mom is doing just her checking to see if I am creeping on her and she is actually really uncomfortable? Does she just do the things she does around me with my wife because my wife pushes it and she doesn't know what else to do? More nervousness uncomfortable? My wife is very very jealous. If she has a problem with something, you will know it. She has no problem letting me know she is mad at me. I know that if this was all another woman other than her mom, she would be livid. However, she genuinely does not seem bothered by me finding her mom attractive. I find that fact even more weird. Now to make all this situation even more hard. Her mom wants to divorce her husband. She has been unhappy with him for a long time because he just treats her like a piece of arm candy, lies to her allot, and spends allot. She and my wife have this whole plan worked out that she moves in with us for a year, then we buy a big house together and live happily ever after. (my wife's words, not mine). I am completely fine with this, I know it will make my wife extremely happy and her mom will be happy too. However, for obvious reasons, I am worried about this. It is going to make my attraction even worse. Seriously what do I do? Am I just reading all these things wrong? Should I tell my wife the degree of my attraction to her mom and ask for her help to over come it and not enable it? Should I just suffer in silence and never say a word. Use the fuel to boost my wife and I's sex life?	1643149670.0	scpp6c	/r/offmychest/comments/scpp6c/my_mother_in_law/	My Mother in Law
dlka3yz2	Hey, Im 17F and my ex boyfriend broke up with me in june 2021. It was horrible, i could write a novel abt the pain i felt during the last months of the relationship and after, not doing that tho.  Basically, i was/am suicidal and depressed and he knew that, i called him multiple times during panic attacks and told him it directly. It was generally a bad time for my mental health last year.  Our relationship was ‚Äûonly‚Äú 7 months long, and the last 5 months were hell for me. He used to bomb me with love in the beginning, writing love letters, stories about us in the future with children and such. He called me almost everyday and we met as often as possible (kinda long distance relationship).  Well, it suddenly stopped after 2 months or so, he didn‚Äôt text me first anymore, no letters, no calls from his side, nothing. He was kinda sad when i was with him, or rather cold. He didn‚Äôt want to hug me, kiss me, touch me even during the day time - at night tho, we had sex often and long.  I asked him MILLIONS of times if he was okay, if i should do or not do anything. I asked him if he needed anything. Id have done anything for him.  He didn‚Äôt talk much, said he had just problems with finding himself, figuring out who he is and stuff.  That was the time when my mental health crashed. I called him during panic attacks, i only wanted him to love me a little. He was there, he just didn‚Äôt say anything. Stayed on the phone but ignored me. One time, he said my panic attacks looked like i was acting badly. That fucking shatters me till this day. I trusted him so much with letting him see me like this, it broke me. But i forgave him. I thought, he has problems himself (which was true, he definitely wasn‚Äôt doing good too not dennying that).  I stayed with him, asked him all the time why he was so distant, cold and mad at me. I know he was hurting too, but he should have told me something i was his gf.  I asked him 5 months every now and then whether he still loved me (we said i love you after two months relationship, yes call it childish) he said ‚Äûyeah ofc, why do you think i wouldn‚Äôt love you, don‚Äôt accuse me of that!‚Äú  In june, he told me he lost feelings.   Fastforward till now, an online friend 19F (who generally is just an online friend with my ex, i met her after the breakup on tik tok, so did he, she didn‚Äôt know us before) chatted with him on tik tok, he was heartbroken bc of a person he met in august 2021.  she talked abt her experiences with love and told him she still feels like a part of her is missing after the breakup with her ex two years ago and that she tries to distract herself with one night stands from tinder (that KNOW she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship, they are ons).  He responded that he knew what she mean, he did the same with his ex girlfriend and was relieved after he broke up with me bc it wasn‚Äôt what he needed.  She told me abt it cause she knew i was still not over him and thought it would help me change perspective abt him.  I want to cry me eyes out, i rlly thought he loved me and would make all the stories he wrote abt us come true.

Wonderful for us etc but I feel as though I have lost my brain. My daughter is now a wonderful 20 months and I still feel so stupid compared to how I used to be. I can't stay on top of the house. I'm no longer good at what I used to do and I lack the energy to do it consistently. It's like all the things I learned about how to adult have been erased. My memory is nowhere near as good too.   Doing things I need to do consistently require so much work mentally . I started a new job and am doing so badly and it's frustrating as I really want to do well. I have no idea what to do. I feel so stupid and useless. Being fairly intelligent was the only thing I prided myself on so I'm also having an existential crisis.  I have done short term counselling (NHS) during which my counsellor agreed I'm not depressed or anxious.

8wbsa0gg	I shit you not, this is not an isolated event, this type of thing has been happening during the entirety of my life.   I grew up with a very obese family. Early on I had an oh shit moment and lost the weight I had. My siblings almost overnight got this mentality of ‚Äúyou think you‚Äôre better than us?‚Äù For losing said weight and life became miserable.   Well, one of the reasons i decided to in the first place was because my family has a very strong history of type 2 diabetes. I told myself I would rather die than have diabetes because why tf would I want that right?   Anyway, I lost the weight, by HS I got into weightlifting. I was doing everything right, eating healthy, working out, living an active life etc.   Recently I‚Äôve been feeling weird. At first I was clueless but eventually that doubt started setting in. I went in for blood work thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going crazy, it‚Äôs impossible for me to have diabetes ‚Äú   Here‚Äôs the kicker, turns out I have type one diabetes. Yep. The 180, 13% body fat, lean, muscular build 22 year old guy who works out daily has diabetes but my siblings who couldn‚Äôt give a damn about their health, evident by being 350lbs do not.. they‚Äôre in perfect health.

j0rksccw	I'm in high school and my parents are going through a divorce (the cause being that my mom has not been happy in the relationship for years and she does not get along with my dad). They've asked me how I've felt on the subject, and I haven't wanted to upset them or worry them, so I've just been acting like I almost didn't care. I know they care about me, but recently, I have been learning a lot of things about them that I never knew before that they've hidden from me for a very long time. I know this sounds like it's going nowhere, but I promise I have a point. I'm really sorry, I just have a lot I need to get out.  My parents have been in a newer argument for the past two days or so and I wasn't sure what it was about. I kept hearing my dad snap about going to AT&T (which confused me, because even though AT&T is where we get our service from, I knew all our phones were working fine and had no issues whatsoever), and after a long while of thinking yesterday, I asked my dad why he was going. He said 'your mom accused me of something I didn't do' and 'it's personal'. He never usually keeps 'personal' stuff from me, so I immediately found it suspicious. I already knew that there was a lot more to the problems in my parents' relationship, so I figured it was a possibility that my dad had been keeping contact with another woman. I had come up with this conclusion multiple times before this and I'm still not sure if I'm wrong. I know he has a secret life he's hiding from me, and I've gone through his text threads on multiple occasions (with little results) to try and figure out the whole picture.  This morning, I asked my mom what my dad had meant and why there was such a fuss over his phone. She hadn't wanted to tell me because it wasn't exactly appropriate, but she tells me a lot of these things because she is honest with me and feels that I have a right to know. A few days ago, my mom had found that my dad's phone (keep in mind, he has an old flip phone) had a long record of data usage on it along with the bills that came with it. My mom was shocked because my dad had always said that his phone had 'no data or internet usage on it' and that his coworkers poked fun at him for it. She found this very odd and continued to look into it. Then, one night, she noticed that when he went to go shower, he took his phone off the charger and took it with him to the bathroom. She followed him a few minutes later and heard him making sexual noises through the door. Evidently, all the data usage records were from him watching porn on his flip phone. And that wasn't even the worst part. My dad had never admitted to it. Ever since I was a kid, my dad has always had a reputation of taking forever in the bathroom, and I always assumed that he had a stomach problem. Instead, he was pleasuring himself while watching sexual videos. The data records showed frequent data usage on his phone while he was at work, and it didn't take much for my mom to put two and two together. She knew he had watched porn years ago, but he had evidently sworn to her that it was just the one time and it would never happen again. She'd seen inappropriate websites pop up on the search bar of the home computer that my dad would use. He even brought his 'work computer' from his work (even though his line of work is not something you can do digitally). Learning all of this just made me feel like my life was turning into a horrible book. It's creepy as hell to think my dad would do something like this even though he says he loves my mom and would never stray. I hate thinking back on all the times I thought my dad was telling me the truth when he was lying. And even though watching porn while in a relationship (no matter what status) isn't considered cheating by most of society, it really fucking feels like it should.  After my mom told me all of this, she made me promise I wouldn't let my dad know she told me any of what happened (my dad has a terrible temper and will not hesitate to yell). I haven't been able to talk about this with anyone, and it feels horrible that I can't confide in people I know. There's no way in hell I could ever talk about this with my dad, and I'm scared that my parents' fights will get worse.  I'm really sorry for saying all of this. I just don't know what to do anymore what with my family problems on top of everything else in my life.	1643150225.0	scpws7	/r/offmychest/comments/scpws7/i_feel_like_i_dont_know_who_my_dad_is_anymore/	I feel like I don't know who my dad is anymore

j0s8poi7	I live a country where the average male height is 6‚Äô & the average female height is 5‚Äô7, I am a 28 year old man and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6.   Everything about being a short guy fucking sucks. When I was a teenager I was very confident, happy etc. Eventually everyone grew much much taller than me and I have had a crippling insecurity about it since.   The problem is the way my society treats me as a whole. I go for a promotion when I am objectively and measurably better than a taller colleague and the taller colleague gets it over me? Why? Because people don‚Äôt take me seriously.   Other Men think they can just bully me in random social situations. I am a strong guy for my size, I will be using a rack at the gym and they will start to take my weights (strangers) and when I ask why they will say ‚Äúyou are done‚Äù (happens all the time) then get shocked and surprised when I say ‚Äúno I am still using this‚Äù. Get angry like I should defer to them.   Anytime I‚Äôve assertive or stand up to myself people tell me to stop acting like a short man? Am I supposed to be a door mat?   People I don‚Äôt know will make fun of me for my height at pubs, clubs or events, try to start fights on me to impress girl.  I tried to become a teacher and the kids just laughed at me calling me ‚Äúoompa loompa‚Äù.  People act like I am not there . I always have to assert and then it makes feedback loop ‚Äúshort man‚Äù.  I have good job now but all colleagues joke my girlfriend is only with me because I stand on my wallet when I met her, it hurts because there is some truth.   What is the point? Every day is another microaaggression ? I don‚Äôt even want to reproduce I wouldn‚Äôt want a son to struggle and play this life on hard mode like me.   Cannot even talk about it, no one cares. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù. I would just like to be treated with respect I see others given each day around me that I don‚Äôt receive .

I‚Äôve wasted my entire 20s working, I never really put my wants & desires first.

For example, I‚Äôve always wanted to learn to DJ but I let the fear of others opinions cloud my vision and just don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôve done nothing but work full time since I was 20, stop taking classes at community college & now I feel like my future is set up at this dead end job not making enough money as I‚Äôd like.

4lf63ynl	When I was a child, I would get emotional about not having a father. Almost all my friends had 2 parents. Their dads would accompany them to father-daughter dances, Father‚Äôs Day lunch in elementary school, and I would just endure the pain I had. I didn‚Äôt understand why my father didn‚Äôt want me or my mom.   As a teenager, the sadness turned into anger. Why did he not want me? Why did he leave my mom upon finding out she was pregnant? Why wasn‚Äôt I allowed to have a dad my entire childhood, but other people were? I thought it was the world against me. I really just couldn‚Äôt understand and trying to just made me angry.  As an adult, I feel like I went through the 5 stages of grief about it and in the past few months I feel as though I‚Äôve grown profoundly.   I found out my biological father had a family when I was around 20. Wife, kid, established business in his town that was a few states away from me. I wanted to write him a letter and tell him all the pain he‚Äôs caused me. I never went to dances where there was a time allotted specifically for fathers dancing with daughters. My mom and I always skipped church on fathers day and would make it a day for just the two of us. She is an incredible woman and I‚Äôm very grateful I have her. She did everything to make my childhood as best as she could. And she‚Äôs amazing for that.   I eventually started writing letters to him. They were filled with rage, sadness and some were just mean. I never sent any of them though. I never wanted to.   About a year and a half ago, I looked up his Facebook page and saw he had 3 kids. All under 6. His newest was a baby girl barely able to open her eyes for a picture with the caption that ruined me. ‚ÄúI can finally participate in national daughters day.‚Äù   Finally? As if I haven‚Äôt existed for the past 25 years?   I cried when I saw it. I was pregnant with my second child and just crumbled to the floor bawling my eyes out. My 2.5 y/o (at the time) came and laid next to me, patting my back, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay mommy. Daddy, tell mommy it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù Obviously made me cry harder because my son didn‚Äôt understand, couldn‚Äôt understand, and he came to comfort me.   I tried letting go of all the anger, resentment, whatever emotions I was holding on to concerning my father.   3 weeks ago I wrote another letter. I told him I‚Äôd written many but whatever I had written wouldn‚Äôt have done anyone any good. I wouldn‚Äôt feel good about telling him what it was like without him and how hard it was for me. And that‚Äôs when I realized I had never considered it from his perspective.   He was 24-25, same age as me. Had a few night stand with a friend (I am the result of a blizzard) and she got pregnant. 24-25 is young to have children. I had my first at 21 and my second at 24. I now have a 4 year old and a 1 year old and it‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôve given up a lot of my youth to be a mother (which I don‚Äôt regret, I love being a mom) but it‚Äôs still a very hard decision for anyone.   I said all of this in the letter and told him I was happy he found a family when the time was right for him.  I didn‚Äôt tell my mom I sent it or my stepdad (who came in my life roughly 6 years ago and is great but not understanding).   I gave my biological father my email address and told him there was no pressure to write me.  Sealed it up, no return address, sent it to the church he works at.  Found out today they moved locations about a month ago and don‚Äôt know if the letter will be forwarded to him. But at least I tried.

64m7xup3	I work at Starbucks and honestly it's the best job in the world. You get paid $12+ an hour to make fuckin coffee and talk to interesting people. At least until the pandemic hit  I started working there in 2019 so I've worked all through the pandemic. At the time I got hired I was 16 so I was the baby. It wasn't my first job but my first "real" job I guess. Im pretty absent minded and shit but in the first 3 months they turned me into a hard working kind employee. Then corona hit and everything changed. Manager through in the fucking towel and has totally checked out and gives 0 fucks. I'm almost 19 now and I'm always helping her w coverage, scheduling, orders, mediation between employees and just general bullshit. IM STILL A BARISTA BTW NOT EVEN A SUPERVISOR. there are 4 supervisors and 3 of them are her friends. She always lets them call out of shifts or just come 2 hours late and leave an hour early etc. My car broke down and I couldn't get to work and she told me I had to make up the hours over the weekend. I work 5 days a week and this is the 3rd time she's asking me to work the weekend. (Real reason is bc her roommate broly, the supervisor...doesn't want to work bc hed rather stream)   My job isn't terrible but I deal with way more bullshit than I should. I have another job lined up the only thing holding me back is the pay and the benefits of Starbucks.

j0781vgm	We had been together for close to 1 and a half years (me 19M and her 19F) but have been friends forever, and our relationship was perfect, especially for the 1st year or so.  She broke up with me about a month and a half ago. Looking back I can see why. Our relationship was not as fun anymore, and actually was more like a friendship.  I do believe that there is more to it though. The last month before we broke up we were constantly together, she never had space for herself and was feeling pressured. She is an introvert after all, and needs time to recharge and time alone.  What she didn't know is that I had discovered something on me, that had an over 50% chance of being cancer. I didn't tell anyone and for the 4 weeks I waited to get checked by a doctor, I tried to be with her as much as possible, because when I was left alone, it was too much for me, knowing that I might have cancer.  I actually got checked and all went well. She broke up about a week after that, saying that she doesn't think we match, and I'm certain that always being together when she is introverted played a major role in her decision.  I never told her, or anyone about this, as she gets extremely nervous and would honestly lose her mind if she knew before I got checked.  I backed off for about a month and reinitiated contact with her. We're talking every few days (both of us are reaching out) and we met once and it was pretty fun. I honestly want us to get back together. I just don't know what I should do, or even if I should ever mention the above.  Also let me point out that we had more problems as well, as all couples, but I believe they were miniscule, and actually wroked on fixing everything, while I spent some time with my self.	1643151289.0	scqb9r	/r/offmychest/comments/scqb9r/we_broke_up_but_there_is_something_she_didnt_know/	We broke up but there is something she didn't know

h26djjwh	To preface my experience, I'm happily remarried. I was just thinking about what a messed up situation this was earlier today and felt like I needed to share. In addition, let me clarify that I'm pro-choice, and I don't have a problem with abortion in the vast majority of cases.  My ex-wife was 15 years older than me, and we married when I was 30 and she was 45. Due to our age difference, I had a stepson who was 27, (just 3 years younger than me) and a stepdaughter who was 18. My stepdaughter moved out of our home due to her mother and how terrible she acted at times. Apparently, she wasn't practicing safe sex, as the next thing we know -- she's pregnant.  My stepdaughter didn't want to abort the baby. She had an abortion previously before I had ever entered the picture and was having a hard time coming to terms with having another one. My ex-wife and I agreed to adopt the baby and raise it as our own. Due to my ex-wife's age, we weren't likely to conceive on our own, and she knew I'd always wanted a child of my own.  We went to the doctor, and I was so excited about the ultrasound. I've never experienced anything like it, and my thoughts were flooding with potential baby names, and I had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face. Once my stepdaughter knew how far along she was and started doing the math, she realized that the father was black. As soon as my ex-wife knew this, she demanded that my stepdaughter abort the baby, and she complied.  I'm in a much better situation now, and maybe it was for the best seeing as how our relationship crumbled soon after. It's just shocking to me that someone could be so evil as to have an abortion for THAT reason. I would have loved that child if they came out purple and green. I wish I would have had the courage and confronted her about it then, instead of divorcing her a few years later.	1643151591.0	scqfa7	/r/offmychest/comments/scqfa7/my_exwife_convinced_my_stepdaughter_to_abort_her/	My ex-wife convinced my stepdaughter to abort her biracial baby.

58wtwg83	This is the third time since I was 16 this has happened to me and I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm 24, and I‚Äôm from the Bronx so tbh I didn‚Äôt think being in Long Island would be a problem. But I was waiting for my boyfriend to get off work and was actually on the phone with my therapist outside of the train station. Some dude approached me and was trying to talk to me and I just walked away. He kept calling after me and I ignored it.   I went into the waiting room and continued talking to my therapist. There were four other people in there. The dude followed me in there and started harassing me. He kept walking closer to me and I kept moving away from him. He made fun of me for standing near other people to protect myself and said he knows how that goes and he would take me down‚Ä¶He left and I thought I was safe then he came back.   He then went on to make fun of me for standing by the bathroom and said some racist shit of, ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôre standing by the bathroom that‚Äôs so disgusting. Not surprising for a black woman you‚Äôre so disgusting.‚Äù He‚Äôs white, I‚Äôm black. Never met or saw this man a day in my life. I literally said nothing to him btw. Just kept leaving. He told me he would keep following me wherever I went.   My therapist was trying to talk me down lol and my boyfriend got off work early :/ I‚Äôm safe now with my boyfriend (who wanted to fight the dude but I held him back :/) but I‚Äôm pretty shaken up.

iud9r4dv	Hi guys. Sorry to get all annoying and dramatic, just thought it‚Äôd be useful to- ha- get this off my chest.   I don‚Äôt see the point in anything at all anymore. A lot of the time I feel really numb and then all of my emotions (mostly sadness or anger lol) are too strong for me to handle them. I know that the people around me love me but I don‚Äôt believe them when they say it.   I just feel worthless. Nothing I do is ever going to fix the problems I cause by just existing. Life would be easier for everyone around me if I died. I‚Äôm either too cowardly or too selfish for that. Whenever people talk about me positively it‚Äôs just because they think I‚Äôm smart. I‚Äôm not even actually smart I just get good grades. I just wish someone would say something else.   I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so broken. I‚Äôve tried asking for help so many times but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of being fixed. There‚Äôs just something wrong with me and I don‚Äôt know what it is. I just upset everyone around me by being emotional and stupid. I cant even stay happy for everyone.   If I‚Äôm unfixable though‚Ä¶ is there a point in any of this? Would it be better to stop everything now? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd like to think that one day I will be really, truly happy.

cwb646hl	I‚Äôm a guy, currently 22 years old and for the majority of my life I have been the weird kid, in early elementary I was the class clown and high school years awkward as hell, also dressed weird and had a really (like really) bad haircut.  After high school I started losing weight, hit the gym, dressed way better. Turns out under all that excess fat I had a really good facial structure, great jawline, blue eyes, really thick hair (my hairstyle similar to shawn mendes). I‚Äôm still a bit introverted but my extrovert side is pushing through and I first realized maybe 2 years ago when I was at a party and my friend‚Äôs sister started hitting on me. She‚Äôs gorgeous like even a hotter margot robbie. I noticed girls checking me out more and more but unfortunately my social skills still sucked.  There are a few negative downsides to this, for example other dudes will throw shade at you or try to belittle you, it‚Äôs really common and in the moment it actually hurts to have some people you wanna get to know be mean because of my looks. Also my life long best friend has also started doing this to an extent.   He was always taking care of me through social gatherings and obviously I did what I could to return the favor, now his looks are declining (losing hair also) and he has become different, always trying to ‚Äùone-up‚Äù me in topics, he‚Äôs more educated than me and uses this as leverage I guess you could say. It really sucks, didn‚Äôt think my best friend would see me as competition, he never did in my awkward phase.   Anyway that is all I had to say, feel free to ask anything. And yeah sorry if I come across as a bragger, this is the first time I can express how blessed I feel about my looks (although it‚Äôs also hard work) in contrast to have always hated my looks, it has really changed my entire life.	1643152565.0	scqs8a	/r/offmychest/comments/scqs8a/im_way_more_attractive_than_i_ever_thought_and_i/	I‚Äôm way more attractive than I ever thought and I love it.

I can't do anything and I feel absolutely useless.

Deadlines are never met, I'm apologising profusely and telling myself I'd do the work when I get home, but I never do. It's infuriating and I hate myself and I just want it to stop.

cccwkfpk	Ok√© this is a long story excuse me for my bad English. I first want to give you some background first you have Robert(24M). Robert had a hard youth. He was for a long time in the crime world addicted to drugs alcohol etc. luckily he got clean from it and found the lord, he is an Christian now. He also had a history of a lot of women and a lot of them have cheated on him. So now he has this rule, he believes men and women can‚Äôt be friends since there is always something more. One of the other prime reasons he has this rule is James(21M) . He used James as example for a guy who always wants something more from a girl. Basically every girl who meets James he fucks. He has a lot of male friends but none female friends since he slept with each of them. James is a really charming guy, good social skills and easy going with girls. He always has that easy connection with girls. James had cheated one time in his life when he was sixteen years old on his ex-girlfriend. James told her that he cheated and they broke up. Ever since nobody of his friends trust James alone with there girlfriends. In October James and his other girlfriend broke up, they had a relationship for 1,5 year. Ever since he really tries to be a better person and I really see an attitude change in him. One example was he dumped his toxic friends which I was really proud of.   Now you have Mary(21F). Mary is an Christian girl and she wants to wait for marriage. She hasn‚Äôt had sex with her boyfriend Robert. Mary and Robert have a relationship. Robert has been very clear from the start that he doesn‚Äôt want his girlfriend to have male friends. He has asked her about this before they got a relationship, when they got this relationship she agreed on it. While I do not agree with Roberts rule I do respect it that he is always honest, not a hypocrite about this rule and never judge other people when they do have male-female friends. Right now they have a relationship for one year and this rule is still in act. Right now Robert is going trough a burnout from school.   A month ago James came to me(21M) to tell me a story. During the holidays he was very lonely he recently discovered that his ex-girlfriend had two boyfriends. (they don‚Äôt know about each other). So he was a little down and lonely. So he was invited to Robert and Mary house to talk in the night. After a while around 10 o‚Äôclock Robert had to leave, it was a work emergency. Before he left he told James and Mary that they could stay but do nothing crazy I trust you guys(it was probably the usual talk about men and women can‚Äôt be friend and I trust you guys). So James and Mary stayed together. They both got extremely drunk, James didn‚Äôt had that much alcohol in a long time. Mary kept giving James more. I don‚Äôt think Mary did that in a weird way she is just a caring person who wants her guest to be happy and she probably didn‚Äôt realize how much she gave him. They stayed the entire night until the next morning. James told me he had the most intimate night in his life. The where telling everything to each other, every hard moment in there life which is in James case is a lot. Mary was also going through a hard time since Robert was going trough a burnout and it was draining on her relationship. She also told James that she wasn‚Äôt always happy with the rule of men and women not being friends. But they were extremely drunk and they were hugging on the couch and holding hands with each other the entire night. At one point they where looking at each other just they way you look at each other before a kiss. Mary asked James are you going to kiss me. Which luckily James refused he realized at that moment if he does that it is done. I am not sure if Mary asked that exactly that way. But she is a traditional girl so she probably believes they guy should make the first move. If James had kissed her she would have probably have kissed him back.   But I was proud of him, at that point James realized he was wrong and didn‚Äôt kiss her. During there goodbye they had a long hug he told me. In the morning Robert came home and realize how much alcohol they had. He only knows that they had drunk a lot and that they stayed together until the next morning but he doesn‚Äôt know more happened. He wasn‚Äôt angry at all that they stayed so long together, he was happy that his girlfriend and friend where getting along with each other. But he doesn‚Äôt know more happened. After that both Mary and James realized they did something wrong that night. James came to me and told me everything he also told me he would go talk with Mary latter that day. We had a long talk and we both came to the conclusion that it was the right thing to do to tell Robert it. He deserves to know if his girlfriend cheated on him. I also know that Robert probably will ask Mary to marry her somewhere this year, so I know Robert believes Mary to be his future wife . We both believe it was a mistake and James doesn‚Äôt have feelings for Marry It was a onetime thing which I agree. After that talk with me I was proud that James was trying to fix his mistake and I was convinced he would tell Robert. But then he went to talk with Mary. He told me they had a good talk but he decided not to tell Robert. Mary doesn‚Äôt want to tell her since she is afraid they would break up together. James standpoint is now: some things you may have to say but not be heard. He also believes that it should be Mary to tell what happened to Robert not him since he doesn‚Äôt want to come between a relationship. I do believe it should be Mary to tell Robert but if she refused. I believe James should be honest to Mary and tell her that he is going to tell Robert or she is going to tell her either way he should know.   Right now I don‚Äôt know how to feel. Mary doesn‚Äôt know that I know. I still believe it is Robert choice to decide what should happen in the relationship and that is why he should know. Right now I am a little angry at Mary since I believe she is at fault for doing it that night, James is also wrong he knows that to. Also for not communicating good with Robert about how she feels and convincing James to not tell Robert.  Robert is also my friend and I believe he deserves to know so he can decide his own future. But I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I tell Robert? Try to push James to tell it? Or just leave it be since it might not be cheating.	1643153013.0	scqy91	/r/offmychest/comments/scqy91/a_friend_of_mine_cheated_and_i_dont_know_how_to/	A friend of mine cheated and I don't know how to feel.
1bu0khp5	 I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm venting or something. This is what I want to say but I don‚Äôt think I ever will.   It‚Äôs been two months since we broke up I can‚Äôt get my mind off you and I know you don‚Äôt give a shit about and probably never did. I never told you how I really felt in the end and I just tried to keep the peace cause that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever done, I‚Äôve never really spoken my mind and it sucks. So here‚Äôs what I really wanted to say back in December.  It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúall good‚Äù like I said in the end. You basically ignored me for the last two months and when it came to finally seeing each other you just cancelled cause it was the easiest option. That was my last straw your birthday. I dropped your present off a week later and that was that. The amount of anxiety betweeen the end of September and start of November I experienced was insane. Constantly thinking why is she ignoring me for days on end? Did I say something? Did I not do enough? It wasn‚Äôt healthy. That‚Äôs why I stopped trying.   I feel like you never actually wanted a relationship, you saw your friends getting married, all have boyfriends and you‚Äôre single and alone and thought fuck it I‚Äôll try that. But your heart wasn‚Äôt in it when mine was. I never asked you for anything, I always tried to be respectful, kind and patient all why being myself and genuine. You used that from the start til the end leading me on to believe something good was happening and to just push me away when you were done. And in the end I wasn‚Äôt even worth a phone call to try and explain it but doing things by text is easier I guess. That‚Äôs cowardly and tells me more about you than anything really.  And I would usually say sorry for this being over the top and everything but I‚Äôm not, this is something that‚Äôs been bottled up for months on end.	1643153043.0	scqymd	/r/offmychest/comments/scqymd/the_message_i_want_to_send_but_never_will/	The message I want to send but never will

As of lately, it‚Äôs not that that annoys me as much but the fact that she gets upset about the minimal things (ex, her and her bfs anniversary was a few days ago and his parents didn‚Äôt honor their agreement abt lending him the car so they didn‚Äôt see eachother, and she was upset at that). I ofc never expressed how annoying this has become and always listen but it‚Äôs gotten to the point I tell her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to tell you‚Äù in order to just end it there bc if it keeps going i will tell her it‚Äôs annoying. I don‚Äôt want to do that bc i know how it feels to not be listened or someone trying to understand you.  I don‚Äôt know how to better my feelings at this point bc i also am going thru so many stress rn (narc mom acting up, uni classes, work, etc).	1643153233.0	scr140	/r/offmychest/comments/scr140/i_feel_im_becoming_a_bad_friend/	I feel I‚Äôm becoming a bad friend
3o15y02g	I recently lost 2 of my best friends because of the action of one of them, and it sucks. I think about it almost every day, I act like I'm over it and don't give a shit anymore but the truth is it still annoys the shit out of me. It makes me mad that one of my closest friends fucked up so badly that I lost my friendship with her and her husband. Not to mention their kids that I loved, and even their family who I'd gotten to know over 10-15 years of our friendship. I lost them all because of the wife.  Long story made kinda short: These 2 friends are a couple. We became close friends long before they even got married. We've traveled together, partied together countless times, opened up and been vulnerable with each other many times, been there for each other, and planned our future as friends together too. It all came crashing down after a trip I(30's, male) went on that the wife was at but not her husband. One drunken night she came on to me, heavily. I talked her down and resisted, despite being very drunk myself. She persisted, coming to my AirBnB room 3 times in a row, trying to break me down and almost succeeding. She said some heavy shit to me; like that she's always loved me as more than a friend, that she thinks she'd be a better partner for me than my gf and that she thinks I love her more than her husband does. I had to keep insisting she was just drunk and saying dumb shit.   She tried to gaslight me into thinking that i've always known and feel the same way. I do not, and have never. On the physical end; never been attracted to her at all. She's just simply the opposite of my type in every way. She's tall, skinny, no curves, A cup, short red curly hair. I truly mean no offense at all to anyone like her, it's just not my attraction. She's pretty, of course, and I recognize that. But again i've never felt any inkling of lust for her. And on top of all that, I simply never entertained the thought of fucking up our friendship by trying to make anything happen anyways. I valued my friendship with them too much, and my relationship too of course. She'd made comments numerous times in the past about how she's not my type and I must think she's chopped liver, and I'd always deflect and be like "oh shut up, you know you're beautiful, dont be like that, stop" etc. I always assumed it came from some insecurities.   Anyways, luckily we never crossed any serious physical line. No privates were touched or exposed, no over the pants bullshit, none of that. We did get close, I'll admit, but thank god the 3rd time she left my room I locked the door finally and stopped it.   I'm trying to keep this short but I'm also venting cuz I don't get to vent often about this to anyone new. Basically... we agreed to never speak of it, and i chalked it up to her being extremely drunk and emotionally vulnerable (they have other stuff going on in their lives I won't divulge). Fast forward some weeks, and she drops a bomb on me over the phone: she told her husband "everything" and obviously he's shook. I was totally caught off guard. I was debating telling my gf anyways, because I didn't like keeping anything from her, but figured it needed to be timed right. I didn't expect her to just decide to blow up our friendship without any warning first, thus forcing my hand sooner than expected.   She made it sound like not THAT big of deal, too. She said our friendship just needed a break and that her and her husband were going to work on their relationship. She made no offer to have me talk to Kevin, or for her to talk to my gf and apologize for totally betraying her trust(Megan was literally the one who assured my gf that she had nothing to worry about on that trip before). So, I told my gf everything. She was pissed of course, but also understanding. Later that day I call Megan to tell her that everything is clear now, my gf knows too. She FLIPS out. She asked what all I told my gf, and loses her mind. Insists that im making it seem like she was the instigator and that its all her fault(it was literally 95% her fault). I tried to explain to her my perspective and remind her of how things went down(i remembered more than her apparently) but she insists im gaslighting her(ironic). She basically blows up and says this is the end of our friendship, that we cant come back from this, that she's so shocked and hurt by what i told my gf and how it makes her look, not fair, etc.   We hang up, and she instantly blocks me and my gf on everything. Within hours I'm also blocked on everything by her husband and even her sister(very weird, she's not involved whatsoever to my knowledge, havent even seen her in years). After some talks with my gf and even my mom(who knows Megan well, they worked together, thats how we met a long time ago), and we all agreed that her overreaction is very telling.   Our theory is: she didnt tell her husband everything. She probably sugar coated it, told him the bare minimum, probably even made it seem like I instigated it to save face. So when she discovered that my gf knew it all, and knew different things than Kevin does, she realized she was fucked. She wouldnt be able to juggle our partners knowing 2 different stories the rest of our lives. The truth would eventually reach Kevin and she'd be totally screwed. So she did what she had to do, to protect her marriage; cut me out and severed all lines of communication to keep Kevin from the truth. She doesnt work, Kevin does. She can't lose him, not to mention they have 2 little girls.  Anyways, I'm still mad. I loved them both. I loved their kids. I was the "funcle" as they called me. Me and Kevin would nerd out over sci-fi books and movies and videogames. We shared memes with each other daily. All of that is gone. Such a fucking waste. Fuck you, Megan.  PS: further confirmation of my suspicion that Kevin doesn't know the full truth: I emailed him a long message, apologizing for my role in this and explaining to him that if he ever wants to hear my side of things I'd love to talk. I told him I'd miss him and said he could keep the videogames I lent him last we saw each other. One day, weeks later, I get an email from Kevin saying "Hey man, can you resend whatever you sent me before? Megan said she went in and deleted it before I saw it." How fucking shady is that? I resent it, and never got a reply from Kevin, but thats fine. I totally understand. Whatever she'd told him, I guess I'd not be ready to talk to me either.	1643153367.0	scr2ub	/r/offmychest/comments/scr2ub/fuck_you_megan_i_miss_your_husband_and_kids_but/	Fuck you, Megan.

Today I was supposed to have an online exam. I had everything prepared, triple checked my enrollment. I didn't get the login email. Getting in touch with them they informed me that I wasn't on the list. I dug up the confirmation email that I was, and had the program in which my enrollments are shown in front of me. They  said they were terribly sorry but couldn't help me.   The first two gave me severe panic attacks. The last one just left me agitated. I don't know how to handle it happening thrice.

iyjro6v	   Ever  since my mom met this asshole, living at home has been absolute hell.  He's fucking miserable all the time. He complains about doing the  chores, complains about my brothers makes noises even though it's 5pm in  the afternoon. He complains about having back pain and his so high blood  pressure but has no problem driving an hour away from home to go fucking  dine out.  Tonight, he really  pissed me off. He's in the kitchen on the phone with his buddy. The  reason is because he has a blood pressure machine and needs help to  figure out how to operate. He calls my mom who's sleeping and after a  while, he stops. Tells his friend, "She's terrible, never pays  attention." I swear I wanted to lose my cool and yell at him. There has  been a lot of arguments and even cop involve in the past that it was  best to just keep it to myself. I so want to leave the house and live on  my own but I have little brothers and I want to help my mother after  getting my degree.

48g5vocc	I've been friends with a person for more than a year but recently we have been talking a lot. Just now had a little argument about me being inconsiderate to them where they told me how much they care about me and all that. Now, I would love a friend who says stuff like this but this is just weird. I feel like cutting them off. I just feel repelled I dont know why. Mine and their mental frequencies do not match at all, I just dont want to talk to them. Its jusy very weird that they're all emotional about this and that they admittedly "cried" after the argument but I just dont care. Its just so weird. Ive never felt this way before. I just dont want to talk to them and I always have a very bad feeling (boredom + depression) whenever I talk to them. I cannot explain the feeling properly but yeah. Can anyone relate to this? Or something remotely close?	1643154069.0	scrbwa	/r/offmychest/comments/scrbwa/wanting_to_cut_off_someone/	Wanting to cut off someone
7d4ijfj	I‚Äôve given up on trying to find close friends as an adult. The only way I can get the intimacy I crave is by getting in a relationship. I‚Äôve been single for over 4 years and nobody ever shows interest in me. It‚Äôs so hard finding a decent man that I want to be around, never mind lose my virginity with. I‚Äôm not a particularly sexual person, so it‚Äôs not the celibacy that‚Äôs getting to me. I just want an intimate, monogamous relationship. And I suppose it would be nice to see what all the hype is about sex. But yeah, I‚Äôm just sick of being lonely and never coming first to anyone.	1643154070.0	scrbx7	/r/offmychest/comments/scrbx7/im_tired_of_being_single/	I‚Äôm tired of being single
a42m7uiy	I have fibroids.  I have had terrible periods for four years.  Debilitating pains, check.  Bleeding every day, check. Mirena coil inserted (horrendous pain), only to be told after two years when having a hysteroscopy that the thing wasn't working and was adding to my bleeding, check.  Now waiting for surgery which will happen who knows when for the fibroid to be removed.  In the meantime, at the moment when I have a period, I get two days where I have to wear a tampon, a pad and two pairs of underwear as I bleed through every two hours.  I have HAD IT.  Sorry.  But needed to vent.  Edit: Nothing more doctors can do for me until I get the surgery.  UK so NHS and timeframe is well, there isn't one.  So suck it up! Apparently.

is950uy0	Meeting you was the worst mistake of my life. Beautiful, talented, and everything I could of dreamt. You were an elixir that I could only find in you. That I will only find in you.  The most amazing poison I‚Äôve ever tasted.  You slowly destroyed me from the inside. It had to be slow because this was to be a complete death of all that I am.   When you finished me off and left, your destruction wasn‚Äôt complete. It took several more years of coming back to check my pulse. If it was steady, you knew I needed just another drink of you.   Your taste has permanently bonded to my neurons. There is no getting over a love like this. Not for a man like me. It has soured me beyond redemption.   My mind was already ravaged by a personality disorder before I drank your fatal elixir. The hatred inside me is all I have to cling. My desire for power is the only rebellion I have left towards an existence I hate.   You took everything from me. My mind will ravage me for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt have the gift of letting go. Not for my brain. I know myself well enough to know what the road ahead of me will be. Empty, childless, partnerless, cold, loveless and haunted.	1643154317.0	scrf8j	/r/offmychest/comments/scrf8j/i_wish_i_never_met_you_and_now_its_too_late_for_me/	I wish I never met you and now it‚Äôs too late for me.
hzj9lo91	   I recently moved out of my 1100 sq ft duplex (2bd/1.5ba) and hired cleaners for my landlord since we moved far and I didn't want to go back to do a deep clean up. For reference, I am not a dirty person. I cleaned after myself and other than dog hair on the baseboards and wiping everything down, there wasn't a ton to do.  I found a cleaning company on facebook that looked good. They quoted me 65$/hr for two cleaners. I anticipated it to take 3-4 hours to get everything done (I think I could've done it alone in this amount of time but I know you pay extra for the service so I was like whatever). I left a blank check with my landlord addressed to the cleaning agency so that they could get paid for the work.  My landlord just told me the bill came out to 412$. They were there for 5 hours. AND they sent an extra person. So it took 3 people 5 hours to clean the duplex. I did the math, 65$/hr for 5 hours is 325$. I messaged the agency asking why it was upcharged from the agreed upon amount. They said " The price is $30 an hour per person. I just sent another one so that it could get done quicker than with two. If only two had come it would have still been the same price in the end because it would have taken alot longer."  I am so irritated. I did not budget for this (I know that's my fault) but it just seems ridiculous. I told her that it is not ok to send an extra person without being transparent and asking to basically charge me for extra things I didn't ask for. I am also upset that it took as long as it did.	1643154355.0	scrfrt	/r/offmychest/comments/scrfrt/cleaners_sent_an_extra_person_and_charged_me_for/	Cleaners sent an extra person and charged me for it.

4h0cf2jr	For most of my life I was the quiet kid who literally let alot of thing slide. For context, I grew up in a place where I was constantly discriminated against for my races as a mixed person; k-12 only person in my class that was a poc.  I am a different religion then most people I come into contact with and I've only meet like 2 other people with the same faith as me in my life. Plus I overall was just different.  From a young age, everypart of me was subjected to someone's inspection and or disregarded. So when I got old enough and went off to college I really didn't care how people saw me because whatever is left of the person everyone's been tearing down is tougher than you could imagine.  I've been almost killed because of what I am, what I value ,and what I represent.

Since you distrust the medical establishment so much, stay out of the damn hospitals and call up Dr. Joe Rogan M.D when you get sick and he'll fix you right up!

izs6y4yf	I was 26 and she was 18 when we met, I understand that age gap doesn't look good. Probably wasn't. I was blind.   I am an alcoholic, drug addiction, and I have a mental illness. That does not excuse anything I did, but I'm telling you that to start because during this story I make a lot of asshole decisions and I acknowledge that but I am going to say all of this with my thought processes at the time and don't want to continuously say that because therapists have told me things that I'll get into.  I had been released from a mental institution because I told someone things that looked like I was going to commit suicide. Never my intention i just felt like dying would be easier. I went to a treatment center where they assist help addiction and mental health. I was doing the some dumb things people do in rehabs, flirting with girls. That's when I met Nicki. It was a couple days and I had seen her around there but I didn't want to crowd the girl because she was new which other guys have already started.  I had been to treatment centers before and I used the time cut off from the external world to read. I read a lot. Nobody else younger than 45 did. I saw Nicki reading a book at a table and I came up and asked her what it was about. She was really excited to tell me and I was excited to hear about it. This is how we started talking.  I was well liked around the community because I hated making people feel bad. Her and I were hanging out constantly when I had a negative interaction with a guy there. Me, her, and another girl were talking about politics. I said I thought the IDF were terrorists in regards to Palestine. This guy piped up and said, "all four of my grandparents were in the military in Israel" I said "ok...?" Because I had never talked to this dude at all. He said, "maybe do your fucking research before you say something like that." I got upset and said, "I've done my fucking research and I've seen some fucked up shit." He left. I thought that interaction was off, because of obvious reasons... but also this guy's name was Jose Gonzalez (not his real name but relevant later.)  This dude and I made up for the argument, but he didn't like me. Specifically during a group to say he stepped up and squashed our beef. Every other person was surprised that he, or anyone for that matter, would have that.  Nicki and I flirted a lot, I didn't know her age at this time but this facility was for adults so I knew at least she wasn't a minor so I didnt really think about it. She told me she flirted a lot with people and that was just her personality. I thought maybe she meant that her flirting with me wasn't something to mull over and flirted a bit with this other girl Rachel(24f) nothing beyond flirting happened but we both kind of knew that was where it was headed. Nicki had flirted with other people kind like I was but her and I would spend a lot of time together. We both woke up early and talked most of the morning every day.  Eventually I had realized that I had fallen for this girl. I've been with enough women to see when one is truly spectacular. She was kind, generous, funny,¬† beautiful, motivated and just breathtaking to me. So I would want to spend more time than we had already with her.¬† One day she said that she was surprised "someone like me would choose someone like her" because she felt that Rachel was prettier than her. I insisted that A) that was not that case and B) even if she was that would not change how I felt.  I have to admit that her saying that stroked my ego. Up until college I was traumatized from every form of abuse and was fat and insecure throughout high school. I became bulimic and started smoking crystal meth and drinking heavily right after high school. I lost over a hundred pounds within a few months. During college I noticed women¬† actually were hanging around me in a type of way I'd never experienced. I was told by several people that I was extremely attractive. Whether me losing the weight caused that or my newfound confidence I don't know for sure, but in my mind it was only physical reasons. I lost my virginity and slept with every woman that wanted to because my insecurity made me feel how embarrassed I was in high school for never having a girlfriend or having sex compared to all of my friends who were way better than I was. I felt like I was on their level. Finally.  Within the next year though I started to think that all of my relationships now were based solely on physical appearance because I was FWB with every one of them and nothing more. I then craved a¬† relationship with any woman wanting that. For three years i was in 4 relationships where I was used for emotional validation with women I thought really liked me. I was lied to, gaslit, and cheated on but I would always accept it until they realized I was such a doormat they weren't interested anymore.   I thought I was going to die alone and unloved.   Nicki said she thought someone like me would never choose someone like her. I thought someone like her would never choose me. We both had self image issues, and both had the same personality disorder so we also both had found someone who could understand the mood swings. We became codependent.  I've written a lot, this is on mobile and might get killed so I'm going to continue this tomorrow morning if it isn't taken down.¬†	1643154973.0	scrnum	/r/offmychest/comments/scrnum/how_i26m_ruined_the_only_good_relationship_i_ever/	How I(26m) ruined the only good relationship I ever had (18f)

8e8wuzig	A little background, my husband used to work in a factory and got a degree in the medical field. I'm very proud. I never anticipated the hate health care workers would receive five years later. We are both vaccinated and boosted. We had pretty mild cases of what was probably omicron. I think I didn't realize how stressed I felt until there was an extended break of him not working. I was worried about him getting covid before but much more minimally after the vaccine. I could physically feel the relief after his first shot.   But, there have been protests outside his hospital. People are making threats. He isn't specifically on a covid floor or administering vaccines but would that matter to psychos out for blood? I'm really scared for people that have those job too, just to be clear. I'm more worried for his safety with crazy people than I ever was with covid. I feel like it's just going to be a matter time before some idiot with a gun shoots up a hospital. I know in my head, it will probably not be my husband's hospital. I know. But I feel so anxious. I can't sleep. I feel sick to my stomach. My chest feels tight.

d2r5akpa	*(Posted in advice subreddit but felt like this was also something fit for offmychest)*  Right, so I‚Äôm 18F and I feel like I don‚Äôt know who the fuck I am. I feel like I don‚Äôt have a personality.  Now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got social anxiety. It‚Äôs not too bad I don‚Äôt think (getting worse but that doesn‚Äôt matter for now) but it prevents me from being ‚Äúmyself‚Äù and one thing I do know about myself is that I love the whole rnr/indie concerts and festivals scene. I also love 90s music. I love the look of big festivals and I would love to go to Reading one day. I really envy people who go to festivals and have the time of their lives listening and dancing to their favourite music. I spent last year being jealous of my ex best friend‚Äôs Snapchat stories because their friend group had the best time and saw so many people that I‚Äôd love to listen to. Fuck being jealous, I wish I could just be happy for them but they seem so confident in themselves, and I start to panic if I accidentally bump into someone at a concert because I feel like they‚Äôll get annoyed with me. Deep down I know it‚Äôs a concert and it‚Äôs bound to happen and they knew what they signed up for, but I‚Äôd still feel guilty. I overthink a lot.  Only thing is, I don‚Äôt have anyone my age to do these things with. The only person who would go is my 40 year old sister but I feel like it‚Äôs not the same as going with friends around my age. And the idea of me, singing along and having the time of my life without a care in the world, makes me so happy. I just know that I wouldn‚Äôt be like that because the thought of me embarrassing myself or just being me makes me sick.   And y‚Äôknow I really want to go see Liam Gallagher in Knebworth this year but I‚Äôve got nobody to go with, and I‚Äôm literally one of the most awkward people I know and I hate it man. I can‚Äôt imagine being there without worrying about every little thing I do.  I just wish I could be myself without thinking everything I want to do/everything I do is cringey. Even writing all of this out makes me cringe. I just want to be one of those people who don‚Äôt give a fuck what strangers think of them, who can wear clothes without thinking I‚Äôm dressing weirdly, who can sit on people‚Äôs shoulders at concerts and not care if the people behind can see (not that I‚Äôd do that ever because that seems rude to me), who can  make friends with anyone anywhere they go, who can be self-confident and proud of the stuff they listen to/the things they love.   I wish I could stop bullying myself internally and stop thinking everything I do is awkward‚Ä¶ because we only have one life and my one goal is to get what I can out of it, because I don‚Äôt want to waste anymore years in this depression or any more of my life saying I don‚Äôt know, maybe next time etc. I want to live it now because I‚Äôve spent too fucking long wallowing with my childhood gone right before my eyes. I‚Äôm still young, I‚Äôve got to make it count or I‚Äôll look back thinking how much I‚Äôve wasted panicking about other people and over stuff DOES NOT MATTER.

q7tbt8	It makes me (23M) feel like I just don't belong. As someone with who's suffered from social anxiety my entire life, has never been in a relationship (never had the courage to ask a girl out), and has never had many friends, it hurts because I just can't socialize and don't have a social circle at all. It's already had a severe effect on my mental health and I know it's going to put at a higher risk of disease as I get older. I don't know what to do.

i0m33wyw	I'm not even sure if I'm in the right spot for writing this, but considering my chest actually feels heavy, then... I need to get this off my chest.   &#x200B;  I wrote about the person in another sub. Long story short: close friend, we talked everyday, he started drifting, stuff was said, he may or may not be depressed, and nope, there aren't conversations and the last attempts at communicating were terrible and inconsiderate (feel free to check the previous posts in my profile).  I may understand some things and needing time, etc, but I'll never understand certain actions.  I've been postponing unfriending him, not that it makes any difference, is just a symbolic thing, as in "I'm totally done. I don't want it to be like this."  The last straw may seem petty but was me seeing him liking posts of other people and not mine. To clarify I'm launching an online business. We used to support each other. He could need some time off talking, but would it be soooo haaard to hit the damn like?! Especially when I know that he knows I've been posting (I usually post the latest posts in stories and yes, he sees the stories). This has been going on for months. And yet, there's likes on posts from other accounts...  This was and is just another confirmation that I've become quite irrelevant.   If I didn't feel like talking to him, now I really don't want to.  &#x200B;  But for some reason, I hit the unfollow and I just panicked. As if I did something wrong.

ax44v83k	Trying to make sense of why I would lie about my assault  The act itself happened, so many times. I think I have repressed a lot of stuff for years I felt crazy, because I felt so numb to everything. I kept questioning my experiences. Nothing felt ‚Äútextbook‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt classify it and it drove me insane.   Long histories of inappropriate sexual experiences occurred pretty early in my adolescence. Middle school was a hard time for me. I was a lot more developed than a lot of my classmates, and as a result got targeted by a lot of my male classmates. After lunch they used to surround me in the hallways when teachers weren‚Äôt looking, and touch me inappropriately this went on for weeks if not months. I was terrified to tell, I didn‚Äôt even know at the time what was happening I thought ‚Äúwell they just like me‚Äù I was so naive I was 12 at the time. This wasn‚Äôt the end, at 13 I was attending a concert with my middle school best friend. I still had braces. A man came up behind me and stuck his hand in my pants. Finally got my friends attention and was pretty frozen in fear and she pulled me out of the crowd.   All of this summits to when I was 15, I was still a virgin at the time, my friend and I had snuck out to meet up with some friends. He was a dealer and smoked regularly. I had never smoked before. He gave me dabs, I couldn‚Äôt feel my body and lost nearly all motor function. I remember crying, he hovered over me and I wanted to curl into a shell and die I couldn‚Äôt move I couldn‚Äôt even speak. He just laughed and made fun of me ‚Äúhaha u are so fucked up‚Äù I was on the verge of being completely unconscious. I felt disgusting, I didn‚Äôt know that that was not what normal sexual experiences are supposed to be, I even apologized to him. I was so naive and never really dealt with anything. Finally my ex bf comes into play. Throughout our two Year long relationship, he had assaulted me on numerous occasions. This all came to a head though the last night I ever saw him. It was the last time we ever had sex, during which he forcibly went in the wrong hole, then told me he thought I wanted it. Despite the fact our entire relationship I had said the opposite. He had taken everything he ever wanted from me, and then he left, and went to the bars the next day and hooked up with another girl and told me about it while I was home crying.   I feel like I never dealt with any of these events. This all comes to a head with my current relationship in college. We had been having severe issues, I had no friends, was really depressed and suicidal, and was almost having to force myself to have sex with him as I almost couldn‚Äôt bear the idea at times. I got drunk at a party and lost my friends and had to walk home, during this walk I had a full blown psychotic break I told my boyfriend and later my parents that I had been raped. I never included a name or anything as of course there was no one to name.   This lie got me home and into therapy, I feel like a monster nearly everyday, and I don‚Äôt know if that feeling will ever subside. I told my boyfriend I lied, I keep trying to analyze why WHY. But he forgave me and understands. I think deep down I never really dealt with anything I felt like I wasn‚Äôt really valid and my experiences weren‚Äôt worthy of emotions and so I made up a story. I still feel like a monster regularly. I love my parents, and I don‚Äôt think I can ever tell them the truth or they would surely disown me. That lie saved my life in alot of ways, and I feel so guilty for that. I don‚Äôt really know where I would have been, I had tried to leave and told them I wanted to leave and seek help, they never really understood and thought I was overreacting.  Today I am in the best place in my life or as good as I can feel with the guilt of this.

ip07p2pn	Heres the thing, horny blorny, blah blah blah. I sometimes really believe I love sex more than anyone I know. I‚Äôm sure some will prove me wrong. But I mean, I‚Äôve fantasized about it since I was in Jr High, and spent til now (my mid 30s) watching it and doing it with the many girls I‚Äôve been romantically involved with.   Sex is great with a one true love‚Ä¶. But it‚Äôs also great, with a random person that you‚Äôve never met but find very attractive. See, sex is in a way an art. I always wanted to explore the nicer side of that. I always wanted to make a website and pay girls. And I would do the scenes that we agreed on, talk setting, story, positions, time, care and stuff.  Problem is‚Ä¶. I won‚Äôt cheat on my future and that‚Äôs the woman I‚Äôm with. I also never wanted my family to know‚Ä¶. And I know that they would find out one day.  Also, I know it‚Äôs another job like any, at the end of the day‚Ä¶. But I really just always wanted to make a few girls scream my name on video, in the name of passion. Cause it would feel good‚Ä¶ cause it would be sexy‚Ä¶.   It‚Äôs never gonna be that way :,(  I know it must sound like idiotic first world problem‚Ä¶. But my dream of working in the field I‚Äôve always wanted is pretty much dead until if a day ever could cum haha come where I could feel alright with it. I don‚Äôt thibk it will.

eu18pxuk	I don‚Äôt know how else to put it. Everything about it is gross. The only good thing out of it is the baby, of course, but doing the whole pregnancy thing is just‚Ä¶.. disgusting.   I personally would feel major anxiety if I got pregnant. I wouldn‚Äôt be happy at all. Knowing everything that is going to happen in the next 9 months and what follows after, caring for a screaming annoying newborn, is so off putting. Stretching your stomach, weight gain, swollen feet, not being able to do simple tasks towards the end like bend over and tie your shoes, FEELING IT MOVE INSIDE YOU (!!!!!!!!!), I have zero idea how women could be like ‚Äúomg the baby is moving how beautiful and precious, what a miracle‚Äù like‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs like an alien moving inside your body, reminds me of Alien when it wants to get out of your body and burst out.   God, not to mention the hormones. The pregnant brain, mood swings, insecurity that your partner will cheat on you because you look like an oompa loompa compared to their young, skinny, and attractive coworker. Sex life being ruined. PPD scares the fuck out of me the most. Im bipolar centered around depression, so I‚Äôm really scared I‚Äôm at a high risk of getting PPD and not being able to properly care for baby or not love them. I don‚Äôt want to ruin my body. I never want to look unattractive to my partner.   And then childbirth goes without explanation. Everything about pregnancy sounds disgustingly horrible and I want no part of it, but I really want kids. I know that many of these things will probably not even happen, it‚Äôs just the possibility that they will. Maybe it‚Äôll change if I ever do get pregnant, but as of right now I want absolutely no part in it. I just needed to finally say it, I feel like I would be persecuted if I said this out loud.	1643155884.0	scs09j	/r/offmychest/comments/scs09j/pregnancy_is_disgusting/	Pregnancy is disgusting
6pj6ayi4	My mother died 4 days ago. She was 96 and had end stage dimentia.  \- For her last 6 months in her home my wife (primarily) has been her constant caretaker. Moving into her home to care for her while I live in our home in a different city.  \- For the last 2 months of my mothers life, she was in a care facility. I did not want to place her in a facility, but we were not equiped to care for her, and not for lack of money.  \- Speaking of money, we covered all her care related expenses for the 6 month period. Clearing our savings, and forcing me to take a 2nd job, though I already made 6 figures in a low cost of living area.  \- Somewhere in this process my depression went from meh to severe, and little to nothing was accomplished in our house as a result.  \- My wife is back home now, and we're fighting about things not getting done. Not so much that they didn't get done, but that I do NOT want to do them. Like panic level do not want.  \- In the 6 month period, the police have been called twice, for elderly abuse. The first time was an honest financial mistake that was corrected as soon as it was brought to my attention. The second was just malicious.  Shortly before my mother died, one of her friends wanted to visit in person. I refused to allow it as Power of Attorney. COVID was spiking with over 1 Million new cases per day. It hasn't gotten much better, but it's not currently much worse, either. I made this decision after consulting with her nurse, the facility manager, and her social services case worker. I was also very clear that I had zero problems with a phone call or any kind of video chat. In fact, I encouraged it, and offered to provide any and all technical support required.  19 days ago I get the following message:  "I can't believe you care so little about Mom as to deny her access to the people who love her. Mom is the only person in your miserable life who ever gave a damn about you.".  Note that we had also not heard from friend after we made her brother move out 3 months prior.  About a week ago, I received a call from the nurse saying that she was starting to transition and it would only be a matter of weeks. At that point, I called her former roomate, not the person that sent the text, to arrange for an in person visit. The roomate doesn't drive, so I offered to drive the several hours round trip to make the visit happen. Unfortunately mom died two days later.  After receiving the texts message, I had to do something. I couldn't not. I handed my wife my phone and went and did some writing. Came up with this:  >!Where were you?!<  >!You‚Äôve been her friend for 30 years. She‚Äôs like a mother to you.!<  >!Where were you? Where were you when she was abused by her husband? Where were you when he had a gun to her head as she‚Äôs screaming kill me? Where were you when her husband‚Äôs friends were gang raping her daughter? Where were you when her daughter over dosed? Where were you when her husband tried to kill both her and her son? Where were you when your brother destroyed her car? Where were you she fell? Where were you when she couldn‚Äôt take care of herself? Where were you when your sister was poisoning her mind? Where were you after your brother moved out? Where were you when she was taken to the emergency room? Where were you when she was in the hospital, crying that all her people have gone away?!<  >!Now, in the twilight of her life, in a world where millions are getting sick in a day, all you want to do is visit in person, ensuring she will die alone, screaming, with her last breath‚Ä¶!<  >!‚Ä¶ where were you?!<  But the text message keeps gnawing at me. Something about it I can't shake. I feel like I need to respond. Even wrote something out:  "My miserable life? You really need to take a hard look in the mirror. The nurse, case manager, and facility manager all said that the COVID risk is too great given her state. You called the police claiming elder abuse after not reaching out for months after your brother moved out. You refused to accept my reasoning and started taking cheap shots to get what you want.  So be it. That will be your legacy. You clearly don't care about her, just about making yourself eel better. This is how you will forever been viewed by her family and closest friends. You are not wanted and not welcome."  My wife keeps telling me to delete it and move on. And while I can delete it from my phone, how to I delete it from my mind?	1643155982.0	scs1kg	/r/offmychest/comments/scs1kg/fighting_with_mothers_friends_after_her_death_a/	Fighting with mothers friends after her death - A rant in several parts.

birpbcip	I know this is a long read but I would really appreciate an outsiders opinion as I am driving myself crazy.  I‚Äôm not sure anymore whether I‚Äôm overreacting or whether this is reality. I‚Äôve recently had a conversation with some of my friends, who have expressed they are worried for me because they‚Äôve noticed signs of gaslighting and ‚Äòemotional abuse‚Äô from my partner.  The reason I put that in quotation marks is because I have no idea what to believe. I‚Äôm going to leave a few examples to see what you guys think.  1) I have depression and anxiety, which he knows. I can‚Äôt tell him when I‚Äôm down or anxious anymore because he tells me I‚Äôm ruining his night, or ruining the mood around our friends. I could go for long periods hiding these feelings as if they‚Äôre not there, and if I bring them up he says he can‚Äôt take it, that I‚Äôm too much and that I‚Äôm not making any effort to be better.  2) A few days ago me and my partner were meeting his mothers new partner, we have been together a long time and his family consider me one of their own. My partner was in another room and myself and his much younger brother were in the living room with his mother and new partner doing handstands. His mother looked over at me during this and smiled, we then went into the the other room to show him. He told me ‚Äòstop you‚Äôre embarrassing my mother‚Äô.  3) He often tells me some things I say didn‚Äôt happen or that my feelings aren‚Äôt valid. He‚Äôll ignore me if I have a feeling he doesn‚Äôt like or want to deal with, and that I should just suck things up and cope with the realities of life like everyone else.  4) I came to the kitchen just before we were due to go to the movies dressed in a pair of jogging bottoms. He told me I should change to make a good impression. If you have read this far, thank you.	1643156086.0	scs2x0	/r/offmychest/comments/scs2x0/is_this_abuse/	Is this abuse?
xk34wua	I am BEYOND over the "guy on a buffalo wing" commercial for Zaxby's new boneless wing meal. It's just...so...NOT funny. It seems to think it's really funny, which makes it even worse.   I am trying to picture the focus group that convinced the marketing department to select this ad . I'll bet that they were only there because of the promise of free Zaxby's, and they just said whatever necessary to sink their teeth into that delicious chicken as soon as they could. It is almost as bad as the "chickenflauge" commercial that starred various cast members from Duck Dynasty (and I thought that nothing could be worse than that).   Here's a thought...maybe go back to making commercials about how good the fucking food tastes? The dude riding a buffalo wing and then finding the meal inside of a tree just didn't do it for me.	1643156126.0	scs3gf	/r/offmychest/comments/scs3gf/i_hate_the_latest_zaxbys_commercial/	I hate the latest Zaxby's commercial!!!

izwoaw7r	This is so fucked. I‚Äôm pretty sure my parents are sex addicts.  A few years back, my ex and I broke up randomly. I had always suspected her of cheating, but it wasn‚Äôt until the relationship ended that I realized the extent of it.  Her abuse had led to memory issues which caused me to forget this one time I walked in on her sucking my friend‚Äôs dick. After going through old texts/pictures, the memories started coming back.  This was somewhat overwhelming, so I hit up my friend to confront him. At first, he was dodgy, but he also kept adding weird details which made it obvious that he knew my ex far too well.   Eventually I told him to cut the shit, and that I remembered seeing him and my ex. Suddenly, he flipped like a switch and became aggressive, spouting out nasty details of his encounters with my ex.  But the cherry on top was at the very end of our conversation, where he added that he had slept with my mom too. And the worst part is, I believe him, because I remember a time where he was getting oddly close with my mom, to the point where my dad actually threatened him.  Once I realized that my ex was capable of this, it reframed many of my experiences with her, and I realized she had probably slept with my dad too. This is based on a time when we were visiting my dad with some friends, and when I came outside, one of my friends immediately says, ‚Äú(ExGF) just kissed your dad!‚Äù Which they both played off like an accident, but my friend said it didn‚Äôt really look like an accident.  I just really don‚Äôt know what to do. This relationship has taken everything from me. I only have 1 friend left who I can trust to not have been involved in any of this mess. There‚Äôs not a single part of my reality in the past 5 years that was actually real.	1643156268.0	scs59o	/r/offmychest/comments/scs59o/ex_gf_cheated_with_my_friend_and_my_dad_when_i/	Ex GF cheated with my friend (and my dad).

He calls me in panic on facetime and just ugly cries and i find it so extremely pathetic and off putting. Of course men should be allowed to cry and show emotion but this is not normal for anyone and it is extremely tiring, i am only in high school and this is NOT how i imagined spending my later teen years. He constantly tells me he wouldn‚Äôt be able to live without me and that i am the only thing good in his life (i am definitely not) He has the most negative outlook on life and everything that is not his way is wrong.

4lkb7tog	I cut off my last friend, we had grown apart for years and he only put up with me so I didn't kill myself. It wasn't right so told him I understood. I'm clingy and needy, he didn't care but felt obligated.    I feel like I've lost a part of me. Not like losing any other friend but probably because I've lost every friend. I'm completely alone and feel nothing but an odd phantom pain I can't describe fully.    I tried to talk to my mom but she just gave the "Bootstraps" talk and it just really made me feel worse. I started crying, the first time in a long time and feel more isolated than I ever have before. I can't really talk to anyone anymore and I have no one or nothing to comfort me. Comfort and affection was missing my entire childhood and into my adulthood it's become apparent that I crave it. I'm not sure why I feel like something within me is lost but I hate it. It's difficult to find friends especially with Asperger's and it's painful to try and seek new people out. It only reminds me how lonely and awkward I am, it makes me afraid because I don't socialize well and have difficulty telling if people like me or are just being nice.    I got a new job today, I should be happy but I just feel empty. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and it makes everything feel so much worse.	1643156942.0	scsdwz	/r/offmychest/comments/scsdwz/i_feel_like_ive_lost_a_limb/	I feel like I've lost a limb.
8fdcx6sa	I would lend money to adults as a 10 year old for interest since I was young. My dad would bring mates over but even an amount of ¬£50-100 is hard to come by if you're working class. Many people work for minimum wage. It's fucking wrong. I'm good at maths and always been intelligent and aware about the value of money because I was poorer than others. I bought my own gaming pc with my money I earned from entrepneurship as a child in many different ventures. I still do this now and don't work. I focus on learning all day and self improvement and then maybe buy something or sell something because I can accurately gauge value for certain groups of items. It's not hard if you know enough. But this was all kickstarted from usury as a young child. That's how poor my town is. Why get 3000% Apr when a kid will take a fixed amount interest you might pay more but you aren't paying 1k for that 100 quid in a couple years time but isn't this sad.

22u7f06v	My gf (f) and me (also f) have been living apart because I am finishing school and she needed to move with her mom for a while. Yesterday she told me she feels like we aren‚Äôt connected anymore. She wants a two week break.   It just day 1 and I don't understand how you can just be okay with not talking to someone that you have been with for 7 years. A few days I get but two weeks? Am I wrong in feeling that if you can go two weeks without talking to someone who was supposed to mean so much to you that there is no point in trying to salvage it. I am just feeling super lost and sad I'm trying to focus on school but all I can think about is her and this. Every-time I see something funny I just think this is something she would have liked that I would usually send her. I of course don't know what she's thinking but I just feel certain she's probably not giving as much thought to me as I am her.   If she doesn't reach out by this weekend I feel like there is no point in continuing on because I'm just so hurt that this is happening and it just feels like she's trying to detach so she can leave me at the end of the two weeks.  We have pets and I miss them but I of course cant contact her about them and im so sad because if this ends she will take them because they are currently living with her at her moms.

ioplyoi5	I‚Äôm only eating meat on the weekends ever since the summer, I can eat fish (and I only like a few kinds, which is two of them‚Äî which is baked salmon or fish and chips) but no meat. When we had fresh veggies from our garden it was so much easier to get hyped up about meals.  Lately I feel like my palate has been blander. I‚Äôve been really stressed from work and just life in general.  I haven‚Äôt had a lack of appetite or a loss of taste, I am freaking hungry right now, but nothing ever sounds good the past few weeks except for Reese‚Äôs peanut butter cups and things like that. Sometimes I think ‚ÄúI want pizza‚Äù and then I think ‚Äúgross, no I don‚Äôt want that‚Äù. I am very rarely satisfied after eating a meal lately.  It‚Äôs not for lack of choice or lack of money‚Äî we have all the world‚Äôs cuisines available to us where we live.  I really don‚Äôt want to have any meat. It sounds gross to me right now, even though on some level I wish I could just feel hungry for chicken tenders (I used to love them so much, on some level they sound delicious right now but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd be grossed out after having had them).  I also used to love to eat rice, rice doesn‚Äôt sound very appealing the past couple weeks. That‚Äôs a big problem because rice was a staple food of mine. I have never not craved rice in my whole life. We cook a lot of Asian food in our home so feeling grossed out by or indifferent to rice or noodles is a real big problem and takes almost all my favorite weeknight meals out of the equation.  Potatoes and cheesy things are usually very exciting, now not so much. Foods I used to love on the weeknights now feel like they‚Äôre not even worth the trouble of cooking.

dn8rmg5w	I've never met anyone like her. She's so kind and sweet and just the most wonderful person i've ever known. Always so understanding of me and listens to me and i just feel so valued around her... All of the relationships i've been in before have been incredibly abusive or lacked any real passion so this is the first time i've ever really...experienced something like this??? I never knew it could be so wonderful and euphoric and everything and i'm just so beyond happy to have met her i'm like getting emotional just writing this and thinking of her. God i love her to death shes so amazing. We've been together over a year and she still makes me so happy... On our anniversary we called for over 8 hours (she lives a bit far away but we still always do things together and it makes me so happy whenever we do). Literally the only reason we stopped is because it was like 4 in the morning omg. I trust her more than anyone and she knows so many things about me that nobody else does, i can always count on her to never be judgemental of me because shes just so unbelievably kind. Not only that but she has a great sense of humor (i.e. nonsensical just like mine) she always has interesting things to say and we both like a lot of the same things so we have a lot to talk about!!!! I invited her to my splatoon competitive team and it's so fun to play with her ahhh and i love all her little quirks and mannerisms too...

2tz7u4ed	Y'all ever have one of those days where you get home and just nothing feels like anything, nothing *really* really matters, and despite the contents of your fridge, despite the money at your disposal, despite the offer from loved ones to have something delicious made or brought to you, you just settle for a bag of frozen broccoli. You microwave it, dump it on a plate, find that it is really mushy and it splashes broccoli water-juice on you. Two florets fall into the sink so you toss them to the dog, but you just don't feel the general bemusement that comes from watching your adoring, sweet, silly K9 eating some flavorless, soggy fucking piece of weird little fuzzy headed tree plant. You eat it anyway. The whole rest of goddamned bag and with each bite, recount the moments of the day that led you to realize that your value is so miniscule, your place in the world is so utterly fucking pointless, that anyone can do the same shit you are doing but better and remind yourself that it wasn't skill that brought you to where you are and it's always just been that your life has been running on unadulterated lick and it can't last forever. You've used so much luck that it's truly impressive that your still living as something more than a vegetable in some hospice room. You think about what it will be like when it does finally run out. Then, right on queue, the ideations a begin again. You feel again just how tired you are, the weight of hidden regrets and eternal nagging of missed opportunities press down on your chest and you find yourself breathing almost like you're completely out of breath; not quite a panic attack because, although highly counterintuitive, you own control of yourself and keep the anxiety and tears at bay. You recall that the only thing that keeps you here is that you want to stay around the one person that means something to you. Like, you know you have friends, but they just don't seem to pluck that "emotion string" in your chest and gut like that one person. Sleep feels right. More and longer sleep feels more in line with the right direction. Permanent sleep feels like the only real solution to avert just a little longer the emptiness that resonates in your torso and still, you just don't want to leave her. Not that you couldn't, but you have an actual desire to remain next to her despite your weariness, despite the constant sensation of pressure against your sternum. So you stay. You stay, plan your tomorrow, try to get it organized but can't wrap your brain around any sort of process to make things make sense anymore. You mentally prepare to once again smile at your perpetually pleasant co-workers, brave the tedium of the daily guesswork of social nuance and professional improvisations for no other reason than to just keep getting by; but you stay. You *choose* to stay. There's no good or bad feeling about it, just the decision to keep doing this whole life thing. But you fucking stay. Or is it just me? I think I need a beer.	1643158772.0	sct19q	/r/offmychest/comments/sct19q/broccoli_for_dinner/	Broccoli for dinner
izwoaw7r	This is so shitty. I already typed out this but my post was deleted, so I‚Äôll paraphrase.  My ex was a habitual liar and cheater who manipulated me into believing her lies. It got so bad, at one point, I walked in on her sucking my friend‚Äôs dick, but she had fucked with my psyche so much that I forgot about it until we were already broken up.  Once the memories started coming back, I confronted my friend. He lied at first, but eventually he broke and his demeanor became aggressive/hostile. He started going into detail about all the nasty stuff he did with my ex, and at the very end of it all, told me he slept with my mom too.  And the worst part is, I believe him. I distinctly remember a time period where he was acting oddly flirtatious towards my mom, to the point where my dad confronted him about it. I remember him disappearing one time while he was at my house, and he turned out to be in my parent‚Äôs closet with my mom.  As I wrestled with trying to make sense of my world, I realized my ex probably slept with my dad too. One time when visiting my father with some friends, I went outside and one of my friends immediately says, ‚ÄúExGF just kissed your dad!‚Äù They played it off as an accident, but now knowing my ex was capable of this combined with my father‚Äôs affinity for young women makes me believe she probably slept with him too.  I am just at a loss. My entirely reality has been shattered and I have no clue how to pick up these pieces.	1643158840.0	sct28t	/r/offmychest/comments/sct28t/ex_gf_cheated_with_my_friend_and_my_dad_when_i/	Ex GF cheated with my friend and my dad.

emgpwck6	My antidepressants cut my libido, which was an initial shock to the relationship with my boyfriend. But since he still wanted s#x 3 or 4 times a week, I had to just "get over it" because he couldn't be in a "loveless, s#xless relstionship".  It's gone from me just not feeling like it initially, to outright dreading any physical contact because it's always a precursor to s#x that I don't want. He'll wake me up early on his days off because he wants s#x, or a hand job, or a blow job. Any cuddling on the sofa inevitably leads to him sticking my hand down his pants to give him a quickie. He doesn't tell me I look nice in anything, just that he wants to stick his d#ck in me. S#x is feeling like borderline assault because he doesn't try to get me in the mood at all, he just wants to get his d#ck in as quickly as possible, even if it hurts me.  The worst part is that every time he's horny, he makes it my problem. Wakes up with morning wood? I have to suck him off. Scrolling through Instagram and sees p#rnographic content from girls he follows? I have to suffer through s#x. Tries to tell me that tumblr is meant for p#rn, despite the fact I had a tumblr long before he even heard of it, and kept a p#rn free dash - so clearly it's not. He happily just scrolls through p#rnhub because he's bored, then expects me to fix the resulting hard-on.  His argument for not trying to turn me on is that I'm too difficult to please, and it takes me too long to warm up to the idea, and I never want s#x so he has to beg and bargain for his weekly due. He even started some bullsh#t like "I'll buy you breakfast if you..." Now I'm on a diet, that doesn't work, so he sulks, and pouts, and pokes me with his er#ction until I just give in.  I hate it. I hate his kisses, his hugs, his offers to buy dinner (since I'm the one who normally has to cook and buy groceries, and then buy take out because "I don‚Äôt feel like what you cooked, I want takeout") everything comes with strings attached to his damned p#nis. Nothing is just about a human connection anymore. I'm miserable and I think I'm just starting to hate him, honestly. I just want it all to be over.	1643158856.0	sct2g5	/r/offmychest/comments/sct2g5/i_just_dont_like_sex_anymore/	I just don't like sex anymore
5weitg5g	the way it is now, it's almost unbearable.  I haven't been able to stop crying for hours.  I don't know how much longer I can take it.  why the hell don't you talk to me  ?  why?  If you don't want me anymore, just tell me.  I can hardly stand the fact that you don't talk to me.  why don't you tell me what's going on  there are a thousand questions in my head.  why did you spend so much time with me/us if you don't really want me/us?  was all of you fake??  Why have I never met your friends or family in all these years?  wasn't I good enough?  you gave me / us so much security and then you just let us / me fall?  why were you active on dating apps even though we spent almost every day together?  did I mean anything to you at all?  I miss you so terribly...  when I write to you, you react annoyed.  why?  what am I for you?  a burden?  why did you take care of my child so much if you don't care about us?  I'm confused... all these thoughts are fucking my head....  I'm scared of going insane...I swore I'd never get my heart broken again and go insane about it....  everything is falling apart and I don't know what to do.

I've learned to cover up the pain.  meanwhile i can be in the best mood among people and no one would ever notice that i have my head full of s_icidal thoughts at the same moment as i stand in front of them smiling and in a good mood.

1f26bfoz	I've been suffering with depression for 6 years now. I started taking medication a year ago and it does help. It makes things easier to deal with at the very least. Though, the last few days have felt horrible. Something that has never gone away is that I feel unwanted. I feel like I'm an annoyance to everyone around me. The last few days have amplified this feeling. When my friends don't talk to me I feel like I'm being annoying or that they don't want to deal with me anymore. I don't even have friends in real life. Making new friends is so exhausting. I feel sometimes that I just want to get rid of all my friends. Like not associate with them anymore. I know it's childish, but I'm at the point where I feel it would be easiest if I just disappeared forever and never talked to any of them again.  I don't really feel important. I know it's fucking childish of me, people do care, but I can't convince myself of it. I want to disappear forever. Would anyone notice? Wouldn't life be easier if I never existed. Bleh  I just want this pain to disappear. I don't know how to get rid of it. I don't want to make new friends really. It's too exhausting and I don't want to be exhausted anymore. I know I'm still young and all that. I know I can do so much in this world or something. But why does it matter if I can't live a day without this pain inside. I don't want to go forward. I just want to stop breathing forever. I want to know if anyone cares for me. How would people react to seeing me dead?

9xkkpdie	We would have broken up months ago if I weren‚Äôt so in love with him as a person. He‚Äôs my best friend and the good times are incredible, but unfortunately only occupy 20% of the relationship. It wasn‚Äôt always like this, so I guess I‚Äôm sticking it out to see if it goes back to normal.      He‚Äôs on the spectrum and I‚Äôve been doing so much research to understand how I can be a better partner. I understand noise sensitivity and overstimulation, but it is not an exaggeration to say that in a 24 hour day, 16 of it he spends wearing noise canceling headphones playing games, A half hour to an hour interacting with me depending on whether or not I‚Äôve made him food, and the rest sleeping, usually long after I go to bed. He‚Äôs not vocal about his emotions and gets frustrated when I ask him for romantic reassurance. And I know that that can get annoying but I need it, and it doesn‚Äôt occur to him on his own.      A couple months ago he got into a fender bender and his car was impounded. At this point, without a real discussion about it, my car became ‚ÄúOur car‚Äù. And at first I was happy to help, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to respect that I need it too. His need for it comes first.       And while he‚Äôs out he won‚Äôt respond to my texts asking when he‚Äôll be back. So I‚Äôm stranded in my apartment for however long it takes for him to get back. In fact, it‚Äôs happening right now.

7rpgwnf5	tldr: an open letter for a teacher that I'm too afraid to send to him whom I think of him as my father figure as I faced abuse from my own biological father  Hey Mr Theo, (fake name)  I know I've said thank you to you a dozen times, but you have no idea how much you mean to me.  You taught me Physics at Grade 9, where I developed a love for it. At Grade 9, I was facing emotional and sexual abuse from my father that had broken me down and my grades plummeted a lot. I told no one about this incident and everyone from school knew from my actions that I was dealing with something hard in my life. Even though you did not comfort me, I saw you looking at me during lessons to check if I was ok.  That was the bleakest part of my life; I cried myself to bed almost every night until one day I could not feel anymore emotions and became emotionally cold. One day when getting into the lift with my neighbor and her kid, I smiled and said good morning to her. Usually she would say good morning back to me but she didn't. Instead she hugged her kid extremely close to her chest in a protective manner. I was pondering about this incident for a long time until I noticed that I had cold, emotionally dead eyes when I was looking at myself in the mirror.  At Grade 9, I often dreamt about how great you would be if you were my father. If only it were a reality, I thought to myself. The summer break I was longing for passed extremely slowly as I saw my father everyday which reminded me of you, and I longed for going back to school to see you face to face.  I'm currently at Grade 10, where I chose Physics as one of my electives. Unfortunately I am not in the class where you taught Physics in. From the encouragement of my friend, I finally had the courage to talk to you. You encouraged me to join a Science Competition and led as the teacher advisor. While talking to you I discovered why you had became a teacher. You were on the verge of crying when you said you wanted to teach students well so that they can contribute more to the society.  I am really scared of sharing my experiences as kids who come from dysfunctional families have prejudice against them. Thank you fellow Redditor for reading my letter. I needed to get this out of my system.  Best regards,  CrappyFrappuccino	1643159498.0	sctamw	/r/offmychest/comments/sctamw/open_letter_to_mr_theo/	Open Letter to Mr Theo

gq1w8997	I personally try to care about her love life, because she wants me to, but in reality I stopped giving a fuck about other people's intimate lives after the huge reality check that was starting my first relationship, personally I don't ask anything and I'm fully honest 100% when someone wants my help.  I don't have a relationship's degree, but what my best friend is doing is just not it. I can't help, but feel weird about her questionable flirting and switching from guy to guy.   She really wants a boyfriend, I totally get it. She never had  one, but she sees my relationship with my boyfriend and desires something like we have, because we seem "perfect for each other". We have a lot in common, but I also had some kind of fantasy about being in relationship, but when I started this journey (in my experience) I realized it's just a good friend that you have a huge connection with and you're intimate with. It's amazing to have someone by your side and I love my boyfriend with all my heart and being, but she has some kind of twisted view about relationships. Nothing is perfect and everyone has their differences.  Now starting the topic. She was flirting with a guy back in 9th grade. Their flirting was questionable and she was not only flirting with him, but also the guy I liked back in the day, but nothing worked out. 10th grade came and she started to having feelings for a guy from her new class and nothing went well (he was a dick). After this one, she started talking with the 9th grade guy again, but she discovered that he was dating someone for some months. In 11th nothing happened, UNTIL 12th GRADE. She started dating (!Not in relationship!) some popular guy, but he was a dick and she moved on, to start talking with one of my closest friends that I know for 10 years.   I didn't mind that, I actually supported her, but although it seemed they could've had something with each other, my friend was interested in other girl and he isn't interested in having serious relationships.   After my close friend, she started flirting really hard with the 9th grade guy, to be completly ghosted after a few weeks :/// her flirting was reallyyyyyyyyyyy questionable. Only talking about her butt, no joke, only that. They didn't even started a "how are you" no, they started full on horny flirting.  She didn't talk about a guy for a week and today happened.  She mentioned another one of my good friends saying "he is kinda hot". Dude, I'm telling you, she pulled that out of her fucking ass. They only interacted once in Halloween. I know her type and MY GUY he is not her type, plus, he is interested in other people. She told me that he talked to her one day and he was cute, because he was tall. That man is a cinnamon roll that shall be protected and as much as I love her, I can't understand why she does this switch and is a maniac in wanting a relationship and have sex. She asked me a couple of times if I did it. Never answered. She is so desperate to pull out of her ass a crush that didn't even makes sense to exist, to begin with. She uses her body has an attractive object for boys and as much as I support "my body, my rules", I can no longer accept this. It's been like this since we were 14 and now we're 18. But the hardest thing is not to witness her getting her view about love getting twisted over time, but the fact that I can't tell her "no" is the most painful thing.  I don't want her sad and angry at me, but her mental health is getting hurt, because of her dream to have a love one and I can no longer accept that.	1643159630.0	sctcc5	/r/offmychest/comments/sctcc5/my_best_friend_has_a_crush_on_one_of_my_good/	My best friend has a "crush" on one of my good friends and I don't know how to feel about it.

dlbmee7n	I just need to write that shit down.   I'm 38 and male, my older brother was diagnosed with lung cancer a few months ago. We all were pretty optimistic but things turned grim at the moment. He has two new tumors and now we're talking about preserving his life as long as possible with as minimal pain as possible. Because of that his wife was under so much stress that she developed a heart insufficiency and needs to be operated in two weeks. She lost both of her breasts two years ago to cancer too. Because of that their youngest son is depressed and in therapy, he has suicidal thoughts and I can't even fault him.  Our mom isn't taking this all well, she has an autoimmune disease and a severe nerve illness, she'll basically slowly loses the function of her limbs and will slowly die. Now my dad was diagnoses with a problem in his right heart chamber, he goes to he hospital tomorrow and will be operated as soon as possible. I don't know how severe it is because he doesn't talk about stuff like this.   I'm living 400km away from them with my own family. I last saw them all about a year ago, not because I don't care but because I just can't make it because of many different things which happened in my family life. It just crashes down all at once. I don't sleep. I go to bed at 4 am and I wake up at 6 am to start my day. I don't know how to cope anymore. I don't drink, I smoke a joint from time to time but more as a sleeping help than a coping mechanism. I talk a lot to my wife, it's not like I'm closing myself in but I still don't see any use in it. I just feel like shit and I don't know what to do. You're just so helpless. Last week I had a long conversation with my brother over the phone. He doesn't want to see me. Not because we don't love each other but because he doesn't want me to see him like that. I never in my life heard him so empty and sad. I could cry the whole day but I have two kids who don't even know what's going on. My daughter is too young to tell her and my son while he would be old enough to understand, he's simply not ready for it, damn I'm not ready for this all at once. He was diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago and while that's nothing dramatic, it just piles on. I feel like I'm unfair a lot of the time and I try to talk to them about it but it's also hard for me to not be stressed out all the time. I try to keep it together but it's tough.    I know that nobody here can help me and I don't look for pity, I'm the one who is at least healthy but I feel like I'm going crazy and I thought it may help to just write it down once. I don't want to involve friends with so much personal drama, it's just too much, so I thought I take this route. Sorry if some things aren't clear, english isn't my native language and I'm not really sorted in my rambling.

4765v05s	I‚Äôm 19F and my friend has a girlfriend who I just don‚Äôt really like? She‚Äôs not a bad person or anything and the two of them have a very good relationship I just don‚Äôt like her and she‚Äôs been absorbed into this larger friend group I‚Äôm in. She‚Äôs good in small doses but she‚Äôs a Huge complainer (hypocritical of me I know) and while I understand that venting is incredibly important at a certain point I think she needs to grin and bear it. Or do something to fix the issue if possible. She‚Äôs also the kind of person who shares every little detail of her life in the friend group chat, and this might be pretty rude of me but I don‚Äôt really care? Like I don‚Äôt need to know you talked to this or that person or see every selfie you‚Äôve taken. I‚Äôm as friendly to her as possible and she‚Äôs generally friendly too but she kind of makes me want to not interact as much when I know she can be there.

9bn9ldql	I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but I‚Äôll try; so a couple weeks ago me and my girlfriend got into a fight (I wrote about it here) ever since that night I‚Äôve been feeling a change personality wise. Like becoming more hostile, more blunt with stuff, more quick to be fuck you get‚Äôem outta here (blocking people when they on BS), more quick to confrontation     Now of course I‚Äôm not snapping unprovoked; everyone that knows me know I‚Äôm not a bad person and that I have a heart of gold even strangers pick this up when they interact with me; it‚Äôs just when people think they can talk to me any kind of way or BS on my name currently I snap back and bring the same if not greater energy before I showed restraint and left things alone and let it blow over( like I did with me and my gfs ‚Äúfight‚Äù). What I find funny is when I do it people be like ‚Äúwhy you being toxic‚Äù I‚Äôm like naaah you started this fire now come dance in these flames. I know this‚Äôll sound bad but I get satisfaction from it; bringing the same ‚Äútoxic‚Äù energy others will give. I guess I‚Äôm just tired of peoples BS and being lenient with people?

izq89k0c	I've never been this distraught before and I feel it's affecting my empathy. Even so I do feel a bit guilty. Misery and desperation push people to do stupid, childish things. Will this make it better? Probably not. In fact if I tell my ex fiancee that I'm going to kill myself and she doesn't even try and reach out to me, what does that say about her? What does that make the point of all this?  No, not kill myself.  Tell all my friends (and my fiancee that ghosted me) that I'm going to kill myself by sunrise and then turn my phone off for a couple weeks.  I already have a place to campout and my lease is up by March 1st anyway.  Please don't suggest that I try and live a successful life for revenge. If anyone deserves to kill themselves it's me but I'm not even pulling that off. And if I ever decide to come back I'll say I was in the psych ward after my failed attempt.  I plan to do this soon, before my rental agreement expires. My roommates finding my somewhat empty torn up room should help seal the deal.	1643161162.0	sctvkl	/r/offmychest/comments/sctvkl/im_going_to_pretend_to_kill_myself_in_hopes_of/	I'm going to pretend to kill myself in hopes of causing panic and hurt to everyone that has given up on me.
9z6scl5f	it is crazy how some people were just created to cause chaos and hurt others. And it is even crazier that some people were just created to endure it and cry silently without showing any sort of emotions in order to "stay strong".   I was doing just fine until he came back. I was waking up early everyday and making sure I was living a healthy lifestyle. I was reading again, something I havent done in years, and was motivated to study. But now he came back just to stomp on me one last time.   He is the type of person who likes to mutilate others and watch them bleed. He likes to cause pain on purpose because he loves when the world struggles. And when I finally catch my breath and stop with the crying mess I made at 3 AM, he comes back just to make sure I fall and never get back up again.   He is pure evil and whatever relationship he ever has will forever be dysfunctional because he will never be interesting enough to hold someone there with him without his suicide threats and "I need you" lies.   He is like a piece of broken furniture: useless, ugly and better off in the garbage can. I swear it takes every single string of my muscles to not report him now.

ecsckw9n	After passing up someone on a dating app multiple times, I finally decided to send a message to this woman. I didn't really know what to say before and trying to be witty all the time with openers isn't an easy thing for me.   Turns out she's awesome. She is everything I could I ask for. Doctor (MD in two countries, actually), no debt, tons of ambition and drive, is emotionally similar to me in that we're both very rational/logical thinkers and communicate as such, kids are optional, accepts my nerdiness and even takes part in casual gaming, incredibly high sex drive.  Yet I still keep having these thoughts about the person who doesn't want me. Not to mention the fact that this person is in another country and it would make trying to have a relationship that much harder. She's still working her way through uni. Has no solid idea of where she's going to end up in the future so everything is incredibly uncertain. I would still give up everything that is good for me right now to take a chance to be with her.  I hate that I feel like this. I hate that this person has become someone that I've fallen in love with. I've been distancing and ignoring her. I don't start conversations and hardly engage in them when she does. All I want to do go back to talking to her for hours and hours again, but I know it's never going to lead to where I want it to.  Why am I willing to throw away what could be an actual forever lasting relationship for someone who (even if she did want to date me) might end up breaking things off in a few years because career wins over personal life.  The lack of control I have upsets me because I know I should be better than this.	1643162204.0	scu8bz	/r/offmychest/comments/scu8bz/i_hate_that_im_hung_up_on_someone_and_im_letting/	I hate that I'm hung up on someone and I'm letting it ruin potentially good things.

94ehxpg5	So, I recently switched from Windows to Linux. It's free  it's faster, and I have started studying programming, so I should try to get along with it, because is extremely well-spoken off and widely used in my field of work.  That said, I can assure you Linux is NOT for the average PC user. I cannot imagine anyone that I know (besides other IT students) doing half of the things I've been doing or having a tenth of my patience to get the hang of it. It lacks graphical interface a lot, like, You wanna install something? Use the terminal, You wanna update something? The terminal, something doesn't seem to work as expected? Terminal, Want to breathe faster? Try the Terminal, it might work. Now, seriously, the terminal is a great tool but 99% of the times you don't know what you are doing or why, you're just pasting a code some random of the internet told you that will solve your problem, and hopefully that code will work in your particular linux distro.  I want to get through it (the adaptation phase), not just complain about everything that's different. I like trying new things, I'm fascinated about my computer's performance now and being able to personalize my desktop a lot. However, it all comes with a great cost. My free time out of work has been drained by my computer, I spend it all trying to do regular stuff, like downloading something to my secondary hard drive (my most recent headache).  So let me tell you, unless you are open to spending days, weeks and even moths reading articles, watching videos, etc, to do the most basic stuff, don't think of Linux as an option to replace Windows.	1643162849.0	scug6d	/r/offmychest/comments/scug6d/a_new_os_is_a_huge_thing/	A new OS is a HUGE thing
6io0rur3	Ever since school i‚Äôve been trying to figure out why i dont get turned on while making out or foreplay in general. My first kiss was with my first bf and we didn‚Äôt have sex but we went till the third base and nothing.  I think to myself hmm maybe because it was awkward and first time and i let it go. In college i start thinking im asexual because it makes sense, but i do have sexual attraction towards people so im not ace either.  I tell myself maybe i judged it all wrong i just didnt have a fun first time doing stuff. And also i hadn‚Äôt even kissed anyone since so i have nothing to compare it too.  I meet someone and went on a date with them and we kiss and‚Ä¶ nothing.   what is wrong with me? ive even started considering if my pcos is affecting my drive. But that‚Äôs the thing, i get horny frequently but it‚Äôs like my mind wants it but my body is playing catch up. i hate it. i just wanna have fun like everyone else like i have on my own just not on my own all the time.   I am almost 22 and shit is running out like i havent even figured out whats going on downstairs and i cant enjoy dating or having an SO because this thing this stupid thing gets in between. my second bf didnt even get action because i was afraid it would suck yet again and so i just kept avoiding it to a covid lockdown long distance breakup.   im just so done and tired. ive never met someone who‚Äôs experienced this difficulty who weren‚Äôt ace. at first i thought id found my people in the asexual community but i soon realised no i dont even fit into the asexual description. and were in a fkn pandemic i cant just casually walk up to a gynae at this time no one is leaving their homes.	1643162887.0	scugn5	/r/offmychest/comments/scugn5/i_fkn_hate_myself_for_how_im_built/	I fkn hate myself for how im built

j0xtzudx	This isn't polished or anything I just couldn't get this out of my mind and need to get it... off my chest  I didn't really know how to compose this title I feel like it just doesn't convey how I feel. I feel like the whole world is just in on a joke that I don't get it's hard for me to make friends I've never been in a relationship and Im turning 17 soon, I understand that sounds young but everyone around me picks up relationships like there nothing meanwhile I can't have a girl as a friend let alone as someone in an intimate relationship, I just can't understand what I'm doing wrong in life. I'm tall (not saying I'm superior to short people but everyone says girls like tall guys), I play football for the highschool team, and am in good shape, I can talk to anyone and usually keep a conversation going with anyone. I don't have a fear of social interaction, I can make everyone laugh I pride myself on being the funny guy I feel like I can "tell a joke". Basically what I mean is that it's not like im shy and quiet and don't speak to anyone, I have no fear of public speaking. I keep myself well kept, I keep up with my hygiene and clothes and what not. I'm trying to give the idea that I'm not someone upon meeting you'd think is the epitome of a social "reject". However I find it so incredibly hard to make friends I feel like it's impossible. Every time I glance at other people's phones their always getting messages from tons of different people meanwhile I can go a day sometimes without anyone messaging me and the people I do message are like 2 other close friends. I try getting people's numbers and what not however no one ever text me back i always have to be the one to initiate messages and I always have to keep it going or else the other person just leaves and never speaks to me again (im not blaming them if im the only one this happens to it's a reflection of me not them). I find it hard to talk to people beyond just being the funny guy I don't know how to have a conversation were im not cracking jokes to keep it going or a conversation this is actually meaningful (i can talk to people about sports and what not but that only goes so far) and it hurts not being able to carry on a conversation with a girl I like or someone who I want to make friends with. I feel like everyone else always hangs out with their friends and all their different friends all the time where as I only have a couple to hang out with and 90% of the time I have to ask if they want to do something. Another thing that always gets to me is being a virgin everyone I know has already lost their virginity and beyond that see girls regularly were as I haven't even kissed a girl let alone date one. It pains me to have to go silent or try to change the subject every time someone brings up "fucking" their girlfriend. Then there always comes the question were people asked if I had sex and I have to admit im a virgin which makes them think less of me. I'm sick of having to make some sort of joke to divert what they're saying and I'm sick of being ashamed of it (please don't say it doesn't matter it makes me feel like less of a man and less of person when everyone brings it up so easily). I don't know what's wrong with me since everyone assume I've been in many relationships everyone assumes I'm not a virgin and it pains me to see them geniouly confused and surprised that I'm not.I try to learn how to socialize and how to text people but no matter what tips I learn they never help, they never change my situation. I see people walking around my school with all their friends and girls and it just reminds me of how lonely I am and what I wish I could have. Then it's worse when I come home after a practice or what not and just sit in my room until I go to school next day since I have no one to hang out with. My dad hates me and thinks I'm a loser, before anyone says anything I heard him arguing with my mom once and he said "what's wrong with me? What's wrong with our son wasting his life in there he has no friends, he doesn't chase girls" and virtually everything I was already insecure about he mentioned, it hurts so much to hear your father call you a failure when your already struggling to be confident and for him to say every insecurity I already had made it even worse . My mom loves me I know that but even she thinks im a loser and a reject. I'm  just so confused in life I can't understand basic human interaction people talking seems like a math problem I can't figure out and it all lowers my self esteem to the point where I feel like less of a man and as a person. I don't blame anyone else for why I can't socialize if I'm the one person that can't do it then that's on me but I just wish I could make friends I wish I had a girlfriend I wish I could have people. Im not suicidal death scares me more than anything but I just feel like I'll never have the meaningful relationship everyone else has in life.	1643163951.0	scutod	/r/offmychest/comments/scutod/im_tired_of_never_being_able_to_connect_with/	I'm tired of never being able to connect with people

But emotionally I'm not strong enough. I have to sacrifice my intelligence well some of it I can't exactly gauge how much its affecting me. But it definitely is.

j10otlhy	My own dad died not too long ago (several months but not quite half a year). He had a heart attack at the hospital he worked at. He had left early in the morning, so the last time I had seen him was the night before. He was completely healthy, no signs of anything. We watched his favorite show together before he went to bed. Nobody knew he was going to die.  Today, my friend informed us that her boyfriend's father is close to passing, so they're going to try and visit him and stay with him for a while. He's had cancer, and they don't know how much longer he'll last. I feel sorry for him, and my heart goes out to him and his family, but I can't help but feel jealous. He gets to say goodbye. He gets to come to terms with it and spend every day with his dad as if it's his last. I didn't. I woke up to my mom crying and the stranger sitting next to me in the car didn't tell me my dad was dead until we were already halfway to the hospital.  I hate myself for thinking it, but I can't stop.	1643164401.0	scuzbp	/r/offmychest/comments/scuzbp/im_jealous_of_a_guy_because_his_dad_is_dying/	I'm jealous of a guy because his dad is dying.
76ps3p80	i would say hate but i can't bring myself to say it. my mom always told me i shouldn't hate anyone no matter what and i'm still related to them, so.  this might be long. thank you for reading this, if you do.   i'm 17 and the youngest of my dad's four kids. i'm my mom's only child, and she's dedicated all of her time to me. she makes me feel so loved and appreciated and i'm beyond grateful for her.   i do love my dad. he's incredible, and he always tries his best. he tells me he loves me all the time and when i do get to see him, we laugh a lot. he works nights so i only see him on weekends. our schedules don't mix at all.   the problem is with his other kids.   the oldest is in his late 30s. my dad is almost 60, and that alone terrifies me because he'll die one day, a lot sooner than anyone else's parents will.   he's not as bad as the other two, but he's still not great. he lives in another city about two hours away from my family. he sometimes says "i'm coming over" without even asking. it really drives my mom up the wall when he does this. he never gives an estimated time as to when he'll show up, he just does.   he has a baby with his girlfriend (fianc√©e? i don't know, honestly), and he's lovely. i love my nephew with all of my heart but i worry about him and the environment he's growing up in. both my brother and his girlfriend smoke weed and do other drugs at home, and i can only hope they don't do it around the baby or her other kids (who are both still very young)  my other brother is a little bit younger. i don't care enough about any of my siblings to know exactly how old they are. they don't even tell me happy birthday.   this brother is always in and out of jail. he doesn't have a stable life and he never talks to my dad at all. he doesn't tell him happy birthday or happy father's day. he doesn't make any sort of effort to communicate with him. i haven't seen him in 5 years.   my sister is the worst out of them all in my opinion. when i was little, she used to live with me and my parents, including my biological mom (who is her step-mom), and she would steal from her. money, makeup, jewelry. anything she could find and pawn off she'd steal. she's always hared my mom, she used to tell her mom that she would abuse her and hit her when she never would. my mom tried to get her help so many times but she always refused.   she disappeared for years. i don't know a lot about that situation, but i know she lived out of state for a long time, got engaged to a rich italian guy, and then everything after that i don't know. but she isn't engaged anymore. she isn't engaged anymore, though. i know that.   i don't know where else to post this.i have no one else to talk to without feeling like a burden   all of my siblings use my dad for money, whatever they want. he's so blind to that. i understand that he loves them but i don't get how he thinks they actually care about him, when they don't.   when i was younger my siblings broke up my parents. they were separated for three years and my sad missed some really big moments in my life.  i don't like them.   i am so envious of people who's siblings care for them. i wish mine loved me. i wish they weren't as horrible as they are.    thanks for reading, if you made it this far.	1643164460.0	scv01x	/r/offmychest/comments/scv01x/i_dont_like_my_dads_other_kids/	i don't like my dad's other kids
7tuwba26	If the topic of loneliness or being single triggers you then don‚Äôt read this. I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel bad after reading my thoughts. They aren‚Äôt much depressive or whatever but when I read sad typa stuff, instead of me feeling better because I relate, I feel worse. So if you‚Äôre like that, don‚Äôt read.  I just need to get this off my chest.  For many years I‚Äôve been completely fine being by myself and have grown to enjoy my own company. Never been in a relationship but I never cared. I would have a crush here and there and obsess over them for a few days then forget about it then think about them again and blah blah blah, whatever goes on when you have a crush. Yet, I never felt like I needed to be in a relationship or desired to be in one. Never felt like that even when I saw social media posts of people being in happy relationships. In fact, I felt happy for them.   But, I was thinking of this one dude who I‚Äôve had a crush on; on and off for the past 3-4 years and had a extremely strong urge to be with him (started thinking of him since 2 weeks ago). I‚Äôve never in my life wanted to be in a relationship with him or anyone this bad.   Even though I had tons of feelings of desperation to be with him or whatever, I still felt really good and happy thinking of him.   Anyways, today my thoughts of him have simmered down after trying to get him out my brain for so long. But, now I feel so depressed ??   I want to be in a relationship so terribly it‚Äôs been making me cry for the entire day. This is so unusual of me. I don‚Äôt know why I feel like this.   There are men who are attracted to me that would want to be in a relationship with me but I just never seem to like them enough to get into a relationship with them. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm fixated on my on and off crush and only want him. I‚Äôm open to new people and even excited for it. But it never works out?  It makes me think I‚Äôll never find anyone.  but honestly, I was okay with that thought up until I thought about my on and off crush two weeks ago.   I realized that I may be subconsciously sick of being alone. But, the fact that I believe I‚Äôll never find anyone who I genuinely like mixed with my strong desire to be in a relationship out of nowhere is physically hurting me and giving me mental pain. I can‚Äôt even do my daily tasks without feeling upset about not being in a relationship.	1643164691.0	scv2xx	/r/offmychest/comments/scv2xx/lonely_out_of_the_blue/	Lonely out of the blue
7nqza30i	I've been holding so much on my shoulders that I can't just ignore the fact that it is affecting my mental health, life choices, and life quality. Since I got here and started high school, I've been doing so much to get honor classes certificates reaching many goals for my academic profile to get a scholarship. More things that could help me and my mom since we are the only ones in this country, starting a new life (everything legal, doing all the paperwork to get political asylum) and working tons of hours to be able to afford each meal, live a mediocre life but still studying and getting many awards, certificates and getting into a lot of honor classes. All of that, for the first three years, I've reached the maximum academic awards with a 4.0 GPA, sacrificing so many hours of sleep, learning a second language that would become the most important one for my academic and professional life, just a lot of things...  once I got to college in the very last minute, all the awards had to be processed through FAFSA. I needed to apply for my FAFSA for all the academic rewards and everything that I received, everything, absolutely everything goes to the trash when all the financial offices rejected all of them for me not having a green card, FAFSA saying that I can't apply even I meet all the legal requirements, work permit, alien number, everything... just no green card (apparently organizations don't want to give you money knowing the possibility you can abandon everything and keep all the money but... bruh). Life has been full of complications, me working full-time jobs to reach the end of the month and help my mom pay bills, barely having anything, studying at the college, barely having time to do any work, and still pulling strength out of nowhere keep a clean GPA. Last year I got my AA, and still, even though there have been many opportunities, COVID has been a lot, professors not even teaching classes and pre-recording everything, my learning capacity not even reaching a decent level to keep going with my cyber security career and everything seems to go worst and in the stupidest lousy way possible. And after everything, suffering from anxiety, depression, and OCD, there is no light. I haven't even taken a break taking summer classes and two jobs to pay bills and keep studying to get a paper to open some doors, and even writing this right now. It's just... I can't describe how tired I am of everything, of people receiving financial aid and failing and not doing anything, the unfairness of living in these conditions, working so much and studying so hard even though I have been like this, I've been keeping an almost perfect GPA, but it is just unfair, I'm going to turn 20. I feel like I'm 40 already, so many responsibilities, no time, just living daily for what? What am I doing during a phase that usually is the best one to live, remember and create good moments with the people you love, but no... every system, every structure is a giant obstacle and feels like I'm breaking down, I'm getting strength from places of my soul where there's none, I am so tired and feel so much agony seeing all of this, feeling all this sadness, I'm just destroyed inside. I'm sorry if my grammar is pretty poor or just absurdly wrong. I'm going on a rant right now over my emotions without overthinking about it. Thanks for taking the time to read this, it's been so much, and this is just a fraction of so many shitty things that have been happening in my life.	1643164708.0	scv35s	/r/offmychest/comments/scv35s/i_cant_describe_how_much_i_hate_the_school_system/	I can't describe how much I hate the school system.

548xcibj	After dealing with panic attacks for 3 years I am finally getting help! I just met with my therapist this evening and she was wonderful. She is going to do a CBT approach for me and she's already given me some good advice and exercises to incorporate into my day.     She is really nice too like when I first signed on my heart was beating really fast and I had feelings like I was going to have a panic attack simply bc I was so nervous, but after breathing in and out and talking a bit more I got more comfortable and felt a lot better :) if you're thinking about therapy I would recommend it so far   Anyways I am just happy bc I feel like I finally am going to end this and these awful feelings	1643164861.0	scv4zv	/r/offmychest/comments/scv4zv/just_had_my_first_session_of_therapy/	Just had my first session of therapy :)
gyez2q16	     Honestly, I don't even know exactly why I'm writing this out. I kinda just want to say it yknow? There's a type of relief in just being able to say it.        I've always been obsessed with telling my story, I don't know why. I feel like it'll make me feel better, somehow. If people can understand my feelings it's nice, ig        I never understood the concept of suicide notes, I guess this kind of counts as one. But I still never understood them, I always feel a need that I absolutely have to write suicide notes or else people will be really upset, like it makes a difference though. They'd still be upset I just don't want certain people to blame themselves, some people I do. It's nice knowing that the people who are shitty to me will have to deal with their shitty actions forever. Never being forgiven. It's empowering in a weird way.        I'm 15, when i was a toddler my dad would hit (spank) me. But not softly, he would do it until I screamed and more. I remember how I'd hide after the one time when I was around 8 and accidentally pulled on the curtains too hard.. The first time I tried to kill myself I was grounded for 2 months (fun times) and when CPS was called on my mom for SA she got away with it by saying it was "just a hug". She touched my ass and boobs, squeezing them sometimes. Still does, is that SA? I've told her to stop multiple times it makes me uncomfortable but she doesn't.        My doctor says Im "prone to addiction" I really just smoked weed and drank bc it made me happy and stress free. I liked how confidently happy I could be - with nothing to stop me. No mental illness or whatever.   I have a girlfriend, we've been dating 3 weeks. And I'm already leaving her, I feel really bad but, what can i do? I don't know what else to write.

6nsi7lgt	I love my mom and she is the most selfless human I know, but I'm at the point at my life where I can't take complaining anymore. All my family does is complain. The second they start, it to the point i get a migraine. They don't see all the things I do just the things I don't. I have had to listen to if from a while. Let's call it a family trait. I moved because of it.  I just moved into a few days ago and my mother came while I was in the middle of waxing. She didn't  let me know she was coming but it's cold and there was a lot of knocing on my door. I grab my robe to open the door so she doesn't freeze. Firt thing she does it complain. "What if it was your father. You would answer the door naked like that?" I saw it was just her and didn't want her to freeze but ok. Also, if you called I would have been able to get dressed. Then she insisted on helping me clean. I told her no.  I went  to get her something to drink and she tell ls me my heat is too high. It was but i was really cold all day and couldnt heat up. She insistes to help clean again and I told her "No, I will do it slowly on my own time. Its better than doning it with you guys cus of the complaining" she insisted and I told her ok. He goes upstairs and the first thing she does is start complaining. I her to get up, got her up and put her on my bed and told her to just sit and I will do it because I don't want to listen to her. I hurt her feelings and I feel like shit. She left after that and told me she wont come until I call her.  The thing is I'm not lazy. I have only been in my house 5 days. I work from 8 to 6:30. I use my lunch break to cook from my husband. After work I take a shower and do what I can. Today I decide to start waxing after my short and she came after 20 minutes of waxing. I really didn't have time.   She really I the best I just don't know what to do?	1643165109.0	scv7yi	/r/offmychest/comments/scv7yi/mean_to_my_mom/	Mean to my mom

7ukf67wh	lately, I've been thinking about the feelings that come with having the same birth name as your father. It's tiring.   (I go by Vivian now) But being the 2nd generation that's supposed to be exactly what they envisioned or perhaps a better image of themselves rather than a better image of a person; There's this immense pressure that's hard to avoid from time to time filled with expectations, desires, dreams..I just want parents to understand that sometimes ingraining your head with high expectations will often lead you to disappointment.   I can tell my dad isn't really proud of me much. Despite the achievements, I made over time, and the work I put in for my future, I just know he isn't happy with me. I honestly feel like if I did the things he wanted me to do without a moment thought he'd be more proud. and the pressure to try to change my plans and fulfill his dream....it doesn't have to be that way though. People-pleasing is a thing of my past and  I am tired of that. I am not responsible for carrying the vision and dream of a son you wanted for years.   Yeah, I'm not the way you want me to be..hell you might not be happy with the plans I have after graduation, but I am happy. You know how far I came, especially the failures I went through to figure out what I want to do. I don't want to be part of a legacy where I feel pressured to be a certain way just so you can be satisfied. Nor do I strive to be better you, not even an extension   I want to be me, my own being.	1643165211.0	scv985	/r/offmychest/comments/scv985/i_hate_being_a_jr/	I hate being a Jr.

i03jg8s0	**TW: RAPE, ABUSE**  ^(I'm super scatterbrained right now so I apologize in advance if my rambling is hard to follow. I am seeing a therapist, but some weeks it's just not enough.)  I was in a really bad relationship for nearly a decade. I know I should have gotten out sooner, but I didn't know any better. I've been out of the relationship for over 2 years now. In the past, whenever I've tried to recall the actual relationship I only get bits and pieces. I can remember a broad timeline, but most specifics are totally gone after the first year or so.  Recently, I started trying to dip my toes back into dating again. I was doing really well until a totally innocuous conversation unintentionally triggered a memory of my ex digging into my shoulder with a pocket knife while they fucked me. I didn‚Äôt even remember where that scar came from. Now everytime I brush it I feel like I'm right back there, terrified and in pain.   Now I've started getting flashes of other moments seemingly at random. I can't remember anything before or after the flash, just the feelings and sounds in that moment. I can see myself crouching in the corner of my old closet and still feel the tightness in my chest as I hyperventilated in the dark, but I don't know what led me to be there. I can hear the crash of my ex kicking the dog's crate down the hallway as hard as possible, but I don‚Äôt know what happened next.   I can still feel the tears rolling down my face as I clung to my ex naked in our bed after I made a mistake and they raped me. I can still hear their whisper as they kept repeating an apology for taking their anger out on me. I don't know why they were angry. I don't remember what I did.   For so long I wanted to be able to remember my lost years and now I wish I could lock it all away again. I don't know why this is all coming up now and I feel like I'm losing my mind. How can I move forward when I can't heal from the past?  I just want to be happy again. I'm so lost.	1643165397.0	scvbim	/r/offmychest/comments/scvbim/i_feel_like_im_spiraling_out_of_control/	I feel like I'm spiraling out of control

7tuwba26	For the past 5 years I got hit with terrible depression out of nowhere. I lost all my friends, confidence, interest and you know the rest. I just wanted to be close with my family because I ingrained it in my head that no one will be there for you but family. I had to do that because those are the only people I had in my life. They didn‚Äôt understand my depression and they thought I was being a bad child by staying in my room all day. My mom would walk in my room and see tissues on the floor multiple times and not question a thing. She thought they were allergies‚Ä¶? You‚Äôre my mom you know I don‚Äôt have allergies.   Anyways point is, no one knew or cared. So that time when I lose my friends I became closer to my sister which I was very grateful for. However, she didn‚Äôt care. She would be ashamed to be with me. Whenever my parents and I would get into fights or tell me to get my life together she would lowkey enjoy it. I knew she liked the spotlight of being the better daughter after all the years I finally left that position. I opened up to her about my depression one day and she just sat there staring at my face then started going on her phone and texting her friends. I felt so hurt and vulnerable that day.   Anyways, last year my parents realized that I was truly depressed. They started to feel bad for me and stuff. They helped me get through it and we have a super great relationship now because they understand me. They understand how important it is to go out and not sit in the house all day long. They understand I need to buy stuff to keep the excitement in my life going. They understand I can get lonely so they always try to be there for me.   One day I was upset about my sister and how she doesn‚Äôt value me as a sister. We are only one year apart. My mom asked me what was wrong and I told her how my sister is rude to me, ignored me for her friends, and doesn‚Äôt value our sisterhood. My mom shrugged it off by saying she is just immature. That hurt me because she‚Äôs only a year younger than me. And I know my sister. She is not immature.   In December 2021, me and my sister made plans to see no way home but we got into a fight. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal we just didn‚Äôt talk for a few days. I was okay with everything. I literally forgot about the fight. But she thought that this was a huge fight when it wasn‚Äôt. The day before the movie, my sister took the opportunity to tell my mom she‚Äôs gonna go with her friends. I started to cry at that time because I knew she never even wanted to go with me in the first place. She made the fight a big deal as an excuse to ditch me.   I saw a tik tok later where a girl was saying how she doesn‚Äôt care that she has no friends because she and her sister are tight. I almost started crying because my sister makes me feel the opposite. She makes me want to look outside for friends when I should‚Äôve had one built in.   Now that my parents understand that they used to never let me leave the house when I had friends and never treated me to just life, they make sure the same thing doesn‚Äôt happen to my sister. She always gets to go out with her friends and have fun. Now my mom wants to go to Cuba. She NEVER leaves the house. But now she wants to so that I could get out of my depression. That‚Äôs okay but why does my sister get to enjoy all the luxuries she has off of my back?   I used to love my sister dearly and I still do but she doesn‚Äôt care about me. This is not to say that our relationship is bad. We had so many great memories. But it‚Äôs so one sided. She never helped me when I was going through my depression in the worst way. I even expressed my loneliness to her once. But instead she walks in front of my room never caring about me and laughing and talking to loudly with her friends.   I‚Äôm not jealous that she has friends. It‚Äôs the fact that she‚Äôs so inconsiderate of me when I know I would never do the things she‚Äôs done to me.   She makes my loneliness worse and makes me feel like I‚Äôm not worthy of anyones time and attention. It‚Äôs wrong to give someone this much power over you but she‚Äôs all I have. My mom always lectures me on keeping my relationship with my sister safe. But she never lectures my sister who does everything wrong. It hurts me. My family doesn‚Äôt see how much pain this causes me. I‚Äôm literally crying right now as I write this.   I‚Äôm just so grateful for this subreddit since I could release my thoughts somewhere.	1643166051.0	scvjro	/r/offmychest/comments/scvjro/sister_enjoying_her_life_from_my_suffering/	Sister enjoying her life from my suffering
5nvt9wxj	I‚Äôm newly with this guy in a relationship and we‚Äôve touched eachother sexually. I trust him very much and know he would never pressure me or anything. I told him I touched myself while I was asleep and he was fine with it. I woke up to him touching himself though and I was fine with it, though later I mentioned it to him and he told me he doesn‚Äôt remember that happening. I feel uncomfortable and bad that he doesn‚Äôt remember it happening and said he wouldn‚Äôt do that. I also feel like I could of been dreaming? I literally can‚Äôt tell if it was a dream or real now but I swear it was. Now I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs lying about not thinking it happened. Since he has gotten up in his sleep and turned off his plants lights (that are supposed to be on and he wants them on) and then when we wakes up he thinks that they like turned off for some reason when it was him that did it. I was the one that had to tell him he turned them off cause he thought that they were just turning off themselves. So yeah he does that in his sleep and it lowkey seems like he‚Äôs awake but he never remembers that.	1643166144.0	scvl10	/r/offmychest/comments/scvl10/he_doesnt_remember/	He doesn‚Äôt remember
cpnw0xb4	My childhood before the incidents was mostly normal. At least, my life in school was normal.   Since I was a one of the only mixed race children at a mostly white school for a long time, I was made fun of.   I was sent to speech therapy for my Caribbean accent, and was made fun of for my hair, my race, and everything that entails.   However, I made friends and was accepted by most over the years.   Outside of school, my life was different.   I lived with my single mother, and her mother (my grandmother). My mother, was a bit peculiar.   My mother, was starting to say things that didn‚Äôt make sense. She was incredibly paranoid and hated pretty much all of the other parents. She thought there was a conspiracy against her, and that everyone where we lived was in on it.   That every rude woman in the grocery store, hated my mother by name, that any bad dye job at the salon was a part of a much larger ploy to sabotage ‚Äúmy Mom‚Äôs name, her middle name and last name. ‚Äù   Despite having me with a Black man, she would say incredibly racist things towards the few non-white students at my school, particularly, towards the Asian children. She also would call the few heavier children pigs full of puss.   Around the time I was in 5th grade, my mother began accusing me of things I was not doing. Why, was she doing this you may ask? Well, my demeanor had changed dramatically within this period. I was making friends.   At the time, there was a lot of new students from all over the place, and I had become a bit, popular. No longer was I a quiet, shy outsider. I was a social, lively animal, not afraid to voice my opinions.   I started finding excuses to be away from the home. My mother was an alcoholic, and I‚Äôd have to be her servant for any whim. She‚Äôd find any reason to punish me, and was often very critical of me.   Keep in mind, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to see anyone outside of school, or play with the neighboring children.   When I was away from the home, I was happy. I loved school. I was at the top of my class. I spoke on the local radio for my video crew, and had a perfect SAT score.   One day, I had a particularly heavy backpack. I had walked home from the bus stop,  and entered the house.   Instead of greeting my mother as usual, I decided to weigh my backpack on the bathroom scale upstairs.   My mother immediately became paranoid and asked me what was in my backpack. I insisted it was just heavy.   My mother insisted I had thrown drugs in the bathroom garbage can, and that the reason I had acne was because I was doing drugs.   This is where it gets messy. I was sat down on my bed, and my mother began to insist I was having sex with my classmates. I denied this.   She insisted I was having sex and doing meth in the school gardens, asking me for details which I denied, and she would confirm those details. I still denied. Then, she accused my classmates of rape, and sodomizing me.   She acted out violent sexual acts using my Barbie dolls, and insisted that I was lying about those acts not happening, or that I couldn‚Äôt remember due to being roofied. She asked me if the perpetrators were circumcised, how big they were, if I liked it.  My mother was using specific names, of classmates who I knew she did not like the parents of, including the son of a wealthy land owner where we lived, and the daughters of surfers she had surfed with and disliked.   I was pulled out of school immediately. I was whipped with a belt, and confined to my bed. My mother threw a bible at me, and told me to pray for forgiveness.   I was not allowed to eat for a week or so, and was only allowed water and vitamins. I was yelled at, screamed at, and slapped.   She called me the n-word, the w word. I spent several days reading my bible, only allowed up to shower and drink water.   I insisted the story was not true, but my mother insisted it was. I was forced to get a drug and STD test, which came back as negative. My mother insisted the results were false, and that I was addicted to methamphetamines.   At the time, I had also gotten my first period. My mother insisted this was the sign of a rape and promiscuity related STD.   My mother performed her own ‚Äúexaminations‚Äù on me, and told me my discharge was abnormal.   My mother called a counselor to the house to talk about  ‚Äúwhat had happened‚Äù.   At first, I denied the whole ordeal. I told the woman nothing had happened, and that my mother was crazy and was forcing me to tell a lie. The counselor told this to my mother, and my mother insisted that I was drugged and covering up the whole story out of shame.   My mother and grandmother were upset with me, and told me that I was ruining lives by covering up the ordeal. They were incredibly disappointed and threatened to punish me if I ‚Äúcovered up the incidents‚Äù.   So, the counselor spoke to me again, after the fact. I told her the fake story. The school began to investigate the issue.   I was so scared of being arrested, or others being falsely accused for the fake story, I began to question my own sanity. I felt horrible, and evil, and sick.   Another thing, was that my grandmother made me swear on the Bible about the whole spiel, and if I was lying I would go straight to hell.   I was also forced to cut off all contacts to any friends from that school, including my best friend of several years.   So, my mother enrolled me in a private religious school, and told the school staff of my rape+drugs story. They were sympathetic to her, and soon, I was a student.   I didn‚Äôt really have a great time at that school. The kids there were wealthy, elitist and snobby. But, I stuck to myself, and did my thing, which was drawing and writing.   The other girls hated me, and the boys didn‚Äôt like me either. I did well in the academic parts of my time there, I didn‚Äôt like the religious parts, because I was an atheist. A lot of the lessons were anti-science, and absolutely crazy to me. But I didn‚Äôt say anything about it, and kept my head down.   So, my mother had an issue with some of the parents of the students, particularly, about three boys.   A one of the students who had ‚Äúraped‚Äù me transferred to the school, and that didn‚Äôt go over well with my mother.   I also made friends with a boy who was a new student, who was very much like me in the sense he didn‚Äôt fit in with the wealthy, conservative base of the school. He was an oddball, that liked jokes, and I was too.   We hung out everyday together, and maybe liked each other a bit, but nothing more than that.   My mom found out and coaxed a confession out of me, of him being sexual towards me.   Basically, my mother accused him of being inappropriate, I repeated the lie, and ordered my teacher to not let me hang out with him. Me and him didn‚Äôt speak to each other again.   Back to the group of boys. My mother, one day at dinner, asked me if I was smoking weed. I said no, I was not. She insisted I was and that I was the one lying.   Then she began to ask me about having sex with older boys. I told her I was not doing so. My mother was persistent I was taped.   Basically, I was coaxed into compiling a report about having sex with these older boys. I had no idea what to do, I was 12. I thought maybe I was crazy.   I was driven to the school, and my testimony was coached by my mother. She clutched my hand if I fudged a detail.    Over the next few weeks, the sexes in the school were segregated due to that, whilst an investigation was under way.   I heard the boys screaming they did not do it, as I was in English class.   I felt horrible, guilty, I‚Äôd never want to lie about rape. Yet I did. Soon, I was expelled from the school for being a liar, and the principal said lying about rape is just as bad as raping someone.   My mother homeschooled me after that. There‚Äôs a lot of details I glossed over within this confession, but that is meat of it.   The follow up to the first incident was that it was fabricated, and that I was lying.   No one was charged or found guilty. The second incident, no one was charged or found guilty, but I was expelled from the school.   My mother sent me to a therapist for sexual abuse. I never talked about the incidents, because I didn‚Äôt want to accuse anyone further. I stopped seeing the therapist, because my mother was upset I wasn‚Äôt confessing the incidents.   My mother would continue for years to talk about how she ‚Äúsaved‚Äù me from myself, rape, and drugs within those years.   I was in and out of CPS for various reasons relating to my mother afterwards. This post is not about that, however.   I still feel guilty to this day. If it was up to me, I would have never lied about rape. I will also include, in both cases, my mother insisted I was drugged and the reason I couldn‚Äôt remember was that I was drugged.   This added another layer of confusion, because at times I wondered if I actually was drugged and my mother was right about this whole ordeal, even if I didn‚Äôt remember anything.   Sorry this is a long post, but I rarely talk about this and needed to get this off of my chest.	1643166236.0	scvm7m	/r/offmychest/comments/scvm7m/my_mom_pressured_me_into_lying_about_rape/	My mom pressured me into lying about rape

ab2imgwt	Hi, so I met a guy on tinder awhile back when I was 21, and I never met him in person, and I honestly had no interest in him at the time. I then matched with him again when I was 22 almost a year later (I‚Äôm almost 25 now), and for some reason I was way more interested this time.  He sent very mixed signals, one day he would seem so obsessed with me and the next he would seem like he forgot my existence. He claimed to live very close to me but always told me he was too tired or didn‚Äôt have time to meet. We never met in person. He told me he was joining the army (which I think was a lie) and ended up moving across the country. (I found this out via social media stalking.) I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since summer 2020 when he ghosted me for a last time and I‚Äôm still hurt over the whole thing. Idk why I‚Äôm so obsessed with a guy who clearly wasn‚Äôt that into me but I have a hard time accepting it. I still to this day think about him constantly. I really just want to forget about him.

j8bjq	I was reading a book in a series, and this particular book was published in 2013.  It's basically about a family that has multiple run-ins with serial killers. And to be crystal clear, the "bad guys" kidnap, torture, and kill people, so they are clearly evil people. In no uncertain terms.  What completely jarred me out of the story was this line from the antagonistic:  "You think I'm itching for r-slur of the year?"  I was bothered enough to contact the author, to ask if another word could have been used, and I feel like the response I received was a cop-out:  "Many times, I will have my characters say things that I myself would never say. Why? Because it paints them in a certain light, good or bad. These are fictional characters, and sometimes I want the reader to get a response out of what they say, be it positive or negative."  It seems so unnecessary to me. With as many other words that could have been used to still have an effect, why use that one? The characters swear and kill innocent people; we know they are jerks.  Maybe it's just one word said by a fictional character, but the author is a real person, choosing which words to put to paper. And I find that it bothers me to the point that I have no interest in reading anything further from this particular author. Words matter a lot to me.	1643166677.0	scvri5	/r/offmychest/comments/scvri5/one_word_ruined_an_authors_books_for_me/	One word ruined an author's books for me
5nvt9wxj	I‚Äôm in a relationship with this guy. We‚Äôve both touched eachother sexually and I feel comfortable with him and all that. One time I touched myself while he was asleep and I told him and he was okay with it. I woke up and saw him touching himself and I was okay with that too but then I mentioned what happened, to him later and he told me he doesn‚Äôt remember doing that and doesn‚Äôt think he would do it. It kind of worries me that he completely forgot. I guess there‚Äôs no harm in it? But I still don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so worried. It‚Äôs just weird that he forgot and it‚Äôs making me question if I was dreaming or something but I don‚Äôt think I was. I genuinely feel like it was a dream but also it was so real, I just can‚Äôt tell. Now I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs lying to me or anything either about not remembering. Since he has these lights in his room for his plants and they are supposed to stay on all night, but a few times he literally got up and turned them off without remembering he did that. Like he thought the lights were turning off in the middle of the night until I was there to witness him doing it himself. He seems so awake when he turns them off too, he mumbles something then gets up and turns them off. So he is obviously turning them off in his sleep, possibly he was touching himself in his sleep too?

49b7ihrw	sorry, this is long.   it‚Äôs been a few months of being suicidal and i can‚Äôt talk to most people i know about it as they don‚Äôt fully understand. i‚Äôm already dead. have been for years and years, just feel like i should let my body go and let my flesh form finally deteriorate until it dies too. i thought i was getting better until an incident from a week ago and ever since things have both made sense but also shown me that i need to die, it‚Äôs my fate. i still have some strings to tie up, but i‚Äôm working on those now. other than that i have no purpose and my life has been wasted. i take little pleasure in anything and i don‚Äôt recognize who i am, i‚Äôm angry and pissy and lonely even though i don‚Äôt live alone but i‚Äôve lived in a fucking glass case my whole life, knowing the outside world is not for me and not being able to join in and after a while just giving up trying. i just sit in my room all the time and get more and more depressed now. i rarely go out and when i do i have anxiety to fucking get back to my mother so i dont get abused for taking longer than the bare minimum of time needed to *quickly* do whatever.  i have no irl friends; the one woman who i talk to is just that; a woman who i talk to. i have no desire to get help. it would be useless anyways. i don‚Äôt tell people about this also as they say to hold on and it gets better but it‚Äôs all a lie. it won‚Äôt get better. i‚Äôm not getting help. i‚Äôm going to let myself go until i get over the rest of my death anxiety and then go, somehow. there‚Äôs nothing waiting for me after this and i‚Äôm okay with that. nothingness is better than this. i live in a comfortable prison and there‚Äôs no way out. my friends who i wanted to live with may die soon. i see no reason to keep going. i‚Äôm so fucking emotionally and socially stunted from being sheltered all my life, i don‚Äôt know how to adult, i can‚Äôt work, my health is poor and my quality of life doesn‚Äôt exist and i‚Äôm tired, so tired all the time. i have two skills and both of them are mediocre and i‚Äôm well set up for failure. i have very few connections but they‚Äôre not enough and i don‚Äôt have enough money to do more than afford a train ride to safety and maybe buy necessities on the way if i‚Äôm lucky. and i could have been someone if i wasn‚Äôt abused and controlled so heavily for so long. why won‚Äôt it end. i‚Äôm ready to die and ready for it to take me and end my suffering. i want to die. some people are just born and used and taken advantage of (i am a csa victim, among other types of sa) and then are miserable and then die and i am one of them. there is nothing here left in this life for me. this world is cruel.   i stay purely for the sake of others and i know my actions are hurting them because i‚Äôm not getting help and i know it‚Äôs selfish but i don‚Äôt care. i should but i don‚Äôt.   to those who read this, i‚Äôm sorry, i love you. reach out to your depressed loved ones and make time for them even if you‚Äôre immensely frustrated with them and hug them. they probably need it.	1643166848.0	scvtir	/r/offmychest/comments/scvtir/wasted_my_life_but_cant_bring_myself_to_go/	wasted my life. but can‚Äôt bring myself to go through with anything.
qgl6p	I fully support him no matter what. We have many close gay friends that he's been around his whole life. I've always normalized being gay.     Since he was about 7yo he'd always hinted that he could be gay or bi. Like someone would say "One day you'll get married to the girl of your dreams.", and he'd respond: "Girl *or* guy!" From time to time he'd ask me how I'd feel if he was gay, and he'd follow it up with saying that he's not but just wondering.  We didn't address it too deeply,  figured we'd let him work through it and time would tell.    Well today he sits me down and tells me has something important and serious to tell me, and he says he's pretty sure he's bi. I asked him why he thought that and he said that for a long time he's "felt romantic feelings toward boys and girls". He said he "knows he likes girls, but knows he likes-likes boys too".    I told him that I'm proud of him for telling me and that I support him 1000%, no matter what. I did tell him not to rush anything, after all he's too young to act on it- whether bi or straight.  I also told him that he should probably only disclose this to trusted friends and family for now - I reminded him about the coming out stories some of our loved ones had shared with us and how coming out can be met with resistance, and that I think he's a little too young to deal with those hardships.  He said he understood and we left it at that.    Then he went to talk to his dad about it.  His dad was very supportive too. Thanked him for telling him,  told him he's his best friend no matter what, but that he shouldn't make a decision just yet. (This was a little yikes for me, but he did his best)  Now my mind is kind of reeling. I'm inclined to believe him, but also hesitant, since I know at that age we're all figuring out our lives. I don't know if I said the wrong things to him - especially the part about keeping it to himself or only telling very trusted friends & family. I always thought if know exactly how to handle this if it happened, but here I am, super unprepared!!	1643166891.0	scvu3p	/r/offmychest/comments/scvu3p/my_9yo_son_came_out_to_me_and_my_husband_and_im/	My 9yo son came out to me and my husband... and I'm kind of lost.
75d64jdt	Some tortured and psychotic individual just tried to open my door where my baby was sitting.    I think he was upset that I didn‚Äôt want to make eye contact after his sign waving.  He wanted my eye contact so he could ask for money,  and I was only going to say no so I just kept looking up at the traffic lights. He shouted something about Miami and began to walk to the right side of my car, I thought he was leaving, but my wife, who was in the middle in the back with the baby to her right, saw this man lean in and tug on the door handle.   I understand he‚Äôs hurting, but that does not excuse his behavior. I thought it best to not engage, since he already left and that‚Äôs all I wanted after that scare.   The neighborhood has a reputation, (Goulds in Miami) but I went to highschool in the area and I never had anything actually happen to me. I had a car in Highschool too, and have driven through there my entire life.  It was next to a new Wal-mart and Wendy‚Äôs, and a couple of shops and the police station are 2 blocks east of there.   I always check that my doors are locked when I see people walking between cars.  Today it paid off, and I went from someone who hears about these awful occurrences to someone whose seen it firsthand.   I also always make sure not to get right up on the car in front of me, and have an ‚Äúescape route‚Äù when driving.  If he had gotten my door open I would have been able to speed off into the crosswalk.   I hope you all remember to lock your doors and stay safe out there.

3odorcs0	I'm a recent college graduate. Lately I've just been greatly struggling with myself. I have days where I am feeling pretty down on myself and depressed at times and I do not know why. Things are not bad per say currently I help manage a hotel (which is a hour from current main home and the city) the hotel is owned by my foreign parents, they are pretty loving and I usually spend 2-3 days out of the week at the hotel assisting my parents while my parents are there all week(they also live on the property). The hotel has been a little difficult for my parents to manage because of the language barrier and technology barrier now since they are older but all in all they still manage, but me being there definitely makes things a lot easier for them. Managing hotels has always been the family business and something they have done for 30 years, while I love being able to help my parents and be there for them, I myself hate managing a hotel but I know my parents need my help for the time being. My parents also pay me decent for my time. Outside of the hotel I do photography which I do in the city, I am currently on a hiatus trying to rebrand my photography business but I have been struggling to find the motivation for it, many days I feel depressed and low and I do not get any work done. I get all in my head. I really want to advance in my career and find a path but I don't know how at times. I feel stuck.  Im also in a loving relationship and she is doing wonderful in her career something I would never say to her because I always support her and want the best for her but I do internally feel jealous at times at the amount of money she is making because its a good bit more than me and how she has a clear pathway for her but besides that I love her very much. I guess I just want to be on a good path like her, I get scared sometimes she will think I am a bum and leave me. I also struggle with also achieving my personal goals like working out, reading more etc.  Many days I have had thoughts of killing myself which sucks because I know I'm in a good position in life and I am still very young. I know my life isn't bad and there a lot of things to feel positive about but everyday when I wake up i think i want to do better. I want to do better in my career and get back to doing photography consistently and not struggling to work, I want to be a better boyfriend and son, I want to do better for myself. I struggle with staying focused and disciplined. So many days i feel lost and I do not know where i am going. I also find myself in the cycle of comparing to others.  Also last thing I am also addicted to porn and masturbation and it is so hard to stop like I have been trying and it is so hard.	1643167284.0	scvyws	/r/offmychest/comments/scvyws/i_just_want_to_better_please_listen/	I just want to better.

hs9orrjz	PS: There's not gonna be a structure for this it's gonna be a rant.  I wanna kill myself. I have strong feelings of suicide and I wanna do it. Every day I act okay and try laughing on or getting busy...few days it's not so easy to hold it in...I snap and I hurt myself...and people's reactions around me makes me want to close myself and makes me regret opening up.  I feel lonely.  The reactions when they see me hurt or depressed aren't negative in any sense...I just want someone to hold me and say it's gonna be okay over and over again. Instead they tell me how sad they'd be if I'm gone and try to emotionally guilt me for feeling like that...I can't take this anymore...maybe the day till I really commit suicide... I'll just say I'm okay...and keep fooling them...I know they're trying to help...I know they don't want me gone...but I don't feel understood. I don't feel okay...I feel lonely...  Maybe it's mostly my fault. I can be clingy when depressed or completely oblivious...and I hate myself for it...cuz I don't want to be alone...maybe it's my fault for expecting someone to be there in the first place...   Every day....I give up a little...I'm getting bolder and bolder...and it's more convincing...I feel like I don't deserve to live. I hate this and I fucking hate the fact that I need to be alive.  Before anyone suggests therapy and try convincing me...I don't wanna go therapy...I don't believe in it and I don't wanna hear it...I'm trying to change my stance on it Ans give it a try...but idk how long it'll take and if even living till then is worth it.	1643167502.0	scw1m6	/r/offmychest/comments/scw1m6/i_just_cant/	I just can't.
iuden4ki	My close friend, Amanda, has been incredibly toxic. Every time we hung out she would call me names, say I was annoying and how others hated me but SHE liked me, and if I ever had anything good to say she would either try to one up it or she would tear me down. Whenever I would mention how she made me feel, Amanda would say I misunderstood or that she never said that. She also would claim that i was the issue and that I shouldn't be so sensitive. Amanda also would intentionally make jokes about my family and mental health.    I've known for awhile I needed to leave, but never felt like I had the ability as I worked closely with her. It would have been very awkward and I didn't want to deal with the backlash at work. We don't work together anymore and  for the first few weeks she still messaged me and tried to get together.

g61layqx	I have a lot of plants in the house, I love plants, they help my anxiety.  I kept a few plants in my room for a while but moved them outside when one of them got a fungal infection.  Recently we brought them back in and my best friend has a plant that is the same breed as one of mine.  I have pictures of the one I raised and watched it grow and flourish every day.  I recently deep cleaned the house and moved about 3 of the plants back to my room.   My friend asked me where one of the plants went.  I told them it's in my room.  They said it was there's.  Now, not only do I know this plant is mine, but I also took a lot of pictures of it during the growth process.  They insisted the smaller, more sickly plant was mine.  She said the bigger plant was theirs because the one they bought was taller.  They said they know it's theirs cause I had said theirs had new growth (it had at one point).  I just decided to let it go and switch plants.  I'm currently nursing the sickly one back to health.  I still feel wronged but I guess I can let it go.  Just wanted to get it off my chest. I still love them and they are very close to my heart so Id never want to say any bad for them but this did hurt a little.	1643167992.0	scw7lt	/r/offmychest/comments/scw7lt/my_best_friend_fussed_at_me_over_a_plant/	My best friend fussed at me over a plant
j12b5kb5	Two years and 6 months ago I got dumped by someone I adored, handsome, talented, funny and I loved him with all my soul and being (Call him J), and while he was out of town I went out with his friends, I was in deep sorrow, because we had been mingling for almost a year, and at that point I knew it was really over. I was so sad and depressedz I dated many dudes, but this dude to me was the thing. I was distroct. Sadly someone else noticed my grief. Out and about with his friends, I got so drunk I blacked out, got taken to one of our friends house, call him "N"...woke up getting raped by his friend, call him "RAPIST PIECE OF SHIT" with N getting that disgusting poc off me. Did not have the courage to go to the cops, because the friend N that was with me was fucking ILLEGAL in the fucking country, and I didn't want him to get fucking deported.  Texted my ex J, sobbing, telling him what just happened  and he told me he didnt know what to do or tell me. Said to call someone else.  I took a bus home and cried in my mom's arms for hours. I was deeply traumatized, quit my job and was about to give up and off myself, but I hanged in there thanks to my mom and my dog. Two months later I see J posted in his fucking facebook a selfie with my rapist. Him and all his friends just delt with it like another thrusday afternoon. They brush it off and kept hanging out with him. Not J or N tried calling me, never checked on me. I could've killed myself. They didn't care. HIM AND ALL HIS FRIENDS NEW I GOT RAPED THAT NIGHT. THEY KNEW I spent a full year cultivating friends that defended the poc that raped me whist I was passed out drunk. Sometimes I feel like coming up with a plan to fuck up their lives real good.  I am in a better place, found a guy who loves me and knows everything. He took me as far away from these mfs. But it hurts. I feel so small and unimportant.  I felt so depressed I wanted to die. J destroyed my life more than his Rapist friend did. Whats most fucked up is they ruined my life but I still feel so attached to this shit in my brain. I cannot bring myslef to hate J. I got really drunk two years ago and showed up at his front yard. Told him all. He blankly stared at me, didn't say a word. Didnt call the cops. Just stared at me, like I was a fucking ghost and he couldn't fucking see me.  I just want to loathe him. I just want to forget. I have cptsd from that shit.

There‚Äôs so many things wrong in this shitty situation. One is physically disabled and the other has severe anxiety. They got let down. Abandoned. I feel stupid for crying over this, but I‚Äôve been personally affected by cheating. My father cheated on my mom and I found that act truly disgusting. I consider him the scum of the earth. I never thought people I considered my friends to do such an act. Why did suddenly, they decided to no longer care for their significant other and throw years of marriage out the window? I‚Äôm just so shocked. I feel terrible for my friends who got hurt from this mess. I can‚Äôt imagine the pain they must feel. I don‚Äôt understand why this is affecting me so much, I‚Äôm not concerned in this situation. Am I selfish for feeling sad? Shit I don‚Äôt know how to think anymore.

3f27xdp8	I don‚Äôt really know what other words to use.  In February of last year I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Any kind of arthritis is a musician‚Äôs worst nightmare. I went for knee pain, but we started talking about how my hands have been feeling‚Ä¶ tired was the only word I could think to use when I‚Äôd play piano. In college I could crank out four hours without blinking, six on weekends in the months leading up to my first concerto performance (only one movement, but THAT left me feeling like a REAL pianist). By February when I was diagnosed, my practice time had slowly decreased to 45 minutes before the pain started. Now, I‚Äôm lucky to get in thirty minutes before my fingers start to go numb.  I saw my doctor today about the numbness. It‚Äôs neuropathy. A complication of arthritis. I‚Äôm trying to digest the fact that even if I successfully find a medication for my joint issues, I will probably never go back to how I used to play, and that is jarring to me. I don‚Äôt recognize my playing anymore. It‚Äôs stilted, and I struggle with passages that used to be easy. I look back on things that were probably warning signs that I didn‚Äôt want to look at because I couldn‚Äôt handle having something else wrong, minor annoyances that now interfere with my day-to-day life. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I put myself in this place.   I normally talk to my mom about these things. But ever since my health became an issue, she‚Äôs changed. I‚Äôm afraid if I tell her that she‚Äôll say I‚Äôm living like an old person and all I want to do is take pills and that I don‚Äôt have the right mindset.  I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôve been playing for twenty-two years. I just want to keep playing.	1643168447.0	scwcxx	/r/offmychest/comments/scwcxx/im_losing_my_ability_to_play_piano/	I‚Äôm losing my ability to play piano.
1sg12ai	I don't really know what to call it, but I'm having a crisis over transitioning life phases. I just finished college after attending for 7 years, and I'm starting my career. I know this should be an exciting time in my life, but Im having panic attacks and mental breakdowns every single day.   In a way, it feels like I'm losing a piece of myself. I know it sounds strange and borderline juvenile, but it's kind of like an "oh shit, I'm actually an adult moment." Life feels strange, unfamiliar, and like I can't control it changing around me. This phase is so new, and I'm honestly terrified. I just feel very uncomfortable and lost. I keep wondering if I'm making the right life choices and if I'll wake up at 40 and loathe life.   I just don't know how to cope. This is so unlike myself. I'm generally extremely focused and driven but now the total opposite. I know this is only temporary but it's pure fucking torture.	1643168499.0	scwdkp	/r/offmychest/comments/scwdkp/having_a_transitional_life_crisis/	Having a transitional life crisis
whqxs	My mother and father divorced after 26-27 years of marriage and it took a few years, in which time we all were fighting and I couldn‚Äôt find a job. (This was 2013-2014) when they finally did divorce I was 18 and my father kicked me out with my mother, leaving me with no place to go.  My mother met a great guy (during trying to get a divorce from my father) who was trying to divorce his wife and they hit it off. I met him and he was honestly a very sweet man. When he heard my father had kicked me out, he let me come live with him and my mom.   During the short time I lived with them, he treated me really well and was the father I never had. My own father never wanted me and hated kids, so needless to say there wasn‚Äôt a lot of attention given to me that wasn‚Äôt already spent at work or on his computer playing various games.   This guy, Bob, was great. But he never divorced his wife and as time went on, my mom and I noticed suspicious behavior from him and suspected he was cheating. We caught him after my mother set up a fake personal profile that he responded to a meet up request with. Despite this, my mother stayed.  I ended up moving to a different state to find work and my mom remained with him and over the years has cried in my shoulder over his behavior; he cheats, keeps secrets, he puts his estranged wife and his previous kids above all of us. It has changed how I look at him as a significant other for my mother, but as a dad he was still.. well, my dad.  Until a few days ago, when he said he would be going out of town on a business trip that happened to fall over his estranged wife‚Äôs birthday. I made a snide comment about it and he responded with telling me to fuck off and said some hurtful things. My mother instantly took his side and wouldn‚Äôt listen to why I even made the snide comment in the first place, citing I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything in anger.  This was last Wednesday and today, things still aren‚Äôt good. Though I don‚Äôt regret what I said, I apologized to Bob. He never read it, I‚Äôm sure he had me on ignore or block and whereas half of me says whatever, the little girl who loved him is heartbroken that after ONE comment I made in hurt after nine years can make him angry enough to effectively disown me. I‚Äôm in disbelief this all went down the way it did.   TL;DR: I made a snide comment to my moms bf who constantly cheats on her but otherwise treats her and I well. This lead to fighting with my mom and I and when I apologized, I realized he never read it because he has ignored or blocked me. I‚Äôm hurt by both their responses.	1643168600.0	scwerk	/r/offmychest/comments/scwerk/i_started_ww3_with_my_family_with_a_snide_comment/	I started WW3 with my family with a snide comment
7wgz0kcv	I'm tired of my city, my family, my house, and my life.  It's not that I don't love any of the above. I do, I think so at least. I just want be anywhere except here! I'm so tired of this. The same room with the same shade of purple I've grown to resent for 9 years. No matter how many times I rearrange the furniture, it goes back to boring and bad within the month.  My city is shitty. High poverty. But I like it. But I Want To LEAVE! 13 years here and I hate it. Nothing but crime and bad memories.  And my family? I feel like I'm getting replaced. I feel like I'm the black sheep when I used to be the golden child. And it's the same little annoyances every day. Whenever I try to sleep someone starts making noise for the next half hour, no consideration. People try to make me uncomfortable, but if I do anything back I'm the bad guy. I'm so tired of this. I just want to live alone so I can do things (QUIETLY!) without the constant feeling of being judged.  I feel like I get thanks or respect. I put the dishes away, unasked? ' Why didn't you do the dirty dishes, too?' I'm exhausted from making cookies, because even standing is physically painful? 'You didn't even do anything, why are you so tired? It's just cookies' (said with a cookie in mouth).   My extended family, on the other hand, places so much pressure on me because everyone else is hopeless that I feel suffocated.  My life is boring. I am busy 12 hours a day, with the same stuff every day. I get >4 hours a day to get ready, eat, relax, do fun things, and basically live. Four days a week. The other three I am recovering from being busy. I'm in pain all the time and my doctor doesn't seem to be in a rush to figure out why, or suggest anything more than Tylenol and exercise.  I just want to leave and start a new life but I know nowhere else. I just want to leave, and maybe I'll be able to look back on this time better in a few years.	1643168605.0	scweta	/r/offmychest/comments/scweta/im_tired_of_my_family_and_my_life/	I'm tired of my family and my life
j0wzne7z	in the end of december I found out I was pregnant, it was a really difficult decision because my boyfriend really wanted me to have and I felt everybody near me wanted me to have it as well. I always thought I would make a fast decision if this ever happened in my life but I wasn't like that. I allowed myself the doubt but chose to do the abortion anyway. it was i painful process, where I live it is not legal but everything went ok. it was hard on the next day, my boyfriend was pretty messed up and started doing drugs again (after years being clean)... I was pretty messed up too and I guess I still am.  the thing is, after a week we started having sex again, first with condoms but after a few days we stop, it was maybe 3 or 4 times without condoms and cuming outside. anyway. I went to the doctor on Monday and she told me I should have got my period already but it ok if I didn't yet... today I started felling lots of cramps and it felt like a good sign, but it looked like the cramps from the beginning of my pregnancy and a white stuff came out of me just like when I got pregnant. I took the test yesterday and it was negative but I didn't felt relief or anything. I'm really worried and super sad. my boyfriend is traveling for work stuff and I don't wanna bother him with maybes and things in my head. I'm scared I have to do the procedure again I have absolutely no money and no mental condition to pass through it again. :(	1643168883.0	scwi4h	/r/offmychest/comments/scwi4h/just_got_an_abortion_and_im_scared_im_pregnant/	just got an abortion and I'm scared I'm pregnant again

iajplrjw	Hi everyone. I just need to vent, so even if nobody reads this, it‚Äôll feel good to finally say it all. (Also this is a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt anyone I know to know this is me lol). So first of all, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD a while back. I struggle a lot with motivating myself to do my every day life. For context, I‚Äôm 18 years old (she/they) and I‚Äôm currently going to college. I actually really enjoy most of my classes because I‚Äôm interested in the subject matter, but at the same time, I have to convince myself to get out of bed and go to class every day. And I‚Äôve been losing that battle more and more lately. As always with new things in my life, I had a surge of energy/motivation during the beginning of my first semester and did awesome. I‚Äôm now at the beginning of my second semester and that‚Äôs all long gone. And I‚Äôve got several more semesters to go. I‚Äôm not failing yet, but I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm headed in that direction if I don‚Äôt figure out a way to get motivated again soon. I also started a new job recently, so it doesn‚Äôt really help that I‚Äôve added that to my schedule, but it‚Äôs obviously necessary because I need money. And I‚Äôm in a fairly new relationship that takes a toll on me sometimes. She also struggles with depression, and she tells me she wants me to keep messaging and reaching out, but then when I do, it feels like it‚Äôs against her will, and I don‚Äôt want that. I really, really like her, and I don‚Äôt want to end things at all, and she says she doesn‚Äôt want that either. I tried talking to her about it, but we didn‚Äôt really get anywhere. I don‚Äôt even know what I want from her, I understand not wanting to talk sometimes and I don‚Äôt want to pressure her, but she keeps telling me it‚Äôs okay and to keep reaching out. But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm the only one trying, you know? My college is having auditions for a musical soon. In high school, I was a massive theatre kid, and knowing I had rehearsal always got me through the days. So I thought maybe I could audition for that and it would help me be more motivated again. But I‚Äôve also never been this busy before, and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd just end up getting burnt out on the musical too. I honestly don‚Äôt even know anymore. I‚Äôm also severely homesick out of nowhere sometimes, but I guess that‚Äôs just a normal ‚Äúnew adult‚Äù thing. I‚Äôve always been extremely close to my family and they are a huge part of me, so I am struggling a bit to find an identity outside of that. I was never the best at making friends, I‚Äôm kinda shy and awkward. This guy from one of my classes invited me to this LGBTQ+ group that meets weekly, but I‚Äôve been either too busy or too nervous to go so far. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt have any kind of resolution for this, this is just kinda my life right now.	1643169322.0	scwn9d	/r/offmychest/comments/scwn9d/stressed_and_depressed/	Stressed and depressed

9zf53v7u	I've been depressed since I was a kid. It's basically natural for me to think like that. Life could be going great at the time, but I would still think about ending it every day.  Now, I'm living the best life I could, despite what happened during the pandemic. I got my GED, I'm going to school, and I have a job that will give me the push I need towards my dream career. On top of that, I'm finally with someone who treats me amazingly. He actually respects me, doesn't yell at me, makes me laugh everyday, and is the most patient person I ever met. He deserves the world. It means even more that I'm high functioning autistic and he treats me like everyone else.  But even then, I think about how I'm better off not existing. I don't want to hurt anyone. Oh, especially not him. I often think about how my parents would react. How heartbroken my cousin would be. All my new friends would wonder why I haven't showed up to school. It hurts me that I have these thoughts.  But life still feels so hard. I want a break or end to everything. It feels easier to cut myself off from everyone until I make a decision. I don't want to have my mind or memories anymore. I don't want to feel different from everyone else. I just want to start anew.	1643169594.0	scwqa8	/r/offmychest/comments/scwqa8/ive_been_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my_partner/	I've been thinking of breaking up with my partner so he doesn't worry about me

j13okhia	Pretty much the title. I've always had a dirty mind, I literally remember thinking up rapey scenarios in my head when i was in elementary school, though i only got into the actual stuff in 6th grade. I fucking hate it. I'm currently in high school and usually gets straight A's, and just hearing my parents and teachers say how good of a student i am just makes me feel worse considering none of them no i have a fucking rape kink. I've literally read real rape stories online, and somehow have gotten turned on by them. In addition to that it's gotten to the point i literally can barely go a day without masturbating, and some of the time i do it twice in one day. As said, I just feel so awful because i know that if any of my friends, or my parents, or my brother found out i feel like they would just be horrified. Again, I'm not saying that my situation is unique or whatever, and I don't mean to imply that my life is bad or anything. I usually go half of the day without thinking about it, but whenever i do think about it, especially during school, i just hate my decisions. It's also made it so I keep staring at girls' breasts which fucking sucks as well. I can only imagine some random girl thinking that I'm some pervert, well i kinda am, after passing me in the hall because i stared at their chest. so yeah. again, i don't really know what the point of this post is, well to get all this shit off of my chest, but i don't mean to give off that im depressed or constantly sad about this, this is just a part of my life that im really ashamed of wish would disappear without a trace. so yeah.	1643169664.0	scwr62	/r/offmychest/comments/scwr62/im_addicted_to_rape_porn_and_i_hate_it/	I'm addicted to rape porn and I hate it

j122sm64	My friends and I would play cards quite often, almost weekly. It was fun, but a number of us also took it very seriously. At one point, we had a new regular player join and he was very good. We noticed that he would be on his phone an awful lot in the middle of hands‚Ä¶ almost pointing it at other players. We thought maybe it was to record our reactions to the cards, our ‚Äòtells‚Äô, or who knows what. We even outright asked him but he denied it. This all sounds so ridiculous writing it out lol, but stick with me.   Me and two other players decided we wanted to try to get him to admit it. Our (brilliant) plan was to do stupid things with the cards/chips to get him to say ‚Äúhey! I saw that! I have it on tape!‚Äù, where we would then say, ‚Äúwe knew it! Why didn‚Äôt you just tell us you were recording in the first place!‚Äù. Now, this is all stupid, but the things we would do would be like, burning an extra card, pulling a chip(s) from the pot, signal other players‚Ä¶ somewhat obviously even. But we had rules. We never did it if one of the other two players weren‚Äôt in the game. If we pulled chips, we had to dump it back plus some in another pot. We didn‚Äôt want to get an edge, just wanted to get this guy to admit he was recording us. Just stupid stuff.  Either way, we did it for a while and nothing ever happened. We eventually stopped when we realized‚Ä¶ hey, we‚Äôre idiots, this guys just a good player. I feel bad I did this, and I don‚Äôt know why I even did it. This was probably about 5 years ago or something. Anyways, I will eventually bring it up to the guy, although I won‚Äôt tell him the other guys that did it with me, that will be up to them to say.   We still play occasionally and I laugh at how stupid I was. And I want to apologize to my friend who was most certainly NOT recording our tells.

I have never experienced a pain like this, and I can‚Äôt fathom a life without this person even though they‚Äôre perfectly fine without me. I feel helpless, alone, broken, desperate to not feel anything anymore. I don‚Äôt want to exist anymore, but I can‚Äôt picture leaving my kids behind and them living without me. I have nothing left in me but I‚Äôm trying so hard not to let my kids down.	1643169934.0	scwuf2	/r/offmychest/comments/scwuf2/i_dont_want_to_exist/	I don‚Äôt want to exist.
19679e07	This just happened a few hours ago. I work as a custodian at a school. I tested positive for Covid-19 despite being asymptomatic and vaccinated. I let my fellow custodians and some other staff at the school know about my situation. The school nurse called me and asked me if I was in close contact (six feet distance) with anyone at work, and I said the names of my fellow custodians, because I'm around them a lot when I'm at work.  Boss is furious at this and calls me up and lays into me about naming my co-workers, particularly one of them specifically who has to quarantine because she is unvaccinated, and apparently he didn't know about the Covid guidelines until this crap happened, where if a person who is unvaccinated is exposed to someone with Covid, they have to quarantine from work for 5 days. So, boss guilt trips me and says that the lone remaining custodian has to do the work of 3 people now. In all of this, he never says it outright, but it's clear he faults me for this happening because of his tone and passive-aggressiveness. Then accuses me of not wearing my mask when I'm around my fellow custodians because of me naming the ones I've been in close contact with, despite me being 100% sure I'm always masked around them. Then also says something like this: "It's shit like this that makes me wanna quit this job and focus on my side business." Well, then fucking quit and do your side business. No one's asking you to stick around.  I was so fucking livid at him that I nearly cried. This isn't the first time that shit like this has happened with him. I was doing what I thought was right: let everyone know what happened with me, and let the nurse know who I was in close contact with. That's. Fucking. It. What the fuck else was I supposed to do? Why would I not name my custodians? What if they got sick because of me not saying anything? Masks aren't 100% effective, which is what he missed during his rant.  I'm a little more calm now, but I seriously just want to run away and never look back. I don't get paid enough to deal with this BS. This feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from.	1643169990.0	scwv4g	/r/offmychest/comments/scwv4g/i_want_to_quit_my_job_i_havent_been_so_stressed/	I want to quit my job, I haven't been so stressed in such a long time, my emotions are all over the place

8mr4913q	He has a ‚Äúthing‚Äù towards another girl. He wanted her to reciprocate. She didn‚Äôt. That hurt his ego. They were always very touchy. I set a boundary and told him not to be that touchy with her. He broke it. He walked around the city arm in arm with her. They shared an icecream at the beach. He went back to her place and didn‚Äôt come home till 11:30pm. At that point he had been with her for almost 6 hours. He claims that nothing happened between the both of them. And that he doesnt like her. If he didn‚Äôt like her? Why did he get bummed out about her not liking him? He blamed all of this on his ‚Äúlove language‚Äù which happens to be physical touch. Why did he feel the need to get that from her when he could‚Äôve gotten it from any of his other friends. He has bestfriends that I‚Äôm 100% comfortable with them having physical affection, but he chose to go to that one girl. He broke the boundary. He broke the promise. He broke my heart. I dont know if im being too dramatic about this. All my friends And his friends agree that he cheated. He agreed too, until one of his friends insisted that its not cheating as long as he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúact on his feelings‚Äù. Now he thinks he‚Äôs a saint and that its completely okay for him to like someone and expect them to like him back, WHILE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP. I get it, attraction towards other people is normal. But he said that ‚Äúshes the type of girl it wouldve happened with‚Äù and that shes ‚Äúhis type ‚Äú. I‚Äôm so lost. I dont know what to do and he keeps pressuring me into make a decision on whether i want to stay or leave.  We‚Äôre long distance, and I‚Äôve suggested it to him countless times before , that if he feels a lack of anything from me, hes free to leave and get it from someone else. Physical affection isn‚Äôt something that i can offer right now. Its out of my hands. He has always said that he didn‚Äôt feel a lack of anything from me.

z2xoqch	Over the weekend I encountered a group of "patriots" protesting masks and vaccines while I was out walking with my son. I crossed the street to avoid them because frankly they are filthy plague rats. At the beginning of January I had to take 8 days off work because of an exposure causing a mandatory shutdown of daycare. Of course tuition was still due per their policy. My 1 year old son tested positive for COVID and was sick for a while but thankfully got better.  I was just finally at a point where I was getting caught up at work on everything I was falling behind on and we just got a other notice that daycare was exposed again. Per their policy tuition is due.  Another 8 days out of work.   There will be no end to this. I'm going to lose my job. Not for missing work because of COVID they will find another reason to fire me.  It's not even upsetting me that much. I can't seem to give a shit about anything these days. I'm behind on credit card bills. Most of the money I make is gone after pay day. My wife never seems to be able to take time off instead it's up to me. I'm the breadwinner and the stay at home dad.    Can't find a PCR test anywhere right now which is required for my son to go back to daycare. Needs to be tested on a Saturday per their five day rule so we will go down to the local walk in clinic at the crack of dawn and wait for hours hoping to get seen.   I can't stop thinking of those idiots protesting the vaccine. Putin and Xi Jinping thank you for your service. It's one thing to not be vaccinated and lie about it but to stand out there with pride waving your Gadsden Flag? Reasonable people are asking you to act like a grown up and you are out there throwing a temper tantrum. Shame! You should be locked up!

For the past 6 months I've only gone once. These job is ruining me. I don't even feel like I am living in a sense anymore, it's like time just goes on and I'm a npc who goes to school, then takes the bus to work after then doesn't get home till 11. I've had to turn down basically every opptunity of my friends asking me to come to the field with them to play because I'm sirpose to do a 8 hour that day. I don't even need the money anymore, I just want to be a teenager again.

9u3715ws	I‚Äôm honestly scared to talk about this, but I‚Äôm at the end of my rope.   Sure, straight people have said to me ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a phase‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just indecisive‚Äù, even that bisexuals are ‚Äúunfaithful‚Äù (the last two of those I‚Äôve heard from the other side as well) but I‚Äôve never faced as much biphobia as I have with other LGBTQ people.   Some see bisexuals as straight people that are just trying to get attention or ‚Äútry on‚Äù a sexuality. Some even think I‚Äôm just ‚Äútrying to be oppressed‚Äù. Others think bisexuals are just transphobic pansexuals, that because we‚Äôre ‚Äúhalf-straight‚Äù we‚Äôre less of a sexual minority or that our stuggles are less valid, and that we‚Äôre ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù for it.  God forbid you‚Äôre cis and have a cis partner of the opposite sex. That‚Äôs just another invitation to be told that you‚Äôre not really bisexual.  I‚Äôm sexually attracted to cis men and cis women. That‚Äôs all there is to it. I shouldn‚Äôt need to defend or explain my sexuality‚Äî I don‚Äôt think non-cis people are lesser, I‚Äôm not more likely to cheat on my partner, and I‚Äôm not indecisive or ‚Äúpretending‚Äù to be anything. If someone told a gay or lesbian person anything like what bisexuals are told by other queer people, everyone would be freaking out and trying to cancel someone. But if it‚Äôs a bisexual person, nobody seems to care.

3wcb1ckb	I‚Äôm a 21 year old guy. I grew up rough and tough, in the south. I have a loving family who cares so much about me, but I‚Äôve been suffering in silence for years now. I hate talking to people about it, because it always ends up feeling like a pity party and I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm making it up. Said simply, I‚Äôve lived for others since I was 16. Lately, I‚Äôve been lower than I‚Äôve ever been, and I just can‚Äôt seem to reach the peak of the mountain I‚Äôve resided at for so long. I grabbed my book, pen and started my goodbyes tonight. One thing I can‚Äôt do is leave my family wondering why, or blaming themselves. Basically, leaving them with nothing. I feel like I want to let it be known that I tried. I truly did. I‚Äôm a coward who‚Äôs held a gun to his head and cried for endless nights and the next day, laughed and put others first because that‚Äôs what I know people need. Someone for them. Even if I don‚Äôt convince myself to do it tonight, I‚Äôll always be looking for the next ‚Äúright time‚Äù. I just wish I had my granny here to hold me, kiss my cheek and tell her baby it‚Äôs okay, that god has a plan. But life isn‚Äôt fairy tales, and I can‚Äôt have that.

l6jmg	First of all, sorry for my english. Not my first language.  Long story short, I (37M) studied a career I never really cared, mostly due to a couple of friends and not really knowing what I wanted to major in. Graduated in 2006 and worked approximately 10 years in several areas. In 2016, my mother died from a horrible disease  after being ill for 4 years, hit me real hard since I was really close to her, and quit my job in 2017. To be honest, apart from the grief and deppresion, I quit because she me left me and my other two siblings a considerable amount of money and felt I could take some time off to decompress from the illness.   5 years have passed and I haven't really done much to find another job. I've managed my money quite well and haven't spent a lot of it, also mostly due to the fact that I still live in my mother's house (my two siblings live in another country). I'm married with no kids but don't know what to do with my life. Part of not trying to look for a job is the fear of feeling old and not having a lot of experience. I dread the job interviews asking me why I have a 5 year gap on my resume and rejecting me because of that, because who would employ a 37 year old who hasn't worked for 5 years?  Sorry, just wanted to see how it felt to type all that since most of my friends and family don't know how I feel.	1643170909.0	scx5g0	/r/offmychest/comments/scx5g0/im_37_and_feel_lost_and_unmotivated_career_wise/	I'm 37 and feel lost and unmotivated career wise.

iajplrjw	Hi everyone. I just need to vent. (Also this is a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt want anyone I know to know this is me). So first of all, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD a while back. I struggle a lot with motivating myself to do my every day life. For context, I‚Äôm 18 years old (she/they) and I‚Äôm currently going to college. I actually really enjoy most of my classes because I‚Äôm interested in the subject matter, but at the same time, I have to convince myself to get out of bed and go to class every day. And I‚Äôve been losing that battle more and more lately. As always with new things in my life (no idea why it‚Äôs always this way but it is), I had a surge of energy/motivation during the beginning of my first semester and did awesome. I‚Äôm now at the beginning of my second semester and that‚Äôs all long gone. And I‚Äôve got several more semesters to go. I‚Äôm not failing yet, but I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm headed in that direction if I don‚Äôt figure out a way to get motivated again soon. I also started a new job recently, so it doesn‚Äôt really help that I‚Äôve added that to my schedule, but it‚Äôs obviously necessary because I need the money. And I‚Äôm in a fairly new relationship that takes a toll on me sometimes. She also struggles with depression, and she tells me she wants me to keep messaging and reaching out, but then when I do, it feels like I‚Äôm pushing her, and I don‚Äôt want that. I really, really like her, and I don‚Äôt want to end things at all, and she says she doesn‚Äôt want that either. I tried talking to her about it, but we didn‚Äôt really get anywhere. I don‚Äôt even know what I want from her, I understand not wanting to talk sometimes and I don‚Äôt want to pressure her, but she keeps telling me it‚Äôs okay and to keep reaching out. But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm the only one trying, you know? And again, I also don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm pushing someone beyond their limit, even if she asks me to keep reaching out. But I also don‚Äôt know what else to do. My college is having auditions for a musical soon. In high school, I was a massive theatre kid, and knowing I had rehearsals always got me through the days. So I thought maybe I could audition for that and it would help me be more motivated again. But I‚Äôve also never been this busy before, and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd just end up getting burnt out on the musical too if I add that to my schedule. I honestly don‚Äôt even know anymore. I‚Äôm also severely homesick out of nowhere sometimes, but I guess that‚Äôs just a normal ‚Äúnew adult‚Äù thing. I‚Äôve always been extremely close to my family and they are a huge part of me, so I am struggling a bit to find an identity outside of that. I was never the best at making friends, I‚Äôm kinda shy and awkward. This guy from one of my classes invited me to this LGBTQ+ group that meets weekly, but I‚Äôve been either too busy or too nervous to go so far. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt have any kind of resolution for this, this is just kinda my life right now. If anyone wants to share advice or just commiserate with me, anything is appreciated honestly.	1643171039.0	scx6ys	/r/offmychest/comments/scx6ys/i_cant_afford_a_therapist/	I can‚Äôt afford a therapist

94eb25so	In the past, I used to fill that void with food. Result? I got overweight.   Finally getting the hold back on the reins of life, I have decided to start dieting before college starts.   That means I no longer have food to fill that void.   And I just realize how uncomfortably painful that void is.   Only when I'm doing my freelancing work or studying, I don't feel that void.   As soon as I succumb to any activity that I feel is useless (Useless: Doesn't make me a better person in the long run) this sensaton of the void is generated. It intensifies with time. Until I have to stop doing that useless activity. (For example Youtube/mindless social media scrolling, games)   Idk if this is good or bad.   I would like to find peace.   Anyhow, this helps guilt/void/useless activity helps steer me in the right direction.   I just feel sad I can't enjoy movies/games as I did in the past.

iwf331dp	 i will never be enough for a girl. most of these girls be already having a boyfriend, stuck on their ex, or already seeing someone. i went out, i approached girls at my retail job, in public. they always said they had a boyfriend, or when they gave me their number‚Äôs they always led me on.  im nobody type, i hate body type(im not fat) i have big thighs and calfs. the outfit i wear dont even look right because my body type. girls like skinny dudes  i will always be someone option, or some last. im not enough to be a main. my personality is funny. i always make ppl laugh, and ppl told me im cool to talk to, or vent to. i will never meet someone who is single. i will always be someone option, never someone priority.  i feel like that ‚Äúfocus on yourself‚Äù shit is bs. my friend have no car,still live with his mom, working shitty job at 27, and he still manage to get girls or a relationship. my other friend introvert, he shy to approach women in public, but he gets all types of girls on instagram. im starting to think its luck. im tired of hearing this pseudo advice.	1643172852.0	scxqwx	/r/offmychest/comments/scxqwx/dating_life_is_over_for_me/	dating life is over for me
ecic7bf8	I have been a codyko fan for about 5 or 6 years and watch the TMG podcast as well as the trillionaire mindset religiously.  Recently I got into a car accident and my car was totaled, leaving me needing a new car. My sister and brother both have mazdas and have said nothing but rave reviews about them, and with the money I had from my car being totaled the mazda3 was within my price range. So, I bought it(same car cody had for years).  Also, I‚Äôm in school and when it came time to choose a major I wanted something with a solid and growing job market and ended up choosing CS. I‚Äôm not sure I even like it but I like the people who study it and figured I want to be a part of that crowd.   I wake up pretty much every morning and turn on Cody and Noel‚Äôs videos because what else is there to watch, and I drive around LA where I live and I‚Äôm just noticing I‚Äôm living Cody‚Äôs old life. It‚Äôs kinda cool but I am starting to feel weird about it.  I know this is stupid but I feel like maybe I‚Äôm subconsciously trying to live his life because i don‚Äôt know what to do with mine? I am very much obsessed with cody and noel and not many people in my life know the extent of this.   It was entirely on accident though! Just feel pretty weird about it. That‚Äôs all.

h52vz	Prefacing this with up until this point, my boss and I were pretty close friends, but nothing more. So for the past month and a half or so, she has been getting flirty and making sexual jokes. It started off being slightly funny, but it got old quickly. So I directly had a conversation with her and told her that it made me uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt look good with her being married. She apologized and seemed genuine. Until about a day or 2 later working with her she started up with them again. So I started walking away when she made any nsfw comments. Didn‚Äôt change anything. I avoided her for almost 2 weeks (which is difficult bc we‚Äôre both in charge of the same department) and told her again that I was uncomfortable with the remarks she was making. Mediocre apology, fell back into it a couple days later. I made a comment to her about ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sign up to be sexually harassed‚Äù she got quiet for a minute, but later in the day continued. I get defeated and just gave up for a few days and let it happen. Until she made a joke saying ‚Äúmaybe then you would get some‚Äù to which I immediately stopped her and told her just how much that comment bothered me. Again, apologized and we had a sincere conversation afterwards so I thought it was taking a turning point for the better. Wrong again. The flirting and sexually comments got really intense, and just a couple days later she made that same comment. I went to go talk to her later but she was on lunch so I just messaged her how much I didn‚Äôt appreciate that comment despite me having a serious conversation with her about it just days prior. All she responded with was ‚Äúsorry‚Äù. I ended up telling her later that we need to keep our relationship on a work only basis. She had the audacity to say she was thinking the same thing! I told her that I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre on the same page, but I felt like the multiple times I‚Äôve given her boundaries, she disrespects me and ignores them. She responds with ‚Äúsorry‚Äù again. I deleted her from social media bc she has my number if she needs it for work.   I‚Äôm honestly furious right now as I look for a different job.	1643173027.0	scxsto	/r/offmychest/comments/scxsto/i25m_finally_told_off_my_married_boss_f25_for/	I(25M) finally told off my married boss (F25) for sexually harassing me (NSFW for S-H)
4ql4zi4q	This morning a guy she gave a blowjob to a month or two before we began seeing each other texted her to hangout and she sent me the text he said and joked that she will just send a pic of me and her if he texts again. Knowing guys, I knew he would text again and told her he would. She asks me what she should reply with and i say its up to you. She lives in a different city and the guy lives there too, we see each other on the weekends. We are students and im spending my day studying and focusing, we already said we love each other, i was her first sexual experience, i appreciate that she feels comfortable bringing this up but theres so many more important things in life than a past fling chasing her again. This evening she told me she got another text from him and wants to know what to do, like i couldnt care less what she says s long as she isnt flirting back and its platonic. If she cheats she could easily hide it because im not there and they talk on snapchat so its not something i think about but the fact that i try to talk to her about things relevant to the relationship and she changes it to what this dude is saying to her is really frustrating and pushing my buttons.

13u8up	I'm in my second semester of graduate school. The first semester was pretty boring but I still participated heavily in class. It was also my first time TAing (teacher assistant) and it went fine. But after coming back home from break I have lost all interest. The first day of class was 3 weeks ago and it was okay. But now it's the 3rd week and I'm so unstimulated. Last semester was too boring/easy. This semester my classes have a lot of PhD students and I feel so lost in comparison to them. My professors are boring. I dread TAing now.  I don't like reading, never have really. I mostly liked going to class and talking with my professors. But I don't have interest for even that anymore. I don't know. Maybe it's the pandemic spiking again, maybe it's seasonal depression, maybe it's cause I'm stressed about money. Maybe I feel scared about feeling behind in my classes. Idk. But I just don't care anymore suddenly.  It's too far into the semester to quit so I'm stuck until May at least. I don't know what I'd do instead. I thought this was my passion. It took me a long time to find my "thing" and just like that it's gone.  I don't know where to go from here.	1643173527.0	scxyee	/r/offmychest/comments/scxyee/suddenly_lost_interest/	Suddenly lost interest
ano58dob	We‚Äôve got Russians believing there‚Äôs American provocation for a war, and we have Americans believing that Russians are provoking a war and rising tensions. Regardless what‚Äôs correct, most Americans I know don‚Äôt want any war to happen and I‚Äôm willing to bet that most Russians would not prefer to fight either. If there was a direct line of communication between the populations of the US and Russia I think we could deescalate this ourselves. Military action only increases tension, politics are futile and both sides are making demands neither can reasonably accept creating deadlock. It‚Äôs time to speak to each other ourselves and explain what we see on the news and explain how we both feel about the ‚Äúlooming war‚Äù. Russia or the United States cannot fight if both civilian populations know neither wants a war, there would be more political pressure to find a COMPROMISE. We can‚Äôt get that message across via news, politics, military, or current social media platforms that are filtered in Russia and the US. Anyone know how to fix this? We‚Äôre in a digital age there has to be a way for us to speak to one another and take matters in our own hands.

9ggpf8t4	TW: mentions of sexual abuse   For background, I am a 23F. I went to the gynecologist because I have been having pelvic plain that was unexplained by urine and blood tests. So they decided to do a Pap smear and pelvic exam. My first time for both. It should also be noted that I‚Äôm not sexually active (never have been) and I was sexually assaulted once which deeply scarred me. So much so that made me scared to use tampons even.   Anyways, I have my own gynecologist and I‚Äôve told her these things so we had developed a plan to start off with a Pap smear and work our way to a pelvic exam using the smallest (child size) for the metal thing. I felt comfortable with this plan since I knew one day I‚Äôd have to get the exam anyways. We had this conversation in May. HOWEVER. I wasn‚Äôt able to do the exam at that time, and given what‚Äôs happened recently, they decided to do all of them now. And my school made me go through the campus doctor instead of my normal one.   So today I got both done. The Pap smear was okay, it didn‚Äôt hurt me and I felt not too scared. But the pelvic exam hurt me so bad I started crying and screaming. It felt like someone was ripping my body and it hurt me badly when they pushed it to the back. I was sobbing and begging the doctor to please stop because it hurt me and I was scared. She didn‚Äôt. Her and the nurse kept saying it didn‚Äôt hurt and that it‚Äôs my fault since my muscles were tense. They hurt me so badly but that that part of me body aches badly now, 12 hours later. I don‚Äôt know if this is normal or not. But it was a terrible experience for me. It was the first time I had that exam and they were not gentle or sympathetic with me. They didn‚Äôt care that I cried or said please stop. I was shaking. I know part of it must be a trauma response because that‚Äôs the first time someone has touched me there since I was sexually assaulted, but it also hurt me physically. Very badly. So much so that I never want to go back there ever again. And now I feel so scared and disgusted by my body. I feel scared of my body. Like they mutilated it. I don‚Äôt know why I have this feeling but I can‚Äôt shake it off. I‚Äôve been crying all day and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. I know I need therapy but I really feel the doctor did not act correctly in this instance.

Knowing I wasn't there a whole year I didn't have lofty expectations, but I had three performance goals that I hit 100% on and everything seems to be going fine.   I was not expecting to get a raise of less than 1%.  A penny more would have made it a whole 1%, so I'm not even sure how they calculated my raise.

guervwcl	I have a problem with crossing other peoples boundaries, and I often don't mean to. One is love, specifically, falling in romantic love with someone that could not date or be friends with me nor did they reciprocate. Another is reaching out to a therapist after they discharged me, asking if they can be my therapist again. Finally, I trauma dump to people.   I have a problem with dumping all of my emotions toward people. Granted, in my defense here, I was going through an extremely difficult time and wanted someone to talk and connect to. All three of these, have cost me these three different people. They have all completely cut me out of their life, and this happened in a relatively short span of time. Some of it hurt far more than others (the person I loved was the real stinger). I feel like the only boundary I know of is don't sexually harass, insult, or stalk people. Besides those boundaries, I have little clue on the rest.	1643173821.0	scy1gz	/r/offmychest/comments/scy1gz/i_suck_at_recognizing_basic_boundaries_in_people/	I suck at recognizing basic boundaries in people.

hqu63mo5	Hi all. Brand new to this site as a user. I've googled some questions here recently and have been brought to this site a couple times reading threads. Seems like I'm not the only one absolutely scared out of my mind about getting older.   I must start this off by saying I do have anxiety, i've had it my whole life. I've never taken medicine for it though. Whether it be we didn't have the money for it growing up or my mom just never wanted me on it, i don't know. But i just grew to deal with it, anxiety attacks and all.   But anyways, next month Feb 21, 2022, I turn 30. I've struggled with it here and there randomly as 2021 went along but it wasn't really anything. Until a couple days ago. I woke up around 4am with a full blown anxiety attack. One i havent had since my first time going to jail when i was 22. Heart racing, slight sweat, hard to breath, mind racing not knowing what to think. It was very weird as it was caused by my mind thinking "youre about to be 30". And a flood of emotions just came over me. I haven't recovered no matter what i try to tell myself. I legitimately feel like turning 30 is a death sentence.  From 19-24 i wasted my life away working in a warehouse. When i finally left i was hell bent on going to college and playing sports as thats what should have happened when i graduated but shitty coaches and not the best parents and that turned into me just needing to survive. So when i was late 24-25 i decided i would start training and somehow play college sports again. I went to football tryouts at 25 and was told multiple times i was too old. Made me even more determined. At 26 I decided to go back to baseball. I went to some tryouts and one in particular i had to lie about my age and say i was 23. Long story short at the tryout i was asked by an NAIA team to go play. I turned it down as i just didn't get the satisfaction from it that i thought i would, I was destroying my shoulder ever time i threw the ball and lying about my age made it feel like it wasnt sincere. Like i only got asked to go play because they thought i was young enough. More long story short after that i trained some more into early 27 but just stopped as i just didn't have the drive anymore. Then covid hit right after 28 and well, that shut it down for good. Now, 29 about to turn 30 i feel i no longer have a purpose or want/care to do anything. I feel i wasted 20-29 with absolutely nothing to show for it. Ever since that anxiety attack the other morning i just feel so down and out. Like 30 is 100. I feel like soon ill be losing more loved ones and animals that i've already had to say goodbye to. Just weird, severely depressed and hopeless. Putting so much pressure on myself since 25 to play sports and not doing it, to now realizing the best i get is taking the basketball class at the local junior college i attend while getting a degree is the best ill ever get.   I feel VERY lost. I just don't understand why all of a sudden this hit me and why its just keeping me down. I don't know if im looking for answers or just looking to vent because the only way to vent is to be a stranger posting online for other strangers to read. I don't know. Maybe if youve felt the same way about getting older, or you have some advice for someone like me maybe itll help.	1643174085.0	scy4bv	/r/offmychest/comments/scy4bv/turning_30_i_feel_like_its_officially_over/	Turning 30...

tagve0l	I‚Äôm sick of trying to be kind.  I go out of my way to be a kind person all the fucking time. I treat everyone, to the best of my ability and sensitively, with kindness. I have been treated like shit my whole life and I made it a point to be kind to people because I *never* want people to feel the way I have felt and was treated by.   But no. Kindness gets me nowhere.  This world loves horrible people. This world would rather give success and praise to people who treat others like garbage than someone who doesn‚Äôt.

I hate being disabled. I hate being sensitive. I hate having mental illnesses that make my life hell. I fucking hate it all. These people don‚Äôt even know.

j04rz4k5	 I don‚Äôt want this post to sound all ‚Äònice girl‚Äô but I do want to speak on my experience.  I have such a difficult time making friends, I‚Äôm very quiet and shy and it takes a lot for me to be vulnerable.   I love to help people when I can, be there for them or support them in anyway and when I look back on my friendships I feel like it‚Äôs the only reason I have friends.   When I start to come out of my shell I think I‚Äôm annoying, I am  neurodivergent and that can leave me expressing myself a lot  and sometimes rambling on and I can sense in those moments that I‚Äôm too much and people don‚Äôt want to be around me. I can say the wrong things. I feel I start to only get close or accepted when I‚Äôm there as support. I feel like I‚Äôm mainly complimented by what I do but not just for who I am.   I feel like this is proven by the fact that when I‚Äôve had moments in my life when things have gone very wrong ( health, family etc ) and I‚Äôm withdrawn, no one reaches out and I‚Äôve lost those friendships as I was the one always checking in and messaging, planning to meet up. It‚Äôs happening again now and I think I‚Äôm about to lose three friends. I‚Äôve lost so many and it‚Äôs starting to hurt. I realise the problem must be me, I see so many people with so many friends but I struggle doing the same. I know I must be too much, my depression and bad health has robbed me of anything interesting I used to be and do. I‚Äôm also in no state to be the best support and now feel very useless as a friend. I‚Äôm just sad about this.

He's never physically abusive but he knows how to hurt me with words.  I'm always on eggshells when I'm with him. Finally I had enough and told him off.  Well... that's probably the end of that since I'm always the one to blame when he treats me like shit.  I know I can't do any better. That was my last chance at any sort of relationship at all. I can't afford to live on my own and the family I'm living with is moving this year.  I'm fat and hideous and worthless.  I think it's time to just check out.

22wlodu8	I can't believe I even have to explain this but I'm on a fb group called Backpacking Mexico. Mexico allows visitors who are unvaccinated as of now but I swear, every other message is from a Dutch person or a Belgian person that's like "I want to visit Mexico and then continue south but I'm not vaccinated and don't want to get the shot what do I do?"  Like...first of all, that's a decision you made, boo. You need to do a border run from Mexico to the US, Belize or Guatemala because they didn't give you enough days but all those countries require a vaccination and you don't have one? That's on you.  I've been in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize since early December and I honestly had no idea how many indigenous people still live in this region. Like holy hell there are so many Mayans and we are so unbelievably lucky they are still around and we can still experience their culture. There's a seriously problematic history of Europeans coming to the new world and killing off entire swaths of indigenous populations with their germs, and it's like these people don't even care. Do they teach about colonialism in Western European schools or is it only Americans that learn this? Like, yes, I understand there are American antivaxxers too that are also doing this but we at least take flack for it and our germs are slightly more similar while Europeans continue this behaviour and no one says shit.  And I'm not even crazy paranoid or anything--like there was a lady yelling about masks at the group I was with when we were literally on top of a windy-ass volcano (how the fuck are you going to get a respiratory virus on a fucking volcano????) and all I could think about was how insane she was--but I feel like this is just being an adult?? If you want to travel and not get a vaccine then go fucking interrailing in your own damn region where you can wear an N95 all damn day and spread your germs to people who already have similar antibodies.	1643174575.0	scy9gw	/r/offmychest/comments/scy9gw/humble_request_if_you_are_unvaccinated_stay_away/	Humble Request: If you are unvaccinated, stay away from Central and South America
bikmeg0k	So, as the title suggests I have been suffering with trauma from my childhood in which is still effecting me. First was my sleep I have been unable to sleep for the past few months now this happens quite frequently as I have reoccuring nightmares in which I'm in the position I was in when I was 10 years old. These nightmeres have been consistent for the past 7 years or so and come in waves so to speak it depends on my mood mostly or what I've been thinking about during that day. The lack of sleep has been making my symptoms worse and making me focus on alot of bad things in my past and I'm afraid as the last time I felt like this I had an major episode In which blinded myself in my right eye. My ability to prevent self destructive behaviour is beginning to fail and I'm afraid as I've reach a point of giving up and I'm not sure what I'll do as my only motivation to stay alive is that I have a twisted sene of blaming everything on myself and therefore living with this is my punishment but even that feble excuse is slipping away from me and now I'm searching for help but can't seem to achieve anything good enough from the health care system and with covid I feel like it'll be a bit too late by the time I'm able to access the correct thing for what I'm going though.

3208e0k2	Hello everyone, I know I my title is a bit general but I didn‚Äôt know how else to express the ‚Äútitle‚Äù of my feelings.  Let me start from the beginning, I am a 23F from Massachusetts in an amazing 6.5 year long relationship with the love of my life. I want to start on a positive note to help me feel better I guess. He (23M) is such an amazing person that has seen me through the hardest points of my life. Those being, expelled from high school, dropping out of college as a Junior (year 4) because I can‚Äôt afford it, my parents divorce and finally my terminal diagnosis of Generalized Joint Hyper-mobility Syndrome Disorder (GJHSD).  I‚Äôve been through a lot of shit, more then close people in my life. I‚Äôve pulled myself up and started again so many times. I‚Äôm honestly so tired and feel like I‚Äôve lived a lifetime in the last 8 years.  To start off in 2014 my family moved cross-country, from Massachusetts to Alaska. Almost the farthest points on the North American continent, 4562 miles to be more precise. It was hard leaving everything and everyone I knew to live in practically a whole new world. I was so depressed and hopeless, I‚Äôll say the lowest point of my life. I actually wanted to die and didn‚Äôt care about anyone or anything. I started failing school, to the point they expelled me, but I‚Äôll be the first to say that I‚Äôm the luckiest unlucky person ever.  I met my boyfriend a month after my expulsion and he has helped me become a much better and happier person. The school let me come back after just a semester off, if I took some college courses in order to re-do my failed classes. After a year and a half of hard work I graduated 6th in my class of 13 (I went to a tiny private school in Alaska but I‚Äôm still proud of not being last in the class).I remember my parents and teachers saying that that past year would be probably some of the hardest things I go through. Boy we‚Äôre they wrong. Every new thing that‚Äôs happened is exponentially harder then the event previous. Fast forward a few months (post graduation in May 2016) and my parents separate. I‚Äôm very lucky to have a good family life. We all have our problems but I know they love me and visa versus. It was hard learning your role models fell out of love. My siblings and I were lucky it wasn‚Äôt messy either. There was no hate or malicious intent from either side. I think I was hit the hardest by the divorce because I moved away for college and was removed from home, but also financially my parents couldn‚Äôt help me with college. Now I‚Äôm a smart girl and work hard but the American college system is not built for people like me. I‚Äôm not a minority, raised by a single parent or lived in the same state I went to college for. Because I wasn‚Äôt emancipated from my parents, their income and residency determine any financial help I get. So my dad had to start paying for 2 households because my mom hadn‚Äôt worked in years. Initially I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need to drop out of school, but there was no way for me to get aid without my parents and I couldn‚Äôt afford school out of pocket. It sucked and I had to leave school with $10,000 in debt. I had to figure out how to be an adult real fast and I did it. I left school the spring of 2018 and worked everyday for the next year and a half and payed it off. I had to move in with my aunt in New Orleans and worked my ass off. I decided March of 2020 to move back to New England and live with my boyfriend. We all know how life has been since then so I won‚Äôt go into detail. I just have been working really. I can‚Äôt go back to school till I‚Äôm 26 so just living life I guess. Now we‚Äôre up to present dayish, I was diagnosed with GJHSD December of 2021. I‚Äôve know for a while that my health has been declining. I have always been active in sports and an outdoorsy person but it‚Äôs been harder for me to do things and I‚Äôm constantly in pain. I‚Äôm not as strong as I was last year let alone 5 years ago. I did swim team and wrestling in high school and I have a hard time picking up a bag of potatoes now. My diagnosis was a relief but also opened a whole new door of worry. My pain and weakness is effecting my work now too and I don‚Äôt know what to do. The American political climate scares me and I don‚Äôt know if I can afford to live. I work in the medical field but I can‚Äôt really move up without a college degree. I want to go on medical leave but I honestly don‚Äôt know how long it will last. The cost of living is crazy on top of rent and a commute to work. I‚Äôve honestly thought about moving to a different country for medical and financial reasons but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good idea. It terrifies me that I could be homeless next year if things continue this way. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice, ideas or kind thoughts because I‚Äôm at such a loss. Thank you in advance ‚ù§Ô∏è	1643175783.0	scym37	/r/offmychest/comments/scym37/im_tired_of_living_and_dont_know_what_to_do/	I‚Äôm tired of living and don‚Äôt know what to do anymore
34shqmng	I started up an account for creative writing a little over two years ago as a fun hobby to do on the side. You could say I'm in a very niche community, but it's one I'm very happy to be a part of. From the beginning, I've had a lot of supportive feedback from fairly big names who've collaborated with me and recommended my stuff to their audience.   Yet I felt they were being too kind to me. I would reread my stuff and catch things I could have done better, plot elements I rushed into that should have been fleshed out. Of course, it's not like we owe each other anything, but I feel compelled to repay their kindness by honing my craft to the fullest.   It's for this reason that I felt I needed to slow down and ensure that whatever I made next was just as good as my friends said it was. I adopted a perfectionist stance, throwing out draft after draft, pushing back deadlines as I sunk into an obsessive state. Because of that, my output has slowed dramatically. I'm practically MIA.   My peers will sometimes reach out and ask how I've been during my inactivity. I tell them I'm fine and that I'm planning to release something soon. It's never a lie, I really do mean it in the moment, but midway through I'll chuck what I have in the bin because it's just not right. My planned date of release will pass in silence and it looks like I've ghosted them.   Now I fear it's impossible for me to write something that will be worth the wait and all I've done is soured relations with those who took interest in me.	1643175945.0	scyns4	/r/offmychest/comments/scyns4/i_feel_like_im_letting_my_peers_down/	I Feel Like I'm Letting My Peers Down
5n7qf	This isn't very long but essentially I'm an alcoholic and have been struggling her probably 6 years. I did recently get help, with a professional and a regular therapist, 7 hours a week. But, during one of my blackout moments, I opened up the 23andMe I had gotten for christmas, read through it really quick and saw something about bodily fluids, remembered having to shit in a cup for a stool sample once and assumed this was the same.    I think what I did but I can't remember, was shit in the toilet and then pick it up jam it in there put the lid on and wash my hands of course. I then at like 2:00 a.m. put it in the package with the stamp and put it in my mailbox. I just remembered this out of nowhere about 2 weeks later. I feel so bad....

7poldx2e	I used to be friends with this girl, it‚Äôs crazy to think we met nearly 7 years ago but it‚Äôs true. For about a good 3-3 1/2 years we were best friends we did outside of school club together and had a big friend group due to it. Eventually shows started getting harder to do one after the other, some of us had big age differences and moved onto college, or were already upperclassman in high school, the friend group started getting smaller until eventually it was just 4 or 5 of us who were around the same age. We all were great friends and I‚Äôll admit some of us had crushes and little middle school, young type of drama happening. Eventually, we just started to disconnect I guess it only makes sense, but I still deep down thought we were still at heart deeply connected with each other. I‚Äôve switched a lot of high schools recently and after coming to this new school I found out some people I knew including this one girl in particular would be there. I even debated not going just because I thought it might be weird. Today I saw her, I didn‚Äôt want to seem like I was ignoring her so I called out to her. Maybe she didn‚Äôt recognize me, maybe I half expected us to go back to being friends again because I truly miss our friendship. Maybe she just was busy and I wasn‚Äôt taking any social cues. But seeing someone who for so long you thought you would know you‚Äôre entire life brush you off like you were some stranger just hurts harder than most things. I hold no resentment though, she doesn‚Äôt owe anything to me, but it would have just been nice to feel remembered.	1643176109.0	scypc8	/r/offmychest/comments/scypc8/kind_of_forgotten/	Kind of Forgotten
dib2mxjm	My mother never ever apologizes. She's never wrong. I believe that this is a major factor why her and I never had a smooth relationship.   When I was a child her and my father would sometimes argue and I know how it goes down to it's my father's fault and not hers. Even if it's the other way around. In her stories she's my grandfather's favorite because of how well behaved and how's she's not like any other kid. She also always tell me stories about how her teachers when she was young dote unto her because she's smart and mature unlike other kids. And it's the same thing with her past bosses and employers. They liked her and didn't want to let her go because no one ever does their job like her. She's simply the best, always right, and can do no wrong.  She's currently living with me. She's helping me out with my newborn baby. I was on baby duty while she's making lunch earlier and she accidentally spilled panko on to the floor. I've put my baby down to clean it up. As I was sweeping it up my mother was going on a tirade how it's my fault that she spilled it. Her argument is that if only I used it all up on the dish I made the other day then she didn't have anything to spill. I was tired and responded sharply that it wasn't my fault. I didn't accuse her I just made it clear I didn't do anything. She kept on pushing that it's my fault. I was tired. I was having none of it and told her to learn to have some accountability just for once. Then she took offense and started crying saying, I can go on ahead and blame everything that's wrong in my house to her so I can feel good about myself. She didn't stop her pity party for a good while. Her crying agitated my baby and made him cry too.  So I was there hushing my baby down while listening to my mother rub it on me how ungrateful I was that she's there for me to help and how I had the audacity to talk back.  I was looking at my child and thinking, I don't want to be like this woman. I don't want my baby and I to have the same dynamic as me and my mother.	1643176595.0	scyu6i	/r/offmychest/comments/scyu6i/i_27_dont_want_to_be_like_my_mother_70/	I (27) don't want to be like my mother (70).
8llhgx4s	A clients friend reached out to me stating he could not take care for his dog anymore and he knows I‚Äôm great with animals so asked if I could do anything. I was going to ask around so I asked for pictures of him, he was so rough looking I was in tears. I told him I would foster him and rehome him to his forever home. He said he‚Äôd give him to me for $800 and I broke the bank that day to go save this poor dog. Long story short, he‚Äôs been with me for 4 months now, I nursed him back to health, he is literally the sweetest and goofiest dog I know. He‚Äôs a one year old Exotic Bully to put the image in your head of his big buns getting the zoomies and rearranging my furniture lol. I love him so much but can‚Äôt keep him, I already have three dogs. My husband has had enough of having four dogs in the house and us (me) putting out even more money with having kids as well. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt surrender him, I feel like it‚Äôs my job to keep him safe and see this through. He‚Äôs had a hard life and I want him to be spoiled and loved as much as I have while he‚Äôs been in my care.

6im79vq1	 Alright here it goes. I‚Äôm 35 years old. In my teens and 20s I was heavy into addiction.. diagnosed bi polar.. had a hard time with life.. but I got a lot better. I developed relationships.. I bought a house.. went back to school.. recently I‚Äôm just finishing a degree. I do have a lot going for me in many aspects of my life.   But my relationships have suffered over the years. Been single for 3 years at this point. I don‚Äôt blame my ex for leaving me.. at times I can be difficult to be around. My brother died 5 years ago and that set me back with mental health. So yeah I became single just before the pandemic hit. And yeah I‚Äôve been isolated more and more since then.  What I find happens to me in recent years especially is that when I notice that someone in my life has bad intentions or they do something I consider a transgression on me.. sometimes I really overreact. I end up causing the person to get defensive and I lay it all out. Usually I end up banishing the person from my life. I also end up feeling bad about it.. then I play the events over and over in my head and it‚Äôs like a circle that comes around to the point that yeah this person is actually an asshole and it‚Äôs good that they are not in your life now but you didn‚Äôt have to tell them every thought you had about them and make a big scene about it.. why am I not smarter about these confrontations. Why can‚Äùt I be the bigger person and just make sure that I don‚Äôt put myself in a position where I depend on them in the future‚Ä¶  Cause that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed about this life.. when someone gets a chance to fuck you over.. if it‚Äôs to their benefit.. yeah a lot of people will take that opportunity.. and they don‚Äôt feel bad after.. if you confront those people with anger and hostility.. they thrive on it.. they know it‚Äôs getting under your skin‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a huge energy drain and basically I give them even more information about my vulnerabilities.  I might be a bit of a jerk sometimes.. but I would never fuck someone over.. I would never do something that harms someone for my benefit. At least not knowingly.  It happened to me again this month. I was working for a guy, racked up 4 grand in hours.. now he is avoiding me and trying not to pay me‚Ä¶ so I should be thinking about resolving it in the civil courts‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm upset but like it‚Äôs not the end of the world‚Ä¶   What do I do instead? I end up freaking out‚Ä¶ making a big scene .. lose my temper‚Ä¶ and you know what.. I‚Äôm still not getting paid.. buddy is not shook at all.. basically just wasting my energy‚Ä¶  I wish I could play my cards closer to the vest.. When someone shows you their true colours, that‚Äôs valuable information.. I should not be letting the anger direct my behaviour.. especially if I‚Äôm in the right. But once I run my mouth‚Ä¶ I just feel wrong.  Also, pretty much guarantee the matter will not be resolved and one of these days it‚Äôs going to escalate too far. Thinking about getting some therapy.

8tmjxfaw	This is going to be pretty long I‚Äôm going to rant because this is my last resort. I‚Äôm 25M, had a regular childhood nothing fancy, was never hungry, never abused, never beaten, was showed love from my mom, my dad was older and just kinda gave me money as love, but we are still pretty close today. From the age of 17-22 I was a complete gaming addict, I‚Äôd game for 14-16 hours, eat, sleep repeat. No exaggeration. Eventually burned out from it and stopped playing them as much, now I‚Äôd play like an hour or two like 3 times a week. At this point I knew nothing about life, wasn‚Äôt taught about anything to do with life, never learned about money, the brain, what to do in a fight (never been in one) never went through any struggle literally what so ever. I get to age 25, at this point I was always using my phone but never really thought anything of it until pretty recently. The whole year of 2021, I was in my bed on my phone, I‚Äôd average 85-90 hour weeks on my phone. Seeing the hours doesn‚Äôt even disgust me at this point. I can‚Äôt stop staring at my screen. I can‚Äôt get out of my bed some days. I get so much motivation to change and I always think this is the time but it never is and I always fall back to my old habits. I guess now is the time to add I‚Äôve been smoking weed regularly since 2017 as well. When I smoke, I think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need this anymore I can live without it this is my last joint‚Äù then the next day my brain convinces me that I need it to survive. I have no control over my brain and I feel completely trapped inside of my body. I feel as if a rope is pulling me away from moving forward, I feel completely helpless I‚Äôve tried so many things. Whatever my brain needs or wants to do it happens because I don‚Äôt know how to fight the feeling or urge. I‚Äôm so lost and I want to live my life and see the world but I‚Äôm literally trapped. Had a very good day today got alot of reading done and was supposed to go to the gym but instead I‚Äôve been on YouTube for 4 hours.

5t5ja73f	Sometimes I wonder if you still think about that period in our lives. I know I do.   I was content with my routine. The dependable. The mundane. The uncomplicated. But then you exploded into my life.   And, suddenly, everything changed.   You were outgoing, intelligent, and beautiful. And you liked *me*. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Didn't know how to react. Didn't know how to navigate those waters.  Romance was foreign to me.  But you, burning white-hot through my insecurities and distrust with your openness and smile, held my hand. You insisted upon it.   Your hand felt different than I had anticipated. It was unexpectedly warm. Unexpectedly caring. Unexpectedly safe.  Through my hand, your warmth ignited emotions I didn't know I had.   Everything was better when you held my hand. I didn't feel as tired. I didn't feel as scared. I didn't feel as alone.   I was happy. Truly happy, in a way I hadn't experienced for years. I had been resigned before, but, with your hand in mine, I became content.  My emotions grew. At first, just a whisper. Then, a trickle of affection. A gurgling stream. Inevitably, raging whitewater.  And yet, it was not love that I felt. Love is choice. A series of actions based upon affection. Based upon respect. Based upon and trust.   Your name was gradually becoming synonymous with those emotions, but the truth of you was complicated. I faltered and did not choose to love you. Choose to tell you how I felt. Choose to explore the possible. Choose to be honest.  Eventually, you withdrew your hand from mine.   And as you withdrew, I was plunged back into the enveloping darkness of emotional isolation. The shock and pain of the night chill on my hand, now so accustomed to your warmth, took my breath away.  After basking in your warmth, after feeling romantic connection for the first time in my life, I could not return to my old habits. My dependable routine. My mundane routine. My uncomplicated routine.  I tried, but the specter of desolation crept closer by the day.   Now, years later, it is my frequent companion. Reminding me, in the quiet moments when the world grows quiet, of the warmth I once felt. Refreshing, in the moonlit moments before I slip into dreams, the keenness of the ice I now feel upon my skin.  I see you, happy with your partner, and I know I will never unburden this load. The moment for that has passed. Time, though, will ease this weight. I know because it already has.  I still think of you fondly. You will forever hold a revered position in my memories. For showing me what I was missing. For showing me a different world. For showing me warmth.  But I can now recognize our differences. See that we couldn't have lasted. Couldn‚Äôt have existed together in nature. Couldn‚Äôt remain stably bonded.   I understand, now; one of us would have been unhappy.  And yet, I still sometimes wonder. Do you ever think about that time in our lives? I know I do.	1643177348.0	scz23y	/r/offmychest/comments/scz23y/shades_of_the_past/	Shades of The Past
rjznv	just feeling down and want to vent this out, I hope this is the right subreddit   It was my birthday yesterday, i got 2 happy birthday. I don‚Äôt celebrate my birthday so I normally don‚Äôt care. I guess I was hanging out with my entire mom side all day and felt bad nobody remembers including my parents .   I don‚Äôt really have a reason to be sad. I have a loving family, a good paying easy job lined up. I never really struggled in life.. my parents supported me and I pick things up easily.. I feel bad that I want to disappear and give up when others are struggling more than me.   I guess I been feeling isolated. I haven‚Äôt had a social life for last couple yesrs. I just got out of a job where I worked 14 hours on rotating shift work so I did nothing but work, lift my weights , and sleep. I finally quit , moved back with my parents , and started traveling  when I can . I planned to having  bigger plans but I‚Äôve done nothing. I only been helping  with family busines. I am now responsible for taking care of my grandma so I‚Äôm scared to get Covid and give it to her.. so I only  lift weights when nobody is there or stay home or work in the back .   I look around to all my old friends and see everybody having move forward while I feel trapped and the same little insecure kid. I thought I got over some of  my insecurity  (mostly height) but it‚Äôs been worse seeing everybody settling down. Getting told by my family it‚Äôs time for me to find a nice lady, but I haven‚Äôt dated for years or had sex for years.   I wish I could disappear but I‚Äôm scared to make my parents sad ‚Ä¶  I just want to start my next job and drown myself in being busy so I don‚Äôt have time to think..  reading this sounds whiny but oh well ..	1643177644.0	scz54p	/r/offmychest/comments/scz54p/just_feeling_down/	just feeling down

teo2l	My sibling and I used to be very close growing up. They are younger than me by about 10 yrs, but when we were kids, I want to say that they kind of looked up to me. In the sense that wherever I went, they followed me, always wanted me  to play with them, always watched the shows I watched, wanted to do the same things I was doing, etc. Then of course as we got older, they started developing their own style, personality, etc., and we diverged in terms of our interests and such, but we were still close. At family gatherings, we were always sitting together, sharing private jokes and quips. We were a hilarious duo. We also went on trips together. I was with them when they rode an airplane for the first time. We've also bonded over trauma we both experienced from our parents growing up. In a sort of "we're in this together" kind of way.   But for a really long time, I've felt like my sibling fell into a habit of mistreating me. It felt like they started to criticize my actions; question or nitpick my decisions; often I would be wrong about something somehow; and sometimes (although somewhat rare), they'd order me around like I was a servant. It often seemed like I annoyed them. At least it all felt that way to me. It felt like that enough that I started feeling like my self esteem was starting to falter whenever I was around them. But I kept telling myself "It's just me," "I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill," "I did something to cause them to respond to me that way," "It's not an issue unless I make it an issue," "They're young, it's just a phase, they'll grow out of it."  But I told myself those things for over a decade, and only two things resulted from it. Now, as time has gone on and the treatment has continued, I feel like I have eroded. I feel like my confidence has completely plummeted. Now, I don't trust myself to ever be correct about anything. I assume by default that I must be wrong. No matter what, I can't possibly be right. Whether it's about making a decision, having read or seen something, having an opinion about anything. It must be wrong. I don't trust myself to make decisions. Whenever there is another person around, especially if it's my sibling, I automatically defer to them to make the call, because I assume whatever decision I make will be wrong. Because I always am. My sibling always finds some reason as to why I'm wrong or I've done something wrong. I feel like it's damaged me, because it's been like this for over ten years. I feel worn out.   The other thing is that it didn't go away. They didn't grow out of it. It all seems to have gotten worse. Now, when I think about visiting with them, I don't look forward to it. Because I know that at some point, I'm going to do something that annoys them. Or I'm going to do something wrong or say something the wrong way. Now more recently it seems like there's an underlying hostility between us. They always disagree with me (because I'm always wrong). They told me that they think I victimize myself, but I don't think that's the case, because they are the only person that makes me feel shitty when I'm around them. I don't feel like this when I'm around my friends. I don't feel like this when I'm around my coworkers, or any other kind of people. It's only them. When I'm around my sibling, I feel stupid, inadequate, incompetent, unreliable, like I'm an irritating burden. I have lately started to wonder if my sibling just doesn't like me. If they're only tolerating me when I'm around. I sometimes wonder if they might even low-key hate me.   What makes it all the more complicated is that the have a lot of trauma and mental illness that they struggle with. Emotional deregulation is one of them, for example, so they're often angry and stressed and anxious. It seems like they're angry by default all the time. They are very aware that their behavior is upsetting to people, and they've been trying to work on improving that behavior for the past two years, now (they've only just recently been able to start therapy). So I see them trying to improve. They do make efforts to adjust their behavior. But for me, I feel like I've been enduring this mistreatment for too many years. I'm tired, emotionally. The last time I visited with them it was for just a couple of days, they were very stressed out about a lot of things, so every time we were together one-on-one, they were always angry or stressing out about something. As I was leaving for home, I kept thinking to myself "thank god it's over," meaning my visit with them. I've been feeling worn out since having gotten back home.    I have a therapist of my own, and I intend to discuss these things with her during our next session, but that isn't until this weekend. In the meantime, I've just been keeping this all to myself. I cannot tell my parents or any of our family. Because I don't want to start turning our family against my sibling. I can't even really say for sure if my sibling really is mistreating me or if I really am victimizing myself. So although my parents want to know how great my trip was with my sibling, I can't tell them that I came back feeling pretty bad about it. I don't really want to bring it up with any of my friends, either. I'm pretty close with my friends, but we're not close enough to share heavy topics like that unprompted. Even if I told them all these things, I think they would just awkwardly not know how to respond.   I do know that eventually I'll be able to tell my friends what's up. The next time we're all having casual conversations, I can let them know that things have just gotten rocky between me and my sibling over time and that it's generally been upsetting to me. And I'll be able to talk about it with my therapist this weekend. But in the meantime, I'm just sitting with my thoughts about all this. Questioning over and over if my sibling really is mistreating me like I think or if I'm exaggerating or seeing behavior there that isn't really there. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. But this treatment feels like it's been going on consistently for a very long time. Or at least, I've felt like this consistently for a very long time.   I also have tried to bring these feelings up in snippets here and there throughout the years. One of the major reasons why I have refrained from really spelling out how I feel is because my sibling already knows that their behavior upsets people and that they are "hard to be around." It seems like their behavior gets criticized by other people often, and they're trying hard to fix things. But I'm afraid that if I tell them "by the way, your behavior harms me, too," then that'll be like another straw just to break the camel's back. I don't want to end up being a reason that they end up self destructing out of guilt or anything like that.	1643177874.0	scz7fm	/r/offmychest/comments/scz7fm/i_think_my_sibling_mistreats_me/	I think my sibling mistreats me.
4mje9ujn	A friend of my (20F) SO (24M) recently coerced me into sex, and I assumed accountability for not saying a hard no  (again) and consenting under pressure. One of his friends initially said he would be down to hang out sometime and hear me out, I was looking for support from my boyfriend‚Äôs friends more than mine as they knew the person involved and had spoken of some of his bad character before. The person who coerced me had also convinced me months before that my friend lied about him sexually assaulting her and I cut her off. To keep a long story short, my boyfriend‚Äôs friends didn‚Äôt talk to me or provide support and ended up blocking me, claiming I was trying to get on their side when I had always been friendly or tried to be their friends as I thought they were interesting and sincere people to keep around. My boyfriend forgives me and knows that consent isn‚Äôt really consent under pressure, that his friends are a part of the problem and that they say they won‚Äôt ‚Äúpick sides‚Äù but they went and told the person who subjected me to this about what I‚Äôve said and picked his side. I never want to speak up again, I never should‚Äôve told my boyfriend or assumed that it was cheating when this guy had consistently felt me up during a movie without my permission, watched my drink alcohol with my first small meal of the day and talk about it, and more. They are drawing the conclusion I‚Äôm manipulative but I didn‚Äôt get to explain myself, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre naive and think they know everything or if they heard something convincing from this guy who has done similar with my old friend and lied to me about it happening (which his best friend confirmed to me). My head is spinning, I don‚Äôt want to prove I‚Äôm not manipulative to anyone because I think that is manipulative, and I never want to open up again. I miss his friends and don‚Äôt know why this pain is so sharp to me since I know what happened and I have him, if my SO has my back why am I so depressed? I told him he should repair and work on his relationship with these people if he‚Äôs interested because they seem genuinely worried about him, but as for me, they are part of a massive problem for especially women. I will never be speaking up if I‚Äôm violated again just to cause a world of pain. I told him I was coerced two days after it happened right as I told him everything, assumed responsibility, I just don‚Äôt know what else to do and I‚Äôm tired of living to explain myself. I‚Äôm good to my SO and that‚Äôs what matters, no love bombing, nothing manipulative happens I just want to help myself and also take myself out and not get therapy all at once because I‚Äôm so mentally drained.

8pvsmitv	I broke up with my boyfriend this morning. We live together and we‚Äôve been isolating because I have covid. We‚Äôve been dating for over 2 years but most of that time I‚Äôve felt extremely depressed. I feel like I hate myself and I hate my life. There are a lot of things he does that make me really annoyed or hurt, but ultimately I think I‚Äôve been wanting to break up for a while because I don‚Äôt think I can be in a serious relationship when I don‚Äôt even love myself.   Due to all of this, I‚Äôm going to have to move back home with my parents. I just graduated from college and this was not the future that I wanted for myself. I‚Äôm just feeling so low right now. I feel so hurt and sad even though I‚Äôm the one who decided to break up with him and he begged me not to. It makes me feel incredibly guilty.

5hf65xyz	I‚Äôm 18 and queer and I‚Äôve finally peaked in terms of my looks. Sure I‚Äôve still got certain things to fix but for now this is good enough‚Ä¶. Unless it‚Äôs not. Most of the time I‚Äôm on lgbtq or lesbian tiktok. Lots of couples post on there. I especially feel discouraged when both individuals are super attractive. Most of the time the girls I want to look like have short hair with bangs, a good body, the right facial structure to make them look old enough and nice clothes.  I‚Äôll be in a nice mood and see a couples tiktok video and just sink. I‚Äôll spend all night crying in bed and hugging my pillow like it‚Äôs a person. The days are full of confidence and the nights are not. Yesterday I sat in the mirror crying and holding a pair of scissors to my hair to cut bangs but knowing that I‚Äôd look like Dora with an extreme baby face. My forehead isn‚Äôt the right shape for them. I have a nice nose, it could be a little pointier. My eyes are fine but not the kind that you could put winged eyeliner on and look sexy. My lips are almost immaculate. I have freckles and I draw my eyebrows in a way that makes me look lest soft (more straight instead of arched). I know that I probably have an eating disorder because I fast till a certain time (besides loads of coffee), eat very little and lift weights. All I can think is ‚ÄúI wish my chest was smaller. I want a smaller waist and a butt. Not a huge one but a naturally beautiful one. My legs are so fat no matter how many leg presses and lunges I do. My arms are horrible. I can‚Äôt imagine what my first time doing the deed will be like. My future partner will probably walk right out because I‚Äôm hideous. I won‚Äôt even have a partner! Silly stupid me!i may have a great personality but man is my body horrible. To touch. To look at. To live in. Tomorrow I won‚Äôt eat as much and get 10,000 steps in. Live barely laugh at my shitty body and die unloved and as a virgin.‚Äù Then I‚Äôll cry more and listen to sad music to help me cry even harder. Doctors tell me to grow a pair and to ‚Äúlove yourself‚Äù and I do sometimes but not when I‚Äôm in front of the mirror alone. I self harmed a few days ago but I. Don‚Äôt want to die. I‚Äôm actually terrified of death and I hate talking about it. Writing this right now is giving me anxiety.if I looked like her I would have a partner. I would‚Äôve never been physically assaulted if I hadn‚Äôt given my heart to some asshole after a day. I ruin d my own life for looking this way. I deleted tiktok but I feel so alone.

2ngaxbra	A few years ago I used to be extremely cynical, angry, and suicidal. I was just a shitty person to be around which I only realized years later. I had lots of problems back then but I chose to blame everyone but myself instead of trying to fix them.   Nowadays I‚Äôm doing a lot better. I‚Äôve made peace with all the shitty things I did and I‚Äôve been working on myself a lot lately. I don‚Äôt want to write a whole novel about my life but I can finally say that I‚Äôm happy with it.   I‚Äôve noticed recently though that friends and family are angry or jealous of me? Maybe annoyed? I can‚Äôt pinpoint what it is but it‚Äôs some sort of negative feelings towards me. I‚Äôm not going around being smug or bragging about how happy I am either, at least I don‚Äôt think I am. I‚Äôm just trying to enjoy life but I guess that‚Äôs making my family and friends angry.   Would they rather me be an angry, depressed asshole like I used to be? Do they think I‚Äôm faking it? I don‚Äôt get it. I hope they get over whatever it is though.

3x9g8s0u	Its complicated, in hindsight it was a mistake I entered into a relationship with someone whom i met as a friend. They themselves were going through stuff with their IRL boyfriend, and somehow we ended up bonding extremely closely. We shared so many of the same thoughts, and we fell hard for each other. He and I spent so much time together, and one early morning we had to have a talk about how we were feeling. lots of drama and crying later we decided to get together in a poly relationship.  Fast forward many months, and the relationship is already showing signs of falling apart after things got rough with me. I had gotten kicked out of my biological parents house after many many months of build up and shouting matches, and around the same time I ran out of anti depressants for a good few weeks. Needless to say, i barely had any energy. This prompted my ex to just lose faith, and start getting attention from another group of people. by the time I got my head back on straight, he was already mixed up with friends he could do lewd shit with, and I figured I was allowed to do the same, being poly. But a few months of my ex lying to me about what he was feeling later, we had an ugly breakup.  I cant stop obsessing over my ex. My ex still wants to keep me around, but only barely. My head keeps spinning and my emotions keep racing, and I dont know what the fuck im supposed to feel or be doing. I'm starting to feel the urge to fuck with his life and be cruel to him now.   I've never been a mentally healthy person, but what really fucks with me is my love being wasted by people who decided for me that they didn't deserve it, and my heart has been in fucking chaos ever since. I dont have the energy to spend time with my other partners who love me so much, and unconditionally at that, and they're starting to notice. I dont think i can continue to be with them. I want to break up with everyone because I just feel like im getting mentally sick again. I dream about my ex, I have fantasies and nightmares about my ex, and worst of all my ex doesn't even seem to know what they want from my presence any more. apparently they just "want to be there for me and be around me."  i want to fucking hurt them, hate them, ruin their relationships in all the ways I know how, just be cruel to them. But i also cant stop dreaming about them, i cant go a day without my head turning into a fucking hurricane over them, I cant stop missing them.  I hate everything that's happened, and I hate how much of my love was thrown in the trash.	1643178637.0	sczetc	/r/offmychest/comments/sczetc/im_poly_and_a_pretty_messy_breakup_with_an_ex_has/	I'm poly, and a pretty messy breakup with an ex has me feeling extremely drained and unable to be there for my other partners
h0qzthlo	I feel as though my unobservable health levels are depleted. Even though physically I am probably at my healthiest I've been in my life, I still chain smoke and drink regularly in order to feel some type of stimulus. I coast through my life, one that has come to feel strange and foreign. Im not sure if it's some sort of phase I'm going through or just the new normal for me, it feels different than ones of past. I have had these feelings in some form or fashion throughout my life, having struggled with depressive and manic periods.   I essentially willpowered my way through every instance.I am somehow exactly where I wanted to be in life, but it feels nothing like how I expected it to. I can't tell if it's because of the route that was taken to get here or in relation to me ignoring my mental health for so long. If I were to guess it would be because of the lows that came with having my life now, as they have reached depths much deeper in relation to the peaks of the good.   The worst part about how I have been feeling lately is that I am so self aware of my issues and what caused what, that I turn into some obsessed internally lost shell of myself. When left to my own devices I spiral into my own insecurities and compulsions, I get so fixated on things that I will take whatever actions needed to further the path I get stuck on. It is really worrysome, and has been something I have taken to extremes in the past.   I could write a book about how messed up I am, it would be a novel of decent length too. On one hand I am thankful for the ability to recognize what is wrong with me, on the other it makes me feel so weak as I can acknowledge my deficiencies yet do nothing to change them at times. If I could go a year being ignorant and oblivious to myseit would be a welcome vacation. It must feel so lax to be able to just go about your day being a mess, while not stewing in every small detail of failure that is occurring in your life that you blame on yourself.   Ignorance is a branch of stoicism. As it is the aspect that allows you to lessen the impact of negativity displayed in others. When used on things you can control it would be something that is unbefitting of the virtue the thinking asprires to achieve. I'm mentioning this because I tried to adopt a more stoic mentality in regards to aspects of my past and it served me well. While doing so now has yet to yeild the same result. Might be due to my lack of follow through on the mentality or maybe it is just not applicable to my current life.	1643178652.0	sczeyn	/r/offmychest/comments/sczeyn/i_feel_emotionally_and_mentally_exhausted/	I feel emotionally and mentally exhausted

itlp0yxj	Im M23.  I have a family that cares about me but I honestly don't think I have ever cared about anyone.  The only way I can describe what I feel towards other people is "cold or nothingness".    I've always wondered why I am this way.  I have no trauma or unfortunate backstory so I am otherwise fortunate.  My genetics are very poor but then again I could have been born with a serious disability so I should only feel thankful when I look at myself in the mirror.  I've never had friends and will never have a romantic relationship for the aforementioned genetic reasons.  Despite this I don't feel sad or regretful.  Again, I feel nothing.  Is this what I'm destined to be?  To live a life where no-one knows I exist?    Not depressed just wanted to get opinions of you normal people.

djno5oeg	So this girl went to a posh dance club that‚Äôs very popular here on Saturday. She met a guy there (it‚Äôs not known if they‚Äôd met through a dating app or they actually met there although it‚Äôs not important) and she eventually went to his house two blocks away to have sex with him.  When she was there with the guy, 3 other dudes appeared and they all raped her and hurt her. She obviously went to the police and reported the crime, and she got forensic medical attention to prove it (semen samples from inside of her and all). We live in a very small country, in a small city (even though is the capital). I say this for context. Now we, most of the country‚Äôs women are outraged because the media and a LOT of people are victim blaming. The media headlines are somewhere in the line of ‚Äúshe claims having been raped after leaving to a STRANGER‚ÄôS house‚Äù. First: they‚Äôre not claims, they‚Äôve been proven, so the ~allegedly ~ should not apply here, but it does because.. you know, she‚Äôs a woman... Second of all, the fact that she left to a stranger‚Äôs house should not be in the headlines, it‚Äôs clearly centering the attention to that fact and not the fact that SHE WAS RAPED BY 4 DUDES.  The comments from guys, mostly, are that ‚Äúshe went to a stranger‚Äôs house, what‚Äôd she expect?‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe had it coming‚Äù, ‚Äúteach your daughters‚Äù and stuff like that. It‚Äôs disgusting.  A TV host even said that we have those things coming because we make duck faces and take butt selfies on Instagram, and wear tight short skirts. They don‚Äôt focus on the fact that FOUR GUYS RAPED A GIRL. How is it that we get more horrified by the fact that she went to a casual sex session than that she ended up raped and hurt by a group of guys??? How is the first one the focus of the conversation??  Why can‚Äôt we enjoy things like going out, casual sex, walking down the street, wear whatever we want like men do? Why should OUR behavior be conditioned by men‚Äôs atrocities and not THEIR behavior changed?? Why does society blame the victim every time!  I was once rufied at that same dance club and whenever I tell the story the FIRST thing people tell me is ‚Äúsee? You ALWAYS have to cover your glass‚Äù ‚Äúyou have to do this or that‚Äù... they don‚Äôt even let me talk with all the ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù (for a past incident!) like it‚Äôs MY fault somehow.

14nehz	I‚Äôm an ER nurse. I‚Äôm suffering with crippling anxiety, depression, and PTSD as a result of this whole shit show. The hospital is paying us peanuts and trying to distract us from that face with pizza parties. Patients are abusive and combative. My coworkers have nothing left in them.   My therapist left the office she was at. No one else is taking clients, no one else takes my insurance. I want to throw up. And cry. And never step foot in a hospital again. But I‚Äôm trapped. It‚Äôs how I pay rent. It‚Äôs where my health insurance comes from.   I go to work, I sleep all day on my day off. It‚Äôs like an endless merry go round that I can‚Äôt step off of.

gh5kntbm	This is one of my biggest demons. I know it must be a childhood trauma type of situation.   Im 28 now , and ever since 24 I kept having the worst anxiety over my age. Im not fully sure why. Looking back 24 is a baby, and I know when I‚Äôm 40 I‚Äôll think 28 is a baby. But ever since 24 the thought of getting older gives me the most soul splitting anxiety.   Growing up gay and I‚Äôm still closeted must have a big part to do with it. I used my youth to hide away from my demons. If you‚Äôre young than you don‚Äôt need to come out etc. It protects you , or protected me. But 27/28 sounds so old to mentally, and turning 30 is my biggest fear. Id love to hear if anyone else can relate to this ? To having incomprehensible anxiety over aging.

ifj0q6pb	even though they told me when we first got her that won't until she had one litter of puppies. I really thought that I was going to help raise a litter of puppies. I waited the two years for her to be of age, got the health tests done,vet-approved it,  put out ads for studs, found a few candidates with excellent health and was ready for her next heat with is due next month. I only wanted a single litter of puppies and my parents promised me that they wouldn't get her spayed until then. Now is the perfect time for me to raise puppies because I work from home now.  Then they went behind my back and booked a spay for tomorrow (which must have been booked in advance but this is the only vet in the area and very busy) and let me know tonight. I am crushed.   Before anyone jumps down my throat for buying instead of adopting, I tried for two years after my childhood dog Tinks died. The shelters in my area never approved any of my applications for adopting or fostering dogs despite having the land and house for a dog and my parents already owning another friendly dog and no small children in the house. So I opted for a dog of good linage to avoid health defects like my parents dog had (until her passing from health complications in early 2021)  I originally wanted a male dog because I've never had one before and found a beautiful blue eyed one in Luna's (my dog) littermates with a calm temperament but my mom said if I picked a girl then we could breed her once and I would raise the puppies so I picked Luna, a very shy, small and timid pup (the only girl left too). Breeder said she was only small because her brothers didn't share food. She didn't grow up to be super fluffy like her brother but that's okay, its means less hair I suppose. This was in mid 2019 when we adopted Luna. I wanted to pay for her myself but my mom declined and said she's a gift. So I raised her from a puppy until now (and also raised my parents new puppy from Oct 2021 until now) and I've been the one dealing with the heats from Luna.  My parents said not to worry because I'll be able to raise puppies with Mags (their new puppy) once she's of age since she's the CKC, top of the line genetics, no health defects in linage, show dog quality, $5,000 dollar dog (Luna was $1,000) but Mags is a bulldog. I do not want to raise bulldogs because of their problems like short snout, breathing problems, prone to hip dysplasia, etc (no offence to people who love bulldogs, they just aren't for me) AND she was just at the vet for shots and was diagnosed with hypoplastic vulva (basically her vulva didn't 'drop' as the vet explained) and said it was caused by genetics.   My parents probably will break that promise too like many other promises they've made to me. I already asked them why the sudden change of heart and they told me "because she stinks when she's in heat".  Yeah but not horribly and besides, their bulldog stinks all the time but that's okay because bulldogs are supposed to smell?? She smells like urine though? I'm not an expert on bulldogs but I don't think they're supposed to smell like that.  Another reason I'm against the spay is because this vet gave the wrong medication to Mags for something and she was throwing up and diarrhea for 3 days afterwards. And another vet (different location) gave my rabbit the wrong medication and killed her instead. This doesn't mean I'm totally against vets but these two incidents are just still so fresh in my mind but if my pet was hurt, I'd still take her to the vet (just not either of those ones)  I just, I don't know. My parents have made so many promises to me before and broken them (among other things too) that its hard to trust them with anything.   I'm not really expecting anyone to give me any solutions but I really needed to get this off my chest.	1643179650.0	sczogu	/r/offmychest/comments/sczogu/i_am_hurt_and_disappointed_that_parents_are/	I am hurt and disappointed that parents are spaying 'my' dog tomorrow (please don't hate on me)

After we finished, she said she liked sex with women more than with men.We both still remember it, but after kissing her I just fell in love. Whenever I see her now, I just think about how beautiful and sexy she is. I want her so bad. I don't know what to do. She's been talking about wanting a man ever since it happened, and hasn't said anything about sex with women.

39ebb0jb	I tried to be somebody, something for the better part of a decade. Pursuing dreams of higher education because I was told that was the way to go in life. When in reality, I barely knew myself enough to know what kind of higher education career to pursue.  My mental health was atrocious for that same period, and then seven years ago my dad killed himself. I‚Äôm too tired to even care anymore. All I want is to pay my bills and save enough to not end up on the streets 30-40 years from now. I don‚Äôt mind being a looser. The rat race is not for me. If I go back to college ill study things I like.  Sure it may be a bit awkward trying to explain I have no life or dreams. But you don‚Äôt know what life has taken away from me.

bgplrd5t	Signed some marriage papers today and it feels like I just died inside. I am not looking forward to getting married next month. Why am I doing this? I know she's not the one. I don't enjoy spending time with her anymore. I'm so depressed. I'm going through the motions every day completely numb. I've gotten so good at masking my true feelings that sometimes I convince *myself* it'll work out and that it's the right thing to do. Is this Stockholm syndrome? Soon we'll be married. Then we'll have a kid. Then we'll get old. And I will have lived my whole adult life in depression and regret.   I feel like I am in debt to her and getting married and having a kid will free me of that debt. What the fuck am I thinking? Writing it out makes me feel so pathetic, weak, and taken advantage of.   I feel like a big pushover. How do I stand up for myself? Where do I go for help?   Ever feel like you could use a good cry? I feel that way now, but the numbness is overriding everything.

j17jo8i3	I have a friend my age who pulls guys like bees to money. She was bragging to me about how she finally found a guy who liked her for her personality and not just her looks.  She's my age. Always been very popular with men.  I've realized how ugly I am. I'm incredibly hideous and I need help becoming more popular with men. On average, I've been rated a 7.5/10 and that's not good enough, apparently!  I'm 22. 23 this year. 5'4, 111 pounds. 4 pounds over the underweight mark. B cup breasts. I wear hoodies and jeans and only eyeliner and mascara. Nothing much else. Maybe some concealer if I have acne but I normally don't.  Personality wise, I'm introverted and sarcastic. I don't flirt with men and I'm not warm and outgoing with them either since they've only caused me sorrow and rejection.  Any advice is welcomed.	1643180105.0	sczswh	/r/offmychest/comments/sczswh/im_ugly_and_unpopular_with_men_because_of_my_looks/	I'm ugly and unpopular with men because of my looks
2icn8trr	My gf is a 10, I'm pretty good looking myself, but she is a 10. I added this line at the top to provide some context.   I'm, I guess you could say by nature, a very jealous person. It has ruined relationships for me in the past, so I've learned to manage it better and have gotten to a pretty good point right before this one started. I was even ok with her going out with a guy friend at the beginning. However, my gf is the same and once she started letting it loose, I was like: "Oh, I remember how this is played, ok" and kind of reverted, tho to be fair, some of the things she was doing I wouldn't have been ok with either way.   I'm going to say from the start, this post is just about complaining. Ofcourse there are good things too, I love the way we are when we aren't fighting and I love her so much.  So, what's driving me insane (I won't list everything, because, come on, everyone has their stuff):   The fact I don't get what I give.   She has access to my phone any time she wants, but sometimes, when I take a look around, I should just "spend time with her and leave the phone alone". This happens mostly after she's been looking through mine for quite a while and after some time of me checking hers, she finishes and I should do the same in 5 min.  For some reason she really enjoys blocking girls on my phone, this includes but is not limited to, every girl to whom I ever said as much as "hello" and also anyone she dislikes or just happens to have too much of a good appearance. This does not bother me one bit, I've never been into social media, so as much as I'm concerned she can just delete it altogether.   But this is the part that really bothers me, and by that I mean enrages. I've always had a problem with "unfairness" as a concept, and man is she unfair. When I want something like that, mostly I cannot and the following reasons are almost worse than the actual fact that she won't let me do what she does on the regular:   He was not a "real" bf, he is a friend (more on this later), he has a gf, it's just jokes, "I won't have as many like or followers". (Keep in mind, I'm currently well past 100 people blocked on any given social media and never before have I ever blocked anyone.) All of them are bs or just plain false and I've told her to not say them anymore, because it bothers me.   The not real bf was the first one I've ever blocked and she got upset and almost didn't let me, not to mention another one after that, who was a one night stand, same story.   Situation has gotten better since, but not by much and not nearly to the extent she requests of me. She got hit on by a metric ton of guys who had gfs, wives or even kids, but somehow to her it still registers as a legitimate excuse.   She has hundreds of "friends". Friends whose names she cannot even remember half the time and of whom almost all have hit on her at some point. I'm saying almost to be as objective as possible, but I seriously doubt it.   Also, as a last resort, she brings up my one female friend whom I've known since literal birth, half an hour apart, grew up together with and never thought of as more than my sister (also we talk once in about a month, maybe less) to justify her hundreds of "friends" even tho she has no one like that and I explained it to her and told it bothers me.   After I insisted once that those aren't friends and that I know what they're after and she obviously does too, she admitted she keeps them around for favours and that she's aware. That bettered the situation some, but not much.  The "jokes" part really upset me. I have found literal flirt with some of her "friends" before (I'm talking strictly in the relationship, not to mention sexts with other ones from before. Still, just friends). It was talk about her giving him a massage, dressing up in something sexy, her biting his nose, him her boob etc. (This is all from one) And she has the fucking nerve to call those JOKES. Fuck that!   It never happened since, but she still has pretty much the same opinion about it, except, she "allowed" too much and maybe, because I'm a guy I see it differently, but she can't tell.  Also, there are these two "really good" friends. One of them, I have no problem with, they are childhood friends and never seen anything to make me think otherwise. The other asshole on the other hand...They met eachother by him hitting on her. He talked shit about me and told her once when we were having a fight that she should've just been with him, to which she replied he's right. He then said something along the lines of "There is still time". She didn't even agree to not see him anymore, but she hasn't since. Anyway, that's a hill I'll die on some other day.   Also, after a ton of shit she gave me about blocking anyone with whom I've ever been involved, I found out she is still friends on fb with a fwb. She assured me she never had him on any social media, and that he made fake accounts when he wanted to meet up or some shit.   Also, she promised me that she was going to tell me if he contacted her. Spoiler, she didn't, she even deleted the chat and I had to find out on my own. I'm also expected to believe she told him she has a bf and doesn't want to do that anymore. I know they've talked about other stuff too, but all she admitted to was "safe". Tho, I only found out about it because he texted her that he's in town. I mean, I guess it is possible that he did that even tho she declined, but it's not likely.   I've convinced her that chats could be recovered, and it took me wanting to leave her for her to agree to let me do that. Chats cannot be recovered on that app, but if she didn't have more to hide, why not accept right away?  She told me she didn't tell, because she did not want me to get mad at her and that she responded because she wanted him to leave her alone.  I blocked him, but how much good does that do   She broke a lot of promises regarding lying, deleting stuff and so on, " So I won't get mad" but somehow I'm still the bad guy. Don't get me wrong, I did some dirt too, when we were about 2 literal days into our relationship (just texts) and nothing since. The shit I'm talking about here is well in.  I tried telling her she isn't allowed to block anyone else, until I get the same treatment, but she got really upset and I gave in. I got bullied by a hot chick :))  She came up with the idea of installing a tracking app on my phone. After talking to a friend of mine, I realized that the ultimate power move would be to not ask for the same thing in return, since being good because you're being watched is not really proof of anything. She didn't install it yet because she wants me to "not expect it" or something. It's all the same to me, I haven't done anything wrong since 2 days into the relationship and I'm not going to. I wasn't taking it seriously and neither was she at that point, at the start.   This is the last bit I promise, but it's suicide related so warning. When I wanted to break things off, she threatened to kill herself or actually attempted it. I love her so much and I cannot bare the thought of something happening to her. I've had to call her to tell her to vomit pills and another time I had to call hospitals after she cut herself, not to mention, restrain her in person to not take pills again after I wanted to leave. I may be an asshole for saying this, but what, am I supposed to just eat any shit because otherwise she will end her life? I can't leave if I want to?!   Ps: I texted a "friend" of hers that worked at the hospital she was taken to. He didn't reply to me, asked her about why I did that in a very annoyed way and blocked me. Yeah, friend my ass  Thank you to anyone who took their time to read this, I know it's kind of long and maybe not so interesting, but I really needed to let some of it out. I know this is not the advice sub, but it would be appreciated.  Edit: To anyone wondering, yeah, I guess the way control stuff is a bit extreme, but as long as we are both ok with it I don't consider it a problem. Only if we were actually both ok with it.	1643180120.0	sczt25	/r/offmychest/comments/sczt25/my_dream_girl_is_a_nightmare/	My dream girl is a nightmare
ghly4oia	To the usual-  I've had more time to think and look at our relationship. You abused me on an emotional level. I took a test and everything you've done to me fits the definition of abuse almost to a tee.  I was also thinking while talking about religion with a friend that you fit the seven deadly sins  - Lust: You and I both know your past. Let's not go there - Gluttony: I've seen you eat, enough said. - Greed: We've had fights over gifts and have avoided giving me gifts. - Sloth: You are hands down one of the laziest people I know. - Wrath: You are also the most vengeful. You resort to mental warfare as revenge. - Envy: You wished I could be like every woman you know's SO. Nothing I did was good enough and you wanted me to be more. - Pride: You did so much psychological damage to me and never apologized which leads me to assume that you feel like you did nothing wrong. Someone aptly explained it to me as someone who's punishing a student or a child.  Long story short- fuck you and my life's better without you. I pity the next poor bastard you manage to trick.

dgio5992	I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even writing this. I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out in shock. My brother is so mentally ill and my parents coddle him to death even though he‚Äôs abusive. I never knew it would get this bad as it did tonight but basically we were all awake because my mom woke up with a terrible leg spasm and needed help, so I was helping her and then I called for extra help. My brother started getting huffy with me telling me to calm down because I was panicked and then he started getting nastier and nastier. Eventually I told him I feel I have to walk on eggshells around him after what he did to me the other night (he verbally abused me 3 nights ago because I asked if there was any beer left‚Äîhe drank the whole six pack my parents bought for us‚Äîand he took personal offense that I was shaming him and then called me every word in the book and 3 days later gave me a super brief apology and moved on like nothings wrong). When I said that to him it lit him off more and I was feeling angry because he gets so abusive verbally with me and calls me all these profanities and vile things when I‚Äôve done NOTHIN wrong and then he acts like it never happened and doesn‚Äôt get himself help. This was the point when he lunged at me across my moms bed, grabbed me by my neck and squeezed, pushed me off the bed so I rolled over on my neck and pulled a muscle I‚Äôm my back, got on top of me to start punching me until my mom finally pulled him off me. Then all my dad could say is how I triggered him.  I officially need to move out of this shit hole. I‚Äôm shaking. I don‚Äôt deserve to be treated this way. I deserve so much more.

h5u7pozk	I used to wonder why people are so self destructive, but give it time and you will know. Why people turn to alcohol and drugs to escape from reality and convince themselves everything will be fine. I finally got to that stage and almost ruined my life...     It wasn't with drugs and alcohol but with food and money. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, in my mind at the time nothing else seemed to matter because the stress and pressure was too much to cope with. I won't go into too much detail but there were a mountain of things putting pressure on me at the time, it wasn't small things either, life changing type of things. It must have been about a week where I completely lost who I was, I walked around in the street in a daze, spending on stuff I didn't need and pretending everything was fine. I eventually committed a crime to try and solve one of the big things stressing me out, just because of my self destructive behaviour and losing my sense of rationality.     So I get why people do the craziest things, try to have thrills like partying until they can't see straight, and doing copious amounts of drugs and alcohol... Stress is a killer and can change your personality if you let it seep in. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I never thought I'd do anything like that, if anyone has had any similar experience please feel free to share.

c0s3t8tf	I hate my body and everyone tells me that it‚Äôs my fault for not being in shape. But I have tried for years and I found I just can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt even walk from my dorm to my classes without collapsing by the door soon after I arrive and having to wait until I can stand up without passing out. My heart rate is consistently over 120 bpm and I feel pressure in my chest even when I am sitting at home doing nothing. when I stand up I have chest/lung pain and my heart starts racing even faster. I see stars and my vision goes black very often. I still jog twice a week (I can‚Äôt even finish a mile but I try anyway) because people will not stop pestering me about how I‚Äôm not putting enough effort in, and during the summer I would ride my bike over five miles every day  (over intervals, of course), even when I returned exhausted, wheezing, and coughing up blood. The frustrating thing is that I‚Äôm neither overweight nor extremely underweight, and I‚Äôm only eighteen years old. And it‚Äôs getting worse as time goes on. It depresses me to know how pathetic I am and that I‚Äôll never be able to improve my body appearance. I am a closeted non-binary so this is extremely important to me. Okay I‚Äôm done typing I‚Äôm just gonna go internally cry myself to sleep now because I‚Äôm constantly fatigued and weak and I need to stay awake through my classes tomorrow so I can graduate, get a job, and get tf out. Side note: it has already occurred to me that I might have a medical issue and probably need to see a doctor, but I do not have the money to do so (was not allowed to get a job before college and don‚Äôt have time for it now because I am taking my courses at an accelerated rate) and will be in big trouble with my family if I get medical treatment behind their backs (they think I‚Äôm doing faking these symptoms for attention and don‚Äôt want me to waste money or maybe somehow they‚Äôre right and I just don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôve exaggerated them in my mind to try to deny the fact that I‚Äôm lazy oh crap I‚Äôm spiraling again sorry). People have tried to give me many suggestions to work around these issues, but it is a very complicated situation that I obviously cannot explain fully, and most of them would not work for one reason or another.

By pure and utter obsession and what feels like spiritual magnetism towards a person who feels so insanely radiant and spectral to me. I remember so vividly being 13 and my world shifting as I locked eyes with my first obsession/object of limerance. These are people though, and not objects, so it takes two to tango.    I'm probably not making sense. Um, there's this woman, at my job, probably younger than me, who I am enthralled with. Her voice is like beautiful windchimes in a rainstorm and her eyes catch mine when I least expect. Otherwise I try so hard to avoid eye contact because I know I'll act stupid if I get overwhelmed. But I don't have to act, I am stupid and stupidly infatuated with someone I barely know at all. Out of the thousands of people I interact with, why this woman? Why in this setting? ..   I'm a lesbian, so there lies a query. Is she into women/me? Am I woman enough if she is? Is she even single/interested?   And even if so, is it healthy or safe even to allow myself to go forward towards my limerance obsession? In my naive younger years I thought it was God leading me to my destined lover(s) but I'm backed now by the notion that this isn't love, it's obsession and I'm not in control. If I can't even look at her face without overwhelmingly becoming flustered, what shot does love have?	1643180822.0	sczzor	/r/offmychest/comments/sczzor/coworker_crush_is_limerance_and_im_suffering/	Coworker crush is limerance and I'm suffering
8lpey8sz	I am in hs and there is this girl at my school who accused me of attempted sexual assault. This happened months ago and the situation has picked up a lot of speed lately and I truly believe that the only way for it to be resolved is with verbal communication between us. where ultimately there is a mutual recognition of the reality of our humanity, situations and forgiveness. there has not been any compassion (on a scale recognized largey) from either side, validation for either of our experiences.   In a lot of ways, how situation has been treated and how people feel about it is having a huge impact on the community. It had created a lot of division and many similar situations to my own have risen. One person is going through a strikingly similar experience to the one I went through earlier this year  (close friends and other people who listen to both sides, sided with me but also we‚Äôre mostly compassionate to the other but people who were moreso from the outside looking in were unreasonable and shook)    it seems impossible for this forgiveness to happen because dramas are being fed into by a lot of people and traumatic events like ones where you think you have or could of been sexually violated are brutal to experience. However division does not seem like the answer here.  I am mocked and shunned and judged negatively seemingly no matter what action, what words, what clothes I wear. Its like im on display. I tried just living with it and my other problems (adhd etc) and eventually I thought I was free from a societal judgment and all these other structures I despised in the past. However, while I actually found peace in not caring, I decided to start caring for the sake of others. I need to pull myself out of this hole	1643180883.0	sd006x	/r/offmychest/comments/sd006x/contradictions_and_mending_with_compassion/	Contradictions and mending with compassion
iyst9fkn	I technically ate it last night but it didn‚Äôt hit until 6 am. It‚Äôs been over two months since I‚Äôve eaten anything cooked/ something with seasonings. No sob story, I just don‚Äôt have a stove or fridge so everything I eat is shelf stable. Yesterday I took my son to get another corn dog and another bag of sonic ice, his favorite. I wasn‚Äôt going to get anything but the car hop said they had a special of two chili cheese wrap jr‚Äôs for a dollar. I decided to splurge, they were absolutely delicious, and no heartburn! I should have stopped there.  Maybe I‚Äôm the only one but I don‚Äôt let myself feel hungry if I know I can‚Äôt eat, whether it be because I can't afford to or if I‚Äôm prepping for a procedure/surgery. But when I do get a tasty morsel I‚Äôm immediately starving. I got another round and I don‚Äôt regret it, actually, I didn't until this morning. I sleep in my carhartt overalls, jacket, and a sleeping bag. I live in Idaho and while it wasn‚Äôt crazy cold, I still sleep with layers.  I should add that my left leg was amputated in an accident and I don‚Äôt sleep with my leg. I get woken up by my stomach making the diarrhea grumble. I‚Äôm sure everyone knows what I‚Äôm talking about, plus the poop goosebumps. I sit up and start fumbling with all my layers and another rumble stops me dead in my tracks. I have the cold sweats and realize I‚Äôm not going to have time to get my leg, I‚Äôll hop. I stood up as quickly as I could and didn‚Äôt realize my cat was curled up with me.  I accidentally shifted my weight on his tail and he screamed. His unexpected scream scared the shit out of me. Everything unloaded at once. I'm cursing up a storm while I'm taking my pants and underwear off as quickly as I could so it doesn't seep into my overalls. I'm doing a half assed clean up with paper towels and baby wipes and all of a sudden my cat starts ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me by trying to bury the mess. I put on some sweatpants and walk over to the bathroom and it‚Äôs out of order. I hate feeling dirty so I decide I‚Äôll just drive to the nearest truck stop.  Garbage bag on the seat and my cat is sitting with his ears straight back whipping his tail in anger. The first stop doesn‚Äôt have a handicap shower so I waste more gas getting to the next stop, 7am and there are two people ahead of me to shower. I have to use my crutches which I hate because I get pitiful looks from people and it never fails, at least one person asks why I lost my leg.  I frustrate cry in the shower and begin my day. I won't be eating anything cooked for a while unless I have a toilet close.  TL;DR: A one legged dude that shit himself, maneuvering with crutches and crying because he ate 4 sonic chili cheese wraps. Small mercy that went in my favor is that it wasn‚Äôt icy. A shit show on ice which is much, much, different than Disney on ice.	1643180976.0	sd00y6	/r/offmychest/comments/sd00y6/one_legged_shit_show/	One legged shit show

f3sgp4gw	I guess, I‚Äôm just using this to vent in a way. I suppose I have a lot of problems internally, unfortunately it‚Äôs so hard for me to trust people or truly believe anyone truly cares about me. I just‚Ä¶. No matter how hard my friends try there‚Äôs always a void wether I feel it in the moment or a day later when I‚Äôm alone. I always feel like I‚Äôm going day to day and no one truly cares. No one asks how I‚Äôm doing (except my family) and I‚Äôm always the one who asks. I guess I just feel isolated in a way. Of course it‚Äôs not their fault, it‚Äôs mainly my self to blame. I unfortunately overthink to much and have worked hard to stop that terrible behavior but sometimes it‚Äôs just a lot especially when I feel constantly tired. In addition I‚Äôve been apart of a fair bit of toxic relationship in my life wether friends that betrayed me or my ex who manipulated me. I know I‚Äôm supposed to be living the best years of my life yet sometimes I just feel like laying in bed all day and just never leaving. Honestly I know in a day or two I‚Äôll feel great and forget I even posted this. Then a few weeks later I‚Äôll feel this way again. It‚Äôs always this bloody cycle and it hurts but it goes away for a time. I guess I just wish I could have someone hold me and comfort me, not in a loving way but more of, I understand way.  Thankfully I do have one friend who I believe thinks the highest of me and likes to hangout with me. He‚Äôs a real one and my ride or die. However outside of him, I just don‚Äôt know where I stand with my other friends. Sometimes I feel like I could fade away and they wouldn‚Äôt notice.	1643181665.0	sd07bx	/r/offmychest/comments/sd07bx/my_demons/	My demons
dbsihhkq	It's not DID, but I do act differently when I experience each. Does anyone else have different modes of existence? Like almost shifting gears, but I don't know what makes them shift and I can stay in each mode for a day or a few days or a few weeks. The first is autopilot. My feelings are muffled and I do the bare minimum. I'm not consciously aware that I'm doing this or really of anything. I think little and just wake up, eat, go to work, come home and watch tv. I don't talk to people or remember much. I just do what's required to live. I don't have emotions and I don't even think about or consider family. People just exist and I just exist. I don't notice the wind or textures or colors. I mean, they're there, but I don't notice. I don't have opinions.  Next is emotional/extrovert. I don't think I just speak. I sing a lot and I'm fidgety. I feel emotions intensely and think about why I feel them in order to calm myself down. But I most just reassure myself when I get scared or overwhelmed. I was happy. I talked a lot; I had the most confidence ever. I felt great unless I was crying, which was like 30% of it. I try really hard to love the people around me and I just want to help and make people happy. I feel textures and have likes and dislikes. I'm not afraid to say my opinions, but I am great with compromise and don't want to hurt anyone or make anyone uncomfortable.  Next logical. My mission is to complete tasks. Just get done what I need to get done. My hobbies are task. I get mild enjoyment out of them. I feel content going from one thing to another till I've done everything. I feel slightly proud when I complete things. I show my affection by doing things for people. I don't feel love, but I care and I know I must love my family, in some way. I don't talk much, but I do ponder things in my silence. I enjoy having philosophical debates in my head and learning about my mental state. I study myself and am currently interested in the cause of my different modes of existence. It's quite interesting. I don't feel much though, just content. I am aware of textures and I felt them some are nice, some aren't, but I have better things to worry about than textures. I'm aware of the cold and the wind. I don't enjoy the wind, but I prefer to not let my fingers freeze. I don't know if other people feel like this or why I'm doing it. I think it's definitely a coping mechanism. Also, they don't overlap. I don't feel them at the same time. Like I said, they last a few days or a week or two and then I transition into the next over the course of two days. Anyone else do this?	1643181704.0	sd07q1	/r/offmychest/comments/sd07q1/does_anyone_else_swift_between_different/	Does anyone else swift between different personalities? (Other than DID)
e34u6yk6	I'm was pretty much a virgin and met this guy, we became friends and had really good sex. Afterwards, he ghosted me and I just wish he was the person I thought he was. I finally knew what it was like to become intimate with someone and I'm grateful for that. I just wish it didn't have to be with someone who didn't actually like me that much. It felt like a once in a life time thing and I don't see that happening again to me any time soon since I'm an anxious mess. I feel like if he suddenly contacted me again I'd reply in a heartbeat and I know I shouldn't since he treated me like shit. I'm just incredibly inpatient and I don't even care if he just wants to use me for sex because our sex was just so good.

2wom090l	We‚Äôve dated for 4 years, married for 1.  He‚Äôs had this dog for 5, coming to 6 years.   When we started dating, we went for spontaneous 2d1 night camps, 4d3n getaway trips to hike, watched movies and sometimes went out on weekends ourselves.   Somewhere along the line, things changed to we had to bring the dog everywhere. The number of places we were able to go to slowly became extremely limited because it had to have an outdoor area so the dog could come.  Trips we went on were limited too dog friendly places too, which was fine except when we brought the dog the dog didn‚Äôt wanna eat and sleep. It just kept going back to the car wanting to go home.   When I suggest going out without the dog for lunch or something - it somehow usually ends up in argument cause I‚Äôve changed and no longer love the dog.   It‚Äôs also always been ‚Äòhis dog‚Äô. Until the dog needs grooming, a shower, his undercoat brushed out, nails cut, or anything along those lines of needs then suddenly it‚Äôs ‚Äúour dog‚Äù.   I got pregnant and suggested we train the dog so that he doesn‚Äôt do a 100m mad dash whenever he wants to poop so we can walk him & pram. No, it‚Äôs the dog‚Äôs walk, he should enjoy it and do whatever he wants.   I‚Äôll admit it, somewhere along the way after having a baby, a switch in me flipped. I no longer like this dog. I tolerate it, make sure he has food, n sometimes (but rarely) do chores like cut his nails or brush out his undercoat, but I crave just having a chill outing without him where we can go anywhere spontaneously without having to be concerned about having a dog with us.   My husband says I‚Äôve changed and have become evil because the dog is family. But surely.. dog owners are allowed to go out without their dog once in awhile?	1643181993.0	sd0acd	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0acd/tired_of_my_husbands_obsession_with_his_dog/	Tired of my husband‚Äôs obsession with his dog.

j19a7pq6	Hello. It's one in the morning and I'm having a mental break down because for the last week I keep having nightmares about what my step father did to me growing up.   He molested me from age 7-14. Thankfully the stopped when I turned 15, because according to him "I was getting to old". Which in itself if a whole different issue.   I've never told my family, in fear of a couple things that could happen, you see my mother is my favorite person in the whole world. She's strong, Smart and everything I wanted to be when I was a child. I still look up to her, and I am now 26.    I've never told my mom for multiple reasons, like for one ,was seven when it started . I didn't know anything about shit like that. I didn't understand what was showing on.  And when I got old enough to understand, I felt dirty. I felt like it was my fault. How could I "let" him do that to me? (Obviously as an adult I know that as a child there is zero way I couldn't have stopped him , but I digress)   The biggest reasons I haven't told her , are as follows    1) what if she doesn't believe me ? What if she says I'm making it all up ? It never happened when she was in the house, only when she was gone.  What if she thinks im am telling her to ruin her relationship with her husband of however many years ?  I will say that and she's so head over heels for him, what if  she just straight up calls me a liar ? I don't think I could handle that mentally. I love my mother so much.  2) now that I'm an adult, and Im afraid she'll hit me with that " well why didn't you say something sooner.? Why wait so long, if it really happened?   3) even worse, what if she knew ? What if she had known all along? I mean there were definitely signs growing up, that as a mother I feel like it's incredibly hard to miss, I wouldn't let him hug me, I wanted zero physical interaction with him. But the biggest memory I have that I feel like it was a huge red flag.   When I was like 11 or 12 she had to go away for some family issues for months. I can't remember why, but she was fine for a couple months. As you can imagine that was the worst part of my life. And I've been homeless before.   I remember we went to go pick her up and bring her home, but something came up and she was required to stay for another couple weeks.  I was heart broken, in my mind she protected me just by being in the house. It was the first time I can ever remember begging for anything and I got on my hands and needs and literally BEGGED my mother to come home, the whole time bawling and screaming.  I kept saying things like "mom you don't understand, you HAVE to come home! PLEASE COME HOME ." I was too afraid to say why because I was afraid of what he would do to me..  I had never thrown, which in assuming my mother thought It was, a "tantrum" like that. I was genuinely a good kid , and I feel like she should have noticed that I NEVER acted that way.     The reason I'm bringing this up, is related to my nightmares.   They came up to see me at the beginning of the year,  and it was incredibly triggering, and he hugged me in one of those country dad bear hugs and wouldn't let go for a minute saying "oh I've missed you so much!! Give daddy a hug"   Usually, when I see him I get nightmares about what he did, and how I felt.   But this time it's different. I keep seeing the scene over and over again of me begging my mom to come home with us. It's been a whole week and I can't get over this . My mental health is rapidly declining. I can't sleep any more, it's hard to keep food down   I had no one else to talk to, as the only one who knows about it is my boyfriend, and he's asleep. So that's why I'm posting here .  I'm sorry if this post is all over the place or hard to read I'm having a break down and just needed to talk to someone..and this is the closest I've gotten	1643182348.0	sd0dff	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0dff/tw_molestation_please_dont_read_if_this_will/	TW: molestation please don't read if this will trigger you, it's not worth it
j0781vgm	We had been together for close to 1 and a half years (me 19M and her 19F) but have been friends forever, and our relationship was perfect, especially for the 1st year or so.  She broke up with me about a month and a half ago. Looking back I can see why. Our relationship was not as fun anymore, and actually was more like a friendship.  I do believe that there is more to it though. The last month before we broke up we were constantly together, she never had space for herself and was feeling pressured. She is an introvert after all, and needs time to recharge and time alone.  What she didn't know is that I had discovered something on me, that had an over 50% chance of being cancer. I didn't tell anyone and for the 4 weeks I waited to get checked by a doctor, I tried to be with her as much as possible, because when I was left alone, it was too much for me, knowing that I might have cancer.  I actually got checked and all went well. She broke up about a week after that, saying that she doesn't think we match, and I'm certain that always being together when she is introverted played a major role in her decision.  I never told her, or anyone about this, as she gets extremely nervous and would honestly lose her mind if she knew before I got checked.  I backed off for about a month and reinitiated contact with her. We're talking every few days (both of us are reaching out) and we met once and it was pretty fun. I honestly want us to get back together. I just don't know what I should do, or even if I should ever mention the above.  Also let me point out that we had more problems as well, as all couples, but I believe they were miniscule, and actually wroked on fixing everything, while I spent some time with my self.	1643182402.0	sd0dza	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0dza/we_broke_up_but_there_is_something_she_didnt_know/	We broke up but there is something she didn't know
izx3a2ez	The title really says it all I feel dirty for doing erotic roleplay on certain subreddits for a few months back in November I started hoping it would be a fun way to explore my sexuality but it was much much worse it was addicting and I couldn't stop I would constantly make post after post looking for rp partners to write smut but now that I look back at it's just sad. It consumed multiple hours of my life and made me sick all the subreddits said 18+ but some unsettling feeling worries me that what If I was being sexual with someone not 18? People lie about their age online all the time so im completely sused out about it. I would never want to be classified as one of those people and I never asked for personal pics because I always found it weird the furthest I went was sending nsfw anime pics to progress the plot but still it making me go insane to think I would write that stuff and makes me feel like I sexual assaulted someone. I have been struggling to even get up in the morning because I feel like a waste to society. (Don't worry I never would attempt that type of thing). It's just I wish to be better as a human I quit Erping in general but I just want help. I want to be told I'm not a weirdo and no one to judge me.

74e0q8w4	I work in a very large building with lots of attractive women and dating in the workplace is pretty commonplace where I work.   Anyway, if I happen to get a girl‚Äôs name or any of her info, I look her up on social media. It gets to the point where I search through mutual friends, type in her name and every last name I can think of. Then I finally find her and it spirals out of control from there. I make burner accounts to keep track of her stories and what she‚Äôs up to. I scroll through her followers list to see who she follows and which guy‚Äôs pictures she likes the most. It‚Äôs gotten very bad to the point over the past year or so, I‚Äôve noticed a change in my behavior and daily habits. I started to isolate myself and found myself laying in bed most of my day, scrolling endlessly on my phone. My schoolwork started to take a hit. My workouts and my nutrition, something I was very religious about in the past, took a nosedive as well. Today, I feel the lowest I have felt in a while.   I want to build meaningful relationships with people instead of trying to learn about them through a screen. And to be clear: I do not intend to harm any of these girls.

She loves spending time with me, we spend hours together and she always responds to my texts right away. She listens to me and wants to make me happy, all I want is to make her the happiest person alive.  She is so different from the other girls, she makes me so happy.

4aq88n6m	I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts all over social media about this exact thing. I‚Äôve always felt some type of way about it but it never really clicked in my head until today.   I grew up in the suburbs so I don‚Äôt have a heavy urban ‚Äúghetto‚Äù accent, I don‚Äôt curse a lot because it just feels really unnatural and unnecessary in most situations for me, I don‚Äôt say the N word at all (because it was literally a derogatory term used to demean black people so why would I call my friend that?) I don‚Äôt fit any of the stereotypes like being angry or aggressive or loud (partly due to past trauma) I don‚Äôt like hitting people and I don‚Äôt think parents should be allowed to beat their kids which is a very unpopular opinion in the black community, im not promiscuous  I‚Äôm bi, I don‚Äôt skip class or do drugs or anything of the sort. I know these are all stereotypes but this isn‚Äôt a how society expects someone like me to act.  I go to a predominately black high school (that‚Äôs not in the best part of town) and I have friends that go there with me that I‚Äôve known since 1st grade that I now feel so uncomfortable around. Some of them have picked up the mannerisms of some of the people that go to this school (skipping, cursing like a sailor, bullying). I expected change I mean it‚Äôs high school after all everything changes now but I didn‚Äôt expect it to this extent.  A few of my friends will try and police my behavior because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcringey‚Äù or ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù when a couple months ago they‚Äôd be laughing along with me. I don‚Äôt even feel like I can have a normal conversation with some of them because of how they treat me and how they act. I feel like I‚Äôm not black enough because I can‚Äôt fit into this mold and everyone else seems to be doing fine with it. I think the fact that im more or less timid really plays into how they treat me but I can‚Äôt help but feel it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have a hard life, I still have both my parents, I haven‚Äôt experienced gun violence or police brutality first hand and that makes me feel like an outsider.

I‚Äôve hung out with her a few times outside of work, and her boyfriend even joined us for drinks.  When I was chatting with her boyfriend one on one, he said that any guy would be lucky to have me‚Ä¶ that I‚Äôm ‚Äúone of those girls‚Äù. I‚Äôd love for him to initiate his girlfriend to kiss me.

4uss249s	A friend of mine lets call her Kate, she cheated on her husband on a business trip then told her husband that there is someone else, but that was right when Covid hit, and she was stuck in the house with him for a few months. They stayed in separate rooms and did not talk that much I believe. Then she was planning to move somewhere else with this new guy. I should also point out that on her "business trip" she stayed with and shared a room with the new guy and definitely slept with him, while still married to her husband. So she divorced her hubby and moved to Seattle with the new guy, also she most likely slept with the new guy in the same house as her hubby. Anyways she was with him for a year and a half, they had an apartment. But she just posted how her and the new guy just broke up and I for some strange reason think that is funny. Like you cheated on your hubby for this guy then you move and start a new life with him but now it is over between you guys?? I think thats freaking hilarious!!! I just felt bad for her hubby too, I used to think he was the luckiest guy ever. I do still consider her a friend but every time I saw her posts I was like "she is a cheater". I am biased though because I was cheated on myself a long time ago and I do not like people who cheat. Also Kate definitely has a type, her hubby and the new guy they look like brothers lol. Just wanted to share that with someone.	1643182905.0	sd0i9b	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0i9b/i_dont_know_why_i_think_it_is_funny/	I don't know why I think it is funny
1us1k4bq	12 years ago, I met a girl I would eventually have feelings for till this day.   We live in a multi racial Asian country, and we are of different race and religion. I met her when we were all starting at a new job. The first time I met her, I was absolutely smitten. Smart but quirky, cute and lovely, strong but fragile. Her looks are as beautiful as her personality and heart. I wanted to always be around her, protect her, guide her, love her.   But...  These are all one sided feelings. She had a boyfriend at the time. Whom she would eventually marry.   I was more than pleased to just be around her for as long as it was. Everyday coming to work and looking forward to being around her was a very good motivator.   A few years passed and the project we were all working for got bought over and we were all about to lose our jobs. I had so many opportunities to leave and start else where, but I stayed to be around her.  Eventually we had to go our separate ways... But my heart still aches for her... I still think about her... To the extent of having dreams about her... That's how much she stays on my mind...  Fast forward to about two years ago. I recruited her in a company I am currently working for. The first day I met her again, my god! she took my breath away.... How is she still so beautiful after all these years. I hope her husband takes good care of her... To me, she's an amazingly wonderful person...   Then COVID hit. Work from home. I only got to see her for a few months before COVID lockdown began. But it was the most enjoyable 3 months in yearssss. I would get on video calls with her just so I can see her and hear her...  Fast forward to now... COVID restrictions have eased. And we are all coming back to the office. Sometime I have this urge to just grab her and tell her how I feel. But that would be wrong. And I know she won't like it. I still feel the same, I want to protect her, guide her, keep her safe and happy...   She's married, with a kid. But seeing her again, makes me fall in love with her every time I see her.  I don't know how to go about this feeling...	1643183063.0	sd0jrx	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0jrx/is_this_a_crush_infatuation_obsession_or_love/	Is this a crush, infatuation, obsession or love?
4i4sbr0v	Hello i know the title sounds extra petty and stuff but i really cannot contain my anger right now. A lot of the stuff here probably wont sound too morally right and a lot of it is just irrational anger so if you don't like that just scroll please i really kind of just need to vent.   I've like this boy. Since march of 2021. I first saw him when my friend invited me to hang out but my friend told me he was bringing 2 friends. I fell in love at first sight (corny omg!!) genuinely. From his quirky laughter to his niche interests his passion for the things he love and the fact he always tries to improve even though circumstances are against him made me admire him and fall for him more. I was even jealous of him because of how great he was. Of course he had flaws. But i accepted them all because i really liked him.   I pulled a little stunt telling my friend i needed his school to do my school's survey and that the person with the best response gets free anime merch or something and it worked. Long story short he fell for it, i got his number( and got my project done ofc) . We hit it off we talked almost everyday for months and months and months. We would occasionally hang out with each other treat each other bubble tea help each other with homework( mostly him helping me since he's smarter hahaha). We would do so much together. He would even play the drums for me and play my favourite songs and i would listen to them all day because he was great at it. And we even had the same music taste! We would talk for hours and hours all the way till 3am sometimes. And even during school days we would keep talking and talking. I even accompanied him to take an all nighter to study for his O levels last year  He had some parental issues and would always talk to me about it. We vented to each other about our issues. He was the first guy i met who genuinely wanted to try and understand how i feel. He was the first to not judge me at all. He was the first who knew how to listen. He was the first that wouldnt just open his mouth and give stupid advice like " if you're depressed just dont be" typa beat. He was all that. And i gave him the same treatment. I was there for him throughout when he was breaking down all the spam messages he'd give me on sms (iMessage for him) when his screentime is over. We would talk about so much about our life ambitions what we want to do and stuff and much more. And i just thought we had something going on...   Until yesterday something happened but its another long story but it ended with me telling him i liked him. And he responded with "too late" i got confused at first but he basically explained that he has a "gf" (yes he put those quotation marks) and said he met her on discord... I was too baffled. For context basically we started drifting from october? Because i had exams and basically i also thought he didnt like me and i have a super annoying self sabotage thing where id abandon them before they abandon me kinda thing cus i thought he hated me osnfkskxjf weird stuff yes. BUT even after that fiasco we still talked for a good like month? And what i said previously abt accompanying him for that all nighter. That was also after october it was in nov so like i thought we were getting closer again. Until this hit me. He basically told me if i did tell him before he'd actually probably accept and apparently he did "play with the thought of us being together" (this was his exact words) which is ???? Bottom line is im pissed. Im so pissed. Like really did none of the things we did mean anything????? Throw all of that for some girl online??????   Im not trying to disregard LDR online rs its really not my intention but i just cant help but think this. All i can think is why why why i keep beating myself over it. Over some girl he met for idk how long like what?? I dont know what to say. I know if i shld be mad it shld be towards him but i cant help hating his girlfriend. I cant seem to be wishing them well because i dont want to wish them well. Its unfair. Does she do the things i did for him?? Whats so good about her? This really upsets me because this was the first boy ive fallen in love with and it just pains me to see him with another girl. Like how did i really lose to someone online?   I know i can never meet a guy as great as him and it pains me. Normally this kind of romantic thing give or take like i only need a day to move on. But this i dont know how long it'd even take. I cant help but bear a grudge. Its just so unfair to me. Im sorry if i sound really petty but i really just want to let this out. Of course im not going to actively try and sabotage their relationship. But it just hurts.   TL;DR: fell in love with a boy for like 9months or something and rejected me because he got an online gf on discord.	1643183200.0	sd0kwy	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0kwy/rejected_for_someone_online/	Rejected for someone online

drk8v	I work in a grocery store and today a hot woman in a sports bra walked up to me. She smiled at me and asked me "Hey do you know where the condoms are??" She smiled and I almost laughed then I showed her where they are. She was chatting with her friend on the phone too. I walked by that shelf later and saw which ones were missing in the front, she got some Magnums. I kept thinking "oh man some lucky guy is gonna sleep with that super hot woman tonight". I wonder if it is her BF or just a sex buddy? If she was buying them because she had a plan or if she was buying them "just in case". I just remember that smile she gave me too.	1643183475.0	sd0ne1	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0ne1/the_woman_at_work/	The woman at work
i4uwy2lb	Title says all. I got a million and a half problems but titties ain‚Äôt one. (Or two.) Yes, I have small breasts, yes I‚Äôm a male. My nipples are probably one of the most sensitive areas of my body. For the better, of course; if I‚Äôm getting frisky with someone, they can be source of pure euphoria. They‚Äôre not severe by any means but they are just noticeable enough to leave someone wondering if they‚Äôre pecs or not.   I‚Äôm not bothered by them. I kind of like the definition I see when I put on a size small shirt. I don‚Äôt really feel compelled to hide them; sometimes I wear shirts that make them more noticeable. I do sometimes feel concerned what other people think, but that comes from a broader sense of attachment issues; like I said I have bigger problems. Such as being gaslit into dropping out of high school before getting absolutely no help to get through life, and instead having batshit delusional religious beliefs crammed down my throat while getting locked in a room for the rest of my teenage years. But I digress, I‚Äôm not shy about admitting my difficulties. I genuinely don‚Äôt care what people think in some regard; that ensuing loneliness makes it impossible to.   Society at large has shit standards for bodily beauty and people can go fuck themselves if they think everyone else‚Äôs sole purpose is to be a cookie-cutter, factory-made boner toy to them. Having a natural mix of feminine and masculine features, I don‚Äôt conform to the standards and I personally think I look fucking beautiful. Sometimes I wonder if people judge me any different, but I imagine my ability to connect to people is far more hampered by my lack of development in other areas of my life, such as fiscal and life skills, and the lack of support that has made me feel overwhelmed and alone, and the ongoing familial barricades make me feel helpless and isolated at times. I don‚Äôt like, first and foremost, having to be worried what other people think out of any sort of need to be dependent to begin with, and it further kills me inside to think I can‚Äôt return the favor and help others because I am so helpless myself. That‚Äôs the stuff that eats at me on the inside, and leads me to shutting down friendships and turning away women that have expressed interest towards me. I say this because I know there are a plethora of men who worry about what their partners and friends might think over their chesticles. Really? I‚Äôd gladly trade my issues off if it meant I had to walk around with triple D‚Äôs the rest of my life.   Conformity is stupid. Purely aesthetic ‚Äúflaws‚Äù are a social construct; if your body is healthy and that engine is burning bright, you are blessed just well enough and that‚Äôs all that matters. Scars are badass, tits are hot, stretch marks look like tiger stripes. Bodily appearance doesn‚Äôt really matter, it‚Äôs performance that does, and if you are one of those people that judge people on their superficiality alone, I would downgrade your role to ‚Äúprospective robbery victim‚Äù because your character isn‚Äôt worth whatever you own. By far the most privileged gift you can have in life, whether someone slaved their life away to bless you or you hauled ass to give it to yourself, is being completely independent of the shit show. Physically, emotionally, fiscally and spiritually. Stare at my chest all day and ask before grabbing a scoop of the vanilla cream; I don‚Äôt care, I have higher priorities.	1643183573.0	sd0oag	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0oag/i_actually_somewhat_like_my_gynecomastia/	I actually somewhat like my gynecomastia.

j19ax43d	Fuck you.   Fuck you.

Fuck you J for making fun of me and then blaming me for ruining the day by crying because it hurt.   Fuck you E and N and M for throwing a snowball in my eyes and then blaming me for ruining the fun because I started crying.       Fuck the three of you for having such a goddamn fucking wonderful time playing on your fucking sport court while I sat next to the window looking down at you watching you have so much goddamn fucking fun while I was alone inside using the computer because no one wanted to play with me.   Fuck you M for tripping me on the sidewalk and chipping my front tooth. It‚Äôs chipped forever because of you.   Fuck you M for bringing me to hang out with your friends only to spend the whole time complaining to them about how weird I am. Did you guys bond over your shared dislike of me?   Fuck you D for punching me in the stomach six times because you didn‚Äôt get the part you wanted in the school play. Was ‚Äúthe gay kid‚Äù an acceptable punching bag for you? I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm your greatest shame because I should be.  Fuck you H for telling me that throwing my binder at Duncan in a fit of anger made me ‚Äúa real man.‚Äù And fuck you for being a bystander.   Fuck you Y for being such a good friend right up until you told me I was a ‚Äúblatant homosexual,‚Äù and that we probably shouldn‚Äôt hang out anymore. I can‚Äôt remember what you said exactly. It was something like that.   Fuck you I for coming into math class to avoid doing your job as the hall monitor just so you could grab at my penis, and sexually harrass to try and get me to admit I was gay just like you.   Surprisingly, I forgive you though. I have empathy for you. Even if I have no sympathy for what you did. You know better than anyone why I didn‚Äôt come out as a 12 year old like you did. I just wish you didn‚Äôt have to take everyone else‚Äôs homophobia out on me. I still remember when we ran into each other at Pride several years later and you were marching with the HIV+ parade group. Did you tell me you were positive yourself? I can‚Äôt remember. Regardless, I can‚Äôt begin to imagine what you were going through during those years.   Fuck you M.F. for telling me to leave the classroom when I got angry about dealing with everyone‚Äôs homophobic bullshit and kicked a chair. It didn‚Äôt hit anyone. I didn‚Äôt hit anyone. I have such a hard time healthily expressing anger to anyone now.   Fuck you Mom for interrupting me at the dinner table. I interrupted the conversation to say ‚ÄúI have something to say-‚Äú you finished my sentence with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gay?‚Äù and you laughed. Just like the kids at school did all the time.   I was so upset I left the dinner table to go into my bedroom and hide under my blanket. You came in to apologize but you just made it worse. I forgive you too though because I know you feel bad. And you gave me a much better apology now. And you‚Äôre my mom and I love you.   That‚Äôs it.   There are plenty more people who hurt me (they know who they are) but these were the ones who‚Äôve taken me the longest to shake. Time to take some fucking control.

gpgbyail	I'm so tired of people using having a small dick as a generic insult towards anyone they don't like. Whenever someone who happens to have a dick is an asshole, the go-to insult is that person "must be overcompensating for having a small dick". As someone who actually has a small dick (so small it's in my medical file that it's abnormally small) this really hurts. And whenever I see someone who like me is angry about this, people automatically assume that we're angry because it makes us think that it's for coitus-related insecurities and use this at an attempt at cheering us up: "size doesn't matter, it's how you use it". I'm sex-averse asexual with no sex drive, the only thing I use my dick for is peeing.  I'm not angry at the potential prospect of being afraid that having sex might not be good. I'm angry that the go-to insult is body-shaming. I'm also planning to get rid of mine (I'm trans) but that doesn't make the insult any less hurtful	1643184558.0	sd0xkr	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0xkr/im_so_tired_of_a_certain_nsfw_insult/	I'm so tired of a certain NSFW insult
943o4djs	So my friend(M20) and I(F19) tend to go a little over the top sometimes with our jokes and sometimes we throw a bit of truth in there cause personalized jokes are just funnier imo but today i accidentally spilled a truth that made things slightly awkward. We tend to joke about our past traumas cause its just our way of coping. Basically we were joking about his first day at work. He had to do some urine sampling and colonoscopy type stuff. I made fun of him right off the bat for surrounding himself with pee and butt cheeks all day. We joked around for sometime and made nasty scenarios and one thing lead to another and I told him a scenario reminded me of the human centipede. I know the movie was nasty but I joked about watching the movie and he gasped and started calling me a freak. He asked me why I watched it and I told him whenever I used to get sad id make myself watch nasty movies cause i felt like i deserved to feel bad. I didn't realize how serious it sounded till I said it out loud. He continued to call me weird and nasty till I got visibly upset and I just went quiet. Idk why he reacted that way, we've seen a bunch of terrible movies together before, I didn't realize this would be where he drew the line. I feel like he now sees me as a weirdo. I know it doesn't sound too serious but I felt like I made him uncomfortable by stating i use movies to make myself upset. or maybe its cause human centipede is a whole new level of gross. The conversation just felt awkward after that and I felt like leaving but I feel like it would have made things more awkward. I stayed and tried to save my butt by saying I barely remember it or i didn't pay much attention and eventually we found common ground and started joking again but it's seriously bothering me. What if he no longer sees me the same or distances himself from me? I really appreciate this friendship and would be seriously upset if I did something to drive him away.	1643184670.0	sd0yjn	/r/offmychest/comments/sd0yjn/im_afraid_i_made_my_friend_uncomfortable/	I'm afraid I made my friend uncomfortable
8vgchiu8	I‚Äôve been dating my foreign bf for more than a year now. I‚Äôm an Asian girl in my early twenties. Recently I was venting at him about my family/country‚Äôs culture of treating their children as retirement plans and passing on the responsibilities of taking care of the family once the the son/daughter graduates and finds a job. I told him I want to break the cycle and not do the same to my future children by working hard and planning my future well. Then he said, ‚Äúmore like by dating a westerner‚Äù. He quickly apologized and said it was an inappropriate joke and nothing more than a joke. I was taken aback by this and have not gotten over it since. ‚ÄúWhat does he mean by it?‚Äù, I wondered. I wonder if he thinks I‚Äôm with him for his money, which I am not. I‚Äôm a college grad with a stable job that pays enough for my own apartment and to send my three sisters to school. I‚Äôve never asked money or any thing from him. I have never missed an occasion without getting him gifts yet it seems he still thinks I‚Äôm with him for his money. Am I reading too much into this?

j19fchqk	So I'm tired of working with an employee. She has me doing 80% of the work and has once made me stay an hour longer at work. She walked out on her shift. It got so busy I wasn't able to eat. So went home hungry.   Anyway, she's always leaning or bending over on a table while using her phone. Decided to report her to the boss. So I took a picture of her using her phone while she's leaning on a table. It was at 4 pm, 2 hours later she was still on her phone. I wanted to show the boss how long she stays on her phone while I do all the work. Went to take another picture. She was bending over on a table while using her phone. Took a picture. After talking about a picture I turn around and see another employee looking at me.  Then I thought. wait... It looks like I took a picture of her butt since she's bending over while wearing tight jeans... Oh no. I wanted to explain why I took a pic but I doubt they would believe me.

10e3g7	At the start of last year I was thriving. I lived in a mansion with my idols, I had a great job, a meme page with 10,000+ followers that idol sized me and was dating the most incredible woman on the planet. We had been friends for about 12 years and decided to give it a shot. This woman was epic. She ran a bunch of businesses, was a novelist and one of the most well known models in her industry. To my surprise the woman was completely in love with me. I was guttertrash compared to her but for some reason she was smitten. Everything was going amazingly until one morning I woke up and found out that my housemate had tried to kill himself. That‚Äôs when the drinking started. Booze, coke and massive levels of self sabotage just to deal with the pain which resulted in breakup. From that point on things got worse. I was now in a house I couldn‚Äôt afford. She was sleeping with all of my friends and my mental health was plummeting. I started to lose my mind and all of my friends. The thousands of people that looked up to me now hated me and i was starting to find out that all of the people I trusted in my close circle were turning her against me just so they could hook up with her which made mending the friendship extremely difficult. As things got worse with us so did every other aspect of my life. I ended up in hospital multiple times. Got arrested. My clothing label was in the bin, no record label wanted anything to do with me, the fashion scene hated me and the music scene that raised me now wanted nothing to do with me. My entire lifes work is shattered. The women that admired me now hate my guts. My heroes are concerned for me. I have no friends left and now I‚Äôm sleeping on my mums boyfriends couch out in the middle of nowhere with $50 to my name. My only option at this point is to walk into the wilderness and put a fucking bullet between my eyes. From being one of the most beloved people in this country to one of the most disliked.

arudyqc	So basically I realized that I made it habit and was obsessed with stalking my ex friend's various pages.    Our friendship got too intense way too quickly and it filled a void in my life. We could relate on so many levels and it felt like I had someone that understood me on a different level. We both had traumatic upbringings, we were both mixed asians in an area where there were few asians in general, had the same interests, wanted to go college at the same school, and we lived right next door. There were red flags that I ignored at first but I actually had a friend that didn't constantly belittle me and actually understood how I felt. It was great, but after a while it got too much. It was too much especially after my mom passed my senior year of high school and then the pandemic hit.   We got very codependent. But after a lot of drama and me finally gaining a back bone, we stopped being friends. It was very messy. My friends and I wrote them a letter about how fucked up they were as a person. And it felt like it was needed since this ex friend had lied (or well tried to since we had evidence of everything mentioned) about their race (claiming to be black and asian when they're white and asian, their age (which was dumb since I was there celebrating their birthdays with their family), and their relationship status. That last one was very messed up because it hurt multiple people and involved them lying about their sexuality and manipulating everyone. Cheating, sexting, and just slandering people was wrong. They even tried to write me a letter to apologize and they couldn't even do that right. They never apologized to the other people they hurt and what they said sorry for was small compared to very big issues we had with them. It was too late to apologize when they were moving out of town the very next day and wasn't gonna see everyone ever again. It was to make themselves feel better. Their own ego.   I didn't want to see them ever again and was glad that they were gone. But then they tried to get people fired from our job and suddenly I had to know what was going on. Then they were nominated for best couple at our old school and I needed to alert everyone that they were a lying snake. Then it was them going to the same college as me and living on campus. I had always planned to live on campus after I got my shit together and I was terrified that I would see them in person. I already knew that they probably bad mouthed me to other people, the same way they did their past friendships to me. Then they had an activist account talking about "black love" and it was ridiculous.  They preach about friendship and being honest when they were the complete opposite. Saying to respect boundaries when they yelled at me when I tried to enforce my own. Telling me that I was unfair to ask space now after months of them being there for me, months when my mom was in the hospital as a vegetable and then died at 40 years old. Yeah sureee, I was unfair to want some support. Sure go on and preach about love and boundaries.   Then I started to see how even though they kept info sparse, I could tell that they tried to be more sneaky on who they were seeing. That even though they're in a relationship, they're still cheating. That they still try to present this picture perfect image, but if you knew the signs and which pages to check, certain things were happening in the background. They still had their old habits that brought their downfall. Suddenly it became a morbid curiosity and need for revenge to see if they'll ever learn their lesson. And I already know from hints on their accounts that they had another huge friendship fallout. The same kind that happened with me and their past friend groups too. It was sad and pathetic seeing that tbh. I almost felt pity for them.   And then recently, they transferred schools and now I don't really have a reason to check anymore. I find myself not checking as much. I'm not worried about running into them anymore and at this rate we won't know any of the same people. They're just someone I used to know. A shitty person but at this rate, a few people in my life fit that mold now. My anger and pain has subsided. My curiosity is gone after realizing that they'll just go through the same cycle over and over with no idea as to why. And with this feeling of wanting to let it go now, I realized how bad I let myself check their every move. While I learned a lot about the kinds of people I want (or don't want) around me, I have to stop checking their accounts. We're strangers at this point and no amount of me stalking their pages will heal the damage they've done. I let myself become too obsessive, thinking that it will help. But it didn't. And it won't. It never will. I'm gonna move on and focus on other stuff I actually enjoy and like.	1643187939.0	sd1qha	/r/offmychest/comments/sd1qha/was_obsessed_but_not_anymore/	Was Obsessed But Not Anymore?
ikijw	I hate it, this feeling that there isnt more that I can do. Pretty much at this point it's all on God/Universe that'll take care of things from here.   I have done all I can and trusted my instincts, guidances from the higher powers to get this far. Now all that there is left is to wait, and pray. The most frustrating part is not knowing when your desired outcome is coming and I feel helpless with the only option I have left is to wait.   This sentiment is applicable to a range of things, but for my thing its sometimes hard to be patient, to trust in god/universe that everything is working in my favor and what ive been experiencing thus far is meant to happen.	1643188038.0	sd1r8u	/r/offmychest/comments/sd1r8u/nothing_more_that_i_can_do/	Nothing more that I can do

ga52n9lx	I have this online friend, we talked about our problems and supported each other when things went bad. We were both very lonely people when we met and helped each other through this.  I feel so regretful for how I‚Äôve been lately. They sent me some messages a few days back about how they were feeling lonely and I didn‚Äôt respond. I don‚Äôt know why, I just didn‚Äôt have much energy the last few days and was feeling lonely myself. I feel so horrible that I ignored them, and now they‚Äôve told me they don‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore.   Honestly, I‚Äôm more upset about this because I know they didn‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to in real life whereas I‚Äôve made a few friends at college who I can talk to so I can survive mentally without our friendship, but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve screwed up this person‚Äôs entire life by not being there when they needed me, and that they‚Äôll fall back into a pit of depression because they don‚Äôt feel like they have anyone.

baaycwa4	Man, gotta love the pettiness of some people. One of my ex‚Äôs friends invited me to play with him in a multiplayer video game. And from looking at the friend‚Äôs video game profile I could see he was playing with my ex. At that moment I wasn‚Äôt able to join the friend in the game, so I messaged him and said I was busy but I‚Äôd join in later. Later on, I was able to join so I told him that. Pretty sure he didn‚Äôt see my message unfortunately üòÖ however the guy went offline soon after. I thought maybe my ex had something to do with the situation, so I unblocked him on Twitter and messaged him, asking if he knew anything about his friend inviting me to play the game with them. I checked to see if he had seen the message later and indeed he had. So I dismissed it and went on with my life. About a half hour later I checked the messages again because I‚Äôm weird like that‚Ä¶and guess what? He had blocked me üòÇ Like, seriously? If he wasn‚Äôt a part of the invitation he could‚Äôve just said so and I wouldn‚Äôt of said anything else after that. But nah he blocked me. So I blocked him again back and messaged his friend again asking about his motivation of inviting me to play the game with them. Pretty sure I won‚Äôt get an answer but I‚Äôm curious so why not, Lolol. I thought I had known my ex‚Äôs true colors after the breakup but nope, he‚Äôs so much worse than I thought, it‚Äôs awesome üòÇ  Gotta give him kudos for being so ruthless though, blocking me after I asked a simple question that he could‚Äôve just said a simple yes or no to. No, he just straight up blocked me, haha. Pretty hilarious in my opinion. Welp now I know he wants nothing to do with me, pfffft.

39sip3b0	I (20f) am a college student who lives in an off campus apartment on the ground floor. My roommate (20f) and I moved into the apartment in August and up until this Saturday night, there had been no problems.   Well, sort of. For the last few weeks I've had this weird feeling that I was being watched. I occasionally heard leaves crunching outside the sliding patio doors at night. And sometimes I would even hear male voices very close by. I had convinced myself that the creepy gut feeling and the noises at night were all in my head - just my anxiety, or maybe even delusions.   The rear of my apartment is situated on a slope that leads down to the main road of the complex, with my bedroom, my roommate's bedroom, and well as the patio windows facing the street. (It's fair to say that it would be very unusual for someone to just "accidentally" be right outside my apartment, mainly due to the slope.) Right outside my bedroom window there's a decently sized tree as well as a great deal of vegetation (vines) on the ground. There are also two streetlights that provide some light- enough to see clearly if all lights in my room are off.    It was around 2 AM and I was doing my usual Saturday night routine: laying in bed, listening to music with over-ear headphones, and snuggling with my kitty. I had the blinds down and closed like I always did at night, but I didn't have curtains and so there was a small crack in the blinds right by my bed in which someone could park through.   As it turns out, someone definitely did.   As I was relaxing in bed, my cat suddenly looked toward my window and appeared to be spooked by something. I immediately took off my headphones and heard very distinctive leaf crunching noises right outside my window. My heart started racing. I realized that I had forgotten to lock my window that night after I had smoked with a friend. Absolutely terrified, I peaked out the small gap in the blinds and a dark shape moved in front of the glass, just inches from my face.  I felt like I was in some terrible horror movie. Typical: the stupid college girl forgets to lock her window and gets brutally murdered. I knew I had to do something before the person outside could try opening the window. Practically shitting myself, I banged on the window with my fist and screamed "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE" which thankfully scared him off and also alerted my roommate.  I couldn't make out any facial features because there had been lights on in my room but I called the police anyways to file a report. By the time officers came by, he was long gone.   Now I'm extra careful about locking windows and doors, and I even got some blackout curtains. But just a few mins ago I thought I heard something outside my window and my heart started racing like it did on Saturday. Now I can't sleep to save my life.  I feel so disgusted knowing that this guy (I am assuming it was a male but obviously I have no way of knowing) may have watched me in bed for weeks. I have never felt so afraid.	1643189282.0	sd21ej	/r/offmychest/comments/sd21ej/someone_has_been_watching_me_for_weeks_and_now_i/	Someone has been watching me for weeks and now I can't sleep because I'm terrified
7mbc4n4w	My brother (29) and I (f25) have always had a tumultuous relationship, he was emotionally abusive to me since early adolescence, and it could be very extreme, at best when there was nothing happening, he simply never spoke to me, and every attempt from me to strike up a conversation was met with rejection, and untill we were both at uni, he never even called me by name, when he referred to me as he would talk with my mom it was always "your daughter" "that one".. etc. I should say that his behavior became like this around the time my father left the family, and as my mother once told me, in a way he took out all of his anger on me. When we got older, things became slowly better, or more accurately it became quieter. He would still do some messed up things, but it wasn't as bad, although I suspect it's also because I stopped trying to get him to like me as much as I used to. But we just didn't really have a relationship, we rarely spoke to each other. Three years ago he moved to live overseas, I've seen him only once since. He's never made any effort with me to talk or anything, except very occasionally. and I also realized how big of a grudge I still hold against him, I started getting these flashbacks of the stuff he did, the fights, the cruelty and I'd feel like my heart was about to burst. Last year, I was going through some rough personal things, and he coincidentally called me on a particularly awful day, he asked me what was wrong I said nothing, and he said something is wrong I know you, and I lashed out on him, I told him no you don't know me and you never tried to do so. He immediately said okay I'll hang up. And then I partly regretted it, so I said I was sorry for hurting his feelings but it's because of all this shit you put me through, and I just went on  letting it all out, everything he did everything he made me feel. At the end he said he didn't know why he acted that way but that he loved me and from that day on he'd try to talk to me more in order to rebuild our relationship. I was happy but then it became clear those were just empty words, he didn't really try at all, and when I did try to text he would ignore me, and then one time as I was trying to be humorous and strike up some conversation he just said I have nothing to say. Last night we had an argument over something not that important, he came to ask me why I didn't do a certain thing and I just lost my shit at his condescension, I told him I didn't like his tone or the fact that he never talked to me unless it was to demand things, he said I just love victimizing myself and that he doesn't care what happens in my life anymore and he's never gonna talk to me again (as if that wasn't already the case) after a while I texted him and apologized for reacting harshly and that it was because I always feel like he's attacking me even when it's not really the case. He left me on read. And I felt like an even bigger idiot, because deep down I know that if the shoe was on the other foot I would never get such an apology or acknowledgement, I mean even when I let it all out with him last year I didn't get an actual apology. And I regret that I apologized so bad, he didn't deserve it at all.  I just can't believe how even after all these years he still lords his "love" over me, and it's like at any argument he threatens to take it away from me because it's the consequences of my bad behavior/actions. And he succeeds in making me feel awful about it even though I know I never even really had any of his affection in the first place. But it's like that version of him that's loving and compassionate that I keep looking for is now inaccessible to me. And it's my fault. He brings out the worst in me, I'm sick and tired of chasing him, it's like I'm still fifteen and desperate for him to love me back. I know I'm not perfect either and I certainly was in the wrong sometimes too, but I always regret even as I'm saying the words and I always make sure I apologize and explain myself no matter how hard I find it. He never does, he likes to be as cruel as possible just for the pleasure of proving me wrong, and he's never cared about the damage he caused. I really think this is the last straw, I just wish I didn't feel so awful. I'm sorry for this huge rant, I just didn't know how to get it off my chest.	1643189663.0	sd24pn	/r/offmychest/comments/sd24pn/i_dont_think_i_want_my_brother_in_my_life_anymore/	I don't think I want my brother in my life anymore
8lit4xdk	I‚Äôm 20 years old. I‚Äôve been afraid of the dentist for so long. I‚Äôve been once, many years ago. Before I had cavities.   My dental hygiene has never been good. I was never pushed to take care of my teeth so I didn‚Äôt. In high school my two bottom left molars both broke/cracked. It didn‚Äôt hurt. They were just broken. I knew this was an issue but I ignored it because I‚Äôve been so afraid of the dentist.   They‚Äôve been hurting a bit on and off for a few months. I ignored it. Three days ago they started hurting and they haven‚Äôt stopped. It‚Äôs excruciating. I went to the dentist yesterday. Both are decaying and infected. There‚Äôs an abscess under one of them. They gave me Norco and 800mg ibuprofen to alternate between as well as antibiotics.   Since then it hasn‚Äôt let up. It‚Äôs only gotten worse. I ended up taking both medications together and even then I only got a little bit of relief.   I can‚Äôt take anything else for another hour. I‚Äôve been awake since 2AM. It‚Äôs 4:30AM now. The only thing I can think about it how much it fucking hurts. I haven‚Äôt stopped crying since I woke up. It feels like there‚Äôs a hot knife pressing into my tooth and the entire lower half of this side of my face hurts and is swollen.   I can‚Äôt drive because of the medication so I‚Äôd be relying on my parents for a trip to the ER, and it‚Äôs 4:30AM so I can‚Äôt wake them up. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do.   Y‚Äôall. Im so fucking serious. Take care of your teeth. Go to the fucking dentist. I swear to god this pain isn‚Äôt fucking worth it.	1643189702.0	sd250h	/r/offmychest/comments/sd250h/please_for_the_love_of_fuck_take_care_of_your/	Please for the love of fuck take care of your teeth and go to the dentist

It's so much fun hanging out again, with people that treat me like a woman, and like I actually deserve respect, which all feels alien still. Idk, I'm rambling, I'm high.

cjpb3p3p	In my personal life I still get a lot of shit about this so I'd assume this is still unpopular in the general masses.  I  rent a two bedroom apartment, and have the bare minimum. Why? Is it  because I don't like stuff? Is it because I don't like fun in life?  No,  it's none of these. It's because I value experiences more than material  things and often experiences - especially trips, hobbies, can be a lot  more expensive than buying things and you need a lot of money saved to  travel and have expensive outdoor hobbies.  I have one table, one bed, and one desk setup in an office in the second bedroom. For food, I shop for 2 weeks at a time.  Minimalism also helps with being able to move cities, meet new people, and experience new things in life.  People  see my life as a minimalist as going extreme but at the same time I  don't have debt, I don't have a car loan, and I don't have a ton of  money out in a credit card since my apartment isn't filled with a bunch  of stuff I don't really need.  Another  perk I've found is there's nothing that you can steal physically from  me if I don't have anything besides a desk, a table, a laptop and some  games lying around. All of which are easily replaceable. I've heard of  break-in's before in surrounding neighborhoods where people would have  their entire apartment or house cleared out, and you can't steal from  someone who doesn't keep a lot around.  I'm  also able to save up a lot of cash, invest a lot of money in stocks and  retirement as a minimalist. What I am really buying here is my freedom,  options, and that takes a lot of money to actually go out and purchase,  and it is far more valuable than anything physical I could buy.  Minimalism is not about suffering, it's about getting the most out of what life offers and the most expensive things to buy - freedom, options, flexibility, the ability to not need a job, are very expensive and the price tag is giving up all of my consumer purchases.	1643190134.0	sd28lk	/r/offmychest/comments/sd28lk/minimalism_is_not_missing_out_on_life/	Minimalism is not missing out on life
2yjgfchn	I'm (32f) sorta friends with my brother's (29m) girlfriend (26f), but she gets on my nerves sometimes. It boils down to: she's an anti-vaxxer who always thinks she's the authority on anything medicine related. Her mom is an antivaxx nurse, so she thinks that means she knows a lot as well on the topic of health even though she herself isn't in the field. I'll mention something health related and she'll immediately tell me I'm wrong. Most of the time I stay quiet but sometimes I disagree with her. The problem is my brother thinks I am arguing or being disrespectful when I say I disagree with her, and he will get angry at me. I do get annoyed at her personality, but the problem is my brother will watch me and growl at me and tell me to calm down if I express any little frustration. (I don't get crazy or explosive). I feel me and his girlfriend are two adults and we can respectfully disagree with each other, but he feels the need to get angry and intimidate me on her behalf. He's also 2x my weight and a male. One time my brother and I did get into a disagreement and we weren't talking, every time I'd peacefully walk by the two of them he'd make an exaggerated motion and act like he was shielding her from me. He has gotten in my face and has explosively yelled at me before for other reasons. I honestly think he would fight me for her, if me and her ever truly got into an argument. I'm forced to interact with them due to my living situation with my mom, who watches their children all the time. They live next door. I just wish I can get my own space and never have to interact with them again. He thinks he's in the right and I wish he'd see that it's 2-on-1 and this is bullying behaviour.	1643190600.0	sd2cax	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2cax/my_brother_bullies_me/	My brother bullies me

cvdw5ozt	  I thought I needed a man to complete me.  But I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs my children that I‚Äôm in love with.   Of course I want to feel wanted and appreciated by a male who I believe in and holds the same heart values as I do.  But I‚Äôve been spending far too much of my personal energy on that pursuit while the people who need me the most, the people who benefit directly from my presence, the people whose lives I can make the biggest difference in being a part of, are those right in front of me.  I pursued others when I thought it would lead to my happiness and there have been some whose connections with just blew my mind.  One in particular.  He was and still is so special and our connection, one in a billion.  Yet choosing him would pull me away from them and could potentially crush their little hearts.  I would never want them to feel abandoned.  They didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve that.  In fact there‚Äôs time to give them a good foundation of healthy loving relationships and learn the basics of living a good life so that when the day comes for them to go on their own, they are strong independent and can pursue and accomplish their dreams.   This has become glaringly obvious and I know what I have to do.  I hope he understands my situation and knows that if things were different, I would choose him, my true soulmate.    I wish him a lifetime of happiness and personal success, and that the emptiness in his heart is replaced by joy and fulfilment, in whatever form that manifests.   I will love him until the end of time and hope that I can meet him again under better circumstances, whether it is this or next lifetime.   Meanwhile, I‚Äôm devoted to my beautiful children and I choose them.	1643190912.0	sd2f3d	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2f3d/i_choose_my_children/	I choose my children
cxoj2ohk	20 M here and procrastination is ruining my life. Whenever I want to start something, I look back and think that if I have not procrastinated during my earlier times, I could have been more successful by now.  I feel that the advice and all other advices for procrastination is just useless. Just doing it does not help at all.  I will be studying abroad soon in 1-2 weeks time and because of my procrastination, I am severely unprepared.  Even Jesus or God can't help me, I am punished by them.  In fact, I dunno if I can even cope with the course material, I have not even studied yet! I don't even know how to cook by myself or clean by myself.  Procrastination advices don't work for me. And fuck myself, I think my study abroad experience will turn out bad because of my procrastination issues. I will never reach my potential and I will always be poor or hungry and not successful thanks to fucking PROCRASTINATION THAT HANDICAPS ME!  GOD PUNISHED ME FOR PROCRASTINATING!

8fnc0pxc	20 M here and procrastination is ruining my life. Whenever I want to start something, I look back and think that if I have not procrastinated during my earlier times, I could have been more successful by now.  I feel that the advice and all other advices for procrastination is just useless. Just doing it does not help at all.  I will be studying abroad soon in 1-2 weeks time and because of my procrastination, I am severely unprepared.  Even Jesus or God can't help me, I am punished by them.  In fact, I dunno if I can even cope with the course material, I have not even studied yet! I don't even know how to cook by myself or clean by myself.  Procrastination advices don't work for me. And fuck myself, I think my study abroad experience will turn out bad because of my procrastination issues. I will never reach my potential and I will always be poor or hungry and not successful thanks to fucking PROCRASTINATION THAT HANDICAPS ME!  GOD PUNISHED ME FOR PROCRASTINATING!  I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF BECAUSE OF PROCRASTINATION	1643191077.0	sd2ghb	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2ghb/fuck_myself_and_fuck_procrastination/	Fuck myself and fuck procrastination
8kvwrh8o	I've been working for the same company for 4 years, made a few promotions and got more and more responsibilities over the past few years. I'm ambitious and i love taking charge and creating processes to make things go smoother, easier and faster, but i'm hitting a fork in the road  This past year was crazy. Someone significant left my team, and i basically took over half of their job on top of my own responsibilities. I created documents and onboardings to make it easier for the new hires that were supposed to replace them to get acquainted with the work. It's been 8 months, and i am still doing this other person's job and people are not taking their own responsibilities.   I'm getting more and more frustrated. I had so many calls explaining things, even made tutorials for people where i explain step by step what to do and why. They skip steps, mess up the files, ask me questions that are a quick google search away  I'm getting so unmotivated, work just feels like a drag at this point	1643191436.0	sd2k82	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2k82/my_job_makes_me_feel_like_im_pulling_on_a_dead/	My job makes me feel like i'm pulling on a dead horse
itrposwx	There's so much going on, it's hard to all describe.  1. I turned 18 a few months ago, and I want nothing more than to feel like an adult and have my own place, or at least some more space. Our house is too small and I feel like I'll never be able to get out. The houses are so expensive in this country, and I've been told there is an almost 12 year waiting list before you could even get a home on your own. 2. I have no money. While I grew up my parents were in debt, they never taught me about money and i didn't have my own money until I was 17. I was in a group home for 3 years in my teens which was fucking traumatic (more on that later) and even they never told me how to spend money, how to manage it. All I was ever told was that they didn't want me to end up like my parents. How nice... I'm always worrying because I don't know if i could even afford my own insurance. I got some payments that suddenly fucking HALVED because they calculate my parents income to decide how much i get. Because their income increased in 2020, I now have even less money. 3. I have school, internship, and work. I barely have free time, I'm always tired, I just want to call in sick to everything. It's too much, but I have no choice. 4. There's no good place for therapy. I go to a place now but all i do is talk and talk. No advice, just listening. 5. The group home I lived in from 14 to nearly 18 was abusive, mentally. The owner hated me, despised my hobbies, always criticized me. I was always fat, spoiled and manipulative to her. Sometimes I could just see a car that looks like hers and i'll freak out. I'm so insecure about everything and scared of everything... 6. I just don't feel like I'm good enough. Not pretty enough, not interesting enough... I'm too introverted and antisocial to be good at making friends. I never had them. Fuck, I tried so hard in the first week of uni/trade school but I still got pushed away by everyone. Long live a class full of pretty girls, I guess. 7. I'm a gaming fanatic. I love meeting people like this and it was my one outlet and way to meet people. My laptop is now broken, and I can't afford a new pc for at least a few years.  I just feel awful, hopeless, and out of control... I can't afford anything, I can't even live on my own. I can't clean my room, I can't even sleep in there. My parents have been mad because I refuse to sleep there and just sleep downstairs on the couch. It doesn't feel like my room, it feels cramped and dirty... It just makes me sad.   I'll never be able to afford anything, and I'll never get the freedom I need and want. I feel selfish, selfish and stupid for making my parents upset with my crying, whining and hopelessness. I'm... stuck.	1643191583.0	sd2lex	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2lex/i_feel_incredibly_fucking_hopeless/	I feel incredibly fucking hopeless.
2gnlq0sl	So I've lived in this apt complex for like 8 months. I'm on the bottom floor and the building was built in the 60's so the ceilings are wood, thin, and creek anytime someone makes the slightest movement. Building owner renovated the upstairs with wooden floors (why not carpet upstairs to dampen the noise?) Anyways.. I have the loudest neighbors. I'm the only one in my 1 bedroom apartment, their's is the exact same size as mine and they have FOUR people living there. A man, his wife, kid, and brother. The kid 9 years old, loud as fuck, and runs around until 3am most nights. His parents are pot heads and seemingly fuck ups. The brother is just some weird dude who never makes eye contact in passing. They blast loud, bassy music all the time. I first approached them to let them know how loud they were being but they just continued. So I reached out to the land lord and she came by and agreed their music was far too loud, so she talked to them... it just made things worse. Now they seem to be playing music throughout the night out of spite. Been going on like this for the last couple months. My mom died suddenly a couple months back and they woke me up that day at 5am blasting their music.  I'm pretty fed up at this point so I've decided to move out. But I can't help but feel like I need to settle the score somehow. I've had my fair share of conflicts with people in the past and always picked my battles. It just feels like letting this one go isn't an option. Almost feels like I owe it to karma to bring things back to a nice equilibrium. Many of you aren't going to like this plan and feel free to say so. Two of the tenants bought newer cars, one has a gas tank that doesn't have a latch that locks it..... I'm going to pour 3 gallons of water in it. The other I'm going to take some 40 grit sandpaper and scratch the shit outa his ride. Planning on doing this a few weeks after I leave to avoid suspicion. I've never vandalized anything before in my life. But this feels beyond well earned. If you have any suggestions on tweaks to my plan or an alternative retaliation please let me hear it.	1643191720.0	sd2mj7	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2mj7/worst_neighbors_ever_heres_my_plan_of_revenge/	Worst neighbors ever... here's my plan of revenge
93inbfwp	I'm cold. I feel like I'm boiling. I'm tired. I need to stretch and move around even when im sitting down. Everything is sore, but I'm fine. I'm too tired to even acknowledge the anxiety that is still here. I don't know what my problem is.  I'm only half here, it's suffering. I cannot focus. My mask helps with my anxiety, so unlike most people, I want to wear it all the time. It bothers my face, it's too itchy.  I'm having tests and exams all the time even tomorrow and the day after and next week and I cannot focus and i feel horrible.  I "woke up" in the middle of class, I was somewhere else. I was actually sleeping with eyes open I cannot remember shit. I woke up to my hand holding my notebook's pages, I want to rip it out I want to crumple it so much.  I'm sitting here with my coat on, I look stupid I know but I can't take it off. Too much anxiety.  I cannot miss any more classes this year. I still have.

alo2n57e	A recruiter from a company I'd rather not name reached out to me via LinkedIn, as apparently they have a job opening and I'd be "a good fit for the role." I looked into the job description and was interested in the company and the job itself.  After some back-and-forth via email, she scheduled a phone interview (it wasn't set at a specific time, just "in the afternoon" but I didn't mind because I was available during the afternoon). No call. At 6pm, I shot her an email asking what happened, and then she replied that she was just about to message me to tell me we had to reschedule. I agreed and I was advised to keep my lines open the next day.  And so we did. Now it's 6pm again and I never received a call. Frankly I'm a bit insulted at this point. I have a lot of anxiety so interviews such as this have me on my toes until it's over. So I had to deal with my damn nerves over nothing.   Anyway, part of me is torn as to whether I should email her to ask what happened this time, as honestly I really am interested in the role. I have a job now, but I've been looking for new and better opportunities lately so I'd thought this could me my shot. At the same time I want to just move on but let the recruiter know that what she did was a bit unprofessional, keeping me hanging and postponing our call without any word beforehand.   It was just a sucky experience overall.	1643192282.0	sd2rm8	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2rm8/recruiter_misses_scheduled_interview_misses_again/	Recruiter misses scheduled interview, misses again after rescheduling

5lxg0nmm	Feeling so so sick rn   I don‚Äôt know if this is all from endo or something else as well. I get so so sick and faint when I stand / walk for too long (20ish min)   I was at the shops and I almost fainted, like I was stumbling and couldn‚Äôt really walk normal cause I was so lightheaded and in so much pain. And then I got home and my mum asked me if I wanted to go out with her to apply for jobs, I said no maybe another day because I had walked 1h + already (the recommended by doc was 30min) and I was feeling really sick. She got annoyed and said ‚Äòyou only walked for an hour‚Äô and was angry at me for *being in pain*. And then they had ppl over for dinner and made me go up and down the stairs to get glasses and drinks and stuff. I stg one day ima just collapse. I was so close to fainting.   I‚Äôm so sick of this. It‚Äôs scary. I‚Äôm always in pain, my meds aren‚Äôt working, my parents don‚Äôt believe me (even though I have a diagnosis), I‚Äôm so so scared for school starting back.  I will be standing up a lot, how can I even focus in so much pain? It‚Äôs terrible and I just want it to go away. My parents don‚Äôt help. When I was 14, and crying about my very recent diagnosis, my dad said ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been in more pain than you ever have so stop complaining‚Äô.

zlhi5	Disclaimer I never watched Encanto and now I'm thinking of never watching it out of spite. I don't know if it's a good movie or not.  Camilo is a Latino artist who recently resurfaced. He won a Latin Grammy and got nominated for a regular Grammy. He's really popular in Spanish speaking countries but he hasn't released English language songs so he's probably not known elsewhere. He's made a bunch of feel good songs, something of a rarity in my country, so I've really gravitated towards his music.  I looked Camilo up recently on twitter but it's filled with what I think are weird fanart about a character named Camilo and a bunch of discussions about that character's gender and sexuality so I investigated more and apparently it's a character from Encanto.  Couldn't they have not chosen to use the name of an active artist or at least used the name of a shitty one like Sebasti√°n Yatra? This would probably be like releasing a movie with a character named Shakira in the early 2000s.  What's worse is it worsens Google's bias against non - anglophone artists. I've been listening to Latin music almost exclusively but then I listen to one collaboration between Camila Cabello and two Latino artists and now it almost exclusively recommends me Camila's songs. Same thing happened with Maluma and The week-end, DY and Katy Perry, and Karol G and Nicki Minaj.  I'm just worried Camilo's work gets overshadowed.	1643193160.0	sd2zxb	/r/offmychest/comments/sd2zxb/im_starting_to_resent_disneys_encanto_because_now/	I'm starting to resent Disney's Encanto because now it overshadows one of my favorite Latino artists, Camilo

4jynnitw	It has been hard in almost every sector of my life. Especially, from September (even tho I managed to succeed in one of my major problems, It caused secondary effects) to the beginning of December. Where I was in a deep severe depression (suicidal thoughts, diet distortion, lack of sleep at night/too much sleep in the morning, headache + sleep apnea, self hurting, and self-punishment). Nothing of these were new, it has been like that for almost 4 years, except, this time was worse and prolonged.   I have so much stuff going on in my head, it's a nightmare (they are not negative thoughts, just self-talking, but it's like people screaming in my ears, not all the time). Also, I don't need someone to rely on or talk to, I have managed to be independent and solve my own things by myself, except for one.  The good news, I guess, is that I'm in a rest phase (not in depression, neither happy, just stable) and that at least I'm trying to love myself because although I have the confidence and trust in myself, I still don't love my existence. Also now I look back and see that I have grown as a person, but that's what the world expects from you right? be strong and bla bla bla, don't know why am I pointing it out as If I needed an award or smth for doing what I have to lol	1643194669.0	sd3d1h	/r/offmychest/comments/sd3d1h/i_need_a_relief/	I need a relief.
3434fn0h	Hey everyone,  I don't want to make this post too long for you to read, so I'm going to keep it simple and cut right to the chase. It's going to sound a little weird.  A few years ago, I discovered the ability to "channel".  I call it channeling because I don't have another word that accurately describes what is that I mean.  Basically, I learnt to be able to, sort of, pull words out from my mind that aren't what I would normally think or say.  It's really difficult to explain but I'm not the only person in the world who believes they have discovered this.  What I have discovered would, as hard as it might be to believe, change the way that people think about the mind and where words come from.  Forget that I call it channeling, because that implies that you can actually receive words from a place other than your mind and frankly it's not important whether that's true or not in order for you to be able to experience it.  I will try my best to demonstrate how to do this.  You can do it when thinking, speaking or writing. As long as words are being formulated you can tap in, for lack of a better term, to this other mode of receiving words that I'll demonstrate for you in a moment.  I'm about to write something using this "ability" to get words from this other mode of thinking. I don't know what I'm about to write and it may not make the most amount of sense but it should definitely sound strange.  @@@  Have you seen the way to the fire? It is not useful to dwell in the past. You can see that I write the words softly and sweetly and narrate the most important facets of human understanding. Does it ring a bell? No it does not.  @@@   Ok, so it's not important what I'm actually saying, what is important is that this technique is not just used by me. It is known to many people around the world and cult and religious leaders have used it for millenia in order to basically brainwash people into believing a bunch of weird shit.  I do believe that is this information were to go viral, eventually someone will come along and agree with what I'm saying. So far, my posts do not gain enough attention to reach a wider enough audience that someone with the same opinion is able to chime in.  Hopefully this doesn't all sound too insane, but what I'm suggesting is pretty crazy but honestly think that this phenomena is behind most of the insanity in the world.  Would be keen to get your thoughts!  If you agree with me, please leave a comment so that people can see that I'm not the only person in the world to have this opinion.  Cheers!	1643194699.0	sd3da5	/r/offmychest/comments/sd3da5/i_discovered_something_i_feel_compelled_to_share/	I discovered something I feel compelled to share.

5a98c546	My current partner and I met through working together. Once we were on the same team together it became abundantly clear how well we worked together, always on the same wavelength, same level of ambition and we smashed so many goals together. We ultimately ended up in a relationship together  but was a tricky one to navigate because it was frowned upon to have work romances at the company. We didn't want our professional reputations tarnished so we kept it under wraps but it caused a level of stress inevitably.   We both also had a lot of issues with the company (heck, everyone did), and so we both ended up moving on (to continue our relationship without added stress & due to the issues at the company). We both work in software, in Product Management. He's gone on to become a GM and then CEO at a startup, and I've joined a startup as their first Product Manager to build it the Product team & processes.  Both of our jobs now are great on paper, and we've been in them for 6-12 months (he moved on before I did), but there's just something missing... We've spoken about it often and both miss working together.   As an aside our relationship is fantastic, we are just so in tune with each other in every way - so when we have challenges at work and colleagues we have to deal with that just aren't up to par with the level we expect / hope for then it becomes easy to think "Man I wish I still worked with my partner" because we just... get it.  Don't get me wrong, I have some fantastic colleagues, but still nothing compares to the times when my partner & I worked together. It's always lacklustre in comparison, I'm never quite as hyped, quite as empowered, quite as inspired... I'm cognizant that a level of that when working with my partner was due to the attraction we had, but it doesn't take away from how well we worked together.  We're both in the startup space, and he's always had dreams of starting and running his own company one day... We've even talked about how amazing it would be to be co-founders together one day, but obviously you need the right idea to get that started. Maybe it's a pipe dream... But either way I don't know if I'll ever enjoy work as much as I did when I was working with my partner.	1643195687.0	sd3mxh	/r/offmychest/comments/sd3mxh/i_miss_working_with_my_boyfriend/	I miss working with my boyfriend
h2ubew1r	I've wanted to write you , I've wanted to talk to you, I've wanted to Express a lot. And in my sober mind I know that is probably the exact opposite of everything you want. Please understand I am writing to you because I am led to. I've had deep remorse and harrowing revelations of the boy I once was. I was ashamed , embarrassed,¬† and distraught.¬† What pain and turmoil I brought to you with complete disregard to your sweet heart and soul. How careless I was with your love and it will be something i will never forget. I've lived with this unbearable guilt since the day I last saw you and wanted you to know i am so much more than sorry. I know that might seem like an easy thing to hear but believe when I say , that is the hardest thing I've had to reconcile with in my short lived life here on this earth.¬† I have no words, and nothing I can say or write will bring the correct meaning to the feeling I have in my broken heart. I couldn't stand to live with myself for quite some time and strayed further and further from becoming the human I was sent here to be. I was a plague and a disease upon our relationship and our lives. I understand the words you've said many times , " I wish we met later in life" and oh how those words tear through me like a seething knife. I am sorry. I am sorry for not only my actions and demeanor,¬† but of the lasting imprint I've made upon you, your family , and this world . It is an irreparable deed , and horrifyingly enough that deed has been done. I hurt everyday .. I wish I can explain to you with my heart who I am. I am a person that was enraged and evil,¬† I was broken, I was a person that was beside myself, a person that wasnt me. I was distrustful, conniving with no intent of functioninality or any sense of normalcy. No sense of humane being. I was a person incapable of love. I didnt know it at the time but that person was calling out for help and didnt know how to obtain it, that person was scared , that person was battling the hardest battle I've ever endured.¬† And that was learning how to love myself for the first time in my existence. Well I can tell you I learned the absolute hardest way when my light , my star began to dim. My world , and everything in it I had always taken for granted , had left. And rightly so . What a traumatic experience,¬† and an experience I will never forget. I think about you every single day and I have zero doubt in my mind you are doing wonderful. I want you to know you are the only person I've every truly loved and it is the worst , most heart breaking thing to write and reread. You are a saint and an angel sent to this earth as I was a hindrance , a ball and chain and I am sorry. I can not say it enough and it will never translate with how I so deservingly ache. I have taken responsibility for my actions and gotten sober and have fought my demons tooth and nail and want to thank you. For I believe you have been the light at the end I hope for . I am not asking you to take me back. But I am asking for something¬† if you can ever find in your heart to do so. I am asking so I can be at peace within my self and my heart and my soul. I am asking for forgiveness . I have made leaps and bounds within my walk and journey on my new path of life and find it harder and harder every day to continue past this hurdle. "This hurdle" is not a term I like but a term I've been acquainted with awfully too well. It's become a daily reoccurrence of that day and many days repeating over and over to no end, to no avail. I have relived my past in utter torment and complete shame briefly destroying all that was around me. I feel I am living with the hell I once was. An ever present anguish awaits my looming thoughts eager to hate myself for my own existence.¬† It is the hell I bestowed upon anyone and everyone around me.. Including YOU, the person I was supposed to open my heart to the most. I never gave you the chance and I kill myself for that daily.  I hurt and I will forever hurt and that is something I've gravely accepted.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   I dont deserve it, I know I dont deserve anything from you. Please if you can .. please forgive me.

f64e8xkn	I‚Äôm exhausted of being a man. It feels like every moment I need to qualify how I‚Äôm _not_ a sex offender, an abuser, a pedophile, pick your label. Further, I‚Äôm straight and white, so pick some more labels. It feels like the intersectional knife we‚Äôve sliced up society with has provided every other configuration some kind of ‚Äútriumph‚Äù narrative. Tell a story about your life and append something about being BIPOC or an alternative sexual orientation and bam, you‚Äôre a heroic survivor because you exist. Be a white dude and go fuck yourself. Hashtags like #blackwomenintech are celebrated. Imagine #whitemeninnursing being celebrated (I don‚Äôt want it be, just attempting to highlight how arbitrary it is, and how it couldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs hateful to exist as a white man). We don‚Äôt get ‚Äúexcellence‚Äù to work towards. We don‚Äôt get to be a celebrated parent. We don‚Äôt get the benefit of the doubt with child custody. We don‚Äôt get to be assertive. Father‚Äôs Day rolls around and I just think about how it‚Äôs going to be spun this time. Maybe something about single moms? Maybe something about how it shouldn‚Äôt exist? Boys are ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù and are socialized to self-relegate. Women get a Doja Cat anthem, men get fart noises and Gillette commercials telling them they‚Äôre an asshole. Masculinity is ‚Äúfragile‚Äù and ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. Femininity is divine.  We‚Äôre treated as disposable ‚Äúproblematic‚Äùclowns that need to ‚Äúbecome an ally‚Äù or be silent (which is apparently violence now).  Straight white man, my immutable randomly assigned identity, is a pejorative.  Sorry. Unstructured rant.

gvkxt4kg	No work no pay. Dad can't work if we do have Covid. He works at a bread factory as a general manager so it's all very hands-on. Work from home isn't an option. We also won't be allowed to buy groceries. I told him that we had to do the test but he just told me to shut up because I don't understand what it's like to be the only one working to provide for the 7 of us (and 6 dogs).  I understand his reasons. We're just.. poor and can't afford to not work because we live in a third world country. Covid response here sucks. My father is the only one going out to work though.  Everyone got sick. We had a fever, coughing and had runny noses. My mom even lost sense of smell and taste. Everyone is fine except for my parents though. My mom still doesn't have a sense of smell and taste and my dad is coughing. If I remember correctly, they had a Covid case in the company dormitory and they did tests on everyone there but he might have been infected.  Last January 9 my mom and older brother went out and they received a text that they might have been in contact with someone who had COVID. They had to buy new eyeglasses so they really had to go out. They also ate out so they put down their mask.  A lot of people I know also got sick so I'm probably thinking it's just a flu. Still, because there's a new variant, we still have to consider whether we really do have it or not.  I don't want to argue with my father because if I do, everyone will be mad at me. Maybe I'm just a woke teenager that cares too much for others that I really feel... resentful that they don't want to consider taking the test.   I can't even be mad. ((: We have to eat too.

rg5ix37	I'll start off by saying this might be super ignorant as Im not at all involved in politics and how shit runs.   So the virus hits hard, lockdowns and restrictions follow (on and off). I don't understand why huge companies are being compensated with our tax money so they can survive this pandemic (I sure as fuck don't pay taxes to help huge international chains such as Hotels). For example these Hotels, 95% of the staff is now put on short time work so they work less/earn less (less guests, less work I know). Those who were unlucky enough for their contracts to run out during the pandemic simply weren't offered a new one. Good luck finding a job as a Waitress or Cook now. But I thought we are paying these big fuck chains money so that they keep employees so we don't flood our country with a bunch of unemployed citizens.  During this time costs have gone up, yet we have citizens that have been in short time work for 2 years already. With no compensation to help them. Lets say they wanna move apartments now so they can save some costs since they are earning less, moving cost money. Money they don't have at the moment. It costs money to save money sometimes.  Another thing pissing me off is we have a mask mandate (I AM TOTALLY FOR THAT) but no matter what you earn you gotta buy them yourself. The amount of times i've had strangers ask me for a mask so they can enter the Train station is sickening, not because I don't want to help but because it shouldn't come to that.   So yeah maybe someone can educate my dumbass on this topic.	1643196663.0	sd3w89	/r/offmychest/comments/sd3w89/covid19_and_how_my_country_is_dealing_with_it/	Covid19 and how my Country is dealing with it

gyvcnh8y	For years now I have been in relationships with guys that talk a lot about their goals but are too fucking lazy or they get complacent and don't accomplish any fucking thing. The same thing happens with friends, it's like they flock to me because I don't like to bs when things need to get done. I would to be surrounded by people who are doers of success and even if they're not perfect (I'm not asking for them to be), it's the fact that they bust their asses to be successful so that someday they can wake up at 2pm knowing that they are the own boss or retired, or both. I need Motivation and encouragement too. I'm always there when others need me. But no one's there for me, but that doesn't stop me from working towards my goal. Im just tired. Venting.

il34k	A gaming friend of mine said he‚Äôd be keen to do something I‚Äôd suggested, which fell through. I messaged him later that night asking if he wanted to reschedule for tomorrow or another time.   No response. Nearly two days later I get a random out-of-the-blue message about something else from them, not even acknowledging the question prior. He‚Äôs not in some sort of crisis where he has no time to reply, he plays games with his other friends and responds to other people almost instantly when they message him.   But if I ask if they want to do something fun, I get some obstacle from them as to why they can‚Äôt. I message them, and I‚Äôm just ignored.  I don‚Äôt want them to do this. I just wanna hang out with my friend and it seems like every single time I try to reach out I‚Äôm shut down and ignored.  I‚Äôm angry and annoyed and disappointed at the same time. You shouldn‚Äôt get to acknowledge I exist only when it‚Äôs convenient for you. I feel stupid for trying and hoping over and over again and it just builds this resentment in me for them.  Reminds me of that scene from ‚ÄòFresh Prince of Bel Air‚Äô when Will‚Äôs father leaves him (again). It‚Äôs like that level of betrayal and hurt and just, being rejected when all you want to do is be involved in someone‚Äôs life because you like spending time with them and talking to them.

4xzcvyns	my mom was cheating on my dad with this guy. I was aware of this and kept her secret. at first they would just go out together or she would go to his house but then it started becoming more frequent. me and my siblings and my dad started seeing her less. she wouldn't come home for days at a time. then she told me, my siblings, and my dad this lie that she got a job offer in another town close by and decided to take it and they would provide a hotel to stay in while she worked over there. I knew she was lying but I don't think my dad or siblings knew. she disappeared for 2 months and I suspected she was living at his house. after those about 3 months she decided to tell me the truth that she had bought an apartment with this man and is living with him and his kids. it was around Christmas time when she invited me over and my heart sank as soon as I walked in. there was "family" pictures on the wall that didn't have me or my siblings in them and there were christmas stockings hung for my mom, her boyfriend, and his kids. it was their home. she had been living at his house for months before they got their apartment together so they were living as a family for about a year before my mom told me. she does everything for her boyfriend and his kids but me and my siblings rarely even hear from her anymore. it's sad to me because before all of this if anyone would've asked me who I was closest to in my family I would've said my mom.	1643197397.0	sd43bl	/r/offmychest/comments/sd43bl/my_mother_left_us_for_a_man/	my mother left us for a man
26d4kav	For a little context, my father is an immigrant who has been living in America for 5 months now. I would say that he adjust to the new environment really well. He does not have to pay any bills and we recently moved to a bigger place. However, he has some trouble with getting his driver license here since he can‚Äôt speak English at all and already failed 2 times on the driving test. My father is an experienced driver but the way people drive in my country isn‚Äôt the same here. Me and my sister, at first we were confident that he wouldn‚Äôt have much of a problem with the driving test but since he can‚Äôt communicate with the examiner, they would ultimately fail him for not being able to cooperate. Now, things should sound like an easy fix if my father willing to learn but his ego is too damn big. He refuse to listen to anyone, EVEN THE EXAMINERS. He couldn‚Äôt follow through a simple direction like backing up a car and literally say to their face that he doesn‚Äôt understand what they said. Then, they told me and my sister that we should spend more time teaching him as if we could do anything at this rate but that is my family problem, not them and I feel extremely bad for these people. Once we were able to translate what they said to him, he literally denied and outright act like he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong when they even state every fault he made during the test and he blame everyone, even the system but himself. I can‚Äôt even have a genuine conversation with him about what went wrong and how we could fix them next time. Since we are still dealing with the pandemic, the appointment for the next test would be a whole ass month (don‚Äôt get me start on this lmao) so there were plenty of time to learn the basic. Honestly, the worst part of this whole situation is  after he done victim blaming, he start talking how shitty we are as his children because we don‚Äôt side with him and how American change us for the worse (for not taking his BS, and standing up for ourselves). Please note that we are from an Asian culture so seeing us criticize him with valid point btw, like a shock to him maybe idk. At this point, I don‚Äôt really know how to handle the situation anymore. If things going his way, it‚Äôs fine but when this happen, he tryna tell us that this country is shiet and he wants to go back which is completely okay by me but since he can‚Äôt even make up his damn mind about what he want, everybody is upset now over something that should not be a problem in the first place.  My sister took him there last time and he was flaming her and told everyone that she was the reason he failed when in reality it wasn‚Äôt. Now I‚Äôm the only person that he can rely on. All the bmv in my city has been all booked up til March but he want to take another one immediately so my sorry ass have to look up different location in other cities nearby to see if they have any spot available sooner. I don‚Äôt want to help but he keep harassing my mom, nagging her about how we just fucked up kids and she is the one to blame. I just wish he wasn‚Äôt here at all. Things were better this way when we all apart from each other. I‚Äôm so done with his BS‚Ä¶ On the last note, before coming to America, he promised to my other sister who still live in my country, that he will become a change man, that he will start all over‚Ä¶ He just picked up smoking cigarettes after quitting for years and started hanging out with friends every Saturday (i have to drive btw) when instead of improving his life. He even complained about how all the food taste lame when my mom and my sister cook every single day and nobody have time to do all this. To summarize, he has all kinds of privileges that I don‚Äôt even have but still tells everyone that we treat him wrong. I‚Äôm at lost here. I just want to leave the house but then I can‚Äôt be there to protect my mom and my sis. Even if he feel that way, nobody deserves to be harassed like that. There‚Äôs much more to the story but it‚Äôs too long. Tldr: my father fails his driving exam and start blaming everyone but himself. Now I‚Äôm on his good side just so I can do whatever he demands and I‚Äôm at my limit.	1643197498.0	sd446h	/r/offmychest/comments/sd446h/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_narcissistic/	I don‚Äôt know how to deal with my narcissistic father
7uonp8kj	    Me[18F] and my bf[20M] are together  for almost an year. I trust him very much, he s my closest person but recently I don‚Äôt feel like I know him anymore. Since the beggining of january, he moved with his brother who lives closer to me and now we are neighbours (he used to live in another home in the same city). Since then we began to spend more time togheter, since we are 2 minutes apart from eachother. But I began to notice that almost every 2 days he‚Äôs visiting some friends in another city, and he comes home late at night. It was strange for me, because from what i knew he was visiting that friend just 1,2 times per month. And now everytime he went there he wouldn‚Äôt talk to me almost at all, always telling me he‚Äôs busy and to stop calling him and that I ask too many questions. Sometimes he was leaving even when we were spending time together, or he was leaving at lunch time and coming back at night. When i was asking for a reason why, he never gave me a clear explanation, he was just saying that they want him there to help with something, or that they came and took him from home and he didn‚Äôt knew why. I began to wonder more and more, but I was trying to not think about it because everytime when i was trying to confront him about it he would say i don‚Äôt trust him, i don‚Äôt understand him and that  i always think negatively.  I gave up on the argument, and i believed that maybe i am a liitle bit too paranoid. But things didn‚Äôt stopped, and same every 2 days he would go there. Two days ago, it happened again and I got mad and i confronted him again, after he didnt return my calls. He got angry, acused me of being selfish and that i want him to stay just with me. He then said that is not necessary to talk with me so often (on that day i had an appointment at the doctor due some medical problems and i wasn‚Äôt feelling well). He blamed me for talking s**t and making him angry. I didn‚Äôt answer to that, i wanted to let him to calm down The next day he was still angry and he called me to tell me again that he didnt sleep because of me and that i am too much for him. I was sick of it, so we began again to fight. I told him if he feels suffocated by communicating more he shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship. He decided to break up with me(which happens almost after every fight) he left his phone at my house to show me that i can‚Äôt contact him anymore. I don‚Äôt know if he forgot, but he didn‚Äôt logged out from his accounts. I checked his phone of course, but through messages i didnt found anything. Then it came to my mind to check his location history. I was surprised by how many times he lied to me about where he was, even before moving closer to me. He would tell me at night that he is going to sleep when he was in fact going to his friend. Or when he was not answering his phone he was finding other excuses, like he was to his doctor, or that he was sick and sleeping and not checking his phone. All those times his location was to his friend‚Äôs home. I was always believing him because if i asked questions he was always getting defensive and threating to leave me if i can‚Äôt trust him. I was thinking he s right and is my mind that is thinking wrong. Sometimes he was dissapearing for few days without any contact. I always had a bad feeling about his friend,i thought he s a bad influence, i never met him personally but i knew he was doing coke but my bf assured me he helped him to get clean and that he is good now. My bf gets easily depressed, and he has pretty much an self destructive behavior especially when we fight. after an argument he goes to his friend and he drinks and smoke with him. A lot.  I don‚Äôt know what to do, since i found all of this im shoked and feel very hurt. He came just now  to ask for another phone with buttons that he has. I gave it to him but I didnt say a word about what i found out. He seems still mad, he just left without saying anything else. I know he expects apologies from me, he always plays this card. I don‚Äôt know what should i do next . If i confront him he will probably turn the situation against me. If i dont say anything my mind has 1000 questions.  What do you think he is hiding ? Any advice is welcome:)  Sorry for my grammar, english is not my first language.  TLDR: Me and my bf have been toghether for an year. He is spending a lot of time to a friend house, in another city. When he is there, he will not return my calls or text me, saying he is busy. I found from his location history that in the past 6 months he has been there more than he was telling me. Sometimes at night. He was always coming to me with excuses for his dissapearances. He doesent know i found out this, but he broke up with me yesterday due to a fight because i got suspicious about him being away so much.

3v85n2vh	 It‚Äôs 3am on a regular Wednesday morning. Two weeks ago I called my college‚Äôs counseling department to set an appointment. A few days later, I spoke with their hired psychologist for 10 minutes for a pre-screening appointment. The usual; why are you calling? What is your background? Are you suicidal or having thoughts of harming yourself? I said no, but that‚Äôs not the full truth. I didn‚Äôt want them to call the police or something.  That night when I couldn‚Äôt sleep like every other night, I drafted a letter to the people closest to me. In a random organic chemistry spiral bound notebook from a year ago. Yeah‚Ä¶ that kind of letter. I didn‚Äôt necessarily want to proceed but‚Ä¶ I was thinking the letter would make me feel something. Anything. Maybe I would realize how many people love me and care about me, and how it would affect them. How would my boyfriend manage? My siblings, especially my little brother? He‚Äôs 19 now. Not so little anymore hah. Who would take care of my cat? Who would clean up the mess, and how would it affect them?   I carefully considered these questions. If I‚Äôm anything, I am careful. I couldn‚Äôt do it because I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to answer these questions. How could I be so selfish and hurt those I love? And yet‚Ä¶. The thoughts remain.   That night I reflected on the past few years and how I got to be where I am now. Everybody‚Äôs story is nuanced and complicated, mine is no exception. Not enough paragraphs in the world could explain why me, a white, privileged, young female with supportive friends and family could get to such a low mental state.   It started more than 2 years ago, maybe in high school? Earlier? Maybe after i moved countries for the 12th or 7th time? Maybe, after i was bullied and harassed through middle school? Maybe in first grade and i was living in Garmisch-Partenkirchen when I was told ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to German school, and you will have to learn a whole new culture and language.‚Äù After 3 years, I did. And then we moved. To virginia. And then we moved again, to russia this time. Then ukraine. Rinse, and repeat until we ended up traveling on the road for 6 months on the east coast of the US. Somehow, after that i landed in a random town in the buttcrack of indiana going to public high school with my uncle as one of my teachers. Parents separated for a while, my mom faced off with some of her old family ghosts and skeletons.   And now; CALIFORNIA. In college, in what oprah calls the happiest town in america. I live 15 minutes from the beach in my own apartment. Who could be depressed after getting to travel the world and then live in fucking central coast of california?   Me. Apparently.   Over the past 3 years, I have slowly become detached and apathetic. It was small things at first; like not doing the dishes sometimes. Just seemed like too much work. Then, i started skipping class more and more. I stopped talking to friends i was really close with. I got into a huge fight with my parents, and for a while was no contact with them. I was already pretty much financially independent, and that solidified that fact. But instead of dealing with anything, i just worked my butt off ( and i mean I worked my BUTT OFF, sometimes 30-40 hours a week while being a full time student) and put on a good face to anyone who saw me. And then the burnout happened; 4-5 months ago.   Who wouldn‚Äôt get burned out after ignoring the growing sensation of numbness for so long, pretending like I‚Äôm fine?  I changed jobs thinking it would help, i lessened my hours, i travelled a bit. I tried to take up swimming, i tried surfing. Lol i bought the board and now it sits vertical against the wall in my room dry as a bone. The holidays came and went. School started again, and I just can‚Äôt do it any more. I can‚Äôt keep working and schooling with the weight and the darkness that‚Äôs taken over my body. I stopped going to class, i‚Äôm doing the absolute bare minimum to stay afloat of the grades. But soon, I may just‚Ä¶ stop trying and let my grades go. That‚Äôs happened before, especially in math heavy classes like chemistry and physics. Did i mention ive retaken certain general chemistry classes, like 3 or 4 times each? I dont know why i keep retaking them since i usually get the same grade. I tell myself it‚Äôs to try and meet the prerequisite requirements for vet school (ive always wanted to become a veterinarian). I called in the work for 3 weeks, saying I had covid. i lied to get the sick pay. But if i dont go back to work this week, i‚Äôll fall so far behind in bills that i‚Äôd lose my apartment.   My new job actually didn‚Äôt help like i thought it would. Ive been a vet tech for almost three years, and i took a position at an emergency clinic because I‚Äôm good at what i do, but man‚Ä¶.. it is so fucking depressing most days. The things i see happen to these animals. Mangled, sick, or worse. Dead on arrival. But it pays super well. The hours suck, i get the graveyard shifts but it pays $3 more. $21.50 an hour to ‚Äúplay with puppies and kittens‚Äù.  Actually, it‚Äôs probably why my sleep schedule is so fucked up that i cant sleep until 6 am most days and miss a lot of classes.  I hide a lot of it really well, my family has no idea. I dont talk to any of my old friends so they don‚Äôt know. The only people who really (probably) know are my roommates and my long distance boyfriend. I havent done dishes in months, though ive been asked to millions of times. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, i promise ill do them today.‚Äù I shower maybe‚Ä¶.. Once a week, if that. I dont brush my hair, or do laundry. It‚Äôs all too much energy‚Ä¶. And work‚Ä¶..   My boyfriend lives 5 hours away, and the only reason he knows is because he‚Äôs noticed my facade slipping, and I am irritable and sad in my demeanor most days. More and more i cant hide the pain. Yesterday we were playing overwatch together and someone else on the team told me in the chat to kill myself, and i flew into a rage and sobbed. Its just a game.   The other day he told me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we try balancing some of the negative thoughts with positive thoughts? The negativity is getting too much sometimes.‚Äù And ive been trying so hard to not complain all the time but .. i have a hard time thinking of good things to say so I tell him to just talk about his day and I‚Äôll listen and smile. We say goodnight and i love you and he goes to bed because he has to wake up early for his job, and i stay awake scrolling or staring at the ceiling.   I feel so alone. I can‚Äôt confess all this to anyone without feeling an immense guilt of burdening them. But i can‚Äôt keep it inside anymore.  So i called the college‚Äôs counseling center. My real appointment was supposed to be tomorrow, but they rescheduled me last minute. Who knows why? Now i have to wait another week to get help. Whats another week, when ive waited 2, 3, 4 years to deal with this? Just week too late, it feels like. So here I am in the meantime to try and make it another week. To feel less alone? I dont know.       Am I alone?	1643198395.0	sd4cns	/r/offmychest/comments/sd4cns/im_realizing_that_i_have_raging_unchecked/	I‚Äôm realizing that I have raging, unchecked depression.
6p4ws	4 days ago was your birthday. And for the 5th year, I'd be planning something, you always love those surprise dinners either be it a quiet little meal or I just dapao from bedok 511 with that soupy bak chor mee. But then again, I have to remind myself, that I've since let you go.  I've always made ridiculous mistakes and wrong decisions that just kept me awake. Having not taken immediate action back when I was in my first job, which would have guaranteed a good lfie for us, and for the second one where I figured would be a safety net for us in the meantime. I remembered you being there by my side, in my arms, consoling me when I was at my lowest and when I was genuinely mad at myself, kicking myself silly and self doubting every thing that I did, spiralled into depression and got myself all fucked up. I sat at home on my sofa, not moving at all, not looking for a job, not looking for anything. "That job was everything to me". I never fucking moved. You always made sure I was alright, and pushed me to do something. You always pressed your hands against my cheeks and told me that I was better than this and that I didn't deserve the seafarers career, "the leaders adorned with ranks who did not see your potential did not deserve your future with them."  You made me wake up. You got my shit together. I got my second job. Hopefully I can make something of out this and move on to something bigger. You congratulated me for the job, even though it was a small one. You looked me in my eyes and told me to do my best. But I still was never myself.  You made me get a dog - one of the best decisions ever made, but however it was yours. You knew it would make me better. It was always ours, no matter how much I said it was just mine. It was closest to how I imagine my own family would be. Just us three against everything else. It was all I needed at that time.   And then I had my breakdowns. I cried. I raged. And I wanted more. Why was my life so selfish? I wanted to be the better partner for you, but I couldn't. I had nothing to offer. I remember the night I drank to the point that I hated myself and called you to just go away and not be with me., Why would anyone want to be with a fucking loser? " You came down the next day, and whacked me into shape. You told me to not let my parents down. And that they shouldn't me in this kind of state - which parent wants to see their kid at the age of 28 be a mess.  But I still was.  Covid 19 came. Retrenchment along with it. I went home. I called you. And dropping everything you came. Emma greeted you, tail wagging and all. But you could still feel something was wrong. A hug. A look.  "I got retrenched."  "It's okay, we will work it out."  "I think you should leave me."  I looked back to all the times. It was nothing but disappointment for you. From my view, I had given nothing but a bout of sadness and pain and made you tolerated so much of my inadequacy. I told you to think about it. I could not remember how many times I had asked you to leave me.  But I never wanted you to leave me. And I got a sense of elatement when you called. "What kind of a girlfriend would I be if I left you when you were at your most vulnerable."  You never changed.  The next day, I registered to be a foodpanda rider. And we both talked about what I was going to expect while doing it. It was fun. Then as I went to bed that night, I ran through the pain of being a rider. And then I was wondering, how would you deal with the fact that your partner was a delivery rider? Ah bengs, low life's, looking for an easy way out, carefree. These words were thrown around and I imagined what you had to deal with. And I didn't. And I knew for a fact that I would still amount to nothing. I believe I was not destined for greatness. And I would not be able to provide for my future family. For us.  That was the biggest lie I ever told you that day. "Babe, I saw a feng shui guy and said we not compatible."  You replied back. You had decided. That it was over too. I heaved. I had let you go.  But I didn't want to fucking let you go. I did not. I gathered every strength to fall asleep admisdt all the pain. I tolerated every urge to stay in bed the whole day. I always thought riding would get my mind away but it all I ever wanted to do was to ride to your place and hope it was all just one nightmare.  I always make bad mistakes. And this is a regret I have to live with. I will take it that I lied to you and that this is what I deserve. These two years without you has been hell. You appear in my dreams at least every once a week. Now more so, than frequently. Every time I'm home, I still have that hope that you will enter my room door unannounced like you always do, making my heart skip a beat. I will miss you just patting our kid on the head and showing her all the love and making me regret the things that I've said.  To everyone out there, I m sorry but I had to let this out. If you ever have something good, don't be blind and let her go. I have always been one to push away help. But I realise hurt just goes both ways. I wished I hadn't said that. I wish I wish I wish. I lost my sense of humor. I lost my sense of life. I lost a piece of me. I have met other people but nothing ever compares. Nothing fills that gap that you were. I have tried moving on as other say and i know how to, but sometimes, if you really know it, you just can't. Especially when you know love was still there. And you yourself ended it prematurely. I've made the biggest mistake. I hope all of you treasure everyone and everything that you have and don't ever mistake a period of downtime and depression as a burden for others to take.	1643198412.0	sd4cvw	/r/offmychest/comments/sd4cvw/bear_with_me/	Bear with me.
dpl4a9is	I hate people so much. Everybody is just so selfish... All of you just care about yourselves, even when you don't have to. When you have the power to care for someone else, stick up for somebody else, you don't do it unless there is some sort of gain for you. Unless there's a moment where you could feel like a hero, feel like you're doing something right, you won't do it. That's people and that's why I hate people. There's little I can be happy about now. I used to take a little pride in helping out my ex girlfriend or me stories... I used to wash her clothes and clean her room and change her cats' food because i wanted to be there for her and she was depressed and she did have a lot of emotional outburts. I didn't love her as a girflriend but I loved her as an individual and someone that was close to me... After we broke up I was pretty sad for a day but I was really happy after that. It felt like 100,000 people holding me back finally let go. Little did I know, some of those fuckers were invisible. I started getting into martial arts and writing at this time and I would say those are some of my favorite things ever. I started writing because I felt very lonely and I was also getting into random characters from tv, anime, or just random things (Like analyzing them). The first story I've ever written was this short story about 3 brothers in which 2 of the brothers were created by the youngest brother but he didn't want to admit it. That was on the back of a flash card and I used to use it as a bookmark, it actually really means a lot to me, even if it's kinda shit. But what I want to talk about is the first Short story i've ever written which I wrote after the story of the 3 brothers. It was about this group of people that took drugs together (Not weed, im talkin hard shit) and they discover this new drug called Frequency 115 (title of story) which is advertised as something that can make you feel like you're in another dimension. The thing about it is it actually shifts your body's frequency and sends your consiousness into another dimension while something else inhabits your human body. In the new universe, after you take the drug, you stay there for maybe half an hour and the thing about the universe is that it's supposed to show you really fucked up and messed up things that would never happen in real life (LMAO). There was a scene I made where everyone held the m/c down while the m/c's girlfriend fed him shit from used condoms. Something that happened to me is that my ex girlfriend made me lick her vagine with sperm inside of it. I didn't know that it actually happened till a year and a half after I wrote the story and 2 years after my ex and I had broke up. If someone would have told me, just gave me a little proof, I could have confidently broke up with her without her threatening to kill herself. Looking back Im pretty sure she wouldnt have killed herself, she was just using the tactic of threatining suicide. But if someone would have told me, I wouldn't have felt so bad, I wouldn't have wasted my last year of highschool focusing on distancing myself from shitty friends and making a girl I didn't even like happy. All that's left of me is just an abused/exhausted kid, someone who couldn't care less about anything, and the person I always didn't want to be.

j1bvel7f	Saturday night I [25 M] confessed my feelings to K [22 F] while we were at my home. She said that although we have great complicity she saw me as a very good friend and that she liked girls (to note that she had already told me several times that she likes boys too, cause she is pan (but has no experience with boys afaik)). But then after the awkward silence, she decided to put herself in fetal position at then end of my bed and put on an alarm to not miss her last transportation. When it rang she didn't react so I woke her up "K it's time you need to go for your transport". But she didn't want to take it, so she ended sleeping at my house on the ground sheet. She wasn't drunk or anything, she apparently even had a party that night that she didn't went to. Anyway two days after we were at a party where J [23 F] (which I had asked out a few months ago and K knew) was. As I was leaving with J, K hurried up and said that she would come with me so we could eat Mcdo. So we did take mcDo and ate it at my place before she left. So I can't wrap my head around that : 1) why would she stay ? like you just rejected me why would you stay ? 2) why go "out of your way" to leave with me as I'm leaving with J 3) why would you lie saying you only like girls while we both know you told me you like boys too ? Should I ask her those questions or just let it be ?

klncbqs	We've only been together for two months but it still hurts. When we first got together i already told him that i was queer and i never claimed i was cisgender, but i was still using she/her pronouns, and after a lot of thinking i came out as nonbinary and asked him to use she/they and that i preferred masculine adjectives over feminine ones (i'm French so everything has a gender :/). He chose to break up rather than using neutral gender or masculine adjectives and dared to tell me "i love you" after that. And like... i can't help but think that if i had chosen to let things the way they were and not seek recognition or whatever everything would have been alright.   And it's pretty awful to feel that because i know i'm right to stand my ground on this one.

9jmnxpa6	I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm writing this, I think I just need to write it down as for once I can‚Äôt talk to anyone in my life about it.   My girlfriend and I have been together just a few months, but we‚Äôve been friends much longer. We both come with plenty of emotional baggage, as most people do. So far our relationship has been nothing but loving. She is 10 years older than me and has very low chances of getting pregnant naturally. But it happened just 5 months into our relationship. Last week she went to the hospital for a scan, and told me everything was fine and she just had to wait for the results. A week later she tells me that she is 10 weeks pregnant and that she isn‚Äôt keeping the baby.   We spoke a bit, I felt overwhelmed. She said that she needed to process it on her own and had been running through all the possibilities in her head all week . I understand and respect that the decision is ultimately hers alone. But I am really struggling with the fact that at no point did she ask me if I thought she had made the right choice, or what I would have wanted. For what it‚Äôs worth I think it is the right decision, as much as it breaks my heart. If we were years down the line it would be magical, but we‚Äôre not and it‚Äôs gut wrenching.   I just wish she would have told me at the time and we could have talked about it and came to this conclusion together. I would never have tried to tell her what to do. And I don‚Äôt understand how she has spent the past week sitting and sleeping next to me like everything is normal while I am clueless to the fact she is pregnant with my child.   I don‚Äôt feel angry, just hurt and alone. As I say, I know it is her choice. But I just want to feel like I was part of it, like my feelings matter too. I am scared that I can‚Äôt trust someone who could keep this from me so easily.   I don‚Äôt know what I expect from this, guess I just want to feel like I‚Äôve told someone.	1643200806.0	sd51q8	/r/offmychest/comments/sd51q8/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_pregnant_a_week/	My girlfriend told me she was pregnant a week after she found out, and that she‚Äôs not keeping the baby.

When I fail or do something incorrect I tend to shit on myself for not doing it correctly, regardless if it is the first time or not. I hate having the mentality where failure is not an option.

6ewjifiu	We broke up yesterday.   We loved each other so much. We had broken up before. She had changed, improved. I thought I did, but I didn't. I came back to the same place the year before when we broke up. I neglected her the whole month. But it wasn't about that, it was about everything that came before that. It was the distance that I unconsciously decided to put between her and I. It was the neverending promises that I broke. The reluctancy to get help, to do something.   We talked about this. This wouldn't have happened if I just gave her the bare minimum: my time.    I was locked in a vicious cycle. In my own stupid little limbo. I loved talking to her, I loved being near her. But I didn't do anything. I just procrastinated everything. To the point I lost the best person I have ever met. I feel so disappointed at myself.  I hope she finds someone better. She deserves to be happy, to have someone care deeply about her. She deserves someone who has the courage to face their own demons. Someone who would put the same effort she puts into everything.  I just woke up and had the best dream in weeks. We were watching a movie while cuddling, we kissed. I woke up loving her and then the harsh reality hit me like a ton of bricks.

gvsk7c1j	Title basically says it all, but to give more details: I always have to work twice as hard as them. I study longer, start earlier,... Yet, when it comes to exams, they pass with barely any effort and meanwhile, I still struggle.   This exam, I started in September. It‚Äôs a hard exam and I wanted to be prepared as best as possible. I passed barely. Thankfully, oral was easy.   Two weeks later they go into this exam with only two weeks of studying, and get way higher scores than I. And it just makes me so mad. I just can‚Äôt be happy for them. One of them has complained about how much I study and now she excelled with less time and effort.   In all honesty, I found her exam questions more doable, but still. It makes me so angry. Angry and hateful and ugly inside. I just hate it so much, I can‚Äôt even be happy for my boyfriend who passed.   Please help me. How do I deal with this?

hzpu6c4a	TW: pedophilia, CSA, CP  using a throwaway because i don‚Äôt know how some people might take this.  now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I DO NOT SUPPORT PEDOPHILIA. i would never ever condone harming children in any capacity or doing anything that contributes to harming children. not in a trillion years. if someone SAs a child, i would rather them rot in prison than anything else.  but i have sympathy for pedophiles, which a lot of people don‚Äôt understand.  i feel bad for them. i feel bad for people living with this attraction that they can‚Äôt control, especially because it‚Äôs extremely stigmatized, and understandably so. but there are pedophiles out there who want to be good people. who never want to harm children. and i don‚Äôt hate them. i want them to live happy, fulfilling lives. i don‚Äôt want them to be miserable for something they can‚Äôt help. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd ever be comfortable being FRIENDS with a pedophile, but still.  and also, this is something i really worry if im a bad person for: i sort of have sympathy for those who go down the route of cp as well. some, at least. again, don‚Äôt get me wrong, CP is disgusting and awful and i have infinitely more sympathy for the children who‚Äôve been hurt in the creation of that kind of stuff. ive come across cp before and it left a mark on me. and i find it absolutely horrifying that anyone could find that stuff and get off to it. but i also know there are people out there struggling with addictions to it and want to change and get help. i know there are people who know how awful it is and feel incredibly guilty but addictions are evil. i do not support them consuming cp‚Äî i want to support them getting help and trying to get away from that and never consume that kind of thing again. there are even people who aren‚Äôt pedophiles themselves but have developed such an addiction to porn that they just want to find more and more taboo things to satisfy that addiction‚Ä¶ and i just feel bad. it‚Äôs awful and disgusting and horrible, but i want them to get help and recover from that, for not only themselves but everyone else. does that make sense?? i just worry it makes me a terrible person	1643202234.0	sd5ir9	/r/offmychest/comments/sd5ir9/i_feel_like_i_have_an_unpopular_opinion_on/	i feel like i have an unpopular opinion on pedophiles
iinhvbla	My father started sexually abusing me when my chest started developing. So age 11-12, I think. I had no clue what was happening at the time. Whenever I said something he played it off as an accidental touch, and I believed him.  He pretended he was hugging me and he ruined hugs for me in the process.   The first time I noticed something was off was when he took me to the store and kept his hand around my waist the entire time. I was humiliated, I knew it looked like I was his girlfriend and I didn‚Äôt want it to look like that. He acted like this every time we went in public from then on.   I didn‚Äôt truly start to realize what was happening until I was 16. But I was so scared of accusing him of something if I didn‚Äôt know for sure that I didn‚Äôt say anything.  I started hurting myself and told no one.  I was 17 when my mom finally found out. I hadn‚Äôt wanted to tell her. I had casually brought up that my father made me uncomfortable, and she asked if he had ever inappropriately touched me. I started sobbing.   I developed an eating disorder and told no one.  He eventually found out I had told. He humiliated me in front of my entire family, called me a liar and made me tell people I wasn‚Äôt ready to tell. I locked myself in a room for a week and spoke to no one. My self harm became so severe that I once counted 45 fresh wounds on my leg. The only people who have seen my scars or know they exist are ex partners.  The last time he did it was my 18th birthday. I was picking out an outfit to wear for that day when it happened. I didn‚Äôt tell anybody until the day after, I didn‚Äôt want him to make another scene. I wouldn‚Äôt let him fuck up a day I‚Äôd be looking forward to for years that easily. I still don‚Äôt like my birthday that much and don‚Äôt plan on celebrating my 19th.  The sexual abuse wasn‚Äôt thing going on behind closed doors, tho. I remember him screaming at me until 3am one night, while I was laying in bed trying (and failing) to sleep. When I locked myself in the bathroom he broke down the door. I remember my heart beating so loudly I could hear it pounding in my ears.  Another time he was being rude to my brother (who he never raised a hand to. My parents never even spanked him), and I flicked something at him to get his attention. I was immediately slammed into the wall so hard I was left in a dizzy shock for several moments after. My brother came to my defense. This was the only time I can remember him doing so. I ran off  I was regularly denied adequate food and healthcare, as well.  I have an autoimmune disorder. I remember when I was young, before I was diagnosed, there was one time I was in so much pain that I was constantly sobbing. I hadn‚Äôt kept down water for a week, and my mom had to threaten divorce before my dad drove me to the hospital. He insisted i was faking it. When the doctors looked at my stomach, it was so bad that they thought i had cancer. That‚Äôs when I was diagnosed with my autoimmune disorder.  Only a few of my friends knew. One time, my dad had an ‚Äúoutburst‚Äù while I was in a discord call with them. A couple days later they were discussing plans to kill him and I had to talk them down from it  Other than those few select people who know, or that I was forced to tell I‚Äôve stayed quiet about this my whole life. I‚Äôve had several suicide attempts, I started doing drugs and drinking when I was still a teen, I‚Äôve been suicidal since I was 12, my autoimmune disorder still sucks just as much today as it did when I was a kid, I still self harm, and honestly I‚Äôm fucked up beyond belief but I‚Äôm alive. I‚Äôm currently studying graphic design at university and I‚Äôve gotten the bastard himself to pay for it. The catch is I have to stay in contact with him as long as I‚Äôm going to school, which definitely isn‚Äôt helping the healing process but it‚Äôs better than being trapped in that house.

6c18h6o0	When I was in the closet I always grunted a little when I would see a gay couple holding hands. It was two things happening at the same time: Internalized anger that that was not me **and** being brought up in a conservative Christian household. Had you told me when I was a teenager (did not come out of the closet until age 25) that gay people have it harder I would have dodged that with "sure, everyone can have it hard." Not exactly true. I am white, from a lower/middle class family and am male. In other words, I have everything going for me *except for* my sexual orientation.   The place I used to work at before and after coming out of the closet opened my eyes, and I had enough examples around me to prove to me that indeed unless you are heterosexual you are not seen as equal by \[almost\] everyone around you. Take for example that the industry I used to work in what 95% heterosexual men, 4% heterosexual women and 1% (me - the gay guy). Before coming out of the closet when I would request something to be done it would get done because I worked a lot of overtime and would do more than my fair share. Literally the day I came out of the closet it was like a light switch went off. The heterosexual men were not going to take orders from a f\*g and that was that. Sitting close to me and treating me like everyone else was out of the question literally the day I came out of the closet.   Then in the recent past it seemed like the tide was turning and a coworker who basically stopped taking to me after coming out asked me if I wanted to join him in donating plasma for some extra cash. I told him "Would love to, but cannot because against the rules as a gay man" \[if you are a man and have sex with another man in the past few months you cannot donate blood or plasma\].   I loved the fact that I came out of the closet - however I can see why so many people stay in the closet.	1643203218.0	sd5tp3	/r/offmychest/comments/sd5tp3/being_heterosexual_is_beyond_easier_than_being_bi/	Being heterosexual is beyond easier than being bi or gay
hj7fiepv	Hi, I know I'm facing severe depression since years and now I have the feeling I don't have a lot of hobbies or a goal in life, I draw, paint and write novels a lot but I feel like I just do the same again and again.  I'm too poor to buy an instrument or take lessons. I'm absolutely not a sport person (and it's upsetting me that everytime there are ppl that lower me.) but I try to play with my ring fit sometimes.  I also lost a bit of interest in video games, I love hard and challenging games like bloodborn or hollow knight but I learn fast and it quickly become boring.  Please help me I even realise a long time ago that my dreams that I used to have when I was young was not only impossible but don't even interest me if it can be true.	1643203268.0	sd5ucu	/r/offmychest/comments/sd5ucu/i_need_a_passion/	i need a passion
6orcaq4x	   I don't know what to say, but I know I  feel compelled to say something. Maybe we flew too high? Maybe we made  the Gods jealous with our bond? All I know is it certainly felt like the  the universe conspired against us.  We  haven't been together for years. We still talk. We share custody of our  dogter. We still laugh and cry together. Everything changed and yet  nothing did.  I can see in your  eyes a facade, but when allowed to look into them long enough I see past  that veil. I see the pain. The sorrow. The sense of being lost. But  don't worry, we're lost together. You, Corgo, and me.  You're  just as beautiful as you ever were, both inside and out. I know the  world has made you weary to open your heart to let your kindness shine,  but my god, what a beautiful and brilliant luster that kindness emits.  When  you tell me you've had a bad day, I still find myself wanting to wrap  you up in my arms to keep all the ills and woes at bay. When you laugh I  still feel the fluttering of butterflies in my stomach.  Sometimes you still take my hand in yours, for reassurance. How I long for you to never let go, but I know you must.  What  can we do? What will tomorrow bring? All I know for certain is my heart  will carry all our memories like diamonds and rubies; rarest treasure  of immeasurable appraisal.  It seems my bones ache for the warmth of you and Corgo next to me in bed. My heart pines for the honor of making you smile.  How does one grieve the metamorphosis from Eden to Urban decay of the soul?  If  you do see this, I don't expect anything to happen or change. But how  can one body be expected to contain all this love without occasionally  spilling out?  &#x200B;     ^(And when there's nothing left)   ^(Ashes and silhouettes)   ^(I hope that I find my rest)   ^(Next to you)	1643203364.0	sd5vli	/r/offmychest/comments/sd5vli/i_know_youll_never_see_this_and_that_is_exactly/	I know you'll never see this and that is exactly why I am saying this here - I am still unapologetically in love with you.
hlja04pj	Instead of being honest, upfront and consistent the seller immediately tries to scam a potential buyer into paying more than what the buyer himself even really actually wants for the product (wtf??) and the buyer disrespects the seller and their product by implying the seller is stupid enough to be convinced into lowering his prices, and instead of respecting the sellers decision and pay the proper amount they insult the quality of the product and the seller for assuming he's out to stiff them.

8vl7ijmd	It's a long story but to keep it short my mom is a super toxic person, half of the house is under her name and she locked the doors to 1st level of the house as she claims it's hers. Her hobbies is to make me and my sister(16) stressed also  she is an overly religious person.  I'm scared of what she will do, I feel she will try to sue my dad and I don't know what is that about. I think she will try to kick my dad out of the house and make his life a mess with some accusations.   She once wiretapped the whole house and doesn't care about us at all, claiming that we abandoned her. The truth is she was stressing me so much with her behaviour that I was unable to go to the kitchen and grab food when I was at home. It's been a month and I wish I could see my dad and sister but I can't stand the stress of seeing my mom. I also don't pick up phone from her as she never calls because she is interested with me, she only calls to stress me and talk how bad and ungrateful I am, recently she called me toxic too.   I have 2 degrees (almost 3) and never in my life did anything wrong yet she never supported me or said she is proud. For 5 years of my university, I was returning home each weekend to help with the house, move the lawn etc.    As a kid when I was stressing if people will like me, she responded with ' why anyone would like you'.   I'm also lucky to have some savings and I hope to start working as an engineer soon so it should get better at some point.   If she will continue with her behaviour I'm considering moving abroad and/or never speak to her again unless she understands how much damage she made.   I'm sorry if the text looks like a mess but I can't stop crying.	1643204172.0	sd64md	/r/offmychest/comments/sd64md/i_have_enough/	I have enough
j1iiamc4	Rant:  2 nights ago I was sitting on the couch (I cleaned up the tv room and took the trash down) and for like 10-15 min or so it felt like a long silence I was like biting my nails and just thinking of a song in my head. (Personally to me I think I‚Äôm always in my head thinking a lot in my head) and my twin goes ‚Äúwhat are you thinking about‚Äù and I say ‚Äúspeak to me by Chris brown‚Äù and she goes ‚Äúmhmmmm sure you were‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù and then she goes ‚Äúyou are being weird‚Äù. She has never said this to me and it‚Äôs new and idk why‚Ä¶  Last night my twin goes ‚Äúmy shampoo is coming in the mail tomrrow‚Äù and I go ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the name of it?‚Äù And she goes ‚Äúsays the shampoo name‚Äù and i say ‚Äúwait I thought I asked you this an hour ago and you said something else?‚Äù And she goes ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you remeber? We researched the shampoo brand together. Oh yeah what was the name of the shampoo I said then?‚Äù And i say ‚Äúthis name or something?? I don‚Äôt remember‚Äù and my twin goes ‚Äúyou are being weird. I want you to get out of my room. Leave. You are making me angry. And she murmurs something like ‚Äúur jealous of me‚Äù (idk that‚Äôs what I heard) but she said I‚Äôm being weird again and it‚Äôs scaring me bc now she‚Äôs gonna think ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs doing something bad or hiding something‚Äù which I‚Äôm not.  She doesn‚Äôt know I actually have a bad memory and don‚Äôt remeber things. I just cant do this anymore.. I‚Äôm scared. For me, I find my life is fun and I love it. Bc i like talk to myself or make jewelry and watch tv myself. I do this daily. But when my twin is in it I love her but I can‚Äôt do this.. keep bottling things. I think she‚Äôs mean and I keep saying in my head I want to kill myself because I do. I‚Äôm so afraid she‚Äôs gonna accuse me of things I didn‚Äôt do.. I just wanna leave..

aow0lgwj	Someone I didn't know that well that I had a strictly professional (not friendship) relationship with died, and the funeral was open for all,  but I didn't go to the funeral because I just thought it would be weird when a lot of other people were so close to them and I had only talked to them once or twice... I was afraid of taking up space (pandemic restrictions) from people who were actually close to the person so I thought I wouldn't go so that someone who was closer to them could take up that space instead.  I feel almost guilty now and I feel like a horrible person and I wonder if people will think I didn't care?

j1ir6nvb	English is not my first language so bear with me .I‚Äôm 16 and my moms 56, as you may assume by the age difference we have different view of the world and different agendas and everything is very different between us. My dad is 57 and he isn‚Äôt very ‚Äúliving in the house‚Äù he is usually at work or in his room. Ok let‚Äôs get to the story, it‚Äôs very fresh cause it happened today.  I had a free day (meaning there was no school) so she wanted to talk to me , as usual I didn‚Äôt think much of this and just set and listened, at some point she started telling me that she is lonely and she basically has no life accept me and mu older brother (which is 36 and has a baby and a wife) , at this point I was like ‚Äúüòê‚Äù then she started telling me that she is afraid of my future cause I‚Äôm not really doing great in school, but I tried to tell her that It‚Äôs not the only thing that matters (I have a artistic ‚Äútalent ‚Äú let‚Äôs say) and extra. Then she broke crying and said things like ‚Äúwithout you my life is worthless and I never wanted to be you enemy and yeah I‚Äôm not the typical loving mom but I always wanted the best for you!‚Äù At this point I held my crying and said ‚Äúyou should accept me not being the most brilliant student but I do have a passion for art that will provide me in my life and you shouldn‚Äôt worry about that. ‚Äú I felt like a motherfucking dumbass saying it to her, I felt so bad and then she kissed me on my head and we both went silent but after couple of minutes she said ‚ÄúI know that, but imagine for a second how I feel. Every day that we fight, every time that you raise you voice on me I want to die because I made that, I didn‚Äôt give you enough love in you childhood and I didn‚Äôt give you anything besides pain and (what I like to call) ‚Äúmath and school problems ‚Äú , I just want you to know that your my everything and that I‚Äôm just afraid, I just want the best for you‚Äù and again about how she feels alone and that she just wants to runaway and not see my dad and me and basically depressed talking, now, I never thought about how she feels or about that she is alone, I never connected with her because all my life she tried to be my manager Instead of my mom. Again, it happened today. And I just wish that I wasn‚Äôt born because it seems that all of what she said to me started 16 years ago‚Ä¶ I never felt like this, especially not for her, but I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I feel so bad about every time I caused her some mental damage, which apparently happens every day,. She told me that she will try to take more interest in my artistic ways and less about school, but how can I live with the fact that every time I said something stupid to her she just hated herself more and more, like fucking 16 years‚Ä¶  should I apologize? Should I spend more time with a complete stranger to me? What should I fucking do. Just saying. She has never touched me (harming, or abusing), never. Just putting it out here.	1643204456.0	sd67z9	/r/offmychest/comments/sd67z9/i_fucked_up_my_moms_life_by_literally_living/	I fucked up my moms life by literally living
j4ba9	I hate being poor. I'm just so fucking tired. I broke down in tears today at work.   I started a new job in mental health services this year, on the 1st of Jan. I'm an "experience expert", meaning I have personal experience suffering from mental health problems and recovering from them, and I've been healthy for a good while. I underwent a long training course for it last year, and got the job in December.  I work for the city now, for the city hospital's psychiatry department. (Only hospital here, I'm in Finland.) My main job is meeting with patients, talking with them. One part listening, giving a chance to open up to someone "less formally", someone who knows what they've been through. And one part talking about my own experience, telling what helped me and what didn't and directing them toward services that I think will work in their specific circumstance. Other aspects of my job are taking part in boards developing the services, giving lectures to patient groups, educating personnel and stuff like that.  I'm really hoping to make a difference. To help. I want to make the lives of people who are suffering better. I know how much it can mean to hear from someone who's been there and made it through. I want to change the attitudes of nurses, social workers, doctors and so on, so they understand better.   All of my clients so far have been such intelligent, kind people. Not like the stereotypical image of a "crazy" person at all. In a way it's more heartbreaking that way.  I'm going to be lecturing a group of young people with depression and anxiety next week. I'm excited and a little nervous. But if even one of them gains strength from hearing my story, I'll be happy.   My pay is not much, though the hourly wage adds up to a little over the minimum wage. But as my hours are reduced, the monthly earnings aren't much, about a 1000 euros a month. That's honestly a pittance in here, as Finland is a very expensive country. I can not increase my hours (not up to me), and it's very difficult to fit another job to my schedule, as the times I work aren't fixed. Also, this job has been pretty emotionally taxing, and I'm not sure if I'd have the energy to work an another job.    Well, today I found out my pay for this month will be reduced by 60%. Or not reduced, but 60% of it will be taxed away. Because I did what my superiors told me multiple times and in writing, and sent in my 2022 tax card. Well, the salary office would have needed last year's card too, but nobody told me. I just called them now and they said it's too late to do anything about it.  So instead of 1000 euros I'll get paid 390 euros for this month's work. I've been waiting to pay some bills and... now I'll have no money left for the month after paying the bills. And the bills are late already and I feel so guilty because one of them is a very old one for my dance school that I apparently didn't pay way back in 2020 even though I thought I did and I don't have the nerve to go to dance classes before I can pay it off and that's kinda sad since dancing is one of the only things that bring me joy (although covid restrictions mean the classes haven't started yet this year)...   As I was so deeply depressed for such a long time I didn't have the means to work or study for most of my adult life. That's why I've always been poor and am now in giant debt (from health care and dentist bills no less, yes even here in Finland that can happen).   It's a self-sustaining cycle. I'm poor so my physical and mental health are bad, I'm stressed and self loathing and all that just contributes to me staying poor or getting even poorer.   Honestly it felt like a miracle to be able to turn my past traumas around into tools to help others with. It's the best thing ever and finally made the world feel like it made sense to me. I could finally be proud of myself.   And I'm doing great, I've already gotten a lot of positive feedback from both coworkers and clients, and I really feel like I fit in here. I'm doing a lot to develop this job even further and accomplishing things already. I'm generally very healthy and happy, I'm just feeling very overwhelmed about this money situation right now. And, well, disappointed.  And yes, starting next month my pay should be all good and everything up to date. Although soon they'll probably start reducing the 1/3 part into the debt payments. But at least that's less than 60%, and I'm thinking of asking for postponement.   So. Wow, that was a lot. I just needed to... well, get that off my chest. Thanks to you if you managed to read all the way here.  Oh and BTW if you know easy ways to make lots of money, pls tell me.	1643204608.0	sd69v9	/r/offmychest/comments/sd69v9/i_was_barely_scraping_by_and_now_my_pay_is/	I was barely scraping by and now my pay is reduced 60% due to someone else's mistake
ejruj8wh	My (18 trans male) younger sister M (12f) constantly slaps, pinches, punches and scratches me. My mother won't do anything, whether she is a witness to the events or not, regardless of any evidence I show her. There was even a time when M threatened to choke me with a charger cable and proceeded to put her hands on my throat when the cable was taken off her. I don't know how to make M stop harming me. I've tried avoiding her, which is quite difficult considering we live in the same house. Asking her to stop doesn't work either.  Getting onto the age difference thing, I know it's ridiculous. Trust me. I get how insane it sounds. But, I can't hit her back. That would land more trouble for me. Even when we were younger and she'd hit me, I wouldn't fight back. The most I have ever done is shoved her away from me. And as mentioned, simply asking her to stop does nothing, nor does asking our mother for help. I just don't know how to make her stop. I'm sick of getting new bruises and scabs every other day.	1643205273.0	sd6hww	/r/offmychest/comments/sd6hww/my_younger_sister_wont_stop_harming_me/	My younger sister won't stop harming me.
ie1ub6l4	The pandemic has taken a large large toll on me. The biggest blow it dealt me was my weight (and consequently, my body image). I started at 140 March of 2020, went up to 148 by July the same year, and 2021, right on New Year's day, I sat on my bed, had my phone set up in front of me, then talked about how I felt so sorry for myself because I was at my heaviest of 152 and I needed that to change.  Now, it's 2022, three weeks before an important event where I would be meeting friends again for the first time in 2 years, and I'm 160lbs. But as the title says, that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that I've actually been posting on social media but I've been editing my photos. Trying to make my arms smaller, back to how they looked before the pandemic, trying to slim my waist down. Would use a camera app that made my face slimmer. Whenever me and my friends would video chat, I'd have my camera off. When my family would post photos tagging me, I'd untag myself because I looked HIDEOUS. I don't know why but when I look in the mirror I don't look too bad, I don't look bigger. But I see the photos and it's like I don't know who that girl is. So then it makes me look in the mirror again, and I keep convincing myself I look fine, but I clearly don't, and when I have that realization, I step back for a moment and think, "I look like shit."   So, in a desperate attempt to feel better about myself, I try to workout, I eat healthier (which I do most of the time really, it's just I can't control my portions), I do all the little habits I see on the internet that helped people lose weight. And it works. It works for a while, I lose 5lbs, and then what? One morning I go downstairs for breakfast, thinking oatmeal with some chia seeds and peanut butter, but then I see rice. There's a voice in the back of my head that goes, don't. Because I know if I eat that one time saying it's a cheat meal, I'm never going to stop. I'm going to eat rice, maybe 2 cups, or 3, then the next meal I'll do the same and say the same excuse. And weeks down the line I look at the scale and I'm a few pounds than I was before I tried.   It's a cycle. And I keep setting myself back even further each time. This has gone on for nearly 2 years and I don't know how many times I've sat on the toilet, thinking what if I turned around, knelt on the bathroom floor, and just poked my throat with my fingers to purge what I ate? But I can't do that. I've been trying to lose weight in a health way. I eat enough food 3x a day and I do just the right amount of working out and sleep early. And you know what's kind of insane, when I try, my parents make me eat more. They get me to eat more food. They try to make me think I'm not eating enough when I am. They buy me a whole bag of Lay's and a few chocolate bars and I have to pretend I'm happy about that when I know I'll be trying for days not to eat it but I'll give in anyway. I try to jog on the treadmill and my mom tells me to just walk. I go down for dinner after working out to make myself food, and she says it's not enough. I don't know. Do they like me fat? I don't like myself like this.   I wish I could just be fine with the way I look right now, but I'm not. I'm trying to get back to how I was before it went to shit, but she's like a pipe dream. And another terrible thing was when I was that weight, I was incredibly happy. I was able to lose weight because I was in a good place mentally. But my parents called me skin and bones.   Nothin'g just ever enough.  Currently, I'm in another episode of what I call "Desperation". It's the 2nd day I'm working out. Cooked really great meals today. I'm attempting to lose 15lbs in 3 weeks which is completely stupid and impossible. I kind of want to throw up at the idea that I'm gonna meet friends (you know, friends who won't judge my weight) soon and they'll look at me and see how much different I look in person now.   I hate it. I hate it all.	1643205342.0	sd6irp	/r/offmychest/comments/sd6irp/its_930_pm_and_im_looking_up_how_to_lose_15lbs_in/	It's 9:30 PM and I'm looking up how to lose 15lbs in 2 weeks (but that's not the worst of it)
iv7g39r1	Even though I've always been an introvert, I used to be a lot more social and outgoing than I am now. Back in high school and university, I used to speak with people easily and occasionally hang out with friends. I never had any issues with making new friends either, be it online or in person. Some of those friendships ended because they betrayed my trust or we just drifted apart. I understand that people change, but I just didn't expect to feel so alone now.  Also, the more I age (27 F), the more I see people's intentions (+ red flags) and I just cannot ignore them...I can tell when someone is talking with me just because they need me to give them something in return. It is not real. I'm tired of being used as an object. Why is it so hard to make new friends as an adult and connect with people?

9b50ehvw	To start off I want to say that we are a poor family. Both Mom and Dad work and they still only have monthly income of 24,000 pesos (~480$) and if we minus rent, water, electricity bill, etc. We only have 12,000 pesos (~240$).  So here's why I hate my mom. She burns money fast. She buys random stuff (mostly for us) that are ultimately useless. She buys Junk foods, expensive foods (to impress the neighbors), random appliances (that we probably won't even use), etc. So when its near the end of the month already, we cannot even buy food so she borrows money and gets in debt. I talked to my mom about this. Told her that random stuff should be bought if we still have money after the end of the month, and that borrowing money is not magic and it will come back to bite the next month. But my Mom being my mom, won't listen because "Mother's knows best".  So where does her siblings fit into this? Her siblings lives with us and doesn't pay anything. Doesn't pay for food, for rent, for water and electric bills. When they need cigarette, they ask mom for money (and my mom never fails to give them one). They are also don't have a full time job but when they do manage to get a part time job, they use all their earnings to buy beer (one of them also become aggressive and shouts inside the house) One of my mother's siblings has a family that also lives with us. Doesn't pay anything too. And don't you dare make their cry baby child cry. They act like anything is theirs too. Our bed? Don't go near it it will get dirty. The toys and food that my parents gave us? It's their child's now so don't even go near it. You're Noisy? Only they can make a noise. And when they get money, Expect nothing because it's spent on their gambling addiction.  Don't get me wrong they still do take care of us (they cook, they wash the dishes and almost do all the house chores. I don't even have do anything) but we are not rich that we can pay for their stuff 24/7.  Tl;Dr We are very poor but mom keeps burning money. Her siblings lives with us but doesn't pay anything. Not even for their food.  Also know that some of these are exaggerated cause I'm very very pissed rn.	1643205708.0	sd6nit	/r/offmychest/comments/sd6nit/i_hate_my_mom_and_his_siblings/	I hate my mom and his siblings

All companies are applying 3 4 interviews scheme, some require even to do a task or a research then they interview you. I usually do well , I can have a conversation and show my knowledge about the required skills for the role. But they can dismiss you for anything even if you are smart and decent person.     What is more toxic is how long you have to wait and beg through follow ups with the recruiters.     I swear to god many hiring managers wanted to get me but then just an asshole in their team decides nah.

h7rmagfi	My life is going great. Since I started focusing on studying again, my grades have made a huge leap and are really good. I‚Äòm confident as hell, way more than half a year ago and I‚Äòm having a good time in school, with everyone. I can even talk to girls now haha. I‚Äòm putting on some muscle and I‚Äòm able to do 3/4th of a one-arm pushup, so success in this part of my life too. There‚Äòs just one thing that I can‚Äòt seem to turn off.  In more quiet moments when I‚Äòm alone, I find myself thinking about how lonely I am, seen from a romantic perspective. It was going good for a while, I didn‚Äòt think about romance and stuff too much. But now I‚Äòm finding back to those thoughts. Probably because I‚Äòm currently working on a group project with classmates to perform a song (‚ÄúAin‚Äòt No Mountain High Enough‚Äú, for those of you that‚Äòd maybe like to know.) and I‚Äòm singing a duet with my crush, who stares at me permanently (in a good way, thank god). I‚Äòm just too chicken to ask her out cuz we‚Äòll be in the same class for the next two years and a ‚ÄûNo‚Äú could kinda ruin the chemistry on stage.

e91us9sc	Waking up groggy and unaware is the best part of my day. I wake up, and after about 5 seconds it's all down hill from there.   I get to the bathroom and check who's in the mirror. Sometimes early in the morning the guy in the mirror looks presentable but that's only when I forget my glasses. Sometime I stare in the mirror and try to memorize his face but he's never quite the same. Maybe not there at all on account of me never having a clear memory of him. I do my best to entertain myself from these thoughts until I have to clock in at my minimum wage job.  I'm fine here. The pay, hours and work all suck,  but having to interact with coworkers let's my social anxiety take the forefront rather than my more abstract existential dread. Only having to stress about my inability comfortably interact with people in my service job is almost relaxing compared to having to spend time alone.   Then I get home and try to get some sleep. I can usually only stand about 45 minute of my mind tellng me how everything wrong with me is incurable and everything I do  is a sign of my subhuman nature, before I reach for my phone. I browse dumb shit until I crash then do it all again the next day.

injm3ob8	During COVID and the first lockdown I lost my job, I ended up working for a company that dealt with secondhand stock/sold it cheap. I loved it there, was a genuinely great place to work.  I changed my shift pattern and ended up managing a shift but it became obvious really quickly that a new member of staff didn't like me. I wasn't particularly bothered because not everyone has to like you, but they were actively breaking rules, walking off, doing unbelievably poor work on purpose, talking shit about me to other staff and then they eventually started threatening and intimidating me.  I reported it to one of my managers (I had 2) who at first was really supportive, but honestly did nothing. As it carried on and got worse I got to a point where I spent most of my nights in work crying and scared because it was such a volatile atmosphere.   I eventually spoke to the same manager again and told him how it was affecting me and the conversation didn't go how I thought at all. He accused me of hating men (we had a pretty 50/50 split of men/women and the one guy was the only person I'd had a problem with). That he'd spoken to the person and they said they weren't threatening me so it was my word against theirs and that if it continued I'd have to leave.  I was heartbroken because I'd tried my hardest there, the other staff had even been and complained about the persons attitude towards them and me because it was causing such a bad environment, and even my other manager was backing me up because he'd heard and seen how the person spoke to me, but the other manager dismissed it completely even saying "so you want us to sack someone based on how you feel?"  I decided I couldn't work there anymore after that because I felt so threatened and disregarded. I found another job quickly, much better company, pay, environment everything! But I still feel like I don't I had any closure from my last job.  I wrote my bosses a letter about how the manager disregarding and belittling me was the reason I'd decided to leave but I still feel like I'm owed an apology or something for just how little they cared for my safety!  I've thought a lot about contacting my old manager and telling him just how little I think of him after what he did to me but it won't change anything now. It still really upsets me, and I feel like I was just scapegoated because the manager hired the person and didn't want to admit he was a shitty hire.  I dunno, I just need to say it out loud and get it out there, nothing will change now and I'm better for it having happened but I still can't believe something like this happened to me...	1643208584.0	sd7nwl	/r/offmychest/comments/sd7nwl/im_still_sad_over_my_last_job_ending_even_though/	I'm still sad over my last job ending even though I'm better off.
ekvmc0a3	I studied in London for 4 years, I went through a lot in that time, some life changing stuff really, it wasn‚Äôt a great time for me by any stretch but my experience of London was exciting. I‚Äôve been to most places and got to experience a lot here, most nights were about making plans with friends or my ex boyfriend - uni came second to adventure. I came out of uni with a decent portfolio of work and landed a creative job back in my home city where I moved back to at the start of COVID. After that job didn‚Äôt work out I decided I missed London and moved back for another creative job with lots of responsibility, I‚Äôm lucky for that I know. A lot of my classmates are still looking for work. However, I‚Äôm realising I will never have my life back the way it was during university and the reality of living in London now is working way too hard for not that great a salary, dealing with expensive living costs and there being little to no excitement in my life. I also live on the outskirts and don‚Äôt get to go into central much or experience what I used to. I‚Äôve always been ambitious since I was a child and I think my family and friends back home understand my decision to move back to London is due to this. There‚Äôs so much I want to achieve but I feel robbed of my time working 50 hours a week for someone else - forcing my dreams to go on the back burner while I just try and survive. One of my better traits is that if I want something, I go and make it happen, but any means necessary - so I have faith that things will change but for now life is really bleak and I need to vent.	1643208886.0	sd7rwv	/r/offmychest/comments/sd7rwv/moved_back_to_london_to_work_and_im_realising_i/	Moved back to London to work and I‚Äôm realising I will always long for my experience of London during my studies

I am really annoyed as I had to wait two days to get data off of a colleague when the task should of taken 20 minutes to hour max. I guess the only reason I got the data is because I had to constantly chase them up and also get my boss to ask. But in the end of the day It's a bad look and is going to reflect badly on me.

i1fymj3q	My name is Dimitri. We were having a fun conversation with my parents and my dad jokingly said "oh just like the other Dimitri". I laughed and thought they were joking about something so I asked what they meant. My mother then looked at my dad with a serious look and said "stop now". I realized that it was something serious so I insisted and asked about it.   Apparently in 1999 my mother gave birth to a child. They also named him Dimitri. He was born with a heart defect so he stayed at the hospital. He passed away some time later while he was still a baby from said heart condition. They later had me, and named me Dimitri also.   I was kinda shook. They said that I was to young to tell me and later on they were just looking for the right time. They avoided the conversation again and again until my dad forgot that I was THE ONLY ONE IN THE FAMILY that didn't knew and it slipped out, before my mother tried to stop him. The way that I found out was totally inappropriate. We were all kinda tipsy on wine and laughing and they just said it because for them it's been so long. I feel like I had the right to know. I got kinda mad and left soon after. Am I being unfair to them? Did I not have the right to know?

42siscm2	I can‚Äôt stop being a failure no matter how hard I try. I‚Äôm ugly and boring and uninteresting and not even enough of any of those to be noticeable. I constantly feel invisible, like people look right through me and don't even see me. No one ever looks at me. I wish they would, even if it was in disgust. I wish people would look at me. No one has ever cared about me or my emotions or my thoughts. I might as well not exist, I could just as easily not exist and no one would notice. No one has ever made an effort with me, because i'm not worth the effort. People measure me by what they can use me for and swiftly move on. I must be so many shades of beige and grey. No one has ever found me interesting or funny. I hate my existence. I hate every day i have to wake up and see how little people care about me. It is so painful to know if i didnt exist people wouldnt even care. I dont think anyone has ever loved me. Even my own family barely think about me. Everyone is so wrapped up in their own thoughts and i don‚Äôt think they consider me a real person, just someone who exists vaguely in the background. I try so hard to be funny or interesting or something to get some sort of notice but i don‚Äôt think it would matter what i did, no one would ever care. I‚Äôm a failure and a disappointment on so many levels. I have nothing going for me. I don‚Äôt think my existence is a net positive or a negative, I think I just keep on existing. Not a single person would shed a tear if i died. They wouldnt even feel sad. I don‚Äôt see any reason to keep going on with this pathetic existence. We are meant to live on this earth to mean something and i mean nothing to nobody, i impact no one and no one feels my presence. They say no man is an island but i must be. I think if i died it would be forgotten immediately. Nothing i do will ever matter. I could delete myself anytime i wanted and nothing would change. I question if i really exist. I‚Äôve never been remotely interesting, I‚Äôve never been the person in the room people notice. Ive always been a vague shadow that no one thinks of. I have nothing to offer to anyone. I hate myself.   I was rejected from Cambridge university. I didn‚Äôt realise how much I cared. I felt if I got in it would prove I had worth as a person, maybe people would be forced to take notice. But it didn't work. I failed. No one will ever care about me. I got so close too, so painfully close, they pooled me, I was only narrowly rejected. I had so much chance to be somebody, i came so close but I failed and fucked it up again. I wanted to prove I could be somebody, be important, be someone people could care about. No one could care about me, I was stupid and wrong. I think sometimes I might just fade out of existence. I am worried it could happen. If we only exist in other peoples imaginations, do I even exist at all? I am certain no one ever thinks of me. I worry I could die in the middle of the street and people would not even stop and take notice; they would just pick up their shopping bags and walk over my corpse as if I wasn't there. Nothing I do will make me any realer. I feel as if I am in a drawing and I can see myself being erased. I am confident I will never have any impact on this world. When I die, not a single soul will know or care. I know that now. I will die in anonymity, probably with no family. No one will ever know I existed. I am a living ghost of a person who never lived.	1643209533.0	sd80yt	/r/offmychest/comments/sd80yt/i_feel_as_if_i_could_fade_out_of_existence_and_no/	I feel as if I could fade out of existence and no one would ever notice

26grje2f	Four months ago, a girl I was dating stopped seeing me. I became pretty depressed and started drinking a lot. A month later, while I was drunk, I decided to look up escorts online. Because of the beer, I stupidly go with one who offers natural services..  Once I get there she was an older asian lady with limited English so talking was difficult. When I was on the bed I really wanted to leave and said that, but she kept insisting she was clean etc. She then grabbed my dick and put it inside her. I accidentally finish inside her.. I get dressed, go home, and cry.  I‚Äôve had myself tested for STDs regularly and have slowed down my drinking. But, I keep thinking about it. Worrying about stupid things like what if she got pregnant, and in the future some random kid comes up to me and says I‚Äôm their dad, etc. She went and cleaned herself up straight away and went to the toilet, but idk.

bfyazs4b	I just need to get this out. It‚Äôs too heavy.  I had a child at 16. At that age I genuinely thought life would ‚Äúwork itself out‚Äù for me. I never stopped to think how I‚Äôd finish school, work, find childcare, move out of my parents house, and comfortably provide for the two of us.  I wish I was physically forced to get an abortion bc I truly had NO IDEA what I was getting myself into; I assumed those telling me to abort were ‚Äúhaters‚Äù. Nah. They were trying to knock some sense into me.   My child is 5 now & I‚Äôm a full-time uni student living w/ my narcissistic parents. I want to move out & live on-campus, but nope, stuck at home with a kid. I can‚Äôt believe I chose this life for myself. If I could go back w/ the knowledge I have now, I‚Äôd get that abortion in a heartbeat.   I love my son from the depth of my soul, but I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I need to be free from my abusive parents. The only reason I had him was bc I was convinced he would ‚Äúsave me‚Äù from depression. How horribly selfish and na√Øve.

h229l4dq	I tried so hard to be calm, reasonable and diplomatic about this. I tried SO hard. I really and truly did.  I said it exactly like this: "I'm deeply concerned about the amount of money we have been spending on weed, and I feel we really need to cut back. I went through the numbers and I was very alarmed. In the span of three weeks, we spent almost 500$ at the dispensary."  We're not in good financial straits right now and are really, really struggling, FYI. Also, I am pregnant and have not been using myself. Today I wanted to buy some strawberries and he got upset and objected because it was 11$ for a box, because, apparently we don't have the money right now.  As I was afraid he would, he got really, really defensive and upset. "Yeah, about 130$ a week, that's my normal. I've been cutting back! I cut out a whole bunch of other things! I don't drink or smoke cigarettes! Now you're telling me I need to cut back on the one thing I enjoy doing?"  Then: "It's in the past! There's nothing we can do! Just forget about it!"  I immediately backed down and apologized and said I shouldn't have said anything, because, clearly, it was a bad idea. I said I was not trying to criticize or attack him in any way, and I'm really not. I know he enjoys weed and I am not trying to take that away from him.  I just want to cry. I feel so bad now for saying anything. Every time I try to talk about something I'm upset or worried about, he just gets really upset with me it seems.  ...I don't understand what I do so wrong.

awouzysz	Just some background I was put into the foster system at 6 months old cause my real mom was an addict so I put in the custody of my great grandparents anyways yesterday my great aunt (F53) told me (F18) that her dad my great grandfather (M77) abused her and my grandmother (F52) when they were children and my great grandmother (F71) knew about it and chose to stay with him, she then informed me that she stayed around all these years so he didn‚Äôt do the same thing to me as I grew up. As someone who was abused by someone who lived us as a young child this makes me sick to think about. I‚Äôve been called a abuser dad all these years and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it.	1643210999.0	sd8ko2	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8ko2/yesterday_i_found_out_the_man_i_call_dad_is_a/	Yesterday I found out the man I call dad is a child molester
1y9rryml	This morning i woke up to my dog barking downstairs,this is not something he normally does. I heard immediatly that there was something wrong. When i saw him i knew something was wrong,he was  Next to his pillow and couldnt gett up. He also pooped inside for the first time in 10 years. I helped him up and he could stand up himself and i let him outside to pee,i ran upstairs to wake my wife to tell her something was wrong with him. When we came back down i started to clean his poo up and my wife went outside to look at him. She then yelled that he layed onto the driveway. We then carryed him inside and sat with him onto the kitchenfloor. He was breathing heavy and then looked into our eyes and wiggled his tail.he then did this thing with his paw like he always does when he want his belly rubbed and while we were stroking his belly we where crying and telling him that we loved him. He then just died into my  lap. He was gone in less than 20 minutes I am heartbroken,he was my best friend. I just dont know how to carry on without him. I just wanted to  vent,thanks	1643211053.0	sd8lgi	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8lgi/my_dog_died_this_morning_in_my_lap_and_i_am_broken/	My dog died this morning in my lap and i am broken.

1q3nu305	I've been working in the civil service for almost a year checking patent applications and pointing out discrepancies which is about as fun as it sounds. Granted, that's not long compared to the veterans who have somehow stuck it out for 30+ years. The system is pointlessly convoluted and the monotony and bureaucracy is out of a Kafka story.  The job is thankless and you're treated like complete shit. The higher ups always try to push this dystopian concept of a happy family work environment when they honestly couldn't care less about you. Everyone on your level is wishing for your demise and brown-nosing to get brownie points from the managers (even though the job is pay graded and there's literally nothing you can do to increase your pay in the role). I've had so many people trying to step on me for absolutely no reason when I just stick to my own thing. Yes I slip up sometimes but everyone uses any mistakes as an opportunity to make you look bad. I've had complaints made about me for the most menial things when I'm literally the most invisible person to exist. My manager has even had concerns that I'm not reaching out enough, despite the reason being is that I don't feel the need to?  Now I've reached a point where I don't give a fuck about it anymore but I also fear that this will aid in my eventual dismissal. Everyone there can go fuck themselves. I'm only staying there because the pay is good in relation to how low I am on the food chain, I can't afford to quit or be on a lower pay and being in the civil service has great job security and is somewhat reputable.  My line manager is a spineless mess who has the authoritativeness of a child. She has a nervous demeanour, can't make simple decisions without the affirmation of her own colleagues and doesn't know anything about the fucking job I'm doing as she's never had experience in the role. She asks me questions then ignores the answers, she goes against my wishes and makes me look like a fucking idiot when I'm contacted by other staff who think I'm struggling because she's gone and told everyone that I can't keep up, and I *swear* she's trying to gaslight me into believing that I need to reduce my hours just because I have one hour of therapy every 2 weeks.  My effort has reduced greatly over the last week and they're starting to notice and I know I need to suck it up and just focus on the paycheck, but I can't bring myself to give a shit anymore, like it's physically painful to wake up in the mornings knowing that I have to do this shit.  I know you can just say that all this shit comes with the territory when working in an office environment but I just fucking hate that it has to be this way. I don't expect fun fuelled hijinx by any means but it bothers me that there's so much malice in everyone's intentions and the work is the equivalent of watching paint dry but also bashing your head against the same wall. Now I'm trapped in this shitty fucking job for the foreseeable future, or until they cut me loose.	1643211457.0	sd8quw	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8quw/i_fucking_despise_my_job_and_i_fear_that_im_gonna/	I fucking despise my job and I fear that I'm gonna get fired eventually but I just can't bring myself to give a shit anymore

8e7x5z4n	 So, okay. I've known this girl for a while through a mutual friend and we went to a party back in December together. Mind you we're seniors in high school and we're both 18. We were talking a flirting for a while until I kind of fucked her over, and used her to get with another girl. Ever since then things have been kind of awkward between us, and she has a boyfriend. He's like not very attractive and his personality is not it at all. I don't like the guy but I befriended him. My plan is to hack into his Instagram account say some out of pocket shit, do some out of pocket shit, get her to dislike him, fuck her over through his Instagram account and watch him deny everything. Knowing her she'll think he's a liar and drop him. Now, I know. I feel so guilty doing this but I won't stop. All throughout high school i've taken highly advanced IT classes, Social Media Security classes and multiple Cybersecurity and backdoor coding classes. I figured out a way to hack into his account but I haven't done it yet. I'm sure it will work. I really like her. I'm not sure if I'll be sorry.	1643211607.0	sd8svw	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8svw/i_hacked_into_a_guys_instagram_account_i_plan_on/	I hacked into a guy's Instagram account.

f4ia2wwi	so last night i finally did the nasty with this girl I've been talking for a month and it was honestly really nice and like the first time in awhile I enjoyed sex. Like I tried the random "hooking" up A month ago and like it was okay and thats kinda how I knew I was like "healed" from past trauma with sex. Its so weird cause I feel like I'm finally healed from my last two exs and have been for like the 3-5 months. I wasnt really able to feel like turned on, butterflies, anything of that nature or anything after 2020. It's so weird to actually feel those feelings again. I also midly feel bad because I cant really give her 100% attachment because it would fuck up my healing and how much ive worked on detaching from everything and everyone cause shit happens. I woke up today to like 5-6 scs from her? and it kinda like scared me in a way..	1643212108.0	sd8zfy	/r/offmychest/comments/sd8zfy/so_last_night_uh/	so last night uh
2c46rlxj	   I feel really awkward posting this but I just had to vent to some strangers, maybe ask for some tips but also share this for people in a similar situation. Like I expected it turned out way too long but I had to share the full story. Hope it's entertaining enough for one of you.  I'll try to keep the back story as short as possible. I started dating my girlfriend over 3 and a half years ago. I'm not about to dissect her whole psychological profile but at the time she was very unstable, had suffered sexual trauma and was very insecure. I don't want to oversimplify and make light of these issues but I hope you understand the 'type': lots of commitment issues, insane 'flight reaction' and basically afraid of everything that resembles real intimacy, which in her case led to a lot of 'casual' sexual encounters because of her lack of self esteem (again, oversimplifying but I hope it adds to the context). She also has Aspergers which makes communicating hard and frustrating sometimes, as I'm the type that wants to talk about and dissect EVERYTHING.  I cut her off, mostly to protect myself, but I knew I still wanted this girl and after half a year we came back together. Still not 'officially', but we spent a lot of time together. I was so happy and glad she finally realised her own worth, and mine, but she still had these tendencies to 'run away' whenever things became intense. I noticed these things, and also noticed her drifting away. During these phases I became suspicious, asked her about other guys and she denied. I knew she was lying but I convinced myself we still weren't dating officially and as her mental state got better, she wouldn't want anyone but me. I realise I sound like captain save a hoe, and I was, but I was just too committed to make it work.  Afraid of being captain of this sad ship though, I developed some toxic traits which were very unlike myself. I kept in contact with some girls that I knew liked me, just to get some pretty much 'unconditional', straight forward affection; and to protect myself from further heartbreak. It never got physical, I didn't want it to as I only 'used' them as a distraction (not lying to them or manipulating them as far as I know, but definitely not having the purest of intentions).  A few months later I went to study abroad for half a year. My absence forced us to discuss our relationship (which was now 'official', a label that didn't really mean that much to me but still important I guess); I knew how scared she was of me leaving, I saw her opening up to me more and more and she convinced me she was committed to me. I believed her, a 100%, but was still annoyed this 'confession of her true love' didn't include coming clean about some hookups a few months before (of which by now I had some vague evidence). I loved this girl though, so I made the decision to 'forgive' her. It still hurt, because I'd always been there for her a 100% unconditionally, and made me feel like a weakling, but I still stood behind my decision.  Because of my frustration, and how incredibly hard it was for me to get in touch with her, I 'drifted away' myself. (again, huge generalisation so apologies for all people on the spectrum, but god damn having a long distance thing with someone with Aspergers is hard as fuck). I had an amazing time abroad, (re)discovered some parts of myself, made a lot of new friends which gave me a huge confidence boost, and also got more female attention than I was used to. Since these doubts were lingering in my mind, and most my efforts to communicate were in vain, I got 'intimate' with two girls over the course of half a year, although it was non-physical except for making out for a few seconds once, which I immediately regretted.  Then, one day, she called me up crying, apologising for the way she was acting, explaining how hard shit was for her etc etc, and that she booked a flight to visit me for a week, which I had wanted her to do for so long, and it really hurt me that she hadn't so this made me really happy. We had a great week, great conversations, great everything, and I felt like we turned a page (even though now I felt some sense of guilt).  Fast forward again. From the moment I've been back home, two years ago, shit has been amazing. I've seen her gain confidence, become more independent, realise how smart she actually is, losing her toxic traits ("I'm a worthless piece of shit so that explains away all the shitty things I do" gosh I hate that) and just in general become a happier person. She's done all of this herself of course but I know I'm a big part of her 'happiness', although that sounds arrogant as fuck. She has expressed this to me many times as well, which is great, because I know how hard it is for her to communicate feelings. When I compare how close we are to other couples around me (although this is hard to judge from the outside and sounds cringe), I feel like we have a great relationship.  She still had her personal issues, and I still worried about the cracks in our foundation from time to time, but between us I was a 100% convinced we were true to eachother. I was really happy to hear she was entering group therapy to work on her personal problems as well.  Last week I had 4 missed calls and she had texted me to come to my house. In all of our time together she NEVER has initiated meeting so spontaneously so I immediately knew something was up. When she got to my house she dropped the bomb, and god damn am I glad it wasn't as atomic as I thought:   She told me when we had started dating, she had sex with somebody, and then over the course of 3 months kissed two other people. She explained every detail I wanted to know (not a lot). It all happened before I went abroad, and only one kiss before we were official (haha I sound like a high schooler), but damn did it still hurt to know WHAT I HAD ACTUALLY KNOWN/HEAVILY SUSPECTED ALL ALONG BUT JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CONFRONT HER WITH. In those months my only priority was her well being, so of course I felt betrayed.  On the other hand, I was really happy that she finally came clean. I had never seen her so afraid and emotional, but at the same time trying to calmly explain how therapy had given her insights in 'how fucked up her thought processes' actually were. We had a great, open conversation in which I expressed my anger and frustration (although I luckily remained very calm). I also told her what 'happened' abroad and spilt out all my insecurities: how I felt like a SIMP, how I wanted to fuck somebody else as payback, how I was afraid that forgiving her made me look even more like a loser and would inadvertently lead to her thinking she could cheat on me and get away, everything. We also talked about the imbalance of our relationship (me giving, her taking) and how bad she felt about it. I know this might sound a lot like me trying to convice you she was being 'real', but it's not, I actually know she was being truthful but I just wanted to explain how glad I was we had a real conversation instead of me just screaming, which is what this shit usually leads to.  I forgave her. One because I love her. Two because I know she was being honest and I know from personal experience, both my parents and my friends, how rare that is. Three because I had always been somehow aware of her escapades, and had some of my own, although less intense, and only as a reaction to her (which doesn't make it right). Four because I don't want to throw away something that has been so good because of mistakes in our very unstable past.  I stand a 100% behind my decision, and I'm not looking for "once a cheater always a cheater" comments, although feel free if you can't help yourself. It's not easy though, which was the initial point of this post (fucking finally my guy!). It's hard as fuck. I feel 'okay' one moment then all of a sudden I'm in this negative spiral feeling betrayed, emasculated, weak and stupid. My brain keeps analyzing memories of the past tainting them with what I now know for sure. Last night I was shaking uncontrollably, having what I would describe as my first 'full-on' panic attack. I texted my girl, again explaining a lot of my doubts and anger, and she was there for me in the way I wanted her to be.  Still feel like shit, but despite all that, when I think of things rationally, I have more faith in the future of our relationship then ever. It's hard as fuck, and I still feel like she 'owes' me in some way which I don't like, but I've expressed this to her as good as I can. When I think of my situation I think of an interview with a relationship expert/psychologist I saw once. She talks about cheating being one of the biggest taboos in (Western) society. It's like the one unforgiveable relationship crime for which a solution seems impossible, and she has "seen a lot of relationships be destroyed that could've been saved by working on it." I really like this 'solution-based' approach. Of course a lot of people are just cheating assholes who you should cut out of your life, but a lot of times it's not as black and white and it's actually worth trying to save what you have.  If you made it to the end of this freakin' novel, congratulations. Just wanted to share my situation as it's been weighing heavy on my mind, but I also feel like a lot of people might be in a similar situation. It's less common (as far as I know) for a guy to be in this position so maybe it gives one of you some insights.	1643212302.0	sd91zx	/r/offmychest/comments/sd91zx/i_forgave_my_unfaithful_girlfriend_but_its/	I forgave my 'unfaithful' girlfriend but it's extremely hard

cy9laf6b	So about 11 months ago, my old friend group sort of abandoned me because we went different paths after a couple of years in college. I was never one to aggressively party or consume alcohol/soft drugs/marijuana and they wanted to love life to the lees, to put it mildly. They soon found company in others like them, and I slowly began to fade out. I have a bunch of very very good friends in college but I still feel extremely pained at the thought of losing my connection with those I truly cared for, for so long. I genuinely felt like I had a good connection with them and things were good, but it‚Äôs just a bunch of sad memories now. Whenever I see them post pictures of having fun or being around each other, only excluding me, it breaks my heart a little. The hurt comes and goes and sometimes it goes away for a while but other times, it hits me like a truck. I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this mental hole of doom I‚Äôve created for myself. It feels like time is passing very slowly and I‚Äôm drowning in it a little. I try to make up for my sadness by working hard academically and live off the temporary rushes of serotonin that come upon receiving an academic achievement. It does make me feel better but it‚Äôs temporary. I have rekindled my love for photography and have some very lovely friends (and family) that are supportive but I still can‚Äôt get over the feeling of abandonment I have. I just hope the pain and anguish subsided soon. May you all have a lovely day.	1643212553.0	sd959i	/r/offmychest/comments/sd959i/i_lost_my_friends_and_it_hurts/	I lost my friends and it hurts
2wq8t9ya	I (19m) am tired of my family, especially on my dad‚Äôs side but almost entirely my family. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been late to work because my mamaw (dad‚Äôs side) asked me to grab a tote down for her because she can‚Äôt reach it or lift it, or she‚Äôs asked me to take the trash off just as I‚Äôm leaving to go do something. I know that last one is a little petty but still, it‚Äôs not like it was sitting around waiting to be taken off, plus I have to drive it to the dump because they don‚Äôt want to pay for the service to have the dump truck come by. If she had asked me to do it before I was getting ready to leave I would‚Äôve done it, but not as I‚Äôm practically one foot out the door.   As for my dad he doesn‚Äôt want to get too involved because he knows that if he does she‚Äôll feel like it‚Äôs an attack on her because of it being his property (which it is, she just has a house there) and because I‚Äôm his son. Yet she‚Äôll sit there looking at old high school graduation photos of other family members, and literally said (unprompted) ‚ÄúI‚Äôd look at these and be so disappointed in you‚Äù and it just hurts. Especially because I did graduate barely, during Covid. She was even there, but I guess it was referring to graduation photos, but she always initiated those and didn‚Äôt this time.  She‚Äôll do this and basically talk down about me, usually when I‚Äôm not around (I caught her talking to someone in the family, idk who for sure, but she was talking about me and saying all these negative things, so I assumed she thought I wasn‚Äôt listening) and he‚Äôll one time I went out for lunch and didn‚Äôt ask her if she wanted anything (which I usually don‚Äôt, plus I didn‚Äôt have a lot of sore money but enough to eat out a few times, but no real obligation to get her anything) and when I got back she was raising a fit, while I was working at home!   She does these things then asks questions like why I‚Äôm so negative around her, and hell one time she legitimately asked my dad where I was getting the money to eat and pay my phone bill. Probably from the f*cking job I‚Äôve been doing for the past 6-7 months now!  This all goes on usually when my dad isn‚Äôt around and I‚Äôll tell him sometimes but he won‚Äôt do much of anything because he wants to spare her feelings since it is her house on his property and she is his mom. I don‚Äôt want any special treatment, I just want to be treated like family. I‚Äôll do the dishes and my laundry, and even though it makes me late I‚Äôll help with the totes and sh*t, yet she keeps treating me and talking about me like crap.   I can‚Äôt afford a place of my own, even with budgeting, I would stay with my mom or her parents but my step dad isn‚Äôt too keen on my coming and staying, and I tried to stay with her parents but they want me to work with them over my work and put them before my health.  The only exceptions to the title is my mom because she will help when she can and my brother because compared to the rest of the family, we‚Äôve gotten pretty close.	1643212644.0	sd96h3	/r/offmychest/comments/sd96h3/this_is_gonna_be_a_harsh_one_but_my_family_is/	This is gonna be a harsh one, but my family is family to me by blood only.
51qw68fw	My dad's pretty much a narcissist.  My mom knows that and so does my brothers and sisters.  He always says how great he is and how others rank him for all the work he does and we should do the same. When I was learning to drive I had to watch him and should already know everything about the car prior to driving.   My mom's not that bad but there are occasions where she'll go through a fit and start throwing and screaming, but she has a thyroid problem and is in her mid 50s so I guess it's normal.    But thats not the problem I have now   I have a 34 year old brother who lives rent, and food free with my parents. He refuses to pay for almost all bills and will very rarely help around the house. He didn't go to college, and all he does is complain about my parents. Day in and day out he calls me or texts me about them.    My parents asked him to pay rent a few years back which he did and now he expects them to pay him back. He is demanding that my dad give him a down payment to buy a house because that's how much they owe him.   They apartment they live in is rotting from the inside with mold and dirt everywhere.  My mom works three jobs and my dad works with door dash so he can be flexible with my younger brother (15) and younger sister (19)    They have 1 car since the other car broke down recently ( which is my sisters). So my dad's day involves dropping my brother at school, dropping mom and sister at work, finding time to work himself and picking all them up.    My brother is upset that they don't clean the house like doing the dishes and general cleaning. He told me that he is going to tell the apartment manager how filthy the place is and get them evicted in spite of them not cleaning and giving him money to move out.   He is a bad influence on my younger brother, and he constantly distracts him from school. He is addicted to fortnite and drags my younger brother to my place to play it for him since he is good. Whenever he does come to my place to play games he eats all my food complains how nobody makes food for him and he'll occasionally buy everything he ate with a generic version.   He can be a bit suicidal so my parents are concerned he might do something drastic again and each time my parents tell him to move out he screams he wants his money.   I'm sure I can go on forever but I'm not sure what to do with him.    Tl;Dr my family is a mess and my brother is a entitled man child  and need advice.	1643212696.0	sd9767	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9767/dealing_with_a_toxic_family/	Dealing with a toxic family

go6cyt9l	Almost 3 years na and I still haven‚Äôt moved on from my 6-year past relationship. I feel like I just miss the idea of that relationship. Last night, I once again check his profile and saw that he‚Äôs still with the girl he chose over me. I hate that I still have this little hope of getting back together even though I know that it‚Äôs a lost cause already. However it still makes me sad. It still makes me question my worth everyday. It still crushes me. I still fear of putting myself into a new relationship. I still think how can he be in a relationship 2 weeks after breakup and having a good time while I spent my last three years trying to move on and still fails to do so. This situation really makes me sad. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve a new happy love.   I know it was a forbidden act to check up on him, but I just wanted to check what I feel, if how much I would still be hurt. Gladly, it hurts less now.	1643212935.0	sd9arh	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9arh/havent_moved_on_still/	Haven‚Äôt moved on still
5w0cvdp4	But for now I‚Äôm stuck on a lease with him. We‚Äôve dated on and off for 8 years. High school sweeties. Lots of trauma and ups and downs together. He knows I plan to leave him in 6 months once our lease is up. He probably knows who I‚Äôm leaving him for. He‚Äôs trying so hard to be good to me and change my mind. It makes me feel horrible and is so confusing. The problem is that I‚Äôm in love with this other person, I have been for 3 years. Truth be I need to do this for myself. I can‚Äôt wait to leave and start over in a new state with my favorite person. I‚Äôve tried so many times to fully emancipate myself from this toxic relationship. The person who I plan to be with is my soulmate. We both have a ton of inner work to do but he is my person and I plan to be with him within a year. It is so painful to be stuck in this facade for the time being. I know that I‚Äôm a bad person.	1643212968.0	sd9b7s	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9b7s/im_finally_leaving_him_for_goodsoonish/	I‚Äôm finally leaving him for good..soonish
ggo8wtwh	In everything she's done. Now before you say you should love your mother. She took care of you and all. My mother was incarcerated most of my life. Always picking fights and into drugs. While I didn't know it then. She is the one that kept me from my father all my life. She had an affair married rich and left. My father was young and poor and had his while life ahead of him. So naturally my mother made sure to move far away to get me to a better school district. Making it nearly impossible for him to see me. She started dictating when he could and could not see me. This defeated man who once felt like he had everything. He did give up his paternal rights over me. There was nothing anymore. In the game of life he had lost. Lost to people like my mother. Her taunts, her emotionless. I know society says I have no one to blame but my own father. That's not what I see. Because while yes my father did hold the gun to his head in this scenario. It was my mother that pulled the trigger for him. She had all the power to turn around try to be a half decent person. However she's the one that delibertly moved far away to reduce his time with me to ashes. And so my mother succeeded and I never knew my father.	1643213007.0	sd9bs3	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9bs3/i_really_do_hate_my_mother/	I really do hate my mother
edyacd0y	My pet rabbit is beside me right now, trying to give her comfort as she cross the rainbow bridge. We were just playing this morning then this, a great shock, I am so heartbroken. You gave me purpose to get out of the bed, to go out, to be more responsible, and you fucking made me happy. You are so stubborn at times but damn, I love you with all my heart. I still remember when you were still so small like a snow ball, you instantly stole my heart. Those moments that I was trying so hard to get you to trust me, because I do not own you, you own me right? Hehe. When you flopped beside me my heart melted, I was like, wait.. Are we good now??? Oh yes. Like these work has finally paid off. Best day ever. You helped me to get through everything, mostly with my anxiety and depression, you are a huge help. Now, I don't even know what to do without you.    Thank you for everything. You're the best companion I ever had, I will never forget you. Thank you for the quick 2 years my love. I will miss you everyday. Don't worry about me, I will get through. Be happy and jump high!	1643213171.0	sd9e3t	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9e3t/thank_you_for_making_my_life_tolerable/	Thank you for making my life tolerable.
9v7ju59k	Currently me and my boyfriend live together at this mother's place.  His parents are divorced and she remarried a man. I got really close to her emotionally because she reminds me a lot of my mother who  I have  lost 10 years ago.   She has a 5 year old daughter. The only thing that makes this relationship going (in my mind) is for her to raise her daughter and have a roof above their heads. I don't think it's impossible for her to get her own place but it would be really hard at the moment because she lost her job. I totally understand her, she is a total fighter and i respect her from the bottom of my heart.  Today I heard them (his mom and his step dad) fighting over the dumbest reason I've ever heard. I stayed calm and mind my business, but I've lost my patience when I heard that little poor soul shouting at them "Stop fighting!". This got me really triggered because I didn't grew up in a calm household and this reminded me of my childhood.   No kid should go through this. She came into my boyfriend's room and i stayed there with her and play some games on my phone to distract her. She really enjoys my company and she always wants to stay with me which i don't mind.  Her father's mom, a complete witch if you ask me, she always tried to manipulate this poor child into staying with her, and if she doesn't want to spend time with her, the grandmother will say things like "I'm mad at you, you're a naughty child! I don't love you anymore!" And this gets me really sick. I've been talking with my boyfriend about this in a polite manner so we can find a way to protect her.  I had the need to write this somewhere because it's eating me inside knowing I can't do much because I'm not in the position.	1643213233.0	sd9eyh	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9eyh/i_feel_the_need_to_protect_this_kid/	I feel the need to protect this kid
d6qp96jw	I recently told my family about all the sexual abuse my uncle put me through as a kid, long story short we're going to press charges and the police are getting involved I'm supposed to meet up with them and tell them what happened but I've never done this before and was wondering if you guys could give me some insight on what you might have been through and what to expect with  the police or family denial.	1643213287.0	sd9fq6	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9fq6/came_out_to_family_about_sexual_abuse_most_my/	Came out to family about sexual abuse most my childhood.
69z261m7	My ex boyfriend's brother killed himself. Hung in the wall on a guitar holder with his bass strings. I was at his house and I was not the first one to see him, but trying to help, I went in to talk to the police and there he was. On the wall. I experienced PTSD symptoms for a month, I would have hallucinations with shadows on the walls being him. Nightmares where I found him still alive on the wall and couldn't move to help him everything. I stayed on cocaine and ketamine for a month so I wouldn't sleep nor feel anything.  Now this horror show is not happening anymore, but I want to die. I envy his courage. I don't want to go to sleep and when I do, I don't want to wake up. Nothing makes sense anymore. Me and him were very alike and used to make fun of it. I'm obsessed by his life. I talk about it all the time, and if I'm not talking, I'm thinking.  I'm good at pretending everything is good too. I deal with severe bipolar disorder and borderline disorder without meds for years now, and I can't remember a depressive episode that felt like this.  I have already tried suicide some times when I was younger and I thought that I had moved past this. It hit me like a shove in the face.	1643213422.0	sd9hkm	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9hkm/found_a_dead_friend_and_now_im_suicidal_again/	Found a dead friend and now I'm suicidal again.

All on top of severe depression and anxiety, which are common with PCOS. I'm only 24 and I feel like my body is betraying me. This is a huge shock and I just need some support handling everything. I have a therapist but it's a week until my next appointment, which sounds like a short time, but feels like an eternity to worry alone. I've told my family but they don‚Äôt seem bothered, what‚Äôs the big deal, you'll just get medications. I know they mean well, but I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre hearing me.

Ive never been in a relationship before this so I see her going through her first‚Äôs in her life and how they impact her has a lot of effects on me. I was her first sexual experience and she also moved to a different city. I used to hate that my parents were so static and habitual but now I understand why my parents haven‚Äôt changed at all in 20 years, its so much more calming to expect the same from the person you‚Äôre with, and this overwhelming feeling has made it hard for me to continue feeling like i love my girlfriend	1643213652.0	sd9kr5	/r/offmychest/comments/sd9kr5/im_starting_to_understand_why_older_people_wanna/	Im starting to understand why older people wanna marry people that will never change

fxcml4pv	So there's this boy, he was my classmate. He started chatting me after our TLE class, why? Well he was there to compliment me and  tell me that i made his day!   Was i appreciative? No, no i was not.  I was sorta uncomfortable.  You see, i was never the affection lovey-dovey idiot Type of person, i do NOT like affection in any form whether or not it's physical or verbal.  So what did i do? I decided hey! Let me just say thanks befriend him and then block him and completely ignore after weeks of buttering him up and spending time with him!  Why? I don't know! I'm so mad at myself! I just did it because i was bored!  And when i didn't have friends to spend time to i decided to apologies to him and butter him up again.  I do not know why and how he forgave me but he did!  And guess what?! Take a good damn guess!  Weeks later i blocked him and ignored him again and at the time i did that i was in a VERY VERY sour mood, so i said something i obviously shouldn't have, i made it seem like it's his fault and how it's HIS mistake not mine.  I did that over and over again until the following days he was more quieter and less productive, the once cheery go lucky boy that always participate in school activities was now sadder due to the fact that I absolutely destroyed his self-esteem.  Soon he transfered school and it's been years already.  Do i feel bad? Ofc Did i apologize? How could i? He transfered to some school i don't know of and i moved cities too.  Are you free to ridicule me in the replies? Yes, something i noticed is that I'm more likely to stop when I'm being bullied on and threatened  So that is all, bye.	1643214819.0	sda14f	/r/offmychest/comments/sda14f/im_manipulative_and_i_hate_it_but_i_cant_stop/	I'm manipulative and i hate it but I can't stop
2wl3nx1w	My Dad is not an emotionally conscious person.  Nor does he even sense his audience.  When confronted, he projects and deflects.   I took him to lunch (which he has never once done for me over my 50yrs!).  I asked him if he is happy as an older man (81) more than he was at my age.  He said mostly‚Ä¶but he really struggles with money‚Ä¶.he has too much to spend!! Money is piling up and stressing him out.  He‚Äôd like to be more willing to spend it all.    WTF?   Meanwhile, I recently got divorced, leveraged to the hills, and drive a piece of shit car (while he comes to lunch in his new Infiniti).    It‚Äôs not about the money.  I‚Äôll do my own thing, thank you.  It‚Äôs the consciousness of a Father to a Son and his situation‚Ä¶.    I guess I asked him.  That‚Äôs his struggle in life.  Just can‚Äôt relate.  I wish he‚Äôd see me.  Ask me about my happiness (Wasn‚Äôt reciprocated) I wish he‚Äôd could self reflect and once reflect on me.   I know it won‚Äôt happen.  He‚Äôs hard wired.

4iofmfkt	28M im ending a family curse which inherited by my family. Mostly by my father. He is simply a man who have no simply a masculine traits. Simply he was raised by his mama and sisters. Even though he is 65 he is still a child in his brain. He has no maturity doesnt know how to act like a man, lead, or responsibility of a father other that working a job. He cant drive or simply dont know go to any place and get a work done. Wherever he go people rip him off ass he have no personality or guts. He is so obedient and childish around women even when he is 65. From his side i have learnt nothing. Simply nothing. So the same pattern goes with me. Im raised by my mom. So i have the basic nice guy traits too. And when I released these my youth was over. Wish i had more time to be with masculine friends inprove my social skills and do a sport like mma and workout. My dad never taught me to be a man. He himself dont know how to be one. He has social anxiety and submissive to any person to avoid conflict and keep things smooth. He is a yes man cause he dont know to ask for what he deserve. He doenst have a family life with my mom. They were not talking since three years after the marriage. But still live in the same house. All he do is think and sit dark. He cant hold a converstaions or maintian eye contacts. And i have learn nothing from him. For all my child hood i was bullied softly most treated me as a soft effeminate guy. And it sucks. Im a mams boy and i can see im becoming my father. He has no soicial life no freiends or simply he is all alone manchild.

ikzj2ulr	My roommate is inconsiderate, incompetent, and a total slob. There have been many complaints that now seem minor. I can (hardly) deal with dishes in the sink for a few days, the fact that they never have done anything close to a deep clean (the fan is stained black from dust and same for the blinds), and that they let their dishes get moldy before they wash them. Not great! But that‚Äôs nothing compared to this zoo shitshow.  She was living alone for a month after her old roommates left before we (my partner and I, and her new boyfriend/our friend) moved in. She didn‚Äôt bother to tell us, THREE PEST CONTROL TECHNICIANS, that her house is infested with fleas and German roaches, before moving in with our 3 pets. She has one dog and 2 indoor/outdoor cats. None of them have been or are being treated for fleas. Occasional anti-flea treats do not count as treatment.   Well, we‚Äôve been struggling to keep this all under control. We tried to fix it a month ago. We did all the things we needed to do. Our cats were good. Hers were not.  We came back from holiday about two weeks ago and the problem has only gotten worse. They left for a home visit this week so we decided to start a legitimate flea treatment a 2nd time without them.  I have spent the last few days washing every piece fabric in this house, flea baths (Dawn dish soap does wonders btw) for ALL of the pets, we professionally treated the home for fleas and German roaches, I have been flea combing all of the animals, we‚Äôre getting them flea meds today (haven‚Äôt yet because I was worried about the side effects since my cats are older) and flea traps are coming in today. I‚Äôve kept the outdoor cats on.  So far, I‚Äôm seeing faaaaar less fleas on the animals and they‚Äôre scratching significantly less, which is great. They could use another bath soon. I was flea combing my cat today; she had worms coming out of her butt! She ingested an infected flea and got fucking worms.   It‚Äôs been one thing after annoying this house and I‚Äôm fed up. Leaving cat puke on the counter and hiding it with a kitchen towel is one thing. Having to take my pets to a vet 4x in 2 months when they‚Äôve never needed to since I‚Äôve had them is a whole other fucking issue.

fwidv	I‚Äôm a fat gal who loves to hike. I geocache, and if I take vacation time from work, it means I‚Äôm disappearing into a state park to climb hills, dig under rocks and climb up tree stumps to get at the caches.    Sometimes I hike 60+ miles in a weekend in 8+ hour blocks. I‚Äôm capable, safety minded, and out here for fun, rather than exercise. The exercise and weight loss is a bonus, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. I almost always go alone, and everyone always asks why.   It‚Äôs because every single time Ive brought a friend hiking, they always make a comment like ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre really out of breath, are you ok? Should I call the office? Do you need a Ranger?‚Äù  Dude, I‚Äôm three hours into hiking up a literal mountain, it‚Äôs 98 degrees out and this trail hasn‚Äôt flattened out even a little in two miles, of fucking course I‚Äôm out of breath and sweating. So are you. Do YOU need a Ranger? No? Then just let me hike in peace. If I feel bad, you‚Äôll know, because I‚Äôll announce it and sit down and rest. I got nothing to prove, and I‚Äôm no tough guy who‚Äôs gotta power through pain or discomfort.    Easier and less frustrating to hike alone.	1643215164.0	sda600	/r/offmychest/comments/sda600/im_exercising_not_dying/	I‚Äôm exercising, not dying

12eh1t65	I will try and keep this as concise as possible but I also want some advice on healing. My friend group was close for the last 5 years or so. We were made up of couples, 3 couples so 6 people total. We hung out together, traveled together to different states, and just enjoyed each others company. We gave each other space when we needed to and would take breaks from hanging out. We all were very comfortable with each other and never really had any drama.   Randomly, one of the girls started acting strange, lets call her M. She barely engaged in conversations and avoided hanging out with the group. It started with her avoiding/ignoring me at all costs, randomly. We saw each other at our normal group hang outs and she barely even looked in my direction. I texted her about this and the summary of what her response was, was ‚ÄúI dont know what you are talking about/I dont have anything to say to you‚Äù. I dont have anything to say to you in a way like, I just dont have anything to start a convo with. I said there is no way she can just randomly say she has nothing to speak with me about after 5 years of friendship, literally we can talk about anything? She disagreed and we never spoke to each other again.  I texted our friend X about it, as M and X had been hanging out a lot. X told me it was nothing, and that maybe just give M space and she will come around. Maybe she was just stressed out or something and taking it out on me. A few weeks pass, and M does the same thing to X. I guess they had plans to hang out and M randomly texted X and said ‚ÄúNo offense and I mean this in the nicest way possible, but I dont want to hangout. Like anymore and I dont know if I will ever want to hang out again. I dont have any explanation to give to you. I hope this doesnt effect our friendship‚Äù. And that was really the bomb in our friend group. She cut everyone off, deleted and blocked them on socials,everything.   My partner met up with M‚Äôs partner to discuss what had happened, as it effected him as well. As I stated, we were all each others friends so not only did M lose friends at her own decision, but her partner lost friends due to her own actions. Her partner stated they actually got into a heated argument about what she said to me and how it was very inconsiderate of her. Her partner stated she never said why she wanted to stop hanging out, she just did it. I cried a lot. That was my closest friend. She also gaslit me in our final convo and I couldnt believe what she was saying. I just cant fathom how she can cut off 4 of her (and her partners) closest friends. It still hurts so much.	1643215434.0	sda9wj	/r/offmychest/comments/sda9wj/i_miss_my_friend_when_i_shouldnt/	I miss my friend when I shouldnt
